BELTRE ERROR COSTS DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ So maybe Adrian Beltre wasn't as old as the Los
Angeles Dodgers were saying. He certainly aged Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Beltre had the ball in his hand and looking at home on a routine
rundown play in the eighth inning. It was the kind of play he had
made a thousand times as a youngster in the Dominican Republic,
long before the club tried to change his birthdate to sign him
early.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing is routine for the Dodgers this season, and Beltre's
throw to the plate sailed over catcher Todd Hundley's head, leading
to two runs that turned a tied game into a 9-6 loss to the New York
Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just took off running, but you could tell all hell was
breaking loose,'' said former Dodger Lenny Harris, who started the
play with a tapper back to the mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reminded me of the bad old days when we looked like that all
the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris, who chased Dodger starter Darren Dreifort with a
sixth-inning homer, played in L.A. in 1992 when the team lost 99
games and finished in last place.
</P>
<P>
   This might not be bad, and Beltre is no Jose Offerman. But it
has been a long season for the team, which is eight games behind
with 40 to play. Beltre's 21 errors are second only to Phil Nevin
among National League third baseman.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers already were tied with San Diego as the league's
worst defensive team before making three errors Sunday, including
one on the next play by Mark Grudzielanek that scored Harris with
the Mets' ninth run.
</P>
<P>
   And what made Sunday worse was the loss came after one of the
Dodgers' best victories of the season. After Saturday's game, Gary
Sheffield talked about not being able to create momentum from big
wins. Despite two home runs by Hundley, Sunday's game proved his
point.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't much you can tell a team after a game like
that,''Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said. ``They feel bad enough.
You can't give up that many outs, and we've been doing that a lot
this year. We're not going to be a championship club until we do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Beltre hardly has been the most erratic Dodger, but more was
expected. After filing a grievance last winter for his
well-publicized early signing at age 15, Beltre signed a
three-year, $5.5 million contract and looked to be one of the
game's budding stars.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he has shown too few flashes of the brilliance that
earned him a promotion from Double-A two years ago at age 18. There
was a game-winning three-run pinch homer last week in Florida, but
he was 2 for 13 against the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, however, he didn't hide afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had time, but I rushed the throw and it cost us the
game,''Beltre said. ``It is the kind of play we need to make if we
are going to do anything the rest of the way. But it is the way we
have been playing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers could have picked up a game on first-place San
Francisco heading into a potential confidence-boosting series
against lowly Montreal. They overcame a 4-0 deficit on home runs by
Hundley in the second and fourth innings.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Dodgers had a chance, tying the game in the seventh
when Shawn Green singled and Jay Payton bobbled the ball in center,
allowing Sheffield to score.
</P>
<P>
   Green, however, was picked off second by Mets reliever Turk
Wendell (6-4). Green would have scored when Eric Karros followed by
with his third hit of the day.
</P>
<P>
   The worst came in the eighth after the Mets put runners at the
corners with no outs. Harris tapped back to the mound, where
reliever Terry Adams (5-6) fielded the ball and started to run Mike
Bordick back to third. Adams threw to Beltre, whose throw to the
plate was several feet over Hundley's head.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs to focus more,'' said Manny Mota, the Dodger coach
who also advises the club's Latin players. ``He has been OK, but he
has made some mistakes. Sometimes people forget he is still
young.''

   INCOME IN CALIFORNIA FELL DURING 1990S
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
By SAM ZUCKERMAN
</P>
<P>
   &LR; c &LR; .2000 SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
San Francisco _ Despite a booming economy at the end of the decade,
the average California family saw its real income sink in the
1990s, making it poorer than families elsewhere in the nation,
according to a Federal Reserve report to be released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The study, which defies the perception of surging prosperity in
the state, blames the lag in family income in California on two
factors. The report notes that the economic downturn at the
beginning of the decade lasted longer and cut deeper here than in
other parts of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But it also points to a widening gap between highly trained
workers who are benefiting from the state's burgeoning sectors _
such as technology and finance _ and California's vast and growing
pool of poorly educated workers, many from other countries.
</P>
<P>
   The data cited in the study run counter to the notion that
California is overrun with well-heeled dot-com millionaires,
investment bankers and entertainment executives.
</P>
<P>
   The state does have plenty of highly paid workers. It's simply
that they are swamped by a larger group of low-wage workers, said
Mary Daly, an economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of San
Francisco who authored the study.
</P>
<P>
   ``The perception is that there is a lot of wealth in
California,'' Daly said. ``But, as a whole, California families
have fallen behind their counterparts in the rest of the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the split in California between high-income and
low-income segments is wider than in the nation as a whole, the
Federal Reserve study shows. Simply put, California has a larger
proportion of rich and a larger proportion of poor people than the
rest of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   By 1998, the latest year for which data were available, ``a
greater number of Californians lived in poverty, a smaller
(relative) number were in the middle class, and a majority had
family incomes below those of comparable families living outside of
California,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   California has grown faster than the nation as a whole over the
last two years, a period the data do not cover. But it's unlikely
that the state has closed the family income gap, Daly said. Nor has
the split between high-income and low-income sectors been
significantly narrowed.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of CALFAMIL () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Since the days of the Forty-Niners, the Golden State has been a
place where people have come to get rich. And, indeed, for most of
the state's history, Californians were better off than people
elsewhere in the nation. In 1989, for example, the state's median
family income was $25,760, 7.9 percent higher than that in the rest
of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   But by 1998, California median family income was $24,668, 4.5
percent less than the median family income outside the state.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1990s, California family income fell not only in
relation to the rest of the country but also in absolute terms.
While median income outside the state rose by more than 8 percent
between 1989 and 1998, median family income in California fell by
4.2 percent, the report notes.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven years ago, California families had higher incomes, after
adjusting for inflation, than comparable families elsewhere in the
country at every point on the income scale.
</P>
<P>
   By 1998 though, at the bottom and middle levels of income in
California, median family income was well below the median in the
rest of the nation at equivalent points on the income scale. But
California families in the 70th percentile or above in income
distribution ``had real incomes higher than equivalent families
living outside of California,`` the study said.
</P>
<P>
   One reason the fortunes of California families fell during the
1990s was because the economic slump early in the decade was so
severe, the study said. Total payroll jobs in the state didn't
surpass the pre-recession peak until 1996, putting California about
two years behind the nation as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   But changes in California's population during the decade also
brought median family income down. Large numbers of immigrants from
Latin America, Asia and other developing regions entered California
during the 1990s. Most of them lacked skills that commanded high
pay and many wound up taking low-wage jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a change in the composition of the California
population toward younger and less educated workers,'' Daly said.
``A primary factor creating these changes appear to be an influx of
individuals from other countries.''
</P>
<P>
   This shift in California's population accounted for between
one-third and one-half of the state's decline in family income
relative to the rest of the nation, the Federal Reserve report
said.
</P>
<P>
   Daly noted one bright spot. Huge demand for skilled labor in the
state means that, if unskilled workers can be trained, plenty of
jobs will be available for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over time, people at the lower end will move into those
jobs,'' boosting their incomes, she said.

WHY CAN'T WE TALK?  _  AS INSTANT MESSAGING TAKES OFF, AOL RESISTS
COOPERATING WITH THE LITTLE GUYS 
 
</HEADLINE>
  By CARRIE KIRBY

<P>
   &LR; c &LR; .2000 SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco _ Instant messaging could become bigger than
e-mail. If only it worked as easily.
</P>
<P>
   Internet executive Peter Schoenke spends his workdays exchanging
instant messages about a project with a collaborator who sits in
another part of the office.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, much of the communication at Broadband Sports, the
Santa Monica company where he works, takes place using America
Online's Instant Messenger. But when he wants to send a quick note
to his girlfriend, Schoenke must turn to a different
instant-message program. And to contact certain friends, he has to
launch a third.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have too many programs running, it slows the computer
down,'' Schoenke said. ``It would be great if they could all be on
one system.''
</P>
<P>
   Instant messaging, or IM, has grown in popularity as fast as
e-mail did a few years ago, with more than a third of online
Americans using it weekly, according to Forrester Research. Three
million users sign up every month, according to an industry
estimate. Forrester predicts that 46 percent of Fortune 1000
companies will use IM by the end of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   But many messaging companies complain that the growth and
development of instant messaging is threatened by a lack of
interoperability. Specifically, they blame AOL, by far the market
leader, for resisting initiatives to enable the different systems
to talk to one another. AOL has as many as 170 million users.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike e-mail or the telephone system, where anyone with a phone
or an e-mail address can contact anyone else, instant messengers
are closed systems, where users can only contact other members of
the same service. Many users end up running two or three IM
programs at once to communicate with friends who use different
systems. It's like having several telephones, each of which can
only talk to customers of AT&AMP;T, MCI or Sprint. Users complain that
it's cumbersome to switch back and forth among several windows, and
running extra software can slow down or crash a PC's system.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has clearly disadvantaged us and other independent
companies,'' said Ross Bagully, chief executive officer of Tribal
Voice. His company's IM product, PowWow, has 8 million users.
</P>
<P>
   Tribal Voice is one of nine IM companies that plan to come out
with a standard next week that would make it possible for users of
any of their systems to contact one another. The group, called
IMUnified, hopes to implement its interoperability standard by the
end of the year. The group includes Internet leaders such as
Microsoft's MSN Messenger Service and Yahoo's Messenger, but,
conspicuously, not AOL.
</P>
<P>
   Interoperability could become an issue for regulators as they
decide whether to approve AOL's pending merger with Time Warner. In
a hearing last month, the Federal Communications Commission
listened to Tribal Voice CEO Bagully's complaints that AOL is
blocking interoperability for its own benefit. AOL told the FCC
that it is working toward making its system interoperable with its
competitors, but that it wants to move slowly in order to protect
its users' privacy and security. Last week, the FCC asked AOL to
turn over all IM documents created since the merger was announced
in January.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC also asked Time Warner to confirm whether its chairman,
Gerald Levin, called IM the most valuable asset of a merged
AOL-Time Warner. AOL's competitors claim Levin said so at a recent
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Introduced 10 years ago as the Buddy List, a part of AOL's
regular service, IM has long been popular with chatty teenagers. In
1996, ICQ introduced a messenger service that anyone could join for
free, and popularity grew. (AOL later acquired ICQ, but the two
systems remain incompatible.) Other companies, including Yahoo and
the Microsoft Network, introduced their own messengers.
</P>
<P>
   Now, proponents say, the medium has the potential to surpass
e-mail in popularity, but not just because it's a faster mode of
online communication.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the tip of the iceberg,'' said Margaret Heffernan,
chief executive of iCast, a Woburn, Mass., company that integrates
instant messaging with online entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Instant-messaging systems are branching out into other
interactive services like voice chat and file trading, such as MP3
music files. It's also possible to send instant messages to
wireless devices. Airline passengers could soon receive news of
delayed flights by instant messages to their handheld devices.
</P>
<P>
   Heffernan predicts instant messaging will be integrated into
every part of the Internet, business and entertainment, in large
part because of innovations in IM:
</P>
<P>
   -- ICast offers a combination media player and instant
messenger, which enables allows  &LR; users to listen to Internet radio
or watch a Madonna video online and message friends at the same
time.
</P>
<P>
   -- Most IM programs let users trade files, such as Microsoft
Word documents or MP3 music files. About 2,000 local bands use
iCast to distribute MP3s of their latest recordings to fans.
</P>
<P>
   -- A program called Aimster makes it possible for users of AOL's
AIM to search one another's music collections and share files,
working much like the controversial Napster file-sharing program.
The difference is that Napster users swap songs with thousands of
strangers, whereas Aimster users trade only with people on their
AIM buddy list.
</P>
<P>
   -- Interactive television systems such as AOLTV let friends
miles apart chat while watching shows together.
</P>
<P>
   -- Tribal Voice's ``white board'' enables users to trade
hand-drawn diagrams or sketches while chatting, promising to make
IM an even more valuable tool for businesses.
</P>
<P>
   IMUnified's plan for interoperability would let users who hold
accounts with several IM services access those accounts through a
single interface. For example, if a user wants to communicate with
friends who are divided among Tribal Voice, Yahoo Messenger and MSN
Messenger, the user could sign up for accounts with each service,
then access them all through Yahoo Messenger.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would be considered a temporary fix until the Internet
Engineering Task Force issues permanent standards, which could
happen later this year.
</P>
<P>
   AOL says that while it wants interoperability, it doesn't like
IMUnified's plan for a quick fix.
</P>
<P>
   ``This coalition is putting more of an emphasis on speed than on
consumer safety, and our focus is on users' security,'' said Trish
Primrose, an AOL spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   AOL said the industry should wait for the permanent standard,
which has been mired in a task force committee for more than a
year.
</P>
<P>
   But IMUnified members say AOL's calls for security are a cover
for what the corporation really wants _ to stall interoperability
and preserve its advantage.
</P>
<P>
   It's true that there are privacy and security risks involved in
using IM. Like e-mail, instant messaging can be used to send spam
and transmit viruses. Hackers have broken into instant messaging
accounts and used them to send forged messages. Conceivably,
letting users communicate with a larger pool of people would
increase the frequency of problems.
</P>
<P>
   But IM's risks are no greater than e-mail's, said Dave Crocker,
an Internet consultant who is co-authoring one of the Internet task
force's interoperability proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Crocker questioned AOL's security concerns, saying, ``What is it
about IM that ought to make it any more dangerous? We certainly
seem to be able to live with the risks that we have with e-mail.''
</P>
<P>
   During the past year, several companies have made it possible
for their customers to send instant messages to users of AOL's
services, only to be blocked by AOL. Last Tuesday, AOL blocked an
IM service called Odigo for the 17th time. AOL says trying to send
instant messages to its customers without its permission is ``akin
to hacking.''
</P>
<P>
   With only 10 percent of the market share by their own estimate,
AOL's unified competitors may not pose the behemoth much of a
challenge. But for AOL, dragging its feet may make it look bad _
especially to those who already see the biggest online service as a
bully.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may hinder them in shedding the perception of not being a
fair player,'' said Lydia Loizides, an analyst for Jupiter
Communications.

VERIZON, WORKERS REACH TENTATIVE CONTRACT AGREEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thousands of striking telephone employees in New England and New
York began returning to their scheduled shifts early Monday,
several hours after Verizon Communications and two labor groups
reached a tentative contract that promised three years of labor
peace and union access to new technology jobs.
</P>
<P>
   News that Verizon had reached a settlement with the
13,000-member International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and
the northern unit of the Communications Workers of America came
Sunday evening while talks continued between the company and CWA's
southern division. That bargaining unit represents 36,000 customer
service employees, and includes New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland,
Delaware and Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   The southern unit remained on strike as 50,000 union members
from New England and New York prepared to return to work Monday
and, in some cases, no later than Wednesday after a two-week strike
that disrupted repairs and telephone installations in a dozen
eastern states and the District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   The unions won assurances that fewer jobs could be transferred
than the company originally had sought and guaranteed more
flexibility and less forced overtime.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the provisions of the accord remained secret until
management and labor could work out language concerning the
strikers' return to work. The unions also demanded amnesty for
strikers accused of disruptive behavior while on the picket lines.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, IBEW and CWA's northern district workers
will receive wage increases of 4 percent the first year of the
contract, 3 percent the second year, and 5 percent the third and
final year of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Management and labor also agreed that 50 digital subscriber line
positions that are being given to subcontractors will be set aside
for customer service representatives in New York and New England.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides hailed the contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``For New England and New York, the strike is now over,'' said
Verizon spokesman Jack Hoey. ``The fundamental issue for us was how
we could continue to add union jobs in an industry that is so
highly competitive. At the same time, customers want service and
they want immediate attention. This agreement will allow us to do
an even better job serving customers. That's why we are pleased.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's happy about a strike, so I'm glad it's over,'' noted
Myles Calvey, president of IBEW Local 2222 in Quincy. ``I'm also
very pleased that we addressed the job transfer issue. That was a
big issue. That was downright job security.''
</P>
<P>
   A total of 85,000 workers walked off the job at 12:01 a.m. Aug.
6, following the expiration of a two-year contract. Although basic
service for most customers continued with few disruptions, analysts
maintained that the growing backlog of consumer repair and
installation orders, which had risen to 100,000 from about 50,000,
provided a strong incentive for Verizon to end the strike.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon Communications, the company created by the merger of
Bell Atlantic and GTE, serves approximately 25 million customers
from Maine to Virginia and is the biggest provider of local
telephone service in the region.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement came several days after both sides worked out
language giving the unions permission to use a card check
neutrality agreement to organize workers at Verizon Wireless, a
subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   That provision, regarded by labor experts as the most surprising
aspect of the pact, will allow the unions to organize wireless
workers after collecting signed cards from a majority of workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever was decided about the other outstanding issues, the
fact that Verizon agreed to a neutrality card check agreement is a
major, major accomplishment for the unions and a major concession
by the company,'' said Robert Ross, a labor specialist at Clark
University in Worcester.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Kagan, an independent telecommunications analyst in
Atlanta, said the contract will expand labor's advancement into the
industry from a toehold to ``a strong foothold on the work of the
future, the work of tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Kagan questioned whether this contract will
also prove to be a bit of a burden around Verizon's neck.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the unions got everything they wanted, then Verizon is
going to have a real challenge,'' he said. ``Sure, it will have
great workers. But will Verizon be as flexible as its
entrepreneurial competitors? Will the company be nimble enough to
compete against companies that are not shackled by these future
union demands? If it is not, those union members will not have
jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   During the strike, picketers had demanded a reduction in
mandated overtime, the hiring of more customer service
representatives, and more flexible scheduling. Union sources said
the agreement guarantees that more workers will be hired, but said
a quota was not set.
</P>
<P>
   The contract also states that more training will be available to
service representatives, and that more accommodations will be made
for those with medical or personal problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the agreement for Local 1400 of the CWA, we received a
package of reforms,'' said Steve Early, an international
representative and organizer for New England. ``The company agreed
to give people more advanced notice of forced overtime, and ease
restrictions that prevented service representatives from
transferring to other units in the company.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, workers will receive a profit sharing plan tied to
the chief executive officer's plan. It will pay a minimum of $1,800
and a maximum of $3,000 over the three-year life of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Other provisions in the agreement announced Sunday &UR;  &LR; night
include:
</P>
<P>
   --Language granting a one-time award of 100 Verizon
Communications stock options to full-time members and 50 shares to
part-time members.
</P>
<P>
   --Language granting an increase in the company's matching
contribution to a 401K plan from 80 percent to 82 percent.
</P>
<P>
   --Language amending the pension, as of Aug. 1, 2002, to a lump
sum cash-out option. Retiring members may receive their benefits
either in a lump sum or in the form of an annuity. ``This is not a
cash balance account,'' said IBEW's Calvey. ``This is cash, which
is a lot different.''
</P>
<P>
   --Language authorizing that new benefits be added to the health
care network, including a maximum lifetime benefit of $20,000 for
fertility and reproductive treatments.
</P>
<P>
   ``This contract recognizes that the service representatives' job
is much more stressful and requires more skills because employees
are being asked to sell a whole range of new services,'' noted
Early.

HIGH USER ANXIETY OVER NET PRIVACY
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
By HENRY NORR

<P>
   &LR; c &LR; .2000 SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
American Internet users want stronger protection for their online
privacy and sanctions for those who violate it, but most have
little understanding of the mechanisms that threaten it or the
tools by which they could protect themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Those are among the conclusions of a report released Sunday by
the Pew Internet &AMP; American Life Project, a Washington, D.C.,
nonprofit group funded by the Pew Charitable Trusts. The study is
based on a phone survey in May and June of 2,117 Americans, of whom
1,017 were Internet users.
</P>
<P>
   Project researchers found that an overwhelming majority of
Internet users _ 84 percent _ are concerned about businesses or
strangers getting personal information about them or their
families. An even larger percentage _ 94 percent _ say Internet
firms and their top executives should be punished if they violate
users' privacy online.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, only 54 percent said they are concerned about
getting a computer virus when downloading information.
</P>
<P>
   The study has a margin of error of three percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Some 86 percent of those surveyed said they favor ``opt-in''
rules that would require companies to ask for permission before
using people's personal information. In contrast, Web advertising
companies favor the ``opt-out'' approach, under which companies
consider themselves free to collect and use personal information
unless users take the initiative to protect their privacy.
</P>
<P>
   The ``opt-out'' approach was just accepted by the Clinton
administration and the Federal Trade Commission during negotiations
with a consortium of Web advertising companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Internet users want the Golden Rule of the Internet to be:
`Don't do anything unto me unless I give you permission,' '' said
Lee Rainie, director of the research project, in a statement
announcing the report's release.
</P>
<P>
   Only 27 percent of users said they agree with the main
justification offered by Web companies for tracking users' online
behavior: that such information enables them to provide information
tailored to the users' specific interests. Twice as many users _ 54
percent _ said they consider such tracking harmful because it
invades their privacy.
</P>
<P>
   While more than 4 out of 5 Internet users want rules to govern
the tracking of users' activities online, most are apparently wary
of having the government step in. Among those who said there should
be such rules, only 24 percent said the federal government should
set them; half said the people who use the sites should set the
rules, while 18 percent were willing to leave the responsibility to
Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, most users apparently don't have much grasp
of how online tracking works. Among Internet users in the survey,
56 percent were unable to identify the primary tracking tool, a
type of file known as a ``cookie.''
</P>
<P>
   And despite the anxiety about tracking the study reveals, only
10 percent of Internet users said they have set their browsers to
reject cookies. (The report does not note that disabling cookies
makes it difficult or even impossible to access many popular
sites.)
</P>
<P>
   The full report will be posted at  &LR; www.pewinternet.org. &LR;

INTEL REINVENTS PENTIUM ARCHITECTURE
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
By HENRY NORR
</P>
<P>
   &LR; c &LR; .2000 SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
San Francisco _ Intel Corp. this week is disclosing technical
details of a new processor design that will likely dominate the PC
market for the next seven to 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The next-generation ``microarchitecture,'' or internal processor
design, will reach users first in the Pentium 4, a chip that will
begin showing up in high-end desktop PCs this fall. During the
following year Intel will gradually move the new design into
mainstream, low-end and notebook PC markets.
</P>
<P>
   The new core design, which the company has dubbed NetBurst, is
Intel's first since it rolled out its ``P6'' architecture in the
Pentium Pro processor in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Although the company has dramatically increased clock speeds and
added a variety of new features in its subsequent chips _ the
Pentium II and III and the low-end Celeron _ they have all been
based on the P6 core.
</P>
<P>
   The existence of the new design hasn't been a secret _ at the
semiannual Intel Developers Forum in February, the company showed
off a prototype based on it, code-named Willamette, running at 1.4
gigahertz, 50 percent faster than the fastest Pentium III available
at the time. In June it announced the Pentium 4.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, however, the company has offered only scanty
information about the chip's internal design.
</P>
<P>
   That will change when the forum convenes again this week, this
time in San Jose. Some 5,000 attendees are expected, most of them
developers, and they will get an earful about the Pentium 4 as well
as the company's other new chip, the server-oriented Itanium, and
its growing portfolio of networking products.
</P>
<P>
   In an advance briefing for reporters Friday, Albert Yu, senior
vice president and general manager of the Intel Architecture Group,
claimed that the Pentium 4 will be ``by far the highest-performance
processor for desktop PCs'' when it comes out this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, Intel chips have delivered more processing speed
than those from competitors such as Advanced Micro Devices, and
that technical lead has given Intel a virtual lock on the lucrative
high end of the PC market. During the past year, however, AMD's
Athlon chip has matched and at times exceeded the performance of
the Pentium III and won support from a number of PC-makers who were
loyal customers of Intel.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentium 4, Yu said, will have 42 million transistors, up
from 28 million in the Pentium III. Among other technical
enhancements, it will feature a ``front-side bus,'' or data channel
to the computer's memory, that operates at 400 megahertz _ three
times the speed of the same element in the Pentium III _ that will
enable it to transfer 3.2 gigabytes of data per second.
</P>
<P>
   In the NetBurst microarchitecture, the execution of each
instruction is broken down into 20 steps _ four times as many as in
the original Pentium and twice as many as in the P6 core.
Paradoxically, adding extra stages _ a technique known in processor
lingo as ``lengthening the pipeline'' _ can improve overall
performance because it allows designers to simplify the chip's
circuitry, which in turn makes it possible to run the chip at
higher frequencies.
</P>
<P>
   Yu said the Pentium 4 will debut this fall at a speed of at
least 1.4 gigahertz, but he added that the design is ``very
scalable to higher frequencies in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Some instructions will be processed at a much higher rate. Yu
revealed that basic arithmetic operations like addition and
subtraction _ among those most commonly used in program code _ will
be handled in a new ``rapid execution engine'' operating at twice
the frequency of the rest of the chip.
</P>
<P>
   The NetBurst architecture can handle six instructions
simultaneously on a sustained basis, according to Doug Carmean, the
chip's principal architect. Its longer pipeline also gives it more
opportunities to improve its efficiency by shuffling the order in
which instructions are processed.
</P>
<P>
   These new features will improve performance even for existing PC
programs. Developers writing new code or optimizing their previous
products for the new chip will also be able to take advantage of
144 new instructions designed to improve performance on such tasks
as graphics and multimedia processing, data encryption and
compression.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of INTEL21 (9256 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  In response to suggestions that today's processors are already
more than fast enough for the tasks most users ask them to perform,
Yu insisted that the benefits of the new chips will be readily
apparent to users, even in seemingly basic tasks such as displaying
Web pages.
</P>
<P>
   The extra performance will be especially welcome, he said, as
users increasingly take on more demanding tasks such as photo
editing, video encoding, speech recognition and processing
streaming media. In the business world, he said, the extra power
will help with e-commerce applications, data mining and
visualization, computer-based telephony and real-time data
encryption.
</P>
<P>
   At last week's press briefing, officials of Santa Clara's Intel
used pre-release PCs with 1.4-gighertz Pentium 4 processors to
demonstrate 3-D animations &LR;  of objects such as a dinosaur, a school
of fish and an armoire.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the moving images were created with Shockwave, an
Internet animation technology developed by Macromedia of San
Francisco. The company said last month that it would add Intel 3-D
technology to future versions of its Shockwave Player, which it
claims is the most widely deployed multimedia player on the Web,
with 137 million users.

BAYH-DOLE ACT SET COLLISION COURSE FOR U.S. INTERESTS, ETHICS
(COLUMN) &HT;    
</HEADLINE>
  By TOM ABATE &HT;    c.2000 SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
San Francisco _ A panel of scientists at the National Institutes of
Health spent two days last week bemoaning the conflicts of
interests that are growing more frequent in medical research.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays it's routine for university scientists to forge ties
with private firms. Some take modest consulting gigs. Others do
industry-funded research. In many instances, academics become
entrepreneurs themselves, patenting discoveries and starting firms.
</P>
<P>
   What brought last week's NIH panel together is the sad fact that
as academic entrepreneurship becomes de rigueur, so are the
instances when greed pushes professors to become unethical. The
transgression may be suppressing an unfavorable finding to please a
private funder, or in the most extreme case, performing drug
experiments that put human subjects in situations of unacceptable
risk.
</P>
<P>
   The most troublesome thing about these conflicts is that I see
them as the outgrowth of a deliberate national policy _ a policy
that is partly responsible for the prosperity we enjoy today.
</P>
<P>
   This point was brought home to me a couple of weeks ago, when a
wire alert crossed my computer screen. A Bay Area firm had just
gotten government approval to sell a new drug for attention deficit
disorder.
</P>
<P>
   The alert met my criteria for business news. It promised to have
a large impact on the company and its shareholders. Best of all, it
was a drug for ADD, a condition that people like to talk about.
</P>
<P>
   There was only one problem. I knew diddly squat about ADD, and
had just two hours to submit my story. With the clock ticking, I
phoned a my &LR; local research university and said: ``Get me an
independent ADD expert!''
</P>
<P>
   You would be surprised how often such reportorial chutzpah pays
off. Soon enough I was on the line with a helpful professor who
started our discussion by disclosing that he was a paid consultant
on the very drug on which I was seeking independent expertise.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, well, at least I got a quick, cogent understanding of ADD,
how it is diagnosed and misdiagnosed, how current drugs do or don't
work, and how the new drug was supposed to work different or
better. Helpful to the last, the professor ended our chat by
pointing me to another university scientist who, he said, was both
expert and not affiliated with the firm.
</P>
<P>
   I tracked down the second expert and explained my desire for an
independent assessment _ only to learn that this professor also had
a consulting relationship with the company in question.
</P>
<P>
   By then I had no more time to comb the ranks of academe, looking
for the unaffiliated expert. My story quoted the two sources and
noted their relation to the project.
</P>
<P>
   I recount this not because I think the company or the professors
did anything wrong. Likewise, the professors were responding to a
clear national imperative to put their expertise to work in the
economy. Washington beamed this message to academia 20 years ago,
when the Bayh-Dole Act became the law of the land.
</P>
<P>
   This landmark legislation allowed universities for the first
time to patent inventions that flowed from federally funded
research. An article titled ``The Kept University'' in the March
issue of the Atlantic Monthly explained the backdrop for the act.
Factories were closing. Imports were putting Americans out of work.
There was a fear across the land that America was losing its
competitive edge.
</P>
<P>
   The act was intended to reverse this economic slide by pushing
federally funded research out of academia, where it might do some
good. Along those same lines, many universities enacted policies
that allowed professors to share in the royalties from their
patented discoveries. It became common for academics to license
their own inventions, secure venture capital and start companies to
commercialize their work.
</P>
<P>
   In hindsight, Bayh-Dole succeeded brilliantly. A drive through
Silicon Valley is testimony to its impact. Sun Microsystems, Cisco
Systems, Silicon Graphics and other firms too numerous to count all
trace their origins to some research spawned on a university and
fertilized by venture capital. Every dot-com in creation owes a
debt of gratitude to browser software created in a federally funded
computer research lab.
</P>
<P>
   Although high tech has benefited from Bayh-Dole and, in turn,
catalyzed the Northern California economy, I would argue that the
act has had its most profound impact on biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
   Here's why. High-tech companies can bring out new products in
six to 12 months. Two years is a long product cycle. But it seldom
takes less than five or six years to bring out a new biotech drug.
</P>
<P>
   Biotechnology represents an attempt to understand the human
body, the most sophisticated living machine we have ever
encountered. To do biotechnology is to reverse-engineer this
marvelous creation.
</P>
<P>
   And that's a game that can be played only with cadres of
graduate students, working in spotless laboratories, using
multimillion-dollar instruments, paid for by a patient university
that isn't going to pink-slip the lab if the experiment takes five
years instead of three.
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago, I wrote about a report from the California
Healthcare Foundation, a biotech lobby group. The report said 2,500
firms and 212,000 employees derive their livelihoods from
biomedical discovery. And the central, irreplaceable feature of
what the report called ``California's bioscience ecosystem'' were
its research universities.
</P>
<P>
   In short, we have built a world in which conflicts of interest
between academia and industry in biotechnology are unavoidable. I
see no way to turn back the clock to the days of the Ivory Tower,
especially not if you accept my argument that we owe much of our
current prosperity to the Kept University. As employees, as
shareholders, as patients, we have all benefited from the cozy
relationships between academia and industry.
</P>
<P>
   Given that reality, the real questions are which conflicts we
consider minor and tolerable, so that we may continue to enjoy the
benefits of industry-university collaboration? Which conflicts are
impermissible under any circumstances? And finally, how do we
police this situation?
</P>
<P>
   If only we had a few commandments to make it all clear. Of
course, it's not that easy. But here in the center of this
biomedical beehive, at the nexus of the new economy, we must worry
about the moral health of a system that has kept us fat, fed and
happy.

APPLE INGENUITY CUBED (COLUMN) &HT;    
</HEADLINE>
  By HENRY NORR &HT;    c.2000 SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
San Francisco _ Say what you will about Apple Computer, its chief
executive officer or the Macintosh _ and I've had my share of
problems with all three _ Steve Jobs and company continue to put
the PC industry to shame on several fronts.
</P>
<P>
   The latest example is the Power Mac G4 Cube, a new model that
began reaching dealers and users last week, a month after Jobs
unveiled it at the Macworld Expo show. For the last 10 ten  &LR; days
I've been trying out a unit that Apple loaned me for evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   In another couple of weeks I'll have to give it back, and I'm
not looking forward to that day. I've tried out and appreciated
most of Apple's recent models, but the Cube is the one I really
wish I could keep.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of performance and features, it doesn't break
significant new ground. What it offers above all is a quality all
too rarely associated with desktop computers: elegance.
</P>
<P>
   That's partly a matter of appearance. Its design _ a silvery box
about 7.7 inches on each dimension, suspended inside a clear
plastic stand that holds it a couple of inches off the desk _ is as
much a departure from the boring beige box tradition as the iMac.
But I for one find the new model's minimalist styling much more
appealing than the iMac's pudgy curves, and I suspect many others,
particularly in my generation, will feel the same way.
</P>
<P>
   It looks particularly good with Apple's sleek new 15-inch
flat-panel Studio Display, which also rests in a clear-plastic
easel-style stand.
</P>
<P>
   But good looks aren't the only virtue of the Cube's design. Its
compactness translates into appreciable savings of desktop real
estate _ a very concrete benefit for those of us who need every
available square inch for our clutter. The new Apple Display
Connector, which sends video signals, electric power and USB data
to the monitor through one cable, also helps thin out the cable
maze that usually accompanies any desktop computer, provided that
you buy one of Apple's latest displays.
</P>
<P>
   (If you prefer to hook up a conventional monitor, the Cube also
has a standard VGA connector; the only people out of luck, until
some third-party developer rises to the occasion, are those who
want to connect flat panels with ``DFP'' or ``DVI'' interfaces _
including those Apple sold until last month.)
</P>
<P>
   Above all, the Cube is quiet _ dead silent, in fact, except for
an occasional soft chirp when it is reading or writing its hard
drive. That's because, like the latest iMacs, it has no fan _ it is
cooled entirely by convection, through a chimney that runs
vertically through the Cube, venting through an oval-shaped grate
on top.
</P>
<P>
   In the context of a busy office, you hardly hear the sound of an
average PC. But in a quiet den or study, the constant hum of a fan
can be an annoyance. You might not even be conscious of it _ we've
all been habituated _ but I bet you will notice the difference if
you try out the Cube.
</P>
<P>
   (By the way, knowing my own housekeeping habits, I was worried
about what would happen if a book or magazine somehow found itself
on top of the Cube's vent. After some experimentation, I'm happy to
report that the answer is ``nothing dire'' _ the machine simply
drops into its low-power ``sleep'' mode.)
</P>
<P>
   Apple has also eliminated the most outstanding shortcoming of
its recent desktop models _ its hockey-puck mouse, which looked
great but was a real pain in day-to-day use. Like Microsoft's
optical mice, Apple's new Pro model works great on almost any
surface. The matching Pro keyboard is also a huge improvement,
except that its cable is too short. Surely, Apple could supply one
that's a foot or two longer, so users would have more flexibility
about positioning their CPUs and monitors.
</P>
<P>
   The Cube is not without more-serious faults, too. Most
obviously, at $1,799 without a monitor, it's pretty pricey by
today's standards, including Apple's prices on the iMac and other
G4s. For that amount of money, the machine ought to at least
include more than the 64 megabytes of RAM it now comes with,
especially considering the Mac OS, at its default settings, now
takes up nearly 30 megabytes.
</P>
<P>
   I also wish Apple would offer a CD-RW drive _ one that can write
and rewrite discs that can be played in CD-ROM and CD music drives
_ at least as an optional alternative to the standard DVD-ROM
drive. Considering that there's almost no content published in DVD
format except movies, a drive that could be used for backing up,
sharing large files and burning music discs would have a lot more
value to those of us who have no desire to watch movies at our
desks.
</P>
<P>
   But these are all pretty minor gripes, especially when you
compare what the PC industry continues to offer by way of
industrial design. Two years after the introduction of the iMac,
the only change that has spread to other manufacturers is the use
of color _ Compaq and Hewlett-Packard in particular have made
replaceable accent panels made of colored plastic a standard
feature in their consumer models.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, however, PC-makers still don't seem capable of
creating systems with any real aesthetic appeal. Intel has been
showing off innovative ``concept PCs'' since shortly after the iMac
appeared, but most of them were notable mostly for their weirdness,
and none has made it to market. Several top manufacturers did
attempt last year to follow Apple's example with more-stylish
machines, but none of them quite pulled it off. Indeed, in recent
months Compaq, Dell, Gateway and NEC have all had to abandon
heavily hyped designs that flopped in the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Apple, too, has had a few miscues _ I didn't think much of last
year's blue-and-white G3s. But on the whole, the company's record
for combining style and substance is unmatched. That has been great
for Mac fans as well as Apple shareholders; for the Windows world,
well, some PC-maker is bound to get it right one of these years.
</P>
<P>
   PALM VS. HANDSPRING: In the wake of Palm's announcement of its
new entry-level handheld, the m100, several friends and readers
have asked for my opinion about how it stacks up against
Handspring's popular Visor line of low-cost Palm clones.
</P>
<P>
   In a word, my choice is Palm _ at least until Handspring comes
out with new models sometime later this year. When the Visors first
appeared, I gave them a glowing review, because at that time they
had three advantages over their Palm predecessors: They were
cheaper, they were better looking (mainly because they came in a
choice of five colors) and they were more expandable.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't long before Palm matched its licensee's prices,
with a low-end model containing 2 megabytes of memory (first the
IIIe, now the m100) at $149 and an 8-megabyte version (the IIIxe)
at $249. In fact, for those who want to share data between the
handheld and a PC, Palm has actually had a price advantage for some
time, because all its models include a way to connect the devices _
a cradle with the older models, a HotSync cable with the m100 _
while in Handspring's case you have to spend $179 to get a cradle.
</P>
<P>
   (Owners of iMacs or other recent Apple models, take note: Palm's
standard cables and cradles still use a conventional serial port,
and the optional USB kit needed to connect to your Mac is a steep
$39.95. That makes Handspring, which uses USB for its cradles, a
better bet for you.)
</P>
<P>
   As for style, this is obviously a matter of personal preference.
But in my book, first place now goes to the m100, with its gentle
curves, intriguing porthole and optional color faceplates.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves expandability as the one strong card in Handspring's
hand. The slot in all Visor models, known as the Springboard, is a
clever design; Palm's low-end models have no equivalent, and even
at the high end Palm hasn't had a consistent approach to expansion.
(That should change in the future because the company has endorsed
a standard called the Secure Digital card, but the first products
incorporating this slot aren't due until next year.)
</P>
<P>
   The problem with the Springboard is that there just aren't many
modules available for it _ fewer than a dozen in all, according to
Handspring's list
( &LR; www.handspring.com/products/springboardnews.asp &LR; ). And mostly
they're not all that compelling. The list includes a couple of
phone-line modems (which cost almost as much as the Visor itself),
a few games, a $200 electronic version of the Physician's Desk
Reference, a device that turns the Visor into a universal remote
control and some memory cards, one of which also makes the device
vibrate, pager-style, when a calendar alarm goes off.
</P>
<P>
   Of the available Springboard modules, the only one with any
particular appeal to me is the Eyemodule, a tiny device that turns
the Visor into a digital camera. I recently tried one out, and it's
definitely nifty. But at $150 it's not exactly cheap, and with
resolution limited to 320 by 240 pixels, it's more toy than serious
tool.
</P>
<P>
   One of these years, the really interesting modules Handspring
has promised _ cell phones and wireless radios _ will probably show
up. But given Palm's much larger overall market share, it's likely
that the same products or equivalents will also be offered for at
least some Palm-branded models.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of TECH21-0 (9993 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  That's true, for example, in the digital camera case. The
Eyemodule is available only for the Visor, but Palm users who want
to take pictures can turn instead to Kodak's PalmPix camera. It's a
little more expensive ($179) and not nearly as petite, but with
resolution up to 640 by 480 pixels, it can take pictures you are
more likely to have some real use for.
</P>
<P>
   In short, I don't think the Springboard amounts to a decisive
advantage for most users.
</P>
<P>
   There's one other point that differentiates the Visor and the
m100, but I'm not sure which way it cuts. The latter's touchscreen
touch screen  &LR; is made of plastic, in contrast to the glass used in
the Visor and other Palm models. That makes the m100 lighter, and
it makes the screen less likely to break if you drop the unit.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the ledger, the m100's display and Graffiti
writing surface are both appreciably smaller than the Visor's or
other Palm models'. The resolution is the same (160 by 160 pixels
in all cases), so you get just as much information per screen _
it's just shrunken down on the m100. Combined with relatively low
contrast, that makes the Palm pretty difficult to read in some
environments, particularly places _ my living room, for example _
that don't have bright overhead lighting.
</P>
<P>
   But the Visor screen is nothing to write home about, either. If
your eyesight makes legibility an important issue, you would
probably be happier with a color model. (Color isn't just for
pretty pictures, as the vendors' ads imply _ it dramatically
increases contrast, which to my eyes is the most important factor
in the readability of text.)
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, color and its benefits aren't available at
entry-level prices _ the color Palm IIIc is $399, and the Palm
OS-based color device Sony is cooking up is expected to be even
more expensive. (It's supposed to be announced formally next week
and ship in October.)
</P>
<P>
   The rival Pocket PC camp _ Casio, Compaq and Hewlett-Packard,
all of which offer handhelds based on the Microsoft operating
system formerly known as Windows CE _ has moved almost entirely to
color, and their screens are even better than the Palm IIIc's. Then
again, they sell for even more _ up to $600.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a heavy Palm OS user, whether on Palm or Handspring
hardware, and you're not satisfied with Palm's memo pad as a way to
manage notes and other free-form data, something you might consider
downloading to your device is a program called Info Select for Palm
Organizers, published by Micro Logic of Hackensack, N.J.
( &LR; www.miclog.com &LR; ).
</P>
<P>
   Basically, the program lets you assemble and manipulate textual
information of any kind in outline format. It has a super-fast and
flexible search function and good support for infrared beaming.
It's also lean enough to be usable on models with only 2 megabytes
of memory _ it takes up only about 100 kilobytes.
</P>
<P>
   The Palm version is based on Info Select for Windows, an old
program that doesn't get much attention nowadays but retains an
enthusiastic, even cultlike, following among PC veterans. If you
have both the desktop and handheld versions installed, you can sync
up outlines between them, though the Palm version doesn't support
all the features of the Windows product.
</P>
<P>
   Info Select for Palm Organizers is $69.95; the Windows version
is $99.95. Unfortunately, there's no free demo version, but Micro
Logic does offer a 60-day money-back guarantee.

INTERNET A GOOD TOOL FOR FINANCIAL QUERIES &HT;    
</HEADLINE>
  By HARRY DOMASH 
c.2000 SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE &HT;     
<TEXT>
Many thanks to all those who've taken the time to send me your
comments and questions. Here are answers to some of the most
frequently asked questions.
<P>
   Q: Where can I find information on stock splits?
</P>
<P>
   A: When a company splits its stock, it issues additional shares
to current shareholders, resulting in a drop of the trading price.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, in a 2-for-1 split, you get twice as many shares,
but each share initially trades at half the pre-split price. In
theory, a split shouldn't affect future price appreciation.
However, many investors think splits do matter, and stocks often
rise after the announcement of a stock split.
</P>
<P>
   You can see stock price performance of recent split stocks at
The Online Investor ( &LR; www.investhelp.com &LR; ) by selecting Splits
Performance from the menu on the left. Click on Stock Splits from
the same menu to see a list of impending splits.
</P>
<P>
   You can sign up to get e-mail notification every time a company
announces a stock split.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can I find out when an IPO lockup period ends?
</P>
<P>
   A: Typically, a company first going public (Initial Public
Offering) sells a small fraction of its shares actually
outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   Early investors, venture capitalists, and officers and directors
own the balance. Many of these pre-IPO investors paid much less
than the IPO price for their shares but can't sell until the lockup
period expires.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the share price should drop after the lockup expires
and the additional shares move into the market. You can see a list
of lockup expirations and additional details at IPO Lockup.com
(www.ipolockup.com).
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can I get closing prices on stocks and indexes from 10
years ago?
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of DOMASH21 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  A: Yahoo ( &LR; finance.yahoo.com &LR; ) has detailed price information,
including open, high, low, and close prices going back to 1984.
First get a quote by putting the ticker symbol into the window and
clicking the get quotes button. Then select ``Chart,'' and finally
click on ``historical quotes.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can I find information on mutual fund money flows?
</P>
<P>
   A: Mutual funds account for a significant portion of market
capitalization. When investors pour money into mutual funds, the
funds use the new cash to buy more stocks, pushing the market up.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, mutual funds must sell stocks, which depresses the
market, when investors, in total, take money out. Trim Tabs
( &LR; trimtabs.com &LR; ) tracks flows in and out of mutual funds. They
track flows into fund categories such as aggressive growth, growth
and income, etc., as well as flows into specific funds.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily you have to pay to see a current report, but you can
see a two-week-old report by selecting Mutual Fund Trim Tabs on
TT's home page.
</P>
<P>
   You'll need the Acrobat program to see the report. Acrobat can
be downloaded at no charge from  &LR; www.adobe.com &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can I keep track of my stocks and mutual fund
portfolios?
</P>
<P>
   A: Most financial sites provide a portfolio tracker. My favorite
is Microsoft's Money Central ( &LR; moneycentral.msn.com &LR; ). It's
flexible and easy to use. Select Investor, then Portfolio. You'll
have to download special free software to get started.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I misplaced your column on how to find the next Qualcomm
while getting ``great abs.'' How do I get another copy?
</P>
<P>
   A: All of my columns are posted in the Basic Training section of
my Web site:  &LR; www.winninginvesting.com &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of DOMASH21 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Q: How do I find the best Web broker?
</P>
<P>
   A: My favorite site for broker information is OnLine Investment
Services ( &LR; www.sonic.net/donaldj &LR; ).
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's a good site for economic indicators?
</P>
<P>
   A: The White House Economic Briefing Room
( &LR; www.whitehouse.gov &LR; ), provides an excellent display of the latest
statistics released by the U.S. Government covering all economic
sectors. Select Briefing Room, then Economic Statistics, and
finally Economic Statistics Briefing Room.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How do I find the strongest industry sectors?
</P>
<P>
   A: Many investors pick stocks by first finding the strongest
industry sectors, then picking the best performing stocks within
those sectors. Big Charts ( &LR; www.bigcharts.com &LR; ) lists the 10 best
and 10 worst performing industries for selectable time spans
ranging from one week to five years.
</P>
<P>
   Select Industries on their home page. Clicking on an industry
name displays the 10 best and worst performing stocks within the
sector.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can I find a list of competitors for a company I'm
researching?
</P>
<P>
   A: Hoover's ( &LR; www.hoovers.com &LR; ) lists the top three competitors
in their Company Capsule. Many other sites claim to list
competitors, but their lists are far too long and include many
false listings.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the company name or ticker symbol on Hoover's home page to
display the capsule.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where do I find out about exchange-traded mutual funds?
</P>
<P>
   A: Exchange-traded funds are similar to index or industry
specific mutual funds, except they trade like stocks. You buy and
sell them as you would shares of individual companies. The best way
to learn about them is to go to  &LR; www.about.com &LR;  and search for
``exchange traded funds,'' and then click on the top listing.

THINK OF THE GIFT CERTIFICATES EDISON COULD HAVE COLLECTED &HT;    
</HEADLINE>
  By CARRIE KIRBY &HT;    c.2000 SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
San Francisco entrepreneur Mark Turrell wants to give you a penny
for your thoughts. Actually, he will pay up to $100 plus 15 percent
of future revenues for really good ones.
</P>
<P>
   Through his Web site, IdeaDollar.com, people can submit their
ideas in exchange for gift certificates at online stores.
</P>
<P>
   Turrell has already purchased rights to develop such gems as the
laminated shower poster and talking dinnerware that tells blind
people what they are about to eat. Since December 1999, the company
has bought 1,500 ideas and awarded about $8,000 in gift
certificates.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it works: You go to  &LR; www.ideadollar.com &LR;  and describe
an original idea for anything _ an invention, a marketing tactic or
even a recipe for world peace. Then you submit it, irrevocably
handing over to IdeaDollar the rights to patent or develop the
concept. IdeaDollar agrees to buy anything you submit. IdeaDollar
pays in gift certificates from its e-tailing partners, currently
limited to Amazon.com and Art.com. The catch? IdeaDollar gets to
set the price: Ideas that score low in originality sell for the
bargain price of $0.
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle submitted a couple of ideas for appraisal. The
results:
</P>
<P>
   -- A pair of keyboard gloves, fitted with sensors that allow the
wearer to enter information into a computer simply by moving the
appropriate finger. IdeaDollar ranked this idea 4 out of 10 points,
and paid $1.
</P>
<P>
   -- Pre-recorded phone messages: Users could record standard
phrases such as ``Call me, my number is ...'' to be replayed when
leaving a message on others' answering machines. It was ranked 5
out of 10, and paid $1.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of IDEADOLL () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Sell your inspiration for a lousy gift certificate? Turrell
insists that inventors get a bargain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It normally costs you thousands of dollars and several years
to take your idea to market, and if you're lucky you get 7 or 8
percent net profit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone's getting a raw deal, it could be IdeaDollar, which
acknowledges that it will be able to convert very few of the ideas
it collects into money-making products. The company also takes on
certain legal burdens. For example, if IdeaDollar buys a design for
a new microchip, it had better make sure that the idea doesn't come
from an Intel employee who has signed an agreement that all her
work belongs to her employer.
</P>
<P>
   The company is exploring a corporate angle that might be more
promising. It's creating a Web site for Bush Brothers' Baked Beans
where customers can suggest bean recipes or other ideas the company
might find useful.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are actually some very good customer ideas out there,''
but most companies avoid soliciting customer ideas because they're
afraid of getting sued, Turrell said. IdeaDollar plans to act as a
go-between that would collect customer suggestions for
corporations.

IT `WAS MY FAULT,' DREIFORT ADMITS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There were a lot of villains in Sunday's 9-6 Los
Angeles Dodgers loss to the New York Mets, but Darren Dreifort says
the blame was his alone.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort, who had won his past six decisions, allowed base
runners in every inning but the first and finally got pulled in the
sixth when Bubba Trammell and Lenny Harris opened with home runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game was my fault,'' said Dreifort, whose five walks were
the most he has had since walking eight in his first start of the
season. ``I put us in bad situations all game. If you throw pitches
where I threw them, the other team is going to hit them out.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort, eligible for free agency this winter after an erratic
career, began his victory streak July 17 against Pittsburgh. During
that stretch, he allowed just 11 earned runs in 38 innings.
Dreifort had limited opposing hitters to a .210 average.
</P>
<P>
   When he was winning he averaged just two walks a game.
</P>
<P>
   Big day for Hundley: Catcher Todd Hundley erased a 4-0 deficit
with two home runs in the first four innings. It was his second
two-homer game this season (the other was May 26 vs. Philadelphia)
and the 12th of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley now has 21 homers this year, giving the Dodgers four
players with 20 homers. The others: Gary Sheffield (40), Eric
Karros (28) and Shawn Green (22). Only the Atlanta Braves have that
many players with 20 homers. Hundley, who went 1 for 15 on the last
homestand, was 0 for 3 Friday night before getting ejected. He
didn't play Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Gold Glover?: Former Dodger Mike Piazza isn't known as a great
defensive catcher, throwing out just 26 of 108 base runners this
year. But Sunday, Piazza made two spectacular catches on foul pops
that certainly will be used to promote his MVP candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   In the second, he raced to the screen behind home to make a
lunging catch of Alex Cora's popup. He got up but collapsed in
pain. Trainers got him to his feet and he remained in the game. In
the eighth, he went to the railing to catch Mark Grudzielanek's
foul pop then somersaulted into the stands. He held onto the ball.
</P>
<P>
   At the plate, Piazza surprisingly went 0 for 5 and hit into an
inning-ending double play in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Remembering L.A.: Harris, who tied the game with a homer in the
sixth, played five seasons with the Dodgers. ``They still send me a
Christmas card every year and that means a lot,'' said Harris, who
was released after the `93 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some rough years for (manager) Tommy (Lasorda), but he
always said to us that we would be Dodgers for life. I still feel
that way. We were supposed to be better, kind of like this year's
team. We had (Darryl Strawberry) and Eddie Murray and thought we
had it won in 1991. But it didn't work out.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris leads active major-leaguers with 124 pinch hits, 26 short
of of Manny Mota's all-time record. The record means a lot to Mota,
who wears a diamond studded necklace ``150.'' ``I love Manny, but
it would mean a lot to get that record,'' Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   Quick hits: The Dodgers entered the game tied with San Diego as
the worst defensive team in the league. Their three errors gives
them 109 this season. ... Eric Karros, who hit his first homer in
three weeks Saturday, has been hot the past week. He went 3 for 4
Sunday and is batting .455 (10 for 22) in the past five games. ...
Grudzielanek's fifth-inning stolen base was his 10th of the season
and 100th of his career. Last season, his 13 errors were the fewest
by a shortstop in Dodgers history. His seventh-inning error Sunday,
which led to the Mets' ninth run, was his 15th at second base.

 &HT;    GODZILLA'S FIREY TONGUE IN CHEEK(a) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    By BILL MULLER(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In (beginitalic)Godzilla 2000(enditalic), the big lizard with a
chip on his shoulder rises from the ocean and once again smashes
Tokyo to bits.
</P>
<P>
   You'd think they'd put up a fence or something.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, things have changed since Godzilla first romped and
stomped through Japan 45 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   For one, the big guy has a new makeup man and a new voice coach.
He looks 20 years younger and a lot meaner, with more teeth and
bigger spikes on his back. His trademark roar is louder than ever.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese haven't been sitting still, either. In this
delightfully campy remake, they've updated their technology and now
use sophisticated computers to track Godzilla. Well, not that
sophisticated. After all, Godzilla is 170 feet tall and spews
radioactive fire. He's not really that hard to spot.
</P>
<P>
   The government is backed up by the Godzilla Prediction Network,
which tries to figure out when the big guy will emerge from the
ocean. It's curiously underfunded and understaffed, considering
Godzilla's frequent forays into town.
</P>
<P>
   Also, at some point, Japanese scientists and military guys
started cursing on camera. With Godzilla squashing their minimalls
every few years, who could blame them?
</P>
<P>
   Other than those updates, Toho Studios worked hard to bring
Godzilla back to life in all his cheesy glory, complete with the
original, scratchy Toho logo as well as the standard-issue
miniature buildings, ineffectual toy rockets and badly dubbed
dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   If you're expecting a modern science-fiction movie with
state-of-the-art special effects, you'll be sorely disappointed.
This movie is a tribute to the days before computer graphics
dominated the movies, when two guys in rubber suits stepping on a
fake city and toy cars didn't seem all that bad.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Godzilla aficionados will enjoy this one,
which is played for laughs. Some of the dialogue is pulled from
other films - (beginitalic)Dr. Strangelove (enditalic)and
(beginitalic)Superman, (enditalic)to name a few - while other lines
offer biting commentary on the monster-movie genre. There's also
some influence from American movies, especially
(beginitalic)Independence Day(enditalic).
</P>
<P>
   In a good move, this version of Godzilla has no interest in
being a friend to man or cleaning up the environment. He'd rather
just step on buildings and spit fire, which is what Godzilla does
best.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, Godzilla shows up one foggy night and
immediately starts squashing stuff. The Japanese, armed with new,
more powerful weapons, bring the full weight of their military to
bear, with somewhat predictable results.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, scientists have discovered a huge rock from outer
space lying at the bottom of the ocean. Once they start fiddling
with it, the thing comes to life and turns into a shiny, flying
computer mouse with a bad attitude. At this point, we get a lot of
N.M. (No Monster) time, as the ship lands on a building and the
scientists scratch their heads.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Godzilla shows up just as a monster pops out of the
ship, and the rumble is on.
</P>
<P>
   The offending monster looks suspiciously like the American
version of Godzilla from the 1998 Matthew Broderick movie. In a
not-so-subtle shot at imitators, there's a lot of dialogue about
the monster trying to steal Godzilla's identity.
</P>
<P>
   But that's impossible. There's only one true Godzilla.
</P>
<P>
   And he'll be back.

   Alexis Brown, 2, and her sister Aliyah Brown, 6, died in the
fire at the Early Childhood Residential Center, a foster home at
3911 Agnes Ave. Authorities suspect arson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody called me a hero. ...I don't feel like a hero,''
Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Alexis died at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep thinking I should have found her,'' said Jones, a
father of two girls and a boy. ``But the smoke was heavy and
thick.''
</P>
<P>
   Aliyah died later at Children's Mercy Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said others could have died if not for Jones. At one
point, he reached into darkness and smoke and felt the edge of a
crib. Inside was a baby whom he rushed outside.
</P>
<P>
   State officials had placed the 13 children _ ages 2 months to 10
years _ in the two-story stone building for their care and safety.
Shortly after dawn, fire officials turned the scene over to police.
The center had become a crime scene.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City police Sgt. Robert Schweitzer would say only that
arson was suspected. Because Jones was at the fire scene at an odd
hour, he originally was considered a suspect. Authorities
questioned him for several hours and determined he was ``a good
Samaritan,'' Police Department spokesman Sgt. Floyd Mitchell said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators determined that the fire began at the rear of the
building, beneath where the children slept.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, 27, who works in home remodeling, had returned to Kansas
City about 5 a.m. from St. Louis, where he had attended a football
game Saturday night. Mike Jones, a linebacker for the St. Louis
Rams, is his uncle.
</P>
<P>
   The long drive home was worrisome. Jones and his cousin passed a
bad accident. Once back in Kansas City, Jones drove to his church
to pray. He knew it would be locked, but he knelt on the concrete
steps of the Greater Grace Temple and ``praised the Lord'' for
getting him home safe.
</P>
<P>
   As Jones was turning his car around in the church parking lot,
he saw the fire through windows of the center. Maybe instinct took
over. A great-uncle, uncle and cousin are firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   Jones ran to the front of the building, kicked in the door and
found several children on the stairway.
</P>
<P>
   Beverly Parks, a worker at the center, was trying to get them
outside. The children were crying.
</P>
<P>
   Jones helped lead them outside. Then, a girl took Jones' hand
and told him her sister was still inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's in there,'' the girl said, leading Jones back into the
smoke-filled building and pointing toward a room.
</P>
<P>
   That is when Jones found the baby in the crib.
</P>
<P>
   Outside again, Parks quickly counted heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's two babies still in there!'' she shouted.
</P>
<P>
   But it was too late, the smoke too thick and the fire too hot.
</P>
<P>
   At midmorning, some of center's staff gathered on a porch across
the street. When asked about the possibility of arson, Cora
Thompson, the center's treatment director, began to cry.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just sick,'' Thompson said, weeping. ``Lexie was a
funny little girl who loved to laugh. She would come in while you
were working and demand a hug.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones was nearly passed out when firefighters arrived on the
scene at 5:22 a.m., three minutes after an alarm was sounded. The
first company found heavy smoke and fire blowing out the back of
the building. They immediately requested additional personnel.
</P>
<P>
   The fire was under control at 5:39 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Alexis was found by Capt. Tim Bowman, Aliyah by Capt. Russ
Hombs.
</P>
<P>
   Parks, the only adult staying overnight at the center, and Jones
were taken to area hospitals, where they were treated and released.
</P>
<P>
   Forty firefighters battled the blaze. None was injured.
</P>
<P>
   The residential center was operated by the Civic Registration
Council. Thompson said the children were placed there by the
Missouri Division of Family Services. Some had been abused or
neglected. Others came from families in crisis. A staff of about 20
provided programs for speech, language and social development and
various forms of therapy.
</P>
<P>
   The children were a familiar site to neighbors in the area just
south of 39th Street.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Fitzpatrick, who lives across the street, often let her
children play with those at the center. She said the children at
the center were happy and well cared for.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzpatrick was awakened by the fire and was on her porch when
the children came out of the building.
</P>
<P>
   She saw Parks frantically count the children and yell for help.
</P>
<P>
   She also heard an older sister of Alexis and Aliyah Brown
scream: ``My baby sisters are in there! Don't let them die!''
</P>
<P>
   Working smoke detectors were found in the building's sleeping
areas. Material loss has been estimated at $100,000 to the
structure and $50,000 to its contents.
</P>
<P>
   The surviving children were placed in other foster homes Sunday,
officials said.

<P>
   Charm is an undervalued commodity in movies these days.
</P>
<P>
   In an era of sprawling, violent epics and empty special-effects
vehicles, there's not much room for whimsy. And that's too bad
because films such as (beginitalic)Saving Grace (enditalic)prove
how enchanting such movies can be.
</P>
<P>
   (beginitalic)Saving Grace (enditalic)is a small film with some
big laughs, mostly due to stellar performances by Brenda Blethyn
((beginitalic)Secrets &AMP; Lies(enditalic)) and Craig Ferguson
((beginitalic)The Drew Carey Show(enditalic)), who play residents
of a quirky fishing village on the Cornish coast.
</P>
<P>
   Blethyn is Grace Trevethen, whose late husband jumped out of a
plane sans parachute, leaving her with a manor house and a mountain
of debt. Ferguson plays Grace's gardener, Matthew, who proposes
digging Grace out of debt by growing marijuana in her spacious
greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   The plot is really secondary in this film, which is all tone and
mood, sprinkled with picturesque shots of the Cornish countryside
and cliffs overhanging the Atlantic. The score is equally
entrancing, and the humor is droll and decidedly British, keeping a
smile on your face throughout.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, this is an actor's movie.
</P>
<P>
   Blethyn carries the film with an utterly convincing portrayal of
Grace, a middle-age woman who has to put aside her morals to save
her home. Ferguson, who also co-wrote the movie, slips easily into
the role of Matthew, an easygoing but rugged Scotsman determined to
settle down with his girlfriend, Nicky (Valerie Edmond).
</P>
<P>
   Nicky provides a nice moral rudder for the film, warning Matthew
that his stunt may have consequences and keeping the movie from
becoming a British version of (beginitalic)Up in Smoke(enditalic).
</P>
<P>
   The film is buoyed by the gang of oddball townspeople who are
determined to help Grace any way they can: the local tavern keeper,
a pair of elderly lady shopkeepers and the seemingly out-of-touch
town constable. Martin Clunes is especially effective in the role
of the town doctor, who takes a fairly relaxed approach to his
practice.
</P>
<P>
   The film is alternately sidesplitting and poignant as we watch
Grace and Matthew struggle to build their marijuana farm in secret,
with some fairly uneven results. When the greenhouse lights up the
entire night sky, the townspeople first blame aliens and then turn
the whole thing into evening entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a funny bit in which Grace, as the ultimate fish
out of water, goes to London to try to peddle her wares. There she
finds an unlikely ally and meets a French drug dealer (Tcheky
Karyo), who has a hidden agenda.
</P>
<P>
   While the ending is a bit too pat, by that time, we're all too
charmed to care.
</P>
<P>
   And with (beginitalic)Saving Grace(enditalic), that's really the
point.

MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENTS FOR CANCER DRUGS MAY BE REDUCED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By Kevin Murphy  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   WASHINGTON _ Elderly cancer patients on
chemotherapy take some comfort in knowing that most of the time
they can be treated at a doctor's office rather than at a hospital.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But that may soon become much less common because the Clinton
administration wants to reduce Medicare coverage for cancer drugs
given at doctors' offices. According to the administration, doctors
pay significantly less for the drugs than what they charge
Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   The impending change has upset oncologists and created a flap in
Congress, with members from both parties joining in protest. Some
lawmakers, including Sen. John Ashcroft of Missouri, want to pass a
law to derail the Clinton proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who are fighting cancer are waging the toughest battle
of their lives,'' Ashcroft said. ``They should not be burdened
further with the uncertainty of whether they will have access to
life-saving medications.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress have waged a letter-writing campaign urging
Clinton and Donna Shalala, secretary of the Department of Health
and Human Services, to reconsider the cut in Medicare payments.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft and Sen. Kit Bond, a fellow Missouri Republican, wrote
Shalala on Aug. 7. Eighty-nine members of the House from both
parties, including Democrat Pat Danner of Kansas City and
Republican Kenny Hulshof of Columbia, signed a letter to Shalala on
July 28 urging no cut in payments ``in the strongest possible
terms.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration has not backed down but is gathering opinions
from the health-care community before directing Medicare bill
payers to reduce reimbursement rates, a spokesman for the Health
Care Financing Administration said this week.
</P>
<P>
   Shalala's office declined comment, saying her views are best
summarized in a May 31 letter to Congress in which she cited
``significant discrepancies between the prices that Medicare must
pay by law and the significantly lower prices at which physicians
may obtain these drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Shalala said actuaries estimate the proposed reduction would
save Medicare $2.9 billion over 10 years. She would like to make
the changes effective Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors acknowledge they often pay less for the drugs than what
they bill Medicare, but they say that the difference makes up for
being reimbursed inadequately for the time and expertise of medical
professionals who inject the drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Several oncologists from Missouri are among doctors nationwide
who are concerned that reducing Medicare payments for chemotherapy
given in doctors' offices will force more patients to go to
hospitals, where reimbursement rates generally are higher. Doctors
and clinics could no longer afford to give treatments under the
lower rates, they said.
</P>
<P>
   About 90 percent of chemotherapy injections are now given on an
outpatient basis, doctors said. The drugs must be administered by a
doctor or nurse, partly because of the potential for immediate side
effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our whole industry _ the doctors, nurses and pharmacies _ is
geared toward outpatient therapy, and that is good for the
patients,'' said David Ota, a cancer surgeon and medical director
of the Ellis Fischel State Cancer Center in Columbia, which is part
of the University of Missouri medical care system.
</P>
<P>
   Ota said the center received about 7,300 visits from cancer
treatments in the year ended June 30, some from patients who came
in from up to 150 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals, even for outpatient treatment, tend to be less
convenient, less attentive and more crowded than a private doctor's
office, says the American Society of Clinical Oncology, which is
lobbying vigorously against any changes.
</P>
<P>
   The organization has urged its members to write their
representatives and senators in Congress. Ota and other Missouri
doctors have written Ashcroft about the effect of lowering Medicare
payments, especially at private clinics not adjacent to hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a dangerous plan that would gravely threaten the
cancer care delivery system on which millions of Americans
depend,'' wrote Christopher F. Sirridge of the Cliffview Hematology
and Oncology centers in Independence and Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft says he will introduce a bill when Congress reconvenes
after Labor Day that would try to head off the Medicare cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The Ashcroft bill would block any cut in drug payments unless
preceded by review with health professionals and government
auditors, and appropriate increases in other reimbursements.
</P>
<P>
   The White House had no response to Ashcroft's proposal, but
Shalala and other officials have said that substantial research has
gone into the decision to consider cutting the Medicare
reimbursements for the cancer drugs.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Congress, as part of its Balanced Budget Act, set
reimbursement rates at 95 percent of the ``average wholesale
price'' of the various drugs Medicare covers. But Shalala said the
formula for measuring those prices is flawed and that a study
showed doctors received from 11 to 900 percent more from Medicare
than what they paid for the drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Justice, which is investigating drug prices,
and the State Medicaid Fraud Control Units have compiled data for
about 50 types of drugs to determine fair prices that the
administration would like to use for Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   While many members of Congress reject setting new drug prices
for Medicare, others agree with Shalala that a change must be
explored.
</P>
<P>
   House Commerce Committee chairman Tom Bliley of Virginia, a
Republican, wrote to seven pharmaceutical companies May 4 seeking
details of prices they charge for various drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Bliley said his committee investigation found that some drug
makers apparently set average wholesale prices far above what they
actually charge doctors. The Medicare reimbursement is based on the
wholesale price, so doctors can keep the difference. This
``spread'' creates an incentive for doctors to buy drugs from those
manufacturers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies increase the spread ``in a calculated and
deliberate effort to use this Medicare-funded windfall as a
marketing tool,'' Bliley wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft said he understands concern about excessive
reimbursements for some drugs, but he and others said shifting
treatments to hospitals may be even more costly to Medicare because
of the higher overall costs of hospital care.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a time when we all are concerned about the long-term
solvency of the Medicare program,'' Ashcroft wrote Clinton, ``I
believe it is short-sighted to ignore this possible unintended
consequence.''

WOMEN'S GYMNASTICS TEAM IS SURPRISING, BUT UNDENIABLY FAIR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In hindsight, it had been an intriguing storyline, this
idea of a one-time queen returning to claim her throne.
</P>
<P>
   But in the game that Shannon Miller was playing, we were
reminded Sunday, there are no shortcuts, no Cliffs Notes, no
``Olympics for Dummies''.
</P>
<P>
   If you dare to experience the thrill, you must pay the price.
And while Miller was off for three years _ writing books, giving
motivational speeches, buying a wedding dress _ the meter was
running.
</P>
<P>
   If you dare to dream the dream, you also need to feel the
hunger. And when she needed it most, with the strain of the U.S.
Olympic Gymnastics Trials bearing down upon her, Plano's Vanessa
Atler dug down to the bottom of her soul ... and found nothing.
</P>
<P>
   They named a women's Olympic team here at the FleetCenter on
Sunday night, a team remarkable only in that the announced six
names prompted little, if any, debate.
</P>
<P>
   In Elise Ray, Kristen Maloney, Amy Chow, Dominique Dawes, Morgan
White and Jamie Dantzscher, team coordinator Bela Karolyi appears
to have found the mixture he was searching for. A blend of young
and old, of poise and experience, of veterans from the 1996 gold
medal team in Chow and Dawes, and of fresh-faced newcomers, like
the irresistible, pint-sized White.
</P>
<P>
   With the entire team to be selected by a Karolyi-influenced
committee for the first time, the outcome was ripe for quarrel. But
Karolyi's post-announcement news conference was symbolically brief.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no discussion and doubt about who are the ones
deserving to be on the team,'' the legendary coach said.
</P>
<P>
   Combining and weighing the results, as planned, of July's U.S.
championships with the trials' scores, the first five finishers all
made the team _ in order, Ray, Chow, Maloney, White and Dantzscher.
Atler's combined score ranked sixth, but Dawes leapfrogged from
seventh place, mostly on the strength of finishing fifth in the
trials' all-around scores.
</P>
<P>
   The two most conspicuous omissions ended up being Miller and
Atler.
</P>
<P>
   As a seven-time Olympic medal winner, Miller, now 23, had every
right to expect Karolyi to validate her royal ticket for Sydney.
But she arrived here under-trained and surprisingly unprepared.
</P>
<P>
   A hairline fracture of the shinbone had cost her three weeks of
valuable repetitions. Miller withdrew from the U.S. championships
last month after strutting her stuff in only one event.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, the surrender came even sooner.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no injury,'' Miller said, after her coach, Steve
Nunno, had pulled her from the meet after only two vaults. ``I just
jammed my legs a little. They're stiff right now, and that's why
I'm not going to finish the meet.''
</P>
<P>
   Let them eat cake, the queen was saying. With the team being
picked by committee, Nunno was shamelessly playing his trump card.
</P>
<P>
   ``They saw what I could do,'' said Miller, who had to
injury-petition just to get into the trials and then prove her
physical readiness in front of a special panel last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very, very unfortunate,'' Karolyi answered later. ``I
wish she had started (her comeback) just a little bit earlier, so
that she could have picked up more physical stamina.''
</P>
<P>
   For Atler, the ending was the same, but the story was different.
The Canyon Country, Calif., native, who moved to Plano because she
thought the change of coaches would lift her to the Olympics, had
been near the top of her sport for the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   The 18-year-old appeared on television in a Reese's Peanut
Butter Cup commercial. There reportedly were deals in the works _ a
book, a cereal box, a public speaking career.
</P>
<P>
   But surgery after the 1999 world championships in China
discovered a bone chip in Atler's left ankle. When the foot still
didn't heal, a second surgery found another bone chip. Atler, too,
lost valuable training time, and she felt the pressure to succeed
increase.
</P>
<P>
   Her Olympic trials were a disaster. Atler wobbled and stumbled,
but mostly she just was not sharp. Her all-around score of 36.924
was better than only two of the 12 gymnasts who finished the meet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deep down in my heart, I knew I wasn't prepared,'' she said,
bravely. ``I think everybody wanted more. But I don't know. I just
wasn't having fun. When the team was announced, I almost had a
sense of relief.''
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people had sacrificed much to see that Vanessa Atler
made the Olympic team. Her mother, Nanette, had moved to Plano, so
that Vanessa could train with former Russian gold medalist Valeri
Liukin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just didn't have the time,'' Atler said, thinking aloud.
``Maybe I'm not into it. There's a lot of things _ all the changes,
the surgeries. It put a lot of pressure on me. And it just wasn't
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Atler said, yes, she was aware that as sixth-place finisher,
under the old system, she would still have made the Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess so,'' she said. ``But if I had made it, still, the
performance I put out there was not Olympic material.''
</P>
<P>
   Shouldn't her two years at the top, someone asked, have been
worth more?
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently not,'' Vanessa Atler said.
</P>
<P>
   The dream was over. There had been no shortcuts. nn

ACCORD IS REACHED FOR MOST WORKERS IN PHONE WALKOUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS 2rd graf with some workers not going back to work; ADDS 10
grafs at end; CUTS into 2 takes)  
 By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The two unions representing more than 86,000 striking telephone
workers reached a contract agreement Sunday with the United States'
largest telecommunications employer, Verizon Communications,
indicating that organized labor still has a place in the New
Economy.
</P>
<P>
   Although about one-third of the union locals had still not
signed off on the settlement by Sunday evening, the company and the
union leaders said the 15-day strike was effectively over. They
said union workers in the region affected by the strike _ 12 states
from Maine to Virginia and the District of Columbia _ could return
to their jobs in New York and New England as soon as Monday morn-
ing, although workers in states such as New Jersey and Pennsylvania
are still waiting for their local presidents to approve the
contract.
</P>
<P>
   The first task for Verizon will be to try to work down a backlog
of telephone repair and new-service orders that has risen to 90,000
_ one-third more than normal _ since the strike began Aug. 6.
</P>
<P>
   Under the three-year contract agreement, the Communications
Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical
Workers secured numerous concessions from Verizon, which is the
nation's largest provider of wireless and local telephone services,
with 260,000 employees around the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The unions secured a 12 percent wage increase, over three years,
for a work force that was already one of the best paid in the
telecommunications industry. The average hourly base pay for a
customer service representative in New York, $26, would increase to
$29.25 in the contract's third year, for example. And in a
new-economy wrinkle, each of Verizon's union workers will, for the
first time, receive a small grant of stock options.
</P>
<P>
   But the broader significance of the agreement, and the reason
the negotiations have been closely watched throughout the
high-technology industry, involves issues that go beyond
traditional wage and benefit concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The unions have won the right to more easily organize workers in
Verizon's wireless division, where fewer than 50 of the division's
32,000 employees belong to a union. The unions also secured
Verizon's promise that union telephone workers will be given the
opportunity to do more work in fast-growing areas like the
installation of high-speed Internet lines _ an activity for which
Verizon has tended to use nonunion contractors.
</P>
<P>
   Those were key points for the unions because wireless and
Internet communications are growing much faster than the
conventional telephone business.
</P>
<P>
   ``This contract is a breakthrough not just for our members who
work at Verizon but for workers throughout the telecommunications
industry,'' Larry Mancino, vice president of the Communications
Workers of America, which represents about 72,000 of the striking
employees, said in an interview Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The unions also secured agreements on several other issues that
reflected worker anxieties in the new economy, which is
characterized by big corporate mergers and an entrepreneurial ethic
in which the shorthand ``24/7'' _ meaning 24 hours a day, seven
days a week _ symbolizes the relentlessness of work in today's
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon was created by Bell Atlantic's acquisition of GTE Corp.
and through the formation of a wireless venture with Vodafone
AirTouch of Britain. Union employees, particularly in the
Northeast, had been worried about the prospect of the company
transferring work to other, lower-paying parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   The union members, especially customer service representatives,
had also sought relief from job stress resulting from long periods
of work with few breaks and frequent compulsory overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon agreed to greater job stability for union members by
limiting the number of employees whose jobs could be moved to a
different region to 0.7 percent of the union workers in a given
geographic area. The measurement would be based on a geographic
area as small as a county, as the unions wanted, instead of an
across-the-board number, as the company wanted.
</P>
<P>
   On job-related stress, Verizon agreed to give customer service
representatives and telephone operators up to five 30-minute
periods each week during which they can do work other than taking
calls.
</P>
<P>
   And mandatory overtime for customer service representatives and
operators would be reduced. For example, operators who are single
mothers will be limited to as few as 7.5 hours a week of overtime
in some areas, down from as much as 20 hours before the strike.

 &HT;    `THE CELL' UNLOCKS PSYCHOLOGICAL HELL(a) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    By BILL MULLER(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At times, (beginitalic)The Cell (enditalic)is really tough to
watch. But you just can't take your eyes off it.
</P>
<P>
   Emotionally powerful and visually stunning, (beginitalic)The
Cell (enditalic)is a triumph of art direction, set design,
costuming and shotmaking. It is, quite simply, like nothing you've
seen before. Or would want to see again, perhaps.
</P>
<P>
   The film is patently disturbing and includes gory, graphic
violence that is not for the faint of heart. Still, it succeeds
through sheer magnitude and sweep, with a clever, taut story that
keeps you guessing until the end.
</P>
<P>
   The film stars Jennifer Lopez as Catherine Deane, a psychologist
who can enter a comatose mind through the use of a radically new
technique. Once inside, she attempts to counsel the other mind,
attempting to bring the person back to reality.
</P>
<P>
   But we're not quite sure what's going on. Others in the film
question whether the therapy works, suggesting that Deane is
actually seeing drug-induced hallucinations and not connecting with
the other mind at all.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the macabre dream sequences are spectacular from the
opening scene, in which Deane rides a magnificent black horse past
giant sand dunes to meet with a child she is trying to help.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, FBI agent Peter Novak (Vince Vaughn) is on the trail
of serial killer Carl Stargher (Vincent D'Onofrio), a sadomasochist
who tortures and kills women who have certain doll-like features.
The police manage to catch Stargher, but not before he slips into a
coma, leaving his last victim hidden with just 40 hours to live.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Deane and her revolutionary treatment. She volunteers to
enter the killer's mind to find the girl. From there, things get
really freaky.
</P>
<P>
   Combining computer effects with brilliant sets and costumes,
director Tarsem Singh takes the audience inside the killer's
twisted mind, creating a nightmarish dreamscape filled with
medieval torture chambers, snarling demons and opulent throne
rooms, where Stargher indulges his sick fantasies.
</P>
<P>
   We watch with fascination as Deane plays Alice, falling into a
surreal wonderland, where the White Rabbit is replaced by spiders,
snakes and other, even less pleasant, creatures - watch for a horse
of a really different color.
</P>
<P>
   Deane is constantly in danger of accepting the bizarre world as
real and perhaps never escaping.
</P>
<P>
   Those scenes are interspersed with the killer's childhood
memories, which include a sparkling 360-degree shot of an
old-fashioned baptism and an artfully shot sequence involving
Stargher's abusive father.
</P>
<P>
   After that, the movie really takes off and, at the same time,
veers into some gory violence. There's one torture scene that will
make most people uncomfortable, and the ending is also quite
bloody. But it seems that the film is trying to be true to its
nature in reflecting the twisted mind of a serial killer.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez does a nice job in the leading role, portraying the
psychologist with equal amounts of sympathy and determination. She
also gets to wear fabulous costumes as she plays different roles in
the killer's fantasies.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn is a standout as the obsessed, haunted FBI agent who's
struggling to find the killer's latest victim. He plays the role
with appropriate weariness, as if he hasn't slept for days.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's D'Onofrio, who portrays several characters in this
film as the killer adopts different personas inside his dream
world. He's under a lot of makeup but turns in a solid performance.
</P>
<P>
   But (beginitalic)The Cell's (enditalic)not really about acting.
It's more of a visual feast. Some of the shots are so amazing
they're really hard to describe.
</P>
<P>
   You just have to be there.

 UNDATED: the strike. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Verizon (pronounced Vuh-RISE-on) was under various pressures to
settle the strike, which had already lasted longer than the token
walkout that the company had apparently expected. It had come at
the busiest time of year for the consumer telecommunications
industry, when many students are about to return to college and
will require new telephone and Internet access service.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before the strike began, the company had also begun a
major advertising campaign to make people aware of its new name.
And lately, concern over the company's earnings have pushed
Verizon's share price near a two-year low. Since the strike began,
Verizon's stock has fallen more than 10 percent. It closed at
$42.4375 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're glad to put this strike behind us and move on,'' the
company's chief executive, Ivan Seidenberg, said in an interview
Sunday. ``I would say that every one of the unions' issues was
legitimate going forward. We've strengthened the fiber of our
company over the long-term with this agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   But it remains to be seen how the agreement will be viewed
elsewhere in labor circles, by other big telecommunications
companies and by Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the most wide-reaching contract settlements the
industry has seen,'' said Jeffrey Kagan, an independent analyst of
the telecommunications industry. ``It'll be interesting to see
whether this will result in a more qualified work force or a ball
and chain around the company's leg.''
</P>
<P>
   The unions' right to organize Verizon's wireless division may be
the strike's most significant outcome. The unions won an important
concession allowing them to organize by card check, a process that
allows a given work site to join a union if a majority of its
employees sign cards saying they wish to do so. The process is
faster and less bureaucratic than holding elections.
</P>
<P>
   Under this part of the agreement, the employees at a work
location would join the union if 55 percent sign up through the
cards. The wireless agreement applies only to workers in the strike
region, where about a fourth of the 32,000 employees of the Verizon
Wireless division are located.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement would include technicians, customer service
representatives and employees who work as customer sales
representative in the wireless division's retail stores.
</P>
<P>
   Making it easier to organize Veri- zon's wireless work force
could have broad implications for the nation's wireless industry,
which is one of the fastest-growing parts of the new economy and
which so far has re- mained a primarily nonunion busi- ness.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is no certainty that the majority of workers in
parts of Verizon Wireless that are not cov- ered by the settlement
or at other wireless companies _ or in other high-growth,
high-technology indus- tries, for that matter _ are eager to
unionize.
</P>
<P>
   But some union advocates are opti- mistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, the parallel issues are glaringly apparent,'' said
Marcus Courtney, co-founder of the Washing- ton Alliance of
Technology Workers, a Seattle organization affiliated with the
Communications Workers of America. The Washington Alliance has
already organized a small num- ber of employees at companies that
include Microsoft and Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will make our efforts easier, because it shows that the
largest company in a key high-tech industry is not off limits,''
Courtney said. ``Now we can hold up this example that says, `Your
voice can be heard.'''
</P>
<P>
   And as in the Verizon strike, the future of union organizing
efforts in high-technology companies is not ex- pected to focus on
wages as much as on issues like job security, benefits, overtime,
work-related stress and even stock options.
</P>
<P>
   ``The questions have been raised,'' said Stanley Aronowitz, a
professor of sociology at the City University of New York who has
studied labor issues. ``In the '30s, no one took work- ers'
complaints seriously until the GMs and U.S. Steels were organ-
ized.''
</P>
<P>
   Already in the wireless industry, where Verizon will try to
compete with other companies that are most- ly nonunion, there are
inklings that organizing can be viable.
</P>
<P>
   At SBC Communications, which will soon operate the nation's
second- largest wireless carrier in a venture with BellSouth, the
same kind of card-check organizing Verizon has agreed to has been
permitted for nearly three years. So far, more than 5,000 of SBC's
wireless employees out of a potential 12,000 eligible are union
members, the CWA says.
</P>
<P>
   And at AT&AMP;T Wireless, the third- largest wireless carrier, the
union won the right last year to card-check organizing, although
elections must be held several days after the cards are gathered _
a potential union impediment not included in the Veri- zon
agreement.

<P>
   ``THE HEAD GAME''
</P>
<P>
   By Roger Kahn
</P>
<P>
   (Harcourt, $25)
</P>
<P>
   ``They're playing chess at 90 miles an hour, and that's not
boring at all,'' Kahn said when former pitcher Clem Labine asked
him if he was tired of watching baseball. Indeed, this book, due
out in early September, is just another excuse to talk about the
game, and that's OK by us. Kahn's hook is what Labine called ``the
head game: the pitcher thinking, the catcher thinking, the batter,
the anticipating and all the rest.'' There's lots of history as
Kahn talks about the intricacies of pitching and the ``armed men''
who have made their mark. When he once asked Pete Rose to name the
greatest pitcher he'd faced, Rose named three: Sandy Koufax, Bob
Gibson and Juan Marichal. Kahn ties them at second, behind Christy
Mathewson. ``Forget 1910,'' he says. ``Mathewson today would throw
splitters, circle changes and all the rest and outthink the
Griffeys, the McGwires and everyone else. Plus he looked like
Apollo - not a bad thing.'' It's something to talk about.
</P>
<P>
   ``BETRAYAL OF TRUST: THE COLLAPSE OF GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH''
</P>
<P>
   By Laurie Garrett
</P>
<P>
   (Hyperion, $30)
</P>
<P>
   This is a formidable book in size and subject, one that's not
easy to embrace when most of us view global health as distant and
irrelevant to our lives. Newsday's Garrett admits that ``public
health is a negative - when it's at its best, nothing happens.''
But it is not at its best, and we now worry naively if what is
``over there'' might come ``here.'' Garrett visited India to study
the pneumonic plague, Zaire to focus on the Ebola epidemic that
flourished after corruption destroyed all basic elements of public
health, and Russia, where life expectancy plummeted after the
Soviet Union collapsed. Finally, she returns to the United States
to address the devastating effects of budget cuts during the Reagan
years, the rise of antibiotic-resistant diseases, the threat of
bioterrorism and the effects of HMOs and wealth disparities on
public health. It's accessible, informative reading about an issue
that affects the world community.
</P>
<P>
   ``BLUE GOLD''
</P>
<P>
   By Clive Cussler with Paul Kemprecos
</P>
<P>
   (Pocket, $16)
</P>
<P>
   Her name is Brynhild Sigurd, and you don't want to meet her in a
dark alley. She is nearly 7feet tall, which never helps, and her
heart is cold - as Cussler says with his dubious flair for
description, ``she could have sprung whole from the permafrost.''
Brynhild lives in Valhalla, her redwood castle on the shore of Lake
Tahoe, and holds business meetings aboard a life-sized Viking ship
that sits in what passes for her living room. Needless to say, she
is trouble - she is, in fact, plotting to take over the world's
supply of fresh water. Her first ruthless act is the 1991
kidnapping of a beautiful scientist who had discovered how to
purify saltwater, but things went awry and the scientist became the
captive ``goddess'' of a remote Indian tribe in the rain forest of
Venezuela. Luckily, Cussler's manly hero, Kurt Austin, is on hand
to flirt with the scientist and figure out what Brynhild is up to.
If you like action and don't want to think too hard, Brynhild and
Kurt are for you.

<P>
   ``SIN BOLDLY''
</P>
<P>
   By David R. Williams
</P>
<P>
   (Perseus, $7.95)
</P>
<P>
   Will anyone read this book? New &AMP; Notable did, waving our fists
occasionally in a show of solidarity, but then we have a soft spot
for quirky ideas. Its real target audience is college students, who
are a harder sell. Subtitled Dr. Dave's Guide to Writing the
College Paper, it tells us what professors want to see in material
submitted by their students: care with grammar and word usage,
awareness of audience, clarity of ideas and expression - in short,
a good performance. Williams, a professor of English at George
Mason University, was tired of correcting the same errors year
after year, so he wrote some ideas on how his students could make
their work better. Self-published at first, the book has come up in
the world and is attracting attention as a blunt, irreverently
philosophical and occasionally long-winded treatise on selling
yourself and your ideas. It's also a primer on that well-known path
to success: pleasing the boss.

JACKSON WILL CALL ... WITH HELP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVINE, Calif. _ It's become an annual rite of training camp,
the question of who will call the plays for USC this season - coach
Paul Hackett or offensive coordinator Hue Jackson?
</P>
<P>
   ``Hue Jackson will call the plays, with help from Paul
Hackett,'' Hackett said. ``I'll have a chance to be complimentary
and talk to him on the headsets, but Hue has a handle on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Then comes the caveat from Hackett: ``To start off with.''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: Jackson is expected to be given more freedom this
season, but it's hardly complete control and is subject to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always reserve the right to jump in,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   This is a change from Hackett's first year, however, when he
almost exclusively called the plays. It's also expected that
Jackson will end up calling more plays than last season, when he
was in charge most of the time. But no one will really know what
happens until the season starts Sunday against Penn State.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't had the opportunity to discuss it yet,'' Jackson
said. ``When we get into game week, we'll discuss it. I know he has
confidence in me because he's allowed me to do it before. He knows
if he gives me the opportunity, I'll be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Few surprises: The two-deep list was released Sunday, and there
were hardly any surprises, at least in the starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, Faasea Mailo won the right-tackle spot over Jacob
Rogers, and Ife Ohalete is the No. 1 free safety ahead of Frank
Strong.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, two positions have co-starters. Sultan McCullough
and Malaefou MacKenzie are listed as the starting tailback, while
David Newbury and David Bell share the kicking position, although
Newbury has been the No. 1 kicker throughout training camp.
</P>
<P>
   A position that actually is too close to call is at defensive
end, where Sultan Abdul-Malik and Lonnie Ford are co-starters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Abdul-Malik probably has a little bit of an edge right now,''
Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more-unexpected announcements came at tight end,
where sophomore Scott Huber is listed as No. 2 behind starter
Antoine Harris. It was assumed that sophomore Doyal Butler or true
freshman Alex Holmes would be the backup.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to play,'' Hackett said. ``But Scott has
experience and has done a nice job. Right now, for the first game,
it's Huber. It could change after a couple games.''
</P>
<P>
   Game plan: Hackett has begun installing a game plan against Penn
State and said he's noticed a different attitude in training camp
because of the opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody has been half-stepping because Penn State has been the
focus,'' Hackett said. ``When you're playing the premier game of
the weekend, and it's against Penn State, it's been different than
last year, and that's not taking anything away from Hawaii.''
</P>
<P>
   Stroock retires: Assistant athletic director Fred Stroock, who
has served various roles within the student-athlete academic
services department and is considered an expert on NCAA issues,
will retire Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Tailgate party: The San Fernando Valley Trojan Club will hold a
tailgate party for Sunday's game against Penn State beginning at 11
a.m. at Gallo's restaurant in Woodland Hills. Information: (818)
993-0648.
</P>
<P>
   Stat of the week: Since this is an election year, USC has
researched the Trojans' record during those seasons when a
presidential election was held. When a Democrat wins the White
House, USC is 70-36-9. When a Republican wins, USC is 100-16-5.

   The Los Angeles Dodgers may want to consider a new promotion:
Blindfold night.
</P>
<P>
   This would allow fans to shield their eyes from hideous moments,
like the one that took place in the eighth inning Sunday and
typified a season gone wrong, and pretty much gone, period.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets had runners on first and third with no outs when Lenny
Harris hit a nubber along third. But Adrian Beltre lobbed the ball
over the head of catcher Todd Hundley, allowing one runner to
score, and when no one bothered to cover home as Hundley chased the
ball to the backstop, the second runner scored all the way from
first.
</P>
<P>
   That was only one of several gory moments best shielded from the
view of small children during the Mets' 9-6 win. Like the second
inning, when catcher Hundley suffered a passed ball on a called
third strike and moments later misfired on a steal attempt. Those
miscues were worth two runs.
</P>
<P>
   There was a Mark Grudzielanek error that added a third run in
the eighth. There were the back-to-back homers Darren Dreifort
allowed in the sixth after the Dodgers had tied the game. There was
Shawn Green getting picked off second in the seventh inning,
leaving the Dodgers with one run to show from two hits, two walks,
a Met error and a stolen base.
</P>
<P>
   But the worst moment of the whole day might have been that TV
picture of Mike Piazza and Mets manager Bobby Valentine standing on
the lip of the Mets dugout and sharing a chuckle during that
R-rated eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Both are ex-Dodgers, of course. Reminders of the club's past
surround it like a moat, prickly thornes that accentuate its
current lost and clueless situation.
</P>
<P>
   It's not enough that Piazza is hitting .345 with 32 home runs
and 100 RBI. While Hundley was struggling defensively (he did hit
two homers), Piazza Sunday turned in two (set ital) defensive (end)
gems, catching a foul popup in the second while sliding knee first
into a cement curb, and catching another in the ninth while going
head-first into the first row of seats.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine is a different matter entirely. He was never a great
Dodger player like Dusty Baker, everyone's first choice to replace
poor Davey Johnson, but Valentine considers the Dodgers his first
family.
</P>
<P>
   When Tommy Lasorda was inducted into the Hall of Fame, the
ex-Dodger manager said Valentine was the best manager in the game.
That caused internal problems that still impact the club today. But
such is the state of the Dodgers misery that the concept of
Valentine someday becoming the Dodgers manager should be taken
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine is manipulative, cocky and not beyond telling a fib or
two, and those opinions come from people who like him. Valentine's
resume includes zero divisional titles and a reputation for being
disingenuous. He and Mets General Manager Steve Phillips have been
waging a personal war for two seasons that seems destined to end
with Valentine moving on, regardless of what happens in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But Valentine's Mets won 97 games last season to earn a wild
card berth and advance to the NLCS, where they lost to the Braves
in six games, with three of the four losses by a run.
</P>
<P>
   In 2000, the Mets are 74-50, trail Atlanta by 1 games in the
N.L. East and lead the wild card race by 3 games over Arizona and
10 over the Dodgers. Valentine's team has won eight consecutive
series, are 26-12 since the all-star break and 21-6 in their last
27.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets won Sunday with ex-Dodger Harris -- ad infinitum
nauseaum -- posting two runs, two hits and two RBI, and with
Valentine going through five pitchers to secure the win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobby is a lot like Tommy,'' said Harris after the win,
``except more aggressive. He will put on a lot of plays, so much so
that you never know what to expect. He's a soldier, and he's in
charge of this locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll make that extra move with the bullpen. He'll give a
starter a day off and give a guy like me a chance to play. We get
things done. We can't always depend on a home run from Mike. We
have to do the little things.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets have played the entire season without a regular left
fielder and with a 27-year-old rookie, Jay Payton, in center.
Valentine has used catcher Todd Pratt more than one would expect
with Piazza on the same roster, gotten a terrific season from a
player, Derek Bell, who was considered tainted, and played more
little ball than you'd think with seven double-digit home run
hitters on the roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known Bobby for 27 years, and he's never been arrogant
around me,'' said Lasorda. ``He's a little cocky. He's got a lot of
self-confidence. What's wrong with that?
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a brilliant tactician who knows how to run a ball club.
He won 97 games last year and the most wins any starter had was 13,
and one of those guys was Bulldog (Orel Hershiser). What does he do
wrong? You can't tell me, because there isn't anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda thinks someone in the media who didn't like Valentine
created a reputation that has since taken on a life of its own --
just as Lasorda was once considered a rookie-killer, ``despite the
fact that the Dodgers had nine rookie of the year winners when I
was manager,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Don't misread anything into Lasorda's comments. He wasn't
stumping for Valentine as a replacement for the beleaguered
Johnson, who is simply mortified at this stage of the season, he
was just responding to questions about Valentine's reputation.
</P>
<P>
   But it's hard to imagine the Dodgers being any worse off with
Valentine as manager as they are today. Regardless of any
trepidation over his style, he'd at least demand pride for the
uniform and organization, something the team isn't getting now.
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't a Lasorda-Valentine ticket, as G.M. and manager, be
preferable than the out-of-towners and out-of-synch duo of Kevin
Malone and Johnson?
</P>
<P>
   At this stage, Siegfried and Roy would be a better duo. But
that's what Dodger baseball has become, a circus act with a G.M.
culled from the Expos, blindfolds for the fans, and consideration
of things and people, like Valentine, never before imagined.

<P>
   George W. Bush speaks of a Jesus who changed his heart. He calls
Jesus his favorite political philosopher.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore makes decisions by asking ``What would Jesus do?'' - a
phrase from the WWJD? bracelets made popular by Christian teens.
</P>
<P>
   The two major presidential candidates are campaigning with Jesus
on their lips more often and more publicly than candidates in
previous elections. Even though America is more religiously
diverse, Christian overtones are more pervasive and more sustained
among the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen a campaign where some pretty amazing things have
been said - at Salvation Army events, at NAACP events, in a
national debate. I think we can say with virtual certainty that it
will come up again. That will be different,'' said longtime
political analyst Kerby Anderson, president of Probe, a
conservative Christian think tank in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   This shift is driven by polls that show a more public faith
plays well with voters who believe in God themselves and who are
concerned with the morality and personal life of the next
president, Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   Martin E. Marty, historian, theologian and expert on American
religion, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ninety percent of the American people believe somehow in some
sort of God, and over 80 percent check in on a biblical God. If you
add Islam, clearly four out of five Americans would line up with
God,'' said Marty.
</P>
<P>
   He directed the Public Religion Project at the University of
Chicago and is author of (beginitalic)Politics, Religion and the
Common Good.(enditalic)
</P>
<P>
   ``In Europe, it's an incomprehensible notion that religion would
have any bearing on politics,'' Marty said. ``They would never
subject their leaders to religious tests.''
</P>
<P>
   Europe is much more secular than the United States.
</P>
<P>
   American presidents and presidential candidates historically
have kept their personal beliefs closer to their hearts and rarely
discussed them openly, Marty said. Such talk was considered
impolite in public and limited to a sort of American civil religion
of ``God Bless America.''
</P>
<P>
   Religion became a serious campaign issue for the first time in
1960 when some Americans had concerns the Roman Catholic beliefs of
John F. Kennedy would mean the pope would run the White House.
Kennedy, who believed a president's religious views should be
private, was forced to talk about religion, Marty said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1976, Jimmy Carter brought up that he was a born-again
Christian, a familiar phrase among evangelicals and Southerners to
describe a conversion experience, but not as familiar outside those
circles. Later, Carter only used more general God talk, and faith
only rarely and indirectly came up in presidential talk. But
Americans are in a different place today, Marty said.
</P>
<P>
   Forty percent of Americans define themselves as evangelical, or
born-again, Christians. That number has grown in the past 30 years,
said Michael Lindsay, Gallup Organization consultant for theology,
religion and culture.
</P>
<P>
   Gallup defines an evangelical as a person meeting three
criteria: Believes the Bible is the actual word of God; experienced
a personal conversion; and seeks to lead non-Christians to
conversion. The Religious Right is a subgroup of evangelicals that
is more political and represents about 10 percent of evangelicals,
according to Gallup.
</P>
<P>
   Among Democrats, 46percent would identify themselves as
evangelical. It's 53percent for Republicans and 40 percent for
Independents. The identification goes beyond conservative
Republicans and crosses denominational lines.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates pay attention to these numbers, Lindsay said, and
after Bill Clinton's impeachment trial, Americans are more
interested in how the personal beliefs of a candidate would affect
his actions in office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most Americans see morality and religion tied together,''
Lindsay said. ``For example, 84 percent in this country say Jesus
Christ is God or the son of God. That's remarkable. If you compare
it with Great Britain, about 46percent believe in the divinity of
Christ. Hence, when someone says they have a personal relationship
with Jesus Christ, that does make a difference for a sizable number
of people. They are using the language of evangelicals.''
</P>
<P>
   So, when Bush said Jesus Christ was his favorite political
philosopher, a lot of Americans nodded.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are people who have kids wearing WWJD? armbands,''
Anderson said. ``They're not Christian Right, but they go to
church, are concerned about the direction of the country, and they
are a little more ambivalent about where society is going. Does
faith set well with them? Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore is Southern Baptist and is active at a church in Arlington,
Va. He grew up in a culture where such talk comes naturally. Bush
grew up Episcopalian and is now Methodist. He had a conversion
experience at a Billy Graham crusade.
</P>
<P>
   For those people who are not in the Jesus camp, these public
professions bring mixed reactions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love Jesus,'' says Ibrahim Hooper, spokesman for the
Washington, D.C.-based Council on American-Islamic Relations. ``We
would hope that a leader would have a firm moral base and that most
often means a spiritual base as well. We're not particularly
disturbed that someone would express their faith openly.''
</P>
<P>
   Art Paikowsky, executive vice president of the Jewish Federation
of Greater Phoenix, worries about the next step: How political
philosophies tied to Jesus will determine how the country is run.
</P>
<P>
   Though he is thrilled that Gore has picked an Orthodox Jew as a
running mate, Paikowsky said he believes personal religious beliefs
should be kept out of public conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good from many standpoints,'' he said of Joe Lieberman,
Gore's running mate, ``but it doesn't change my general point of
view that I hope candidates continue to be disciplined with regard
to introducing their faith into the electoral campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   People want to know that candidates have thought deeply about
faith issues, and they have the right to know how religious beliefs
will direct actions, said the Rev. Dr. C.Welton Gaddy, executive
director of the Interfaith Alliance. The national organization
represents 100,000 Protestants, Catholics, Muslims, Jews and 50
other faith traditions, and promotes the role of religion in public
life.
</P>
<P>
   But people also can be suspicious about the sincerity of such
statements, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you only use religious language when it is politically
profitable?'' he asked. ``If that is the case, are you being
religious or are you being political?''
</P>
<P>
   Bringing private religion into the public world has high risks
and could be in bad taste, Marty said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As more ample use of religion plays its part, they better
handle it with care,'' he said. ``They better know the risks, and
they better know they will be accused of hypocrisy, and they better
search their hearts. Religion is so easy to exploit. {hellip}
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, if you want to be president of all the people, you
have to watch things. I think we've had enough of the testifying.
Now, we have to see what they do with policies.''

   Until John F. Kennedy was elected president, the country was
pretty much run by Protestants, some of whom were religious
privately but not publicly. It was considered poor taste for
candidates to discuss their private religious beliefs openly but
these same candidates, once elected president, supported the
``American civil religion'' and sprinkled speeches with such
phrases as ``God bless America.''
</P>
<P>
   Harry S. cq stylebook cj Truman (1945-53, Democrat) - A Baptist
who hated public displays of piety. His personal letters to his
wife show he was religiously informed, biblical and godly.
</P>
<P>
   Dwight D. Eisenhower (1953-61, Republican) - Had not attended
church as an adult, but as the president, he joined the National
Presbyterian Church and was baptized. He authorized ``In God We
Trust'' on all money (the motto had been in use on some coins since
1908) and the addition of ``under God'' to the Pledge of
Allegiance. Also played golf on the National Day of Prayer.
</P>
<P>
   John F. Kennedy (1961-63, Democrat) - His Roman Catholic beliefs
stirred concerns he would show more allegiance to the pope than the
Constitution. His opponent, Richard M. Nixon, said Kennedy's
Catholicism wasn't a problem, and religion would only be an issue
if an agnostic or atheist ran for president.
</P>
<P>
   Lyndon B. Johnson (1963-69, Democrat) - Affiliated with the
Disciples of Christ; attended church at home and at the National
City Christian Church in Washington, D.C., although he sometimes
attended an Episcopalian church with his wife. He liked to quote
Scripture. cq stylebook cj
</P>
<P>
   Richard M. Nixon (1969-74, Republican) - He was raised in a
Quaker church but not much of his religious upbringing showed in
his adult life. In his speeches, he talked about America's faith in
its children, its weapons and in other things rather than about
America's faith in God.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald R. Ford (1974-77, Republican) - A churchgoing
Episcopalian who was selected by Congress to replace the resigning
Nixon because of his integrity and character. As a child, the rule
in his house was ``Tell the truth, work hard and come to dinner on
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Carter (1977-81, Democrat) - A Baptist, he was the first
who talked about his faith openly as a candidate and said he was
``born again,'' a code phrase in evangelical circles for describing
a conversion experience. After that, he used more generalized God
language in public. His beliefs influenced his foreign policy
decisions, and he taught Baptist Sunday school while in the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Reagan (1981-89, Republican) - He grew up in a Disciples
of Christ church in Illinois and was a member of Hollywood
Presbyterian Church as an adult. He was most aligned with
evangelicals politically but did not certify his religious
experiences with their language. He was respectful and reverent of
religion. He attended church the least of all presidents, saying it
was too much trouble for the Secret Service.
</P>
<P>
   George Bush (1989-93, Republican) - Brought up in an East Coast
Episcopal parish where the mainline Protestant culture nurtured
faith, but parishioners didn't talk too publicly about personal
beliefs. During his terms as vice president and as president, he
was a vestryman at St. Ann's Episcopal Church in Kennebunkport,
Maine. He is active at his Episcopal Church in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton (1993 to present, Democrat) - A Southern Baptist
who knows the Bible well and can readily quote Scripture. He
attends a Methodist church in Washington, D.C. He has received the
most support and the most criticism from religious leaders. He used
the occasion of a September 1998 interfaith prayer breakfast at the
White House to apologize to the country for the Monica Lewinsky
scandal, but he has not talked much about the details of his
personal faith.

<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Nicky McCrimmon of the Los Angeles Sparks
sat in a corner, her eyes bloodshot from crying. Teammate DeLisha
Milton sat staring downward, speechless, unable to describe what
was going through her mind. Their team had lost and they couldn't
hide their pain.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks did all they could to try to fend off elimination in
the Western Conference Finals. They came back from a devastating
opener in Houston and played team ball.
</P>
<P>
   They did a great job of affecting two of the Houston Comets'
three big stars.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the least-talked-about players - Brazilian Janeth
Arcain and reserve Tammy Jackson - who dealt the Sparks their
biggest blow of the season. Not Sheryl Swoopes, Cynthia Cooper or
Tina Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   Arcain scored the last five points, including the go-ahead
basket with 39 seconds to play, to send the three-time defending
champion Houston Comets to the championship series with a 74-69
victory over the Sparks on Sunday afternoon at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   Except for a small group of Comets fans, the season-high crowd
of 13,084 fell silent. They were stunned that the Sparks, the team
that won a record 28 regular-season WNBA games, that defeated the
Comets three times, would not have another chance to play again
until next year.
</P>
<P>
   The day began with much anticipation and excitement, starting
with Sparks coach Michael Cooper being introduced as the WNBA Coach
of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks trailed 40-35 at the break, but traded leads with the
Comets in the second half until the final minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put ourselves in a great position and we just ran up
against the champions, and champions know what to do,'' Michael
Cooper said. ``But I tell you what - if you were to ask (the
Comets) if they would, if they could have played (today), I
guarantee they'll say no, because they have nothing else left to
give. That's why they're champions, because they get it done when
necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   After Arcain's shot put the Comets ahead 71-69, the Sparks had a
chance to tie it. But Jackson blocked DeLisha Milton's layup and
Allison Feaster had to foul Arcain to stop the clock. Arcain made
the second free throw to make it a three-point game with 20 seconds
to play, enough time to give the Sparks another opportunity to tie.
</P>
<P>
   Mwadi Mabika, who had team-high 19 points, came off a screen on
the right side to shoot a 3-pointer, but it fell short. Feaster
tried to push the ball out to Tamecka Dixon at the top of the key,
but Arcain came up with the ball and Feaster fouled her to stop the
clock again. Arcain made both free throws with 12.4 seconds to play
for the decisive margin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously a lot of people say this is a team that has three
players, but everybody can see now that they have five people that
can play,'' Michael Cooper said. ``Just because those three get all
the publicity, you have the tendency to forget about those two.
That's when those two do what I call a silent sniper job on us -
Jackson coming in getting some key baskets and Arcain hitting some
key baskets.''
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Cooper scored a game-high 29 points, but Swoopes and
Thompson had only 15 between them. However, it didn't matter with
Arcain scoring 16 and Jackson 12 off the bench. Swoopes had six
assists, often feeding the ball to Jackson in the low post.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like coach Cooper said, we followed what we needed for Sheryl
and Cynthia to distribute the ball to the other players,'' said
Lisa Leslie of the Sparks. ``And the other players played well
tonight and that was pretty much the difference. They took shots
they normally don't take and made shots that they normally don't
make.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the champs and I tip my hat to them,'' Michael Cooper
said.

on their lips more often and more publicly than candidates in
previous elections. Even though America is more religiously
diverse, Christian overtones are more pervasive and more sustained
among the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen a campaign where some pretty amazing things have
been said - at Salvation Army events, at NAACP events, in a
national debate. I think we can say with virtual certainty that it
will come up again. That will be different,'' said longtime
political analyst Kerby Anderson, president of Probe, a
conservative Christian think tank in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   This shift is driven by polls that show a more public faith
plays well with voters who believe in God themselves and who are
concerned with the morality and personal life of the next
president, Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   Martin E. Marty, historian, theologian and expert on American
religion, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ninety percent of the American people believe somehow in some
sort of God, and over 80 percent check in on a biblical God. If you
add Islam, clearly four out of five Americans would line up with
God,'' said Marty.
</P>
<P>
   He directed the Public Religion Project at the University of
Chicago and is author of (beginitalic)Politics, Religion and the
Common Good.(enditalic)
</P>
<P>
   ``In Europe, it's an incomprehensible notion that religion would
have any bearing on politics,'' Marty said. ``They would never
subject their leaders to religious tests.''
</P>
<P>
   Europe is much more secular than the United States.
</P>
<P>
   American presidents and presidential candidates historically
have kept their personal beliefs closer to their hearts and rarely
discussed them openly, Marty said. Such talk was considered
impolite in public and limited to a sort of American civil religion
of ``God Bless America.''
</P>
<P>
   Religion became a serious campaign issue for the first time in
1960 when some Americans had concerns the Roman Catholic beliefs of
John F. Kennedy would mean the pope would run the White House.
Kennedy, who believed a president's religious views should be
private, was forced to talk about religion, Marty said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1976, Jimmy Carter brought up that he was a born-again
Christian, a familiar phrase among evangelicals and Southerners to
describe a conversion experience, but not as familiar outside those
circles. Later, Carter only used more general God talk, and faith
only rarely and indirectly came up in presidential talk. But
Americans are in a different place today, Marty said.
</P>
<P>
   Forty percent of Americans define themselves as evangelical, or
born-again, Christians. That number has grown in the past 30 years,
said Michael Lindsay, Gallup Organization consultant for theology,
religion and culture.
</P>
<P>
   Gallup defines an evangelical as a person meeting three
criteria: Believes the Bible is the actual word of God; experienced
a personal conversion; and seeks to lead non-Christians to
conversion. The Religious Right is a subgroup of evangelicals that
is more political and represents about 10 percent of evangelicals,
according to Gallup.
</P>
<P>
   Among Democrats, 46percent would identify themselves as
evangelical. It's 53percent for Republicans and 40 percent for
Independents. The identification goes beyond conservative
Republicans and crosses denominational lines.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates pay attention to these numbers, Lindsay said, and
after Bill Clinton's impeachment trial, Americans are more
interested in how the personal beliefs of a candidate would affect
his actions in office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most Americans see morality and religion tied together,''
Lindsay said. ``For example, 84 percent in this country say Jesus
Christ is God or the son of God. That's remarkable. If you compare
it with Great Britain, about 46percent believe in the divinity of
Christ. Hence, when someone says they have a personal relationship
with Jesus Christ, that does make a difference for a sizable number
of people. They are using the language of evangelicals.''
</P>
<P>
   So, when Bush said Jesus Christ was his favorite political
philosopher, a lot of Americans nodded.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are people who have kids wearing WWJD? armbands,''
Anderson said. ``They're not Christian Right, but they go to
church, are concerned about the direction of the country, and they
are a little more ambivalent about where society is going. Does
faith set well with them? Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore is Southern Baptist and is active at a church in Arlington,
Va. He grew up in a culture where such talk comes naturally. Bush
grew up Episcopalian and is now Methodist. He had a conversion
experience at a Billy Graham crusade.
</P>
<P>
   For those people who are not in the Jesus camp, these public
professions bring mixed reactions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love Jesus,'' says Ibrahim Hooper, spokesman for the
Washington, D.C.-based Council on American-Islamic Relations. ``We
would hope that a leader would have a firm moral base and that most
often means a spiritual base as well. We're not particularly
disturbed that someone would express their faith openly.''
</P>
<P>
   Art Paikowsky, executive vice president of the Jewish Federation
of Greater Phoenix, worries about the next step: How political
philosophies tied to Jesus will determine how the country is run.
</P>
<P>
   Though he is thrilled that Gore has picked an Orthodox Jew as a
running mate, Paikowsky said he believes personal religious beliefs
should be kept out of public conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good from many standpoints,'' he said of Joe Lieberman,
Gore's running mate, ``but it doesn't change my general point of
view that I hope candidates continue to be disciplined with regard
to introducing their faith into the electoral campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   People want to know that candidates have thought deeply about
faith issues, and they have the right to know how religious beliefs
will direct actions, said the Rev. Dr. C.Welton Gaddy, executive
director of the Interfaith Alliance. The national organization
represents 100,000 Protestants, Catholics, Muslims, Jews and 50
other faith traditions, and promotes the role of religion in public
life.
</P>
<P>
   But people also can be suspicious about the sincerity of such
statements, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you only use religious language when it is politically
profitable?'' he asked. ``If that is the case, are you being
religious or are you being political?''
</P>
<P>
   Bringing private religion into the public world has high risks
and could be in bad taste, Marty said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As more ample use of religion plays its part, they better
handle it with care,'' he said. ``They better know the risks, and
they better know they will be accused of hypocrisy, and they better
search their hearts. Religion is so easy to exploit. {hellip}
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, if you want to be president of all the people, you
have to watch things. I think we've had enough of the testifying.
Now, we have to see what they do with policies.''

   Until John F. Kennedy was elected president, the country was
pretty much run by Protestants, some of whom were religious
privately but not publicly. It was considered poor taste for
candidates to discuss their private religious beliefs openly but
these same candidates, once elected president, supported the
``American civil religion'' and sprinkled speeches with such
phrases as ``God bless America.''
</P>
<P>
   Harry S. cq stylebook cj Truman (1945-53, Democrat) - A Baptist
who hated public displays of piety. His personal letters to his
wife show he was religiously informed, biblical and godly.
</P>
<P>
   Dwight D. Eisenhower (1953-61, Republican) - Had not attended
church as an adult, but as the president, he joined the National
Presbyterian Church and was baptized. He authorized ``In God We
Trust'' on all money (the motto had been in use on some coins since
1908) and the addition of ``under God'' to the Pledge of
Allegiance. Also played golf on the National Day of Prayer.
</P>
<P>
   John F. Kennedy (1961-63, Democrat) - His Roman Catholic beliefs
stirred concerns he would show more allegiance to the pope than the
Constitution. His opponent, Richard M. Nixon, said Kennedy's
Catholicism wasn't a problem, and religion would only be an issue
if an agnostic or atheist ran for president.
</P>
<P>
   Lyndon B. Johnson (1963-69, Democra$)V5) filiated with the
Disciples of Christ; attended church at home and at the National
City Christian Church in Washington, D.C., although he sometimes
attended an Episcopalian church with his wife. He liked to quote
Scripture. cq stylebook cj
</P>
<P>
   Richard M. Nixon (1969-74, Republican) - He was raised in a
Quaker church but not much of his religious upbringing showed in
his adult life. In his speeches, he talked about America's faith in
its children, its weapons and in other things rather than about
America's faith in God.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald R. Ford (1974-77, Republican) - A churchgoing
Episcopalian who was selected by Congress to replace the resigning
Nixon because of his integrity and character. As a child, the rule
in his house was ``Tell the truth, work hard and come to dinner on
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Carter (1977-81, Democrat) - A Baptist, he was the first
who talked about his faith openly as a candidate and said he was
``born again,'' a code phrase in evangelical circles for describing
a conversion experience. After that, he used more generalized God
language in public. His beliefs influenced his foreign policy
decisions, and he taught Baptist Sunday school while in the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Reagan (1981-89, Republican) - He grew up in a Disciples
of Christ church in Illinois and was a member of Hollywood
Presbyterian Church as an adult. He was most aligned with
evangelicals politically but did not certify his religious
experiences with their language. He was respectful and reverent of
religion. He attended church the least of all presidents, saying it
was too much trouble for the Secret Service.
</P>
<P>
   George Bush (1989-93, Republican) - Brought up in an East Coast
Episcopal parish where the mainline Protestant culture nurtured
faith, but parishioners didn't talk too publicly about personal
beliefs. During his terms as vice president and as president, he
was a vestryman at St. Ann's Episcopal Church in Kennebunkport,
Maine. He is active at his Episcopal Church in Texas.

<P>
   Bill Clinton (1993 to present, Democrat) - A Southern Baptist
who knows the Bible well and can readily quote Scripture. He
attends a Methodist church in Washington, D.C. He has received the
most support and the most criticism from religious leaders. He used
the occasion of a September 1998 interfaith prayer breakfast at the
White House to apologize to the country for the Monica Lewinsky
scandal, but he has not talked much about the details of his
personal faith.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ A team of Norwegian divers managed to open the damaged
outer hatch of the sunken Russian submarine Kursk early Monday and
found the escape chamber was flooded but found no sign that any of
the crew members were alive.
</P>
<P>
   First reports from the rescue site in the Barents Sea indicated
that officials had not yet decided how to open the inner hatch
below that provides access to the submarine.
</P>
<P>
   Having found no signs of life more than a week after the Russian
submarine Kursk plunged to the bottom of the Barents Sea, rescue
teams had been preparing a plan to use a ship's crane to rip a
hatch off the giant vessel and begin the grim task of recovering
bodies and a lengthy and dangerous mission to salvage the
submarine's twin nuclear reactors.
</P>
<P>
   In their first full day of work on Sunday, a team of Norwegian
divers working with the Russians found the rear escape hatch on the
490-foot vessel badly damaged, a Russian official said, and the
divers failed in repeated attempts to muscle it open by hand and
with powerful, special tools.
</P>
<P>
   The divers reported that hatchway valves had been opened from
the inside, leading Russian officials to conclude that the body of
one of the submarine's 118 crew members was in the flooded air lock
chamber.
</P>
<P>
   During the weekend, Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov and Vice
Adm. Mikhail Motsak, chief of staff of Russia's Northern Fleet,
indicated that one or more members of the Kursk crew may have tried
to make a desperate escape from the submarine, only to perish when
seawater under great pressure rushed in.
</P>
<P>
   In a day of frenetic work at a depth of more than 300 feet, the
Norwegian navy team on Sunday sent back vivid pictures of the
escape hatch that had defied nearly a week of efforts to open it.
The divers pounded with hammers on the hull hoping that their
soundings would locate any remaining air pockets inside.
</P>
<P>
   As they worked in teams of three in six-hour shifts, the divers
sent up requests for special tools to turn the hatch valves, and
some tools were fabricated on board the Norwegian vessel.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, two Norwegian divers flew by helicopter to the
Russian submarine base at Vidyayevo, the Kursk's home port, to
practice opening and entering hatches on one of the Kursk's sister
ships.
</P>
<P>
   Planning was under way to rip the Kursk's hatch cover off by
force, according to Klebanov.
</P>
<P>
   ``The joint commission made a decision to open the top hatch of
the rescue lock chamber,'' he said, referring to the escape chamber
that passes through the hull, with inner and outer hatches that
allow emergency exit from the submarine. ``Unfortunately, they
failed to open it for several hours though very powerful tools have
been used.''
</P>
<P>
   They succeeded Monday where they failed Saturday.Russian
officials reported that air pockets might still exist in the
compartment below the inner hatch, but they expressed no
expectations that any survivors would be found, though a Norwegian
military spokesman in Oslo, Kjell Grandhagen, said, ``We are still
working on the theory that we are looking for possible survivors.''
The apparent cooperative spirit among Russian, British and
Norwegian rescue crews was somewhat undermined Sunday night when
the spokesman for the Norwegian armed forces, speaking in Oslo,
contradicted Klebanov's statements that the escape hatch was too
severely damaged to be opened manually, or with the British LR5
rescue submarine that arrived on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not drawn the conclusion that the hatch is so damaged
that it cannot be opened,'' the spokesman, John Epsen Lien, told
Reuters. ``We think it should be possible to open it with a British
or Russian rescue capsule.''
</P>
<P>
   The British minisubmarine began diving toward the Kursk at about
7 a.m. Monday. Earlier, Klebanov had said that video images of the
hatch showed a serious crack in the donut-shaped ring around it
that is used to create an airtight seal.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is why we think the British sub will not be able to
dock,'' Klebanov said, adding that he believed that the Norwegian
divers would agree to enter the Kursk after studying the entryway
on one of the Kursk's sister ships.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their commander is now asking them who will go and it is
already clear that someone will go,'' Klebanov said.
``Psychologically, it is very difficult but there is assuredness
that several people will agree and the operation will continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Norwegian officials have yet to confirm that their divers will
enter the Kursk.
</P>
<P>
   What lies ahead after the hatch is opened is a complex and
dangerous investigation of the Kursk's nine compartments. Dangerous
battery acids, unexploded weapons and highly radioactive fuel
elements in the Kursk's twin reactors could pose a serious danger
to the recovery operation.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials have speculated about plans to lift the rear
section of the submarine with surface ships and drag the vessel to
shallower water for easier access by salvage divers. With winter
already approaching in the Arctic region, it seemed possible that
the salvage operation could carry over to next spring, but Russian
officials have as yet given no definite accounting of their plans.
</P>
<P>
   As the Norwegian divers worked Sunday, Russian President
Vladimir Putin met in Moscow with senior clergymen of the Russian
Orthodox Church and expressed the powerlessness he felt over the
loss of the 118-member crew.
</P>
<P>
   The attack submarine went down Aug. 12 during military
maneuvers. Two explosions apparently ripped through the hull of the
submarine as it was running at periscope depth, and sent it
crashing to the seabed.
</P>
<P>
   ``With sorrow in our hearts and, I do not exaggerate, tears in
our eyes, we are following all that is happening in the Barents
Sea,'' he said. ``The sailors are doing everything they can to save
their comrades, but, alas, sometimes events _ and not us _ dictate
the logic of how a situation develops.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he added, ``until the last minute we will do all that can
be done to save whomever can be saved. We will struggle for the
lives of each of our sailors, and hope for the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Putin remained at the Kremlin Sunday, despite calls for
him to travel to Severomorsk, the naval headquarters near the scene
of the disaster, the Russian president held a long conversation
with Igor Spassky, Russia's leading submarine designer.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's public remarks, delivered in an unusually somber and
deliberate tone as he stood in front of the golden brocade walls of
one of the churches inside the Kremlin walls, appeared in part to
be in response to a swell of criticism that the Russian military,
and Putin personally, were too slow to seek foreign assistance in
the rescue operation.
</P>
<P>
   An investigating commission, headed by Klebanov, announced on
Saturday that preliminary findings showed that the Kursk was
involved in a collision with an object near the surface weighing
8,000 tons or more. He said it was possible that the object was a
ship or an old mine.
</P>
<P>
   Or, Klebanov said, some unknown chain of events could have
triggered a massive internal explosion aboard the submarine.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Russian officials say most of the crew died in the
first two minutes after the explosion, including all officers on
the bridge. They say that the pressure of seawater rushing in
compressed the air in the hull and reduced the chances for survival
beyond a few days.

   George W. Bush speaks of a Jesus who changed his heart. He calls
Jesus his favorite political philosopher.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore makes decisions by asking ``What would Jesus do?'' - a
phrase from the WWJD? bracelets made popular by Christian teens.
</P>
<P>
   The two major presidential candidates are campaigning with Jesus
on their lips more often and more publicly than candidates in
previous elections. Even though America is more religiously
diverse, Christian overtones are more pervasive and more sustained
among the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen a campaign where some pretty amazing things have
been said - at Salvation Army events, at NAACP events, in a
national debate. I think we can say with virtual certainty that it
will come up again. That will be different,'' said longtime
political analyst Kerby Anderson, president of Probe, a
conservative Christian think tank in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   This shift is driven by polls that show a more public faith
plays well with voters who believe in God themselves and who are
concerned with the morality and personal life of the next
president, Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   Martin E. Marty, historian, theologian and expert on American
religion, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ninety percent of the American people believe somehow in some
sort of God, and over 80 percent check in on a biblical God. If you
add Islam, clearly four out of five Americans would line up with
God,'' said Marty.
</P>
<P>
   He directed the Public Religion Project at the University of
Chicago and is author of (beginitalic)Politics, Religion and the
Common Good.(enditalic)
</P>
<P>
   ``In Europe, it's an incomprehensible notion that religion would
have any bearing on politics,'' Marty said. ``They would never
subject their leaders to religious tests.''
</P>
<P>
   Europe is much more secular than the United States.
</P>
<P>
   American presidents and presidential candidates historically
have kept their personal beliefs closer to their hearts and rarely
discussed them openly, Marty said. Such talk was considered
impolite in public and limited to a sort of American civil religion
of ``God Bless America.''
</P>
<P>
   Religion became a serious campaign issue for the first time in
1960 when some Americans had concerns the Roman Catholic beliefs of
John F. Kennedy would mean the pope would run the White House.
Kennedy, who believed a president's religious views should be
private, was forced to talk about religion, Marty said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1976, Jimmy Carter brought up that he was a born-again
Christian, a familiar phrase among evangelicals and Southerners to
describe a conversion experience, but not as familiar outside those
circles. Later, Carter only used more general God talk, and faith
only rarely and indirectly came up in presidential talk. But
Americans are in a different place today, Marty said.
</P>
<P>
   Forty percent of Americans define themselves as evangelical, or
born-again, Christians. That number has grown in the past 30 years,
said Michael Lindsay, Gallup Organization consultant for theology,
religion and culture.
</P>
<P>
   Gallup defines an evangelical as a person meeting three
criteria: Believes the Bible is the actual word of God; experienced
a personal conversion; and seeks to lead non-Christians to
conversion. The Religious Right is a subgroup of evangelicals that
is more political and represents about 10 percent of evangelicals,
according to Gallup.
</P>
<P>
   Among Democrats, 46percent would identify themselves as
evangelical. It's 53percent for Republicans and 40 percent for
Independents. The identification goes beyond conservative
Republicans and crosses denominational lines.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates pay attention to these numbers, Lindsay said, and
after Bill Clinton's impeachment trial, Americans are more
interested in how the personal beliefs of a candidate would affect
his actions in office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most Americans see morality and religion tied together,''
Lindsay said. ``For example, 84 percent in this country say Jesus
Christ is God or the son of God. That's remarkable. If you compare
it with Great Britain, about 46percent believe in the divinity of
Christ. Hence, when someone says they have a personal relationship
with Jesus Christ, that does make a difference for a sizable number
of people. They are using the language of evangelicals.''
</P>
<P>
   So, when Bush said Jesus Christ was his favorite political
philosopher, a lot of Americans nodded.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are people who have kids wearing WWJD? armbands,''
Anderson said. ``They're not Christian Right, but they go to
church, are concerned about the direction of the country, and they
are a little more ambivalent about where society is going. Does
faith set well with them? Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore is Southern Baptist and is active at a church in Arlington,
Va. He grew up in a culture where such talk comes naturally. Bush
grew up Episcopalian and is now Methodist. He had a conversion
experience at a Billy Graham crusade.
</P>
<P>
   For those people who are not in the Jesus camp, these public
professions bring mixed reactions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love Jesus,'' says Ibrahim Hooper, spokesman for the
Washington, D.C.-based Council on American-Islamic Relations. ``We
would hope that a leader would have a firm moral base and that most
often means a spiritual base as well. We're not particularly
disturbed that someone would express their faith openly.''
</P>
<P>
   Art Paikowsky, executive vice president of the Jewish Federation
of Greater Phoenix, worries about the next step: How political
philosophies tied to Jesus will determine how the country is run.
</P>
<P>
   Though he is thrilled that Gore has picked an Orthodox Jew as a
running mate, Paikowsky said he believes personal religious beliefs
should be kept out of public conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good from many standpoints,'' he said of Joe Lieberman,
Gore's running mate, ``but it doesn't change my general point of
view that I hope candidates continue to be disciplined with regard
to introducing their faith into the electoral campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   People want to know that candidates have thought deeply about
faith issues, and they have the right to know how religious beliefs
will direct actions, said the Rev. Dr. C.Welton Gaddy, executive
director of the Interfaith Alliance. The national organization
represents 100,000 Protestants, Catholics, Muslims, Jews and 50
other faith traditions, and promotes the role of religion in public
life.
</P>
<P>
   But people also can be suspicious about the sincerity of such
statements, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you only use religious language when it is politically
profitable?'' he asked. ``If that is the case, are you being
religious or are you being political?''
</P>
<P>
   Bringing private religion into the public world has high risks
and could be in bad taste, Marty said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As more ample use of religion plays its part, they better
handle it with care,'' he said. ``They better know the risks, and
they better know they will be accused of hypocrisy, and they better
search their hearts. Religion is so easy to exploit. {hellip}
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, if you want to be president of all the people, you
have to watch things. I think we've had enough of the testifying.
Now, we have to see what they do with policies.''

   Jesus and the presidency
</P>
<P>
   Until John F. Kennedy was elected president, the country was
pretty much run by Protestants, some of whom were religious
privately but not publicly. It was considered poor taste for
candidates to discuss their private religious beliefs openly but
these same candidates, once elected president, supported the
``American civil religion'' and sprinkled speeches with such
phrases as ``God bless America.''
</P>
<P>
   Harry S. cq stylebook cj Truman (1945-53, Democrat) - A Baptist
who hated public displays of piety. His personal letters to his
wife show he was religiously informed, biblical and godly.
</P>
<P>
   Dwight D. Eisenhower (1953-61, Republican) - Had not attended
church as an adult, but as the president, he joined the National
Presbyterian Church and was baptized. He authorized ``In God We
Trust'' on all money (the motto had been in use on some coins since
1908) and the addition of ``under God'' to the Pledge of
Allegiance. Also played golf on the National Day of Prayer.
</P>
<P>
   John F. Kennedy (1961-63, Democrat) - His Roman Catholic beliefs
stirred concerns he would show more allegiance to the pope than the
Constitution. His opponent, Richard M. Nixon, said Kennedy's
Catholicism wasn't a problem, and religion would only be an issue
if an agnostic or atheist ran for president.
</P>
<P>
   Lyndon B. Johnson (1963-69, Democrat) - Affiliated with the
Disciples of Christ; attended church at home and at the National
City Christian Church in Washington, D.C., although he sometimes
attended an Episcopalian church with his wife. He liked to quote
Scripture. cq stylebook cj
</P>
<P>
   Richard M. Nixon (1969-74, Republican) - He was raised in a
Quaker church but not much of his religious upbringing showed in
his adult life. In his speeches, he talked about America's faith in
its children, its weapons and in other things rather than about
America's faith in God.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald R. Ford (1974-77, Republican) - A churchgoing
Episcopalian who was selected by Congress to replace the resigning
Nixon because of his integrity and character. As a child, the rule
in his house was ``Tell the truth, work hard and come to dinner on
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Carter (1977-81, Democrat) - A Baptist, he was the first
who talked about his faith openly as a candidate and said he was
``born again,'' a code phrase in evangelical circles for describing
a conversion experience. After that, he used more generalized God
language in public. His beliefs influenced his foreign policy
decisions, and he taught Baptist Sunday school while in the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Reagan (1981-89, Republican) - He grew up in a Disciples
of Christ church in Illinois and was a member of Hollywood
Presbyterian Church as an adult. He was most aligned with
evangelicals politically but did not certify his religious
experiences with their language. He was respectful and reverent of
religion. He attended church the least of all presidents, saying it
was too much trouble for the Secret Service.
</P>
<P>
   George Bush (1989-93, Republican) - Brought up in an East Coast
Episcopal parish where the mainline Protestant culture nurtured
faith, but parishioners didn't talk too publicly about personal
beliefs. During his terms as vice president and as president, he
was a vestryman at St. Ann's Episcopal Church in Kennebunkport,
Maine. He is active at his Episcopal Church in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton (1993 to present, Democrat) - A Southern Baptist
who knows the Bible well and can readily quote Scripture. He
attends a Methodist church in Washington, D.C. He has received the
most support and the most criticism from religious leaders. He used
the occasion of a September 1998 interfaith prayer breakfast at the
White House to apologize to the country for the Monica Lewinsky
scandal, but he has not talked much about the details of his
personal faith.

<P>
   For the first time in their lives, 14 million members of
Generation Y get to vote this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Most won't.
</P>
<P>
   Election observers expect fewer than one-fourth of the
first-time-eligibles to be counted where it counts most, which is
at the polls.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, the year the voting age was lowered to 18, half of all
18- to 24-year-olds voted.
</P>
<P>
   To Jason Bellini, a 25-year-old Scottsdale Chaparral High School
in Scottsdale, Ariz., and Georgetown grad who currently works as a
correspondent for MTV's Choose or Lose election coverage, the
absentee youth vote will squander potential swing power in what
could be a close presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as 1992, young people were credited with helping
Bill Clinton find the White House.
</P>
<P>
   That year, the youth turnout was 43 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That year, the turnout among 65- to 74-year-olds was 70 percent.
The trend toward electorate shrinkage isn't limited to the young,
of course. In 1960, 63 percent of all eligible voters voted. In
1996, it was 49 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our generation could really be the jump ball in this
race,'' said Bellini, who spent last week at the Democratic
National Convention in Los Angeles and has been steadily
interviewing his demographic peers since the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the older edge of Gen Y and the younger edge of
Gen X won't be much of a factor this year, Bellini said, can't be
blamed on apathy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young people may answer a lot of our questions with, `I don't
know,' but we never hear them say `I don't care,''' he said. ``This
generation genuinely cares about the future of this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Fact: Young adults volunteer for civic and charity causes in
record numbers, making the conspicuous absence of under-30 voters -
a full one-fourth of the electorate - all the more vexing.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe even inexplicable. Still, we'll try.
</P>
<P>
   As an outreach effort, the following freewheeling youth-vote
discussion employs lots of assertive and edgy boldface type - a
typographical flourish with proven youth appeal.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, young people today say that comparing them to the
class of 1972 isn't quite fair.
</P>
<P>
   They had Nixon, the draft, widespread social unrest and
(beginitalic)Brandy (You're a Fine Girl) (enditalic)by Looking
Glass.
</P>
<P>
   Kids today have, what? That Napster deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politics isn't the life-and-death matter it was during the
Vietnam War,'' Bellini said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Well then, perhaps young people can't relate to hot-button
``issues'' of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Bellini has found that his peers can generate personal
passion over many of the issues that drive the presidential scrum,
including health care, abortion, education and gun control.
</P>
<P>
   Even Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Retirement planning would seem to be the furthest thing from a
20-year-old mind, but Nathan Sproul, executive director of the
Arizona Republican Party, said that George W. Bush's Social
Security plan - by which some contributions are freed up for
private investment - seems to be getting some traction with
Generation Dude.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young voters today know what a 401(k) plan is. They're
investing in the stock market,'' said Sproul, 28. ``There's a
different level of consciousness. This is the information age.''
</P>
<P>
   Alison Byrne Fields, creative director and chief strategist for
the non-profit Rock the Vote (which encourages voter registration),
said Gens Y and X have come of age in an era of unprecedented
prosperity but also face the burdensome future of unprecedented
college loan debt.
</P>
<P>
   Many young people already have worked a lifetime's worth of
dead-end service jobs and may be dealing with the psychological
trauma of living up to what Byrne Fields (CQ: {ndash} PREFERS BOTH
LAST NAME) describes as ``the myth of the dot-com millionaire at
24.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in their lives, otherwise lived at the
commercial heart of our popular culture, young people are not the
entire focus of every marketer's attention, and they're miffed
about being ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Since the primaries, Rock the Vote had been advocating a
youth-centric debate between the presidential candidates, which
``would be an incredible first step in improving dialog,'' said
Byrne Fields, 30. Such an event seems ``not incredibly likely''
during the current campaign, though Al Gore last week agreed to
participate in an MTV ``town hall'' gabfest.
</P>
<P>
   Fine. To really weigh the campaigns' commitment to youth,
however, follow their money. Specifically, follow the television
advertising dollars, which for this campaign season will flow
primarily to networks that skew 35-plus or older, such as CBS and
CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Gealy, president of Acme Communications, which owns 10
youth-appeal network affiliates around the country - nine WB and
one UPN - would prefer it not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our stations skew 18 to 34,'' he said. ``But the campaigns
over advertise to the 50-plus audience and are totally missing the
younger demographics.''
</P>
<P>
   A demographic, it should be added for irony's sake, that defines
the term ``undecided.'' And, presumably, open to the power of
focused marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Half of the people we talk to won't commit to being a Democrat
or Republican,'' Bellini said. ``They don't want to be
categorized.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Besides, young voters aren't really being ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Though political coverage in the mainstream media may chill
younger news consumers, there's a wealth of resources available to
the demographic most likely to consume such digital data. A couple
of content-rich www-dots that cater exclusively to youngish
would-be voters include www.rockthevote.com and the Choose or Lose
subsite of www.mtv.com.
</P>
<P>
   A Rock the Vote bus, touring the country mixing politics and pop
music, is scheduled to visit Arizona State University on Aug. 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to make this stuff seem kind of fun,'' Byrne Fields
said.
</P>
<P>
   At the local level, the Arizona Secretary of State staffs a
special voter-outreach office that concentrates on wooing young
voters. One tactic: greeting cards, mailed to citizens turning 18,
reminding them that it's time to register. Another: public-service
radio announcements, some of which have run during Howard Stern's
brazen morning show.
</P>
<P>
   Young people haven't been indoctrinated in the ritual of voting.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the Arizona-born Kids Voting program has been
hand-holding today's 18-year-olds for more than a decade. Many
current first-time voters have been exposed to the voting process
through the program, which now encourages kids in 39 states to
visit polling places with their parents.
</P>
<P>
   No Arizona figures are available, but a Kansas study showed that
Kids Voting alums showed a slightly higher propensity to actually
vote once they turned 18 than their peers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Young people may be confused about or intimidated by the simple
mechanics of voting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of questions we get on the Rock the Vote Web site
have to do with process,'' Byrne Fields said. ```How do I go about
registering to vote? How do I get an absentee ballot?' During the
primaries, we were getting phone calls saying, `I want to vote
today, but I didn't register. What do I do?'''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Young people lack charismatic peer-group role models.
</P>
<P>
   They haven't met Lawrence Robinson, a recent graduate of Corona
del Sol High School and, at 19, the youngest Arizona delegate at
last week's Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson will attend Claremont McKenna College in California
this fall, but he departed for LA having done plenty of
interpersonal politicking.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of my friends are registered,'' he said with a laugh,
adding that most of them are registered Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   On a grander scale, the political parties have offered
26-year-old Karenna Gore Schiff and 24-year-old George P. Bush as
ticket touts.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, there is the Rock.
</P>
<P>
   Did any other fortysomething observer wonder, while watching the
Rock make his political debut, how we might've reacted had
Republican strategists offered Baron von Raschke as their youth
ambassador in 1972?
</P>
<P>
   Young people, distracted by rampant consumerism and whatnot,
don't care, period. Plus they're convinced that their one vote
doesn't count for much.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, they volunteer with gusto.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you work for Habitat for Humanity, you see the house being
built,'' Robinson explained.
</P>
<P>
   Added Bellini, ``(Young people) use their energy and optimism
where it will be most effective. For whatever reason, people in our
generation, in large numbers, don't feel that voting is going to
accomplish much.''
</P>
<P>
   There's still time. The registration deadline for the Nov. 7
election is Oct. 9.

voters. One tactic: greeting cards, mailed to citizens turning 18,
reminding them that it's time to register. Another: public-service
radio announcements, some of which have run during Howard Stern's
brazen morning show.
</P>
<P>
   Young people haven't been indoctrinated in the ritual of voting.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the Arizona-born Kids Voting program has been
hand-holding today's 18-year-olds for more than a decade. Many
current first-time voters have been exposed to the voting process
through the program, which now encourages kids in 39 states to
visit polling places with their parents.
</P>
<P>
   No Arizona figures are available, but a Kansas study showed that
Kids Voting alums showed a slightly higher propensity to actually
vote once they turned 18 than their peers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Young people may be confused about or intimidated by the simple
mechanics of voting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of questions we get on the Rock the Vote Web site
have to do with process,'' Byrne Fields said. ```How do I go about
registering to vote? How do I get an absentee ballot?' During the
primaries, we were getting phone calls saying, `I want to vote
today, but I didn't register. What do I do?'''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Young people lack charismatic peer-group role models.
</P>
<P>
   They haven't met Lawrence Robinson, a recent graduate of Corona
del Sol High School and, at 19, the youngest Arizona delegate at
last week's Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson will attend Claremont McKenna College in California
this fall, but he departed for LA having done plenty of
interpersonal politicking.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of my friends are registered,'' he said with a laugh,
adding that most of them are registered Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   On a grander scale, the political parties have offered
26-year-old Karenna Gore Schiff and 24-year-old George P. Bush as
ticket touts.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, there is the Rock.
</P>
<P>
   Did any other fortysomething observer wonder, while watching the
Rock make his political debut, how we might've reacted had
Republican strategists offered Baron von Raschke as their youth
ambassador in 1972?
</P>
<P>
   Young people, distracted by rampant consumerism and whatnot,
don't care, period. Plus they're convinced that their one vote
doesn't count for much.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, they volunteer with gusto.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you work for Habitat for Humanity, you see the house being
built,'' Robinson explained.
</P>
<P>
   Added Bellini, ``(Young people) use their energy and optimism
where it will be most effective. For whatever reason, people in our
generation, in large numbers, don't feel that voting is going to
accomplish much.''
</P>
<P>
   There's still time. The registration deadline for the Nov. 7
election is Oct. 9.

 &HT;    GIRL WITH AIDS TO HEARING(a) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    By KARINA BLAND(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stephanie Ray, a 14-year-old fugitive from Wisconsin foster care
who has AIDS, won't be getting on a plane this morning as ordered
by the Waukesha County Juvenile Court last week.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, this afternoon, she'll go before presiding Judge
Maurice Portley of Maricopa County Juvenile Court, who has agreed
to hear an emergency petition asking that Stephanie be allowed to
live with her aunt in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   The petition was filed on behalf of Stephanie by a Gilbert
lawyer who heard of the girl's efforts to stay in Phoenix on a talk
radio show Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Shick, 32, is a 1999 law school graduate who admits
having little experience with custody law. She called Portley at
home on Saturday and pleaded for the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie, a nationally known advocate for people with AIDS, has
been staying at her aunt's house since last Sunday, when she was
supposed to return to foster care. She refused to go, saying she
wants to live with family here, where she has been vacationing for
two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie said Saturday that the hearing gives her hope that she
may not have to go back to what she has described as a chaotic life
in foster care, waiting for her father to do what the court has
ordered, including getting sober, to get her back.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie, who lived in Glendale for four years until she was
almost 12, was born with acquired immune deficiency syndrome. She
was expected to live only a few years.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother died of an AIDS-related illness when Stephanie was 5.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Stephanie was taken from her father in Wisconsin
because of neglect and possible abuse, according to police records
there.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, a judge ordered Stephanie back to Wisconsin by
today.
</P>
<P>
   If she was not back on time, Judge Ralph Ramirez said sheriff's
deputies in Arizona would pick her up at her aunt's house and put
her on a plane.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie's aunt, Cathy Stelter, is nervous. If the Arizona
judge denies the petition that would allow her to stay, Stephanie
will be in violation of Ramirez's order to be back in Wisconsin by
5 p.m. (3 p.m. Arizona time).
</P>
<P>
   Stelter has told her niece that she will back any decision she
makes, but that if she keeps Stephanie from returning to Wisconsin,
she could be criminally charged with custodial interference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so nervous,'' Stelter said Saturday, ``I think I'm going
to throw up.''
</P>
<P>
   Shick works for Wilson Law Offices in Gilbert, where a defense
fund has been set up for Stephanie.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie's flight was scheduled to leave Phoenix just before
9:30 a.m. today.

<P>
   POLAND-COMMUNIST-PAST (Warsaw) _ In an interview, the former
head of the Polish secret services talks about the continuing

loggers are being trained to answer phones for support-services

   NUCLEAR-SPY (Albuquerque) _ Of all the unusual aspects of what

turned off by today's bland offering of applications on mobile
devices with tiny screens, more than two dozen New York wireless
Internet companies have been spawned within what has become a
Darwinian environment for firms solely focused on the Web. New York
is emerging as the nation's center for wireless Internet

   VIDEOGAMES-SHAKEOUT (San Francisco) _ Despite falling revenue
and earnings at Electronic Arts, the world's largest independent
videogame company, the mood at the company's Silicon Valley
corporate headquarters is one of great optimism. Part of the reason
is that executives believe they have emerged relatively unscathed
from a cyclical, and expected, downturn as the industry is moving
to a new generation of consoles. At the same time, executives
assert they have made key investments they say will take the
company to new levels of prominence. Whether they have succeeded

and it refers to advertisers' attempts to capitalize on a

   Subjective selection process produces best six gymnasts
</P>
<P>
   By JOHN P. LOPEZ
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   You could call it unfair. You could even call it blatantly
unfair.
</P>
<P>
   But the difference between now and then _ the difference between
committing a crime against the American way and putting together
the best American women's gymnastics team for Sydney, is that this
time everyone knew it would be unfair.
</P>
<P>
   Unfair was in the rules.
</P>
<P>
   Although we don't care to get into the specifics of how the 2000
women's gymnastics Olympic selection process was worded, it went
something like this: Try hard, score high, and we'll tell you if
you make the Olympic team as soon as Bela Karolyi lets us know.
</P>
<P>
   These were trials that ended like so many before, which is to
say with tribulations.
</P>
<P>
   There were tears, heartbreak and so many what-ifs. There were
two days of strained nerves, terrific performances and unfathomable
pressure. There were guts, glory and anguish.
</P>
<P>
   Then, USA Gymnastics president Bob Colarossi walked into a room
underneath the stands at Boston's FleetCenter and read a list of
the Subjective Six, which are not to be confused with the
Magnificent Seven.
</P>
<P>
   Elise Ray, Amy Chow, Kristen Maloney, Morgan White, Jamie
Dantzscher and Dominique Dawes, with Alyssa Beckerman named the
alternate.
</P>
<P>
   There was no Shannon Miller-Phillips, the seven-time medalist
with a bum knee. There was no Vanessa Atler, the one dubbed a year
ago as Miller's successor, and who actually scored higher than two
of those who made the list.
</P>
<P>
   It certainly was no tea party telling so many talented young
women that all those hours, days, months and years of bouncing
through gyms were all for naught.
</P>
<P>
   And certainly, with Atler scoring in the top six but being left
off the team, the decision smacked of the craziness that happened
in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Kim Kelly scored high enough to make the team at the
trials but wound up being bumped from the team when USA Gymnastics
officials called for a special ``training camp,'' which was their
way of saying they wanted the previously injured Betty Okino on the
team instead.
</P>
<P>
   That was unfair. This was not.
</P>
<P>
   This was how Karolyi, Houston's maker of champions, has wanted
to conduct an Olympic trials all along.
</P>
<P>
   This time it was in the rules, and frankly, this will be the
best team USA Gymnastics could take to Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike swimming, where the first two athletes to hit the wall
are Olympians _ period _ gymnastics is a sport in which reputation
and style figure as much into medal chances as physical ability.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike track, in which the clock is the only gauge, this is a
sport in which will is tested as much as ability, and judging can
be influenced by political alliances.
</P>
<P>
   It was also at the 1992 trials when former U.S. star Hilary
Grivich fell victim to obviously shady scoring from judges,
finishing eighth by less than a 10th of a point and getting left
off the team.
</P>
<P>
   That was unfair. This was not.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the only chalk you've ever rubbed between your hands has
been in a pool hall, and you couldn't tell a Salchow from a
Yurchenko if your life depended on it, you probably know that no
sport offers pressure like that which comes from teetering on a
four-inch beam with a billion people watching.
</P>
<P>
   It was will and determination Karolyi was watching as much as
the scoreboard this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Atler and others broke when the pressure kept mounting; Dawes,
the three-time Olympic veteran, and Chow, the repeat Olympian,
never wavered. Ray was consistent. Maloney was her usual consistent
self.
</P>
<P>
   And Dantzscher and White, both of whom were considered long
shots by many except for Karolyi, who raved all week about seeing a
certain confidence in their performances, proved him right by
scoring in the top five.
</P>
<P>
   This will be a strong U.S. team headed to Sydney, so much
stronger and better than the one that finished a dismal sixth at
the 1999 world championships. This is a team that again stands a
good chance of earning a medal.
</P>
<P>
   The Subjective Six.
</P>
<P>
   It was heartbreaking to see Atler's face when the announcement
came Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
   It was sad to watch Miller-Phillips cry when she realized that
not even her fame could overcome a knee injury and inconsistent
performances.
</P>
<P>
   It was too bad the great Dominique Moceanu never had a chance
because of a bone chip in her knee.
</P>
<P>
   It would be impossible trying to console those who came with
Olympic dreams, only to see them quashed by a slip or two, an
ill-timed injury or a nervous bobble.
</P>
<P>
   It was sad watching those who barely missed, like it always is
sad.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't unfair.

INVENTORY SOUGHT FOR CITY`S ART
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ALEXA HAUSSLER 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Little-known fact 1: The city of Los Angeles owns
a multimillion-dollar art collection, with thousands of unique
pieces from oil paintings to bronze busts.
</P>
<P>
   Little known fact 2: Many of the more than 2,000 works of art
are stored in a warehouse with no climate control.
</P>
<P>
   Little known fact 3: Hundreds of works are missing.
</P>
<P>
   Now, city leaders are calling for an inventory of the collection
and a review of how it is handled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does not seem relevant to me for the city to own art that
is being locked up in a warehouse somewhere, not being seen, not
being appreciated,'' said City Councilwoman Laura Chick, a leading
displayer of the city's art collection in her council offices as
well as a member of the council's Government Efficiency Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The collection has been amassed during more than 100 years, said
Roella Louie, director of grants, public art and planning for the
city's Cultural Affairs Department. It includes gifts presented to
the city's mayors and other city officials over the years, other
donated pieces, and works of sculpture purchased for public
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows how much the collection is worth, or even where all
of it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't even venture a guess,'' Louie said.
</P>
<P>
   Graduate students from local universities are trying to
inventory and track down the city's art collection, including
researching the background of the pieces, Louie said. But she said
it is a time-consuming project and they can catalog only about 10
to 15 piece a year.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, some of the pieces are scattered throughout the
city in various municipal buildings and offices. An abstract bronze
sculpture in a fountain at the DWP. Oil paintings of past mayors.
Musical instruments at the Watts Tower.
</P>
<P>
   Chick has several pieces in her City Hall office and displays
posters at her district office in Reseda.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am putting the city's art to good public use, and I want to
know that all of it is being used that way. If we own art, then I
want to see that it's put to its maximum and best use,'' Chick
said.
</P>
<P>
   The pieces of the massive collection that are not on display,
however, sit in a dark downtown warehouse borrowed from the
Department of Water and Power.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an ideal storage space, but it's the only space we
could get,'' Louie said. ``It's not museum quality - temperature,
light and dust-controlled.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the city began renovating the historic City Hall, the
collection was in a room, ``just thrown in, stuffed in like
somebody's closet,'' Louie said. Since the renovation, which
started about two years ago, the works have been stored in the
warehouse space.
</P>
<P>
   Art museums take pains to make sure the works of art are in
controlled and stable environment. Fluctuating humidity and
temperature, bugs or a leaking roof can destroy irreplaceable
artwork, said Victoria Blyth-Hill, director of conservation for the
Los Angeles County Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   ``Art ages just as everything else does and if you don't control
the environment, then you accelerate that aging process and at some
point it can become an irreversible process,'' she said. ``The
damage can be so extreme that there is really nothing that one can
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Jon Coupal, president of the statewide Howard Jarvis Taxpayers
Association, said while it is appropriate for a city to have a
municipal art museum, the Los Angeles art collection sounds like
``a case of bad asset management.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They need to make the decision whether or not these works are
going to be collected or displayed and, if not, they need to
liquidate them, if for no other reason than to make sure they are

<P>
   Subjective selection process produces best six gymnasts
</P>
<P>
   By JOHN P. LOPEZ
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   You could call it unfair. You could even call it blatantly
unfair.
</P>
<P>
   But the difference between now and then _ the difference between
committing a crime against the American way and putting together
the best American women's gymnastics team for Sydney, is that this
time everyone knew it would be unfair.
</P>
<P>
   Unfair was in the rules.
</P>
<P>
   Although we don't care to get into the specifics of how the 2000
women's gymnastics Olympic selection process was worded, it went
something like this: Try hard, score high, and we'll tell you if
you make the Olympic team as soon as Bela Karolyi lets us know.
</P>
<P>
   These were trials that ended like so many before, which is to
say with tribulations.
</P>
<P>
   There were tears, heartbreak and so many what-ifs. There were
two days of strained nerves, terrific performances and unfathomable
pressure. There were guts, glory and anguish.
</P>
<P>
   Then, USA Gymnastics president Bob Colarossi walked into a room
underneath the stands at Boston's FleetCenter and read a list of
the Subjective Six, which are not to be confused with the
Magnificent Seven.
</P>
<P>
   Elise Ray, Amy Chow, Kristen Maloney, Morgan White, Jamie
Dantzscher and Dominique Dawes, with Alyssa Beckerman named the
alternate.
</P>
<P>
   There was no Shannon Miller-Phillips, the seven-time medalist
with a bum knee. There was no Vanessa Atler, the one dubbed a year
ago as Miller's successor, and who actually scored higher than two
of those who made the list.
</P>
<P>
   It certainly was no tea party telling so many talented young
women that all those hours, days, months and years of bouncing
through gyms were all for naught.
</P>
<P>
   And certainly, with Atler scoring in the top six but being left
off the team, the decision smacked of the craziness that happened
in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Kim Kelly scored high enough to make the team at the
trials but wound up being bumped from the team when USA Gymnastics
officials called for a special ``training camp,'' which was their
way of saying they wanted the previously injured Betty Okino on the
team instead.
</P>
<P>
   That was unfair. This was not.
</P>
<P>
   This was how Karolyi, Houston's maker of champions, has wanted
to conduct an Olympic trials all along.
</P>
<P>
   This time it was in the rules, and frankly, this will be the
best team USA Gymnastics could take to Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike swimming, where the first two athletes to hit the wall
are Olympians _ period _ gymnastics is a sport in which reputation
and style figure as much into medal chances as physical ability.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike track, in which the clock is the only gauge, this is a
sport in which will is tested as much as ability, and judging can
be influenced by political alliances.
</P>
<P>
   It was also at the 1992 trials when former U.S. star Hilary
Grivich fell victim to obviously shady scoring from judges,
finishing eighth by less than a 10th of a point and getting left
off the team.
</P>
<P>
   That was unfair. This was not.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the only chalk you've ever rubbed between your hands has
been in a pool hall, and you couldn't tell a Salchow from a
Yurchenko if your life depended on it, you probably know that no
sport offers pressure like that which comes from teetering on a
four-inch beam with a billion people watching.
</P>
<P>
   It was will and determination Karolyi was watching as much as
the scoreboard this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Atler and others broke when the pressure kept mounting; Dawes,
the three-time Olympic veteran, and Chow, the repeat Olympian,
never wavered. Ray was consistent. Maloney was her usual consistent
self.
</P>
<P>
   And Dantzscher and White, both of whom were considered long
shots by many except for Karolyi, who raved all week about seeing a
certain confidence in their performances, proved him right by
scoring in the top five.
</P>
<P>
   This will be a strong U.S. team headed to Sydney, so much
stronger and better than the one that finished a dismal sixth at
the 1999 world championships. This is a team that again stands a
good chance of earning a medal.
</P>
<P>
   The Subjective Six.
</P>
<P>
   It was heartbreaking to see Atler's face when the announcement
came Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
   It was sad to watch Miller-Phillips cry when she realized that
not even her fame could overcome a knee injury and inconsistent
performances.
</P>
<P>
   It was too bad the great Dominique Moceanu never had a chance
because of a bone chip in her knee.
</P>
<P>
   It would be impossible trying to console those who came with
Olympic dreams, only to see them quashed by a slip or two, an
ill-timed injury or a nervous bobble.
</P>
<P>
   It was sad watching those who barely missed, like it always is
sad.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't unfair.
</P>

WOODS MUSCLES SPORT TO ANOTHER LEVEL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ Just when it seemed we had seen Tiger Woods'
prismatic golf game from every angle, we saw it Sunday in a
different light. The genius he exhibited in taking the U.S. and
British Open championships by a combined 23 strokes earlier this
summer was breathtaking, but not as stunning as the manner in which
Woods won his second consecutive PGA Championship crown and third
straight major.
</P>
<P>
   Woods was one stroke behind journeyman Bob May with two holes
remaining despite birdies on three of the first seven holes of
Valhalla Golf Club's back nine. He was playing well, but May was
having a day suitable for framing in the Smithsonian.
</P>
<P>
   Woods didn't get demoralized; he drew even with his playing
partner with birdies on the final two holes. That forced a
three-hole continuation of the high drama and ended with another
high-water mark in Woods' career. The 24-year-old beat May by one
stroke in the playoff to become the first golfer to win three
majors in a single year since Ben Hogan in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   It's fitting that Woods cinched another piece of history on a
Valhalla course that had none to speak of before Sunday. Because
with every swing he takes the multiracial superstar is separating
himself from the game as it was played by Ben Hogan at Oakland
Hills and Sam Snead at Oakmont Country Club and Jack Nicklaus at
Congressional.
</P>
<P>
   Woods is as distinctly different from golf's old guard as
Valhalla is from any of the venerable pre-World War II courses that
previously have hosted the PGA Championship.
</P>
<P>
   He is not about pastel sweaters and exclusionary policies and
well-stocked 19th holes. He has taken golf out of the boardrooms
and the bars and plunked it down in places that were not considered
hospitable to birdies or eagles.
</P>
<P>
   We're not speaking simply of minority households in Compton or
Cypress, where Woods was reared. Much has been made of how Woods,
who is of African-American and Thai descent, has given the game
more color. Less acknowledged is how he also has given the game
considerably more muscle.
</P>
<P>
   To focus on his skin pigmentation is to fail to notice the
6-foot-2 frame carved like an ice sculpture. Woods wasn't as brawny
when he turned pro in August of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In the past four years he has worked feverishly to fill out his
frame with 20 pounds of muscle. In doing so, he has added length
off the tee and stamina and sent his rivals scrambling for personal
trainers.
</P>
<P>
   Scotsman Colin Montgomerie, whom golf announcer David Feherty
once dubbed ``Mrs. Doubtfire'' in an allusion to his doughy body,
recently became the latest player to follow Woods down the path to
six-pack abs.
</P>
<P>
   After finishing 14 strokes behind Woods at the British Open,
Montgomerie hired a personal trainer. ``When Michael Jordan started
playing basketball, people had to improve to compete with him,''
said Montgomerie, who finished tied for 39th here. ``When Carl
Lewis started running very, very fast, people had to improve to
stay with him. When Pele played (soccer), people had to improve to
play with him. Muhammad Ali was the same. I believe Tiger is from
this town.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the world's best athlete playing our game. With all
due respect to the many, many major champions we have had, we have
never had that in golf before.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Watson, one of those major champions had to agree with
Montgomerie. ``You are seeing a phenomenon here,'' Watson said,
``that the game may never, ever see again.''
</P>
<P>
   The tendency is to talk about Woods as though he was fashioned
in a laboratory by his mad scientist father, Earl. As has been well
documented, Earl taught the only child of his second marriage how
to swing a golf club when Tiger was 10 months old. When Tiger was 1
year old, he learned how to putt. At 8, he was beating collegians.
</P>
<P>
   His father and mother, Kultida, may have raised Woods to be a
champion, but Woods was the one who made their influence matter.
Marv Marinovich was no less fastidious than Earl Woods in rearing
son Todd to be a superlative quarterback, and all of Southern
California has borne witness to how flawed that plan proved to be.
</P>
<P>
   Woods has become the exemplary athlete that Todd Marinovich did
not because he took his parents' blueprint and continues to this
day to build on it. He re-tooled his swing after winning the 1997
Masters by 12 strokes, thumbing his nose at the maxim that if it
isn't broke, don't fix it.
</P>
<P>
   This refusal to rest on his God-given gifts distinguishes Woods
as much as his power-red golf shirts, his licorice-like flexibility
and his 300-plus yard drives.
</P>
<P>
   He is driven by a compulsion greater than that impressed upon
him by either of his parents. Why else would he have prepared for
this tournament by watching videotape of every shot of the 1996 PGA
Championship, which also was held here? ``Woods wants to be the
best player that ever lived,'' Watson said. ``I think that pretty
much explains it.''
</P>
<P>
   That would certainly explain why Woods isn't merely No. 1 in the
world rankings, he also is easily in the top 3 in range hours
logged.
</P>
<P>
   Woods had a piece of the lead or the lead outright after each of
the first three rounds here, but that didn't cause him to become
complacent. He repaired to the range each night, defying darkness,
to refine a swing that already is picture perfect.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the praise heaped on Woods last week, perhaps none was
more weighty than Watson and Nicklaus saying they watch Woods
carefully to try to learn from his shots. That's like Mozart saying
he listened to Beethoven to learn more about music.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus wondered aloud why nobody rose to challenge Woods at
the U.S. and British Opens. That was before Nicklaus played his
first competitive round with Woods last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sort of understanding why we don't have anybody else
playing that well,'' Nicklaus said afterward. ``He is that much
better than everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Valhalla, a Nicklaus-designed course that opened in 1986, might
grow up to be one of the grand post-World War II courses. Woods,
meanwhile, is launching golf into the 21st century with all the
subtlety of a nuclear blast.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus noted Woods' prodigious length off the tee, his
exceptional course management, his tremendous touch around the
greens and concluded that Woods ``plays a game with which I'm not
familiar.''
</P>
<P>
   Golf insiders quivered in their soft spikes at the historical
significance of such a statement; years ago the celebrated amateur,
Bobby Jones, said the same thing of Nicklaus.
</P>
<P>
   Only time will tell if Woods will surpass Nicklaus' legacy. The
older Woods gets, the harder it will be for him to keep life's
myriad distractions at a distance.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens in the ensuing years, there can be no arguing
when the new golfing millennium started. The year 2000 will go down
as the start of a new period of prosperity and happiness for the
game. On the golf calendar, the year of the Tiger has been one
continuous celebration of greatness.

   Lima critical of Dierker in wake of Astros' loss to Brewers
</P>
<P>
   By JOSEPH DUARTE
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   Win and almost every problem _ no matter how big or small _
seems to magically disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Lose a game or two _ or 74 in the Astros' case _ and every
little word can spark internal controversy and disharmony.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Lima has never been speechless. On Sunday afternoon, he had
plenty to say, and most of it pointed toward manager Larry Dierker.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like everything I do here is wrong. Now I know who's
your friend and who's not your friend,'' Lima said following a 6-5
loss to the Milwaukee Brewers at Enron Field that snapped the
Astros' six-game winning streak. ``When things are not going your
way, they turn their back on you. I've seen that all year long.''
</P>
<P>
   Lima, who was visibly upset at being removed after only five
innings Sunday, accused Dierker of losing confidence in him.
</P>
<P>
   Fueling the situation during his postgame media session, Dierker
criticized Lima's lack of an inside pitch and failure to hold
runners.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same things we've talked about over and over and over
again,'' said Dierker. ``He's done some things from Day 1 of the
season. Some games he gets away with it; some games he doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
   With the scored tied at 5, the Brewers won the game when Henry
Blanco doubled in the go-ahead run off Jose Cabrera (2-3) with two
outs in the ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm real hurt right now, because I know I'm better, and I know
I deserve respect,'' said Lima. ``I feel there's no respect here .
. . like I'm just another guy. I don't have anything against
anybody here. I don't fight with anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   When told of Lima's comments, Dierker responded: ``He's stayed
in the rotation all year long. That's some measure of confidence.
All I can say, the record speaks for itself. I know he won 21 games
last year, but this is a long way from last year. We're almost to
September.''
</P>
<P>
   Lima struck out four of the first eight batters he faced before
allowing a run in the third inning. He escaped a bases-loaded jam
in the fourth but ran into trouble in the fifth when the Brewers
scored two runs, one coming on an error by second baseman Bill
Spiers.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker used a pinch hitter for Lima, who had thrown 102
pitches, in the bottom half of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just didn't look like he was getting ready to get
straightened out,'' Dierker said.
</P>
<P>
   Lima disagreed with Dierker's assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``When things are not going your way, they are not going your
way,'' Lima said. ``I pitched inside today and gave up some hits.
Do I have to pitch inside the whole time? It has nothing to do with
pitching inside or outside. Let them say what they want to say.''
</P>
<P>
   After falling behind 4-2, the Astros rallied to take a 5-4 lead
with three runs in the seventh inning on Tony Eusebio's two-run
single and Chris Truby's RBI double.
</P>
<P>
   But Milwaukee scored two runs in its final two at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   In the ninth, Charlie Hayes singled with one out off Wayne
Franklin, who was replaced by Cabrera. Rafael Belliard followed
with a grounder between first and second that hit Hayes in the
foot. Hayes was called out, and Belliard reached on a single.
</P>
<P>
   Blanco, who went 3-for-5, followed with a double to center field
to score Belliard with the go-ahead run. On the play, center
fielder Richard Hidalgo bobbled the ball momentarily before what
might have been a close play at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Coming into the game, Cabrera had two wins and had retired 12 of
13 batters, including six on Saturday, since being recalled from
Class AAA New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we would have been perfect in the field, we would have
won,'' Dierker said. ``But you can't play perfect defense every
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Curtis Leskanic (4-3) pitched two scoreless innings, striking
out two batters in the ninth for Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   The loss overshadowed Jeff Bagwell's 38th home run of the season
and ninth in the past 10 games for the Astros. Hidalgo added his
31st homer.

   Woods outduels May to repeat as PGA champion
</P>
<P>
   By EDDIE SEFKO
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ The man who made it look so easy so many times
showed Sunday that he can create history the old-fashioned way,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Hard work, hustle and a don't-fail-me-now putting stroke were
Tiger Woods' best allies in the final round of the PGA
Championship. And it was a good thing, because he needed every one
of them.
</P>
<P>
   Woods went 8 under par in a 13-hole stretch to nail down his
third major in a row and become the first back-to-back winner in
the PGA in 63 years as he prevailed in a three-hole playoff over
previously unheralded Bob May.
</P>
<P>
   It was a riveting head-to-head battle at Valhalla Golf Club. And
it looked for the longest time like Bob may. But in the end, Tiger
would.
</P>
<P>
   Woods found himself two shots behind after making two early
bogeys in his round. But starting with a birdie on the seventh and
ending with a 20-foot birdie putt on the first extra hole, Woods
did everything he needed to keep pace with May, who provided a
wonderful test.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a memorable battle,'' Woods said. ``I enjoyed it. And I
hope Bob did, too. It was a very special day to have two guys
playing at a level you don't see unless you have the concentration
heightened to where it was.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never backed off from one another. And that's as good as it
gets right there. We played one of the best duels in
major-championship history.''
</P>
<P>
   The win had everything _ elegant shot-making, clutch putts and a
worthy challenger. It even had a final-hole detour through
adventure, drama, cart paths, deep woods, bunker shots and gallery
members who ducked for cover, but not a single shot in the fairway
by either player.
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, Woods shot a final-round 67 for a 72-hole
total of 18-under 270 and had won his third consecutive major
championship. He and Ben Hogan, who did it in 1953, are the only
players to win three of the four modern majors in the same year.
Woods also ends the jinx of nobody repeating as PGA champ since
Denny Shute in 1936 and '37.
</P>
<P>
   Woods won with style. He birdied three holes in a row _ the
final two in regulation and the first one in the playoff _ then
held on against a game May.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I proved to a lot of people that I could handle the
heat,'' said May, who started the day one shot behind Woods and
shot 6-under 66 for the third day in a row. ``Believe it or not, I
don't feel disappointed. I think if you shoot three 66s in a major
championship, you should win. But playing with the best player in
the world, he proved that's not good enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played a good, solid round of golf. It just wasn't quite
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   It was plenty to push Woods to the brink. Standing on the 17th
tee, May had a one-stroke lead. It had long since become a
two-horse race.
</P>
<P>
   Woods smoked a drive; May left his in the rough. May proceeded
to make a solid par, but Woods stuffed his sand-wedge approach
inside of two feet for a tying birdie.
</P>
<P>
   Both hit the par-5 18th green in two shots. Woods was on the
right side of the green, May on the left. Both had nasty swales to
conquer to get to the hole.
</P>
<P>
   May putted first and knocked his ball off the back edge of the
green, leaving him 15 feet on his birdie try.
</P>
<P>
   ``The swales out there are pretty big,'' May said. ``So I
thought I had to hit the putt pretty hard. I really was
concentrating on the line. But once you get over the hill, it
starts going downhill, which I didn't pay attention to.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods, meanwhile, left his big-breaking, right-to-left putt five
feet outside the hole. Both players had downhillers left, and May's
birdie putt zeroed in on the hole like it had eyes. Woods then
calmly knocked in his tester, sending the tournament to a
three-hole playoff, a new format implemented this year.
</P>
<P>
   On the first playoff hole, the par-4 16th, May made a remarkable
par, blasting out of the deep rough short and right of the green to
within six inches.
</P>
<P>
   But Woods would not be denied. He had hit a 7-iron 20 feet right
of the hole, and the putt dived straight into the cup. The one-shot
lead would hold up the rest of the way, although not without some
excitement, particularly on the 18th.
</P>
<P>
   Woods yanked his tee shot ``50 yards left of the fairway,'' he
said. The ball hit trees and cart paths and finally skittered
backward through the gallery. He then knifed his second shot into
the left rough and his third into the bunker in front of the green.
</P>
<P>
   May wasn't much better, although he knew he was being given a
grand opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``He left the door open, which was totally unexpected from
Tiger, to hit a drive like that,'' May said.
</P>
<P>
   But May put his drive in the left rough and sprayed his second
shot into the right rough. His approach was on the green, but 25
feet right of the hole in the same swale from which Woods had to
play in the regulation finale. Woods, meanwhile, wasn't upset with
being in the bunker.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, he put the shot a foot from the hole, and when
May's birdie try slid by on the low side, Woods had the fifth major
championship of his young career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, you knew you had to execute golf shots,'' Woods said.
``Par wasn't going to win any holes. That made it more exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Though there were eight players within two shots of May and
Woods on the front nine, it became their show on the back nine.
Nobody would finish within four shots of the two front-runners.
</P>
<P>
   Woods got off to a ragged start when he bogeyed two of the first
six holes, giving May the lead. The pair was tied at 13-under when
Woods rammed in a 15-footer for birdie at the par-3 eighth, and
when they both parred the ninth, the back-nine stage was set for a
shootout.
</P>
<P>
   Woods tried his best to make a statement on the 14th, rolling in
a 12-footer on the par-3 for birdie. But May had stuck his 4-iron
shot to within five feet and made the putt on top of Woods' to
retain the one-shot edge.
</P>
<P>
   If there was a point when May failed to close the deal, it came
at the 15th. Woods' second shot on the par-4 hooked 20 yards left
of the hole, but he got a good kick off the hill into a closely
cropped collection area. He putted eight feet past the hole but
canned the par putt.
</P>
<P>
   When May missed his five-footer for birdie, the game was very
much in doubt. May, at 17-under, continued to cling to the one-shot
edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had missed and he made his, he'd be three up with three
holes to go and looking pretty good,'' Woods said. ``I felt if I
missed, he would make. And I knew if I made mine, it would make his
a little bit longer. I just stepped up there and buried it.''

   Tiger able to handle heat, even from Cinderella
</P>
<P>
   By DALE ROBERTSON
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ Tiger Woods made a whole slew of additional
golfing history Sunday, as if we're supposed to be startled by that
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   But Bob May, a man of considerably more modest means and
aspirations, could at least leave Valhalla having made a name for
himself. Whatever, if anything, comes of May, after this fateful
near-miss of a major breakthrough, he'll never be Bob Who? again.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the rich got richer. Goliath did a Houdini and
wriggled free. Yes, Tiger won, and Bob lost. Imagine that. But the
fourth round of the 82nd PGA Championship, extended by three
playoff holes because neither the Chosen One nor the Obscure One
deigned to blink, offered up marvelous theater and, on repeated
occasions, hyperventilating shot-making worthy of anyone who ever
gripped a club.
</P>
<P>
   The route to such a predictable (foregone?) conclusion would be
jammed full of more electric moments and courageous feats _ with a
healthy dollop of duffer comedy interjected at the finish _ than
most entire golf tournaments, certainly the sort Woods has been
sucking the drama from of late.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger's conquering-hero Sundays at the U.S. and British Opens
were lazy victory laps, not grueling tests of fortitude. Here at
the PGA, in contrast, he showed us he can handle real pressure,
never mind how utterly improbable would be the source of it.
</P>
<P>
   May, a 31-year-old refugee from a half-decade innocuously spent
traipsing around the European circuit, has never won a North
American PGA Tour event, major or minor. Bob's first foray, in
1994, into the weekly meat grinder that Woods is making such a
mockery of saw him earn $31,079 _ in 31 tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   Disconsolate if not defeated, he fled across the pond soon
thereafter and didn't return stateside until the current season.
Other than to let the FedEx St. Jude Classic slip from his grasp on
the final day, after he had earlier missed four cuts in five
starts, May hadn't done a single noteworthy thing in seven months.
</P>
<P>
   Until he earned the right to tango, one-on-one, with Tiger on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   A stroke separated Woods and May when the afternoon began. A
stroke still separated them when it was over, although for much of
the race it was Woods who found himself playing catch-up. Tiger's
yippy putter let May pry open a two-stroke lead after six holes,
and Woods didn't draw even until 17, when his birdie putt trumped
May's gutsy save.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played a good, solid round,'' May said. ``It just wasn't
good enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Good? Solid? Cripes, he posted a 5-under 31 on the backside
under the most extreme duress imaginable, applied by the fastest
tracker to greatness the game has known. But Tiger, being Tiger,
also shot 31, with his 31st swing a right-on five-foot birdie putt
that replied, resoundingly, to May's own 15-footer for a birdie
from the back fringe.
</P>
<P>
   Twice on 18 it came down to Mr. Par 5 vs., as a colleague noted,
``a guy in a hat.'' The latter proved the former's equal the first
time, but he had only one checkmate move in him.
</P>
<P>
   While neither player, both largely spent by then, hit the
fairway on the 75th hole, Woods parlayed a lucky bounce off a
horrid drive into a magnificently salvaged par, although he wasn't
home free until May's 30-footer for birdie, requiring an almost
90-degree break, rolled inches wide.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had one heck of a battle on the back nine,'' Woods
admitted. ``The fireworks started for both of us. This was one of
the greatest duels I've had in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   By winning it, he entered yet another superstar stratum. Only
Ben Hogan had won three professional majors in the same year until
Tiger completed his 3-for-3 summer sweep. Perhaps more remarkably,
his 72-hole cumulative of 18-under (equaled by May, of course) put
his name in the record books for the lowest scores relative to par
in all four majors.
</P>
<P>
   And he's only 24, competing in a sport men aren't supposed to
fully grasp until their 30s.
</P>
<P>
   On longevity and the sheer volume of his important titles _ 18
Slams _ Jack Nicklaus remains many points ahead of Woods in the
best-ever tally, but even Jack won't argue with the notion that
Tiger has proved himself to be the finest golfer ever relative to
his peer group in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus collected his record stash of championships at the
expense of a series of fabled fellow thoroughbreds, from Arnold
Palmer and Gary Player on through Lee Trevino, Johnny Miller and
Tom Watson.
</P>
<P>
   Jack's lament here this week, a week that saw him formally pass
the torch to Woods as the keeper of the flame when they finally
paired up Thursday and Friday, was that none of the ostensibly
regal lads who should be stepping up to challenge Tiger's supremacy
is doing so, and the PGA's mismatched showdown proved Jack's point.
</P>
<P>
   May deserves hearty applause for throwing his body in front of
the Woods freight train. But where was Ernie Els? Jose Maria
Olazabal? Davis Love III? Justin Leonard? Phil Mickelson?
</P>
<P>
   Why weren't they in that playoff instead of Bob? When will they
stand up and answer the imposing challenge Tiger presents?

TIGER'S TALE STILL GROWING 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ They golfed for five hours Sunday at Valhalla
Golf Club, and this is how good they were: literally too much for
one man's dreams.
</P>
<P>
   The night before Tiger Woods and Bob May gave this infant of a
course its proper christening, May began to dream about the final
round of the PGA Championship. The dream was abruptly cut off, as
if May had pirated free cable and had his line disconnected. His
subconscious must have known that he couldn't handle _ or wouldn't
believe _ a sneak preview of the PGA Championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never played a hole out,'' May said of his interrupted
dream. ``I just kept on seeing holes.''
</P>
<P>
   When the day finally ended, May had actually seen and played 21
holes. And Woods must have seen visions of the men he now stands
next to in golf history. Woods is the greatest player of his
generation and he played like it, winning the championship in a
thrilling three-hole playoff. He has won three majors in the same
year, and three in a row, the first player to do that since Ben
Hogan accomplished it in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   In '53, Woods's father, Earl, was 22. Now Earl's son, 24, has
wiped the dust from dog-eared history books and calligraphied his
name in them. His tag will read something like this:
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods . . . golf innovator.
</P>
<P>
   The innovation began long before Sunday, the greatest golfing
day of the year. May and Woods golfed inside and outside the ropes.
Woods began the day with a one-shot lead. May caught him, passed
him, and threatened to make it a three-shot advantage on 15. Woods
tied it on 17, and gave this crowd something to cheer and be
confused about.
</P>
<P>
   Do you root for history? Or do you root for the guy who used to
be Tiger's neighbor?
</P>
<P>
   Most of the gallery chose Woods, probably because they realized
golf has never had a champion like this. If he were a recording
artist, Woods would have overwhelming crossover appeal. He has
brought hipness to golf. He has brought more fans to the galleries,
making them swell even more than they did in the days of Arnie's
Army. In some way, he has changed you, too.
</P>
<P>
   If you are tired of him, you watch to see him fail.
</P>
<P>
   If you are a longtime golf fan, you watch to see him give your
sport a good name.
</P>
<P>
   Woods's name is now referenced in the most unusual places. One
of the characters in ``Shaft'' mentioned him. Last month at Fenway
Park, several hours before Jerry Manuel's White Sox were to play
the Red Sox, the Chicago manager sat in the visitors' dugout and
asked one of his coaches, ``Did you see Tiger today?'' He is the
athlete _ yes, he's an athlete _ that nonsports fans find most
provocative, most relevant, and most interesting.
</P>
<P>
   His father said he would have the social impact of great men
(Martin Luther King Jr. and Gandhi) who changed the way people
thought about worldwide equality and justice. Well, let's just call
that parental exuberance. If you interviewed 100 parents, 95 of
them would promise you that their children could be famous
surgeons. Tiger Woods is not the preacher-poet that King was.
Gandhi stared down British soldiers; Woods simply won the British
Open.
</P>
<P>
   There has been so much commentary about his race and his age and
his commercials that we don't focus on this enough: He is an
incredibly bright and talented golfer. Everyone from May to Jack
Nicklaus has said that, but they have also said they didn't realize
how good he was until they played with him.
</P>
<P>
   May played with him Sunday for those titillating five hours and
got the full Tiger Ensemble. He saw the crowds; saw the drives; saw
the unusual club selections (He's using a 2-iron here? Are you
kidding me?); saw the stare _ especially after Woods birdied 17 _
that reminded you that if you are going to beat this guy, you will
have to come with something extraordinary.
</P>
<P>
   May did that. And he did it longer than anyone expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's got to go down as one of the best duels in the
game, in major championships,'' Woods said.
</P>
<P>
   May and Woods, seven years apart, used to play the same southern
California golf courses. Woods was 9. May was 16. The older kid
would play a complete round. The youngster, some new jack called
Tiger, would play nine.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the old days, they played 21 Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Their final shots in regulation were putts that could have ended
the tournament. May lined up his putt, tapped it, watched it take a
long journey to the hole (imagine syrup taking its time coming out
of the bottle), and then saw it curl into the cup.
</P>
<P>
   Woods made his putt to force the playoff. You knew he would do
that, just as you knew Bill Russell's teams would win in the NBA
Finals. Just as you knew Joe Montana's teams would not lose in the
Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Woods birdied the first playoff hole, leaving the gracious May
in a trail of playoff pars. After the birdie, Woods became an
interactive golfer: two of his shots went deep into the gallery and
onto a walkway.
</P>
<P>
   So there was Tiger, taking one shot with a man in a red shirt
practically looking over his shoulder. On the other shot, there was
the man in the red shirt again, behind Tiger, mugging for the small
city of photographers that followed Woods for the bulk of the 75
holes he walked here.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after all the emotion and brush with Woods's raging
celebrity, we are left with numbers. Historical numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Woods is the first PGA champion to repeat in 63 years. He holds
under-par records in four majors _ the Masters, British Open, US
Open, and the PGA Championship. And he has those three majors this
year.
</P>
<P>
   He left here Sunday with a silver winner's trophy, $900,000,
respect from and for May, and memories of grateful Kentuckians
singing ``My Old Kentucky Home'' to him on the 18th green. He
should also have the knowledge that the sport will never be the
same. Golfers exercise more often now because Tiger does. Golfers
play better because they don't want Tiger to embarrass them. And
records, even the oldest records, are now vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   The achievements of Hogan, Nicklaus, Sam Snead, and Byron
Nelson, still rest on the sport's front-room mantel. But they have
to move a few inches over now. They have to make room for Tiger
Woods.

WOODS A HISTORY MAJOR 
</HEADLINE>
 CHAMPIONSHIP-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ From the edge of the Pacific Ocean to hallowed
land in Scotland to America's heartland, Tiger Woods has spent the
summer playing an unprecedented brand of golf that has ushered him
into the pages of history.
</P>
<P>
   But standing on the 18th hole of Valhalla Golf Club Sunday, he
was faced with the harshest reality this game offers: Make the putt
or lose.
</P>
<P>
   Woods never flinched, never lost focus, never questioned his
nerve. When he curled in the birdie putt from 5 feet to complete a
round of 5-under-par 67 for an 18-under 270 total, he set in motion
a three-hole playoff victory over unheralded Bob May in the 82d PGA
Championship to vault himself into an atmosphere never before seen
in this game.
</P>
<P>
   ``One memorable battle,'' said Woods, who joined Ben Hogan as
the only players in modern history to win three major championships
in a season. ``We never backed off. We went birdie-for-birdie,
shot-for-shot. It was a very special day.''
</P>
<P>
   He spoke quietly and his smile had disappeared, proof not that
Woods was unappreciative of the momentous occasion, but that he was
physically and emotionally drained from what he called ``one of the
toughest battles'' he had ever faced on a golf course. May, before
this weekend a virtual unknown who required a special exemption to
get into the event, put up a challenge that people had cried for in
the aftermath of Woods's 15- and eight-shot wins in the US and
British opens earlier this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I proved to a lot of people that I can play under the heat,''
said May. He should have said ``near-flawlessly,'' too, because he
strung together his third consecutive 66 to threaten Woods's walk
into the pages of history. He capped off his splendid round with a
15-foot, double-breaking, downhill putt on the 18th green to force
Woods into a must-make situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fully expected him to make it,'' said Woods. ``You have
to.''
</P>
<P>
   May, in turn, knew what was coming. ``My caddie (Steve Kaye)
said, `Partner, get ready. We're going to a playoff.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Woods drained the left-to-right breaker to match May with a 31
back side, and off they trudged to the par-4 16th, each of them at
18-under but only one of them stalking history. May was simply
trying to win for the first time on the PGA Tour in this, his
rookie year at the age of 31.
</P>
<P>
   Had it been sudden death, it would have been over quickly, for
Woods found the fairway with a 2-iron on the 444-yard hole, rifled
a 7-iron to 20 feet, and drained the birdie putt to go in front.
But in a new twist, the PGA of America uses a three-hole aggregate
format, so Woods and May, who had saved par at that first playoff
hole from a greenside bunker, went on to the 17th and 18th again.
</P>
<P>
   They were mad scrambles for both. The play for the first time
all day was ragged, but Woods was able to save par after driving
right into the woods at the 422-yard 17th, then at the 18th when he
inexplicably pulled his drive way left, over hills and onto a cart
path.
</P>
<P>
   ``He left the door open,'' said May, ``which was totally
unexpected from Tiger. I was just trying to hit a good, solid drive
down there.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time all day, May failed miserably. He pulled his
drive well left into thick grass on the hill, had to lay up, then
knocked his third to the right of the pin, some 35 feet away, down
on a lower tier.
</P>
<P>
   Woods missed the fairway with his layup, then found the bunker
with his third shot. No problem, for he had birdied this hole three
times from that sand. And he mastered it again _ a blast to tap-in
range that put the 18th hole pressure this time on May.
</P>
<P>
   He had handled it well all day, but this was too much to ask.
Though his birdie putt tracked the hole all the way, it curled dead
left at the end, leaving the players short par putts that put an
end to one of the most dramatic days pro golf has seen in years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoyed it,'' said Woods, a mind-boggling 49 under in this
summer's three major championship triumphs this summer, ``and I'm
sure Bob did, too.''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, though the three extra holes weren't as satisfying as
the first 18 to May, who honed his game the past few years on the
European Tour. He had made a run at a victory earlier in the year
in Memphis, but this was his first time on the big stage. He didn't
disappoint.
</P>
<P>
   Starting the day one back, he assumed the lead at the par-5
second when he made birdie on top of Woods's bogey, and pushed it
to two shots with a birdie at the fourth. Woods slapped a
birdie-birdie hit on him at Nos. 7 and 8 to take the match even
into the turn and set the stage for a scintillating back nine.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the best duels in the game,'' said Woods.
</P>
<P>
   That he was on the short end of it was shocking, but there was
May making three straight birdies starting at the 10th, then
another at the 14th to get to 17 under, one ahead of Woods, who had
merely birdied 10, 12, and 14.
</P>
<P>
   At the 402-yard, par-4 15th, one of the most shocking upsets in
golf history appeared sealed. May stared at a birdie putt from 5
feet thanks to a brilliant 7-iron approach, then stole a look at
where Woods had ended up _ behind the green, long with an 8-iron,
his ball coming to rest in a collection area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Misread the putt, misjudged the slope,'' said Woods, who
putted poorly to 15 feet. Yes, a three-shot lead was on May's mind,
but Woods saw things differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew if I made mine, it would make his a little longer,''
said Woods. ``If I missed, I knew he'd make his. Three down with
three to go wouldn't look pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods, who had nearly putted his way out of the match on the
front nine, is reminding everyone of a young Jack Nicklaus _ that
is, deadly on any putt he has to make. He drained that 15-footer
for par, May indeed missed his birdie chance, and the deficit was
just one.
</P>
<P>
   But not for long, because Woods two holes later scorched a drive
high into the blue Kentucky sky, his ball coming to rest 335 yards
away. He flipped a 60-degree sand wedge at the pin, the ball hit
once, skipped, checked, and came to rest 2 feet from the pin.
</P>
<P>
   He drained it, of course, and was tied at 17 under, taking his
bid for history to the 72d hole in front of thousands.
</P>
<P>
   It is a par-5 that ends 542 yards from the tee, at a green that
has three tiers. With his second shot, May found the left tier,
perhaps 100 feet from the pin. With his second shot, Woods found
the right tier, 30-35 feet away.
</P>
<P>
   May badly navigated his first putt, hitting it too high on a
ridge, and it moved left. ``You see it going left, you know it is
done and over,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Woods's putt was shorter, but also traveled up and over a ridge
and when it came to rest 6 feet above the pin, May figured he had
to make his _ and he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he made it, it really wasn't that big a surprise,'' said
Woods. ``I knew I had to make mine to tie.''
</P>
<P>
   And he did. Which was not a surprise, either. At least not to
those who had seen this act at Pebble Beach and St. Andrews this
summer.

<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ After a game Sunday in which neither team
gave away much beacuse they meet again in the regular-season opener
here Sept. 3, New England quarterback Drew Bledsoe said, ``I think
we did enough good things and showed that we can move the ball and
score some points against their defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe's coach, Bill Belichick, agreed. At least he agreed
enough to pull the first-team offense in the first half of a 31-21
loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Beyond that, Bledsoe and
Belichick weren't happy with many other aspects of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have four fumbles, nine penalties, and one blocked
punt, we made too many mistakes,'' Belichick said. ``Though we did
a few positive things, they were overridden by poor plays, costly
individual plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe went 10 for 18 for 77 yards and didn't turn the ball
over. But the Patriots continued their third-down woes, going 4 for
14 (29 percent).
</P>
<P>
   One of the two touchdowns produced by the offense came on Kevin
Faulk's 58-yard second-quarter run, which gave him a slight edge in
the derby to become the team's starting running back.
</P>
<P>
   Also impressive was the play of the first-team defense. Chad
Eaton, Willie McGinest, Chris Slade, Brandon Mitchell, Lawyer
Milloy, Ty Law, Tedy Bruschi, and Tebucky Jones all had superb
games, holding the Bucs to 62 yards on the ground in the first half
and pressuring Shaun King into a tough 8-for-21 performance for 158
yards in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   The Bucs had two fluke plays go their way, including a touchdown
pass to Jacquez Green in the second quarter that tipped off tight
end Dave Moore's hands and into Green's. The play went for 55
yards. Earlier there was another tip, when Law seemed to nicely
defend a long pass to Green, but he knocked the ball forward and it
landed in Green's hands for a 58-yard catch. The Bucs squandered
that opportunity when they missed a field goal.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots evened things when Faulk got loose for his
touchdown run right up the middle with 10:10 left in the second.
Max Lane blocked strong-side linebacker Shelton Quarles while
Damien Woody pushed the nose tackle aside, opening a nice hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really didn't pay much attention to the block or who I
blocked. It was just one play,'' said Lane. A big play.
</P>
<P>
   Faulk's eyes bulged when he saw the opening, and he told
himself, ``Wow. Do not let anyone catch you from behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Faulk, who has had the best exhibition season among the
Patriots' running backs (rookie J.R. Redmond made an unimpressive
debut Sunday, fumbling a punt), believes he can be the No. 1 back.
``I know I can, but I have to prove that to the coaches,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bucs defensive tackle Brad Culpepper said, ``The majority of
plays we shut them down, but then they had the big draw play. Last
year we prided ourselves on not giving up the big play. There was a
gap assignment missed on that play that has to be corrected.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots' defense then went to work, swarming fullback Mike
Alstott and forcing a fumble that was scooped up by Law and run in
20 yards for the go-ahead score.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay's Martin Gramatica kicked a 36-yard field goal to make
it 14-10, Patriots, at the half.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe's day ended with six seconds left in the first half when
offensive coordinator Charlie Weis summoned Michael Bishop to throw
a Hail Mary pass, which was picked off.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop started the third quarter quite poorly. He dropped back
deep in Patriots territory and had the ball slip out of his hand as
he cocked his arm. Linebacker Jamie Duncan recovered the ball in
the end zone, giving the Bucs a 17-14 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was setting up a screen pass to J.R.,'' said Bishop. ``J.R.
was out in the flat and I had my hand going forward and the ball
slipped out of my hand. I thought it was a forward pass, but the
official didn't agree.''
</P>
<P>
   Trailing, 24-14, following another score by the Bucs on a
32-yard pass from Eric Zeier to Karl Williams, Bishop tried to
mount a comeback, finding his former Blinn Junior College teammate,
Shockmain Davis, for passes of 51 and 32 yards, the latter a
touchdown play that pulled the Patriots within 3 points.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bucs got a 5-yard TD run from Aaron Stecker to seal the
victory.

SENSATIONAL SIX SELECTED

 TRIALS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The somersaulting sisters of Sydney took their
introductory bow Sunday &UR;  &LR; night at the FleetCenter, where Elise Ray,
Amy Chow, Kristen Maloney, Morgan White, Dominique Dawes, and Jamie
Dantzscher stood hand in hand after being named to the US Olympic
gymnastics team.
</P>
<P>
   But amid a shower of red, blue, and silver streamers at the
conclusion of the US Olympic Gymnastics Trials before a crowd of
16,377 on Causeway Street, there was also a tinge of sadness.
</P>
<P>
   Shannon Miller, the most decorated US gymnast in history, was
forced to pull out of the competition following the first rotation,
jamming both knees when she smacked down on the floor attempting to
land the first of two vaults.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, . . . I wish she would have started just a
little bit earlier,'' said Bela Karolyi, the women's team
coordinator, all but dismissing the chance the 23-year-old Miller
might be named to the team as a second alternate. ``At this point,
we can't consider it.''
</P>
<P>
   Alyssa Beckerman, who placed eighth in the trials, with last
month's nationals factored into the equation, was named as the
alternate _ somewhat of a surprise because Vanessa Atler finished
sixth overall and was left off the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's weird,'' said Atler, who ranked 10th overall in Sunday's
final round and was under consideration to make the team as a vault
specialist, ``but when they announced the team and I wasn't on it,
I was kind of relieved. I was messing up a lot of things out there.
It wasn't my day. It wasn't my time. That's OK. I'll be back.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller, hoping to be named to her third Olympic squad, was
upstaged by the bold, athletic Dawes, who now will compete in her
third Games. Miller, Dawes, and Chow were all part of the
Magnificent Seven who captured the women's all-around gold medal at
the '96 Games in Atlanta. In the end, Chow was the best of the
three here, finishing second only to Ray by just over a half-point
(76.839 to 76.205).
</P>
<P>
   Could the quiet, efficient Chow _ getting better with each week
of practice while cutting her pre-med classes at Stanford _
ultimately end up the team leader Down Under?
</P>
<P>
   ``This team has a leader,'' said Karolyi, ``and that's Elise
Ray.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray, who captured the national championship last month, ranked
third on the final day of competition, behind Chow (1) and the
diminutive and spirited White (2). Entering the meet, Ray and
Maloney were viewed as the top guns among the new generation, the
Olympic first-timers expected to assume dynamic leading roles Down
Under. Karolyi wants Ray to be that _ thus his vote of confidence _
but Chow and Dawes, both of them steady, efficient, and strong,
right now appear more capable of fulfilling the leadership role.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the men's team, whose rules mandate the top four
finishers in the trials make the team, all six women were
handpicked. As it turned out, the top five finishers made it in
order, with Dawes (No. 7) jumping over Atler (6) for the final
spot.
</P>
<P>
   Atler said she made it clear to everyone that she didn't want to
go to Sydney if asked to go as an alternate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The performance I put out there,'' she said, ``is not like
Olympic material.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond Miller's fall, the most dramatic moment of the night was
the strong performance by Dawes (9.037) on balance beam. After
sticking her landing, Dawes hopped from the floor, then jumped back
on stage to blow kisses to an adoring crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, an enthusiastic Karolyi bolted to her corner,
vigorously shook her shoulders, and enveloped her in one of his
patented bear hugs. The formal announcement would come later, but
she had her ticket to Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's strong. She's mature,'' said Karolyi. ``She's a very
powerful athlete.'' Just the kind of backbone Karolyi wants, just
in case the kids cower at the foot of Olympus.
</P>
<P>
   The last glimpse the world may have seen of Miller in
competition came at 6:42 p.m. when she skipped backward in obvious
pain after landing her second vault. She returned to the floor 15
minutes later to collect her warm-up suit, the sign she was
surrendering for the night.
</P>
<P>
   When her withdrawal was announced over the PA, the crowd
murmured an audible ``Ahhh,'' and seconds later broke into
respectful applause. Quietly, with little ceremony, the torch was
passed.

RANGERS AVERT RED SOX SWEEP 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-RANGERS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ All the Red Sox magic took a vacation Sunday &UR;  &LR; night. No
Martinez sleight of hand. No managerial masterstrokes. No last-gasp
miracles.
</P>
<P>
   And by the dreary end, no more fleeting hold on first place in
the American League wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   A night of great promise swiftly went south, as Sox starter Jeff
Fassero squandered four perfect innings and his teammates reverted
to their punchless ways at the plate, never more so than with
runners on base.
</P>
<P>
   The damage: a 6-2 loss to an uncelebrated Texas starter, Doug
Davis, and a Rangers club in free-fall.
</P>
<P>
   The collateral pain was a lost opportunity to creep within two
games of the Yankees, who lost, 5-4, to Anaheim. Mo Vaughn and his
Angels, just two games behind the Sox in the wild-card race, arrive
in town Monday for a three-game series.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest sequel of a distressing story, the Sox left 10
runners on base. And they stayed flat through the end, unable to
recreate their recent walk-off theatrics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a lot of opportunities,'' manager Jimy Williams said.
``We just couldn't get those hits with guys in scoring position.''
</P>
<P>
   The turning point may have come before many of the 32,467 in
Fenway downed their first beverage.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox loaded the bases with none out in the first inning, as
Jose Offerman legged out an infield hit, Bernard Gilkey was hit in
the right foot by a pitch, and Carl Everett singled to left.
</P>
<P>
   But the Sox, unable to overcome their chronic production
shortage, all but let Davis off the hook. Nomar Garciaparra, one of
the league's toughest batters to strike out (once every 11.9 plate
appearances), whiffed on a 1-2 pitch out of the zone for the first
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking, `Get ahead and either strike him out or get a
double play,' '' said Davis (5-4), a lefthander who entered the
game with a 1-3 record in his last five starts with an ERA of
11.69. ``Preferably, I would have liked to get a double play, but a
strikeout's just as good.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox managed a run when Troy O'Leary grounded into a
fielder's choice, allowing Offerman to score. That made it 1-0,
with runners on first and third and two out. But one of last week's
impromptu heroes, third baseman Lou Merloni, hit into a forceout to
end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a chance early to do some damage,'' Williams said,
``but . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   A better chance never came, though the Sox squandered a number
of lesser opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no big deal,'' said Merloni, who finally looked mortal
after a remarkable first week back with the Sox. ``We'll come back
(Monday) and put some runs up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers appeared ripe to be swept after losing the first
three games of the series (Texas had not lost a four-game series at
Fenway since the 1975 wonder year). With the worst record (13-23)
in the American League since the All-Star break, the Rangers had
lost 14 of their last 18 games. And there was the questionable
Davis on the mound.
</P>
<P>
   All that, and Fassero looking invincible.
</P>
<P>
   The lefthander, who wore a T-shirt emblazoned with ``Lucky 13''
to the park, briefly electrified the Fenway crowd by hurling the
four stellar innings. He allowed only one ball out of the infield,
a line drive to right that Darren Lewis snared on the run to start
the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   But the 13th batter Fassero faced, Rafael Palmeiro, drilled a
poorly placed slider to left-center for a single.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was more like Unlucky 13,'' Fassero said.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, his golden touch took on some tarnish in the fifth, when
the Rangers erupted for three runs, and lost its sheen altogether
in the sixth, when Texas scored three more. The Rangers knocked
Fassero around for six hits and drew a walk before his night of
great promise ended so unceremoniously.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was not distracted by the notion of the four perfect
innings. Maybe if it had gone on into the seventh, he said.
</P>
<P>
   And he said the pitch Palmeiro hit was the only bad one he threw
all night. The seeing-eye grounders and the bloopers were the
killers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fassero was left to watch from the clubhouse as the Rangers
scored their fifth and sixth runs, which were charged to him. They
scored when Rod Beck, who entered the game with runners on first
and second and none out, gave up a single to Bill Haselman, a
bases-loaded walk to Royce Clayton, and a run-scoring fielder's
choice to Frank Catalanotto.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Sox stranded runners in every inning but one, the
fourth, and only then perhaps because no batters reached base.
</P>
<P>
   And Davis baffled them until the end, throwing 141 pitches for
the first complete game of his career and his team's first of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just tried to battle,'' he said, ``and I battled all
night.''
</P>
<P>
   And he won.

NO DOUBT ABOUT THIS TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
 TRIALS-ANALYSIS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ They didn't need the jury room after all. The team
picked itself. After all the politics and the paranoia and the
predictions Bela Karolyi would choose whomever he wanted, the US
women's gymnastics team going to Sydney is the one that should be
going. The federation didn't have to use the old Bucharest ballot.
</P>
<P>
   ``No discussion and no doubt,'' declared Karolyi, after the team
had marched out onto the FleetCenter floor Sunday &UR;  &LR; night. ``The
athletes played out their positions.''
</P>
<P>
   Elise Ray, Amy Chow, Kristen Maloney, Morgan White, and Jamie
Dantzscher were the top five in the combined standings and they
would have been the top five by any subjective standard.
</P>
<P>
   The only question was whether the sixth should be Vanessa Atler
or Dominique Dawes. And if you watched both nights of the trials,
where Atler barely showed up and Dawes kept clawing upward, the
question became moot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vanessa is one of the closest to my heart,'' conceded Karolyi,
who had once hoped to build the team around her. ``She is a unique
talent, but talent is not enough. When you represent the United
States, you have to have the performance.''
</P>
<P>
   And Atler didn't perform. Not when she had to. She was in strong
contention after last month's national championships in St. Louis,
but Atler came here out of shape and out of fire. ``It just wasn't
there,'' she admitted. ``Maybe I just wasn't into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the old format, the ``fair'' format, the top six after
nationals and trials would have been on the team. That would have
meant Atler and not Dawes, who came back with medals from the last
two Olympics. But USA Gymnastics has gone the ``fair'' way before
at its trials and paid a painful price.
</P>
<P>
   Gymnastics isn't swimming, where the clock decides the victor.
It's a subjective sport, where judges award points for subjective
things like ``virtuosity'' and ``amplitude.'' Shouldn't the trials
be subjective, too? That was what federation president Bob
Colarossi said, whenever he was asked about it.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with a subjective process, at least in America, is
that it provokes lawsuits from the unchosen. The Olympic softball,
cycling, and wrestling teams have already been through arbitration
this year. It would have been easier simply to take the top six
Sunday &UR;  &LR; night, but the team would have been weaker for it.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympics are not about dreams and soap operas. They are,
finally, about medals. The United States Olympic Committee will
base future funding of its sports bodies by how many medals they
win in Sydney. And this time, USA Gymnastics did not have the
luxury of leaving the team to chance.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, since the Magnificent Seven won gold in Atlanta,
the women's team has tumbled off the mat. They were sixth at the
1997 World Championships, sixth again last year. So the federation
brought Karolyi out of retirement and essentially left the
selection process in his hands.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the written procedures were more complex than the
Treaty of Ghent, and even though there was a four-person selection
committee, everybody understood the deal. Karolyi would have the
loudest voice.
</P>
<P>
   Not that everybody agreed with the deal. Ever since he defected
from Romania in 1981, his fellow coaches have regarded Karolyi with
both respect and resentment. But his resume is solid gold.
</P>
<P>
   Until Karolyi turned up, the US women hadn't won an Olympic
medal since 1948, when the rest of the world was still using beams
and floors to rebuild their war-shattered houses.
</P>
<P>
   But since Karolyi has been involved with the national program,
the US women have won three Olympic team medals and were flat-out
robbed of a fourth at Seoul. The record was beyond dispute. Once it
was clear Karolyi would not coach any individual gymnasts, the fear
and loathing subsided. The competition took care of the rest.
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't a one-night thing. The women competed in 16 routines
across four sessions at nationals and trials. Eventually, as
Brooklyn Dodger manager Chuck Dressen used to say, they eliminated
theirselves.
</P>
<P>
   Dominique Moceanu and Jaycie Phelps withdrew with bad knees
before the trials even started. Shannon Miller's legs gave out and
coach Steve Nunno pulled her out after one rotation Sunday &UR;  &LR; night.
Everybody else made it _ or didn't _ on performance.
</P>
<P>
   Ray, Chow, and Maloney, as expected, were solid. White, who was
second Sunday &UR;  &LR; night, just kept getting better. Dantzscher, whom
many insiders doubted could hold up for four nights, had 14
routines of 9.0 or better.
</P>
<P>
   So when the selectors went behind closed doors, they had only
one decision to make _ Atler or Dawes? Atler had figured to be a
specialist on vault, the team's weakest event. But when the flag
went up Sunday &UR;  &LR; night, she went flat. If Atler can't do it here,
Karolyi shrugged, she won't do it in Sydney. So Dawes, who has done
it twice at Olympus, gets a third shot. No impasse in the jury
room. The team picked itself.

MILLER FALLS OUT OF CONTENTION 
</HEADLINE>
 TRIALS-MILLER-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN BICKELHAUPT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ How much weight does it carry to have won more Olympic
and World Championship medals (17) than any gymnast, male or
female, in history? How much weight does it carry to be the only
American to have won two consecutive World Championship all-around
titles?
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, not enough.
</P>
<P>
   Shannon Miller, 23, learned that Sunday &UR;  &LR; night when she
literally fell out of contention to make the team to go to Sydney
next month. When she ran down the mat to flip over the vault in her
first routine of the night, she landed on her backside __ just like
she did Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   But this time the consequences of the fall were more dire. On
one hand, an Olympic berth was at stake. On the other hand, so was
her health.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches swarmed around Miller as she grabbed her right knee, and
the crowd at the FleetCenter grew silent. But Miller made her way
back to her feet, walked back to the start of the running mat, and
headed with determination back to the vault.
</P>
<P>
   This time she landed on her feet. But minutes later she was
scratched from the meet, and two hours later would learn she was
not going to Sydney. Not with the team, and not as an alternate.
</P>
<P>
   There was some thought that Miller, a two-time Olympian, might
make the team as a sentimental favorite, or to provide leardership
much in the same way John Roethlisberger did when he was named to
the man's team Saturday for his third trip to the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   But the women's team coordinator, Bela Karolyi, made clear the
selection process was based on points, not sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, we could not consider her,'' he said of Miller.
``Unfortunately, . . . I wish she would have started just a little
bit earlier. But I don't know how anybody could consider her after
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller is one gymnast who didn't have too much trouble getting
out of competition. After winning a gold medal on the balance beam
and another with the team in Atlanta in 1996, she headed back home
to Edmond, Okla., back to the University of Oklahoma. Last year,
she got married.
</P>
<P>
   Last February, she started persuading former coach Steve Nunno
she was ready to go back to competition, and by January he gave in.
</P>
<P>
   She looked on track to compete in the US Nationals in St. Louis
last month, until she suffered a chipped tibia in her right leg two
weeks before the meet. So she had to perform for Karolyi last
Tuesday here to prove to him she was ready to go.
</P>
<P>
   He said OK, and it looked like she was on her way.
</P>
<P>
   Until Sunday &UR;  &LR; night, when Miller's dreams of a third appearance
in the Olympics evaporated.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who spoke while the meet was still going on, said her
fall was not career-ending and still held out hope she'd be chosen
to be part of the Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no injury,'' said Miller. ``I just jammed my legs and
came in a little short. So they're a little stiff right now and
that's why I'm not going to finish the meet.''
</P>
<P>
   And she left the door open for Karolyi when she said, ``They've
seen what I can do, and they saw what I can do Tuesday and Friday.
I'd rather sit out and be healthy if they need me and be ready for
the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Nunno, though, wasn't so optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most disappointing event in our career,'' he said,
adding he has no intention of appealing a decision by USA
Gymnastics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to petition any further; we want to be
considered for what we can do,'' he said. ``We've been
rehabilitating and came in here healthy, and we want to walk out
healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller might have walked out healthy, but not with a ticket to
Sydney.

SABERHAGEN UPBEAT FOLLOWING STRONG START 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-SABERHAGEN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHIRA SPRINGER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ As a veteran of three major shoulder surgeries, Bret
Saberhagen has resigned himself to a simple rehabilitative fact:
There always will be pain.
</P>
<P>
   More often than not, Saberhagen can shrug off the stiffness and
soreness. So, after his sixth rehab start in Pawtucket Saturday
night, Saberhagen persevered through a small amount of pain and
pronounced himself ``headed in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   The righthander pitched five strong innings, throwing 75 pitches
(50 for strikes). He kept his fastball velocity consistent, ranging
between 88 and 90 miles per hour. Saberhagen felt command of his
fastball was a little off but no reason for concern. With one or
two more starts, he expects to improve his sharpness and arm
strength.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching coach Joe Kerrigan was particularly pleased with the
sharp break on Saberhagen's curve.
</P>
<P>
   Although Saberhagen felt some pinching in his shoulder, the arm
appeared to recover quickly. The pitcher called his brief workout
before the Red Sox played Texas Sunday night a good indicator of
how close he is to reaching the major league level. If the shoulder
rebounds quickly from a tough effort, Saberhagen gets a step closer
to taking the mound in a big league ballpark. ``I just whip it
until I can't whip it anymore,'' said Saberhagen. ``Sometimes it
responds to the challenges. Sometimes it doesn't, that's when you
have the setbacks. I'm just trying to make do with what I have.
Hopefully, I'm able to pitch and get back to a no-pain type
feeling. The doctor said I'd be ready around the All-Star break and
I think with him saying that I tried to get back too quick and had
some setbacks. I was rushing. A normal arm would have been back in
that time. But it's taken a little bit longer because of the stuff
that's happened in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Driven by competitiveness and a desire to help the Red Sox as
they make a final push for the playoffs, Saberhagen will likely
return when the rosters expand Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Before then, he expects to make one or two more starts for
Pawtucket, trying to increase his workload each time. Saberhagen
feels his arm has not yet handled a heavy enough load in game
conditions. After Saberhagen started Saturday, his arm felt very
weak, telling him that he was pushing the surgically repaired
shoulder to the limit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most encouraging sign was his ability to get up and down
five times and get 75,'' said Kerrigan. ``That's a big step. He's
always going to have discomfort in there, but (Saturday) night he
had it to the degree where it was a little more than he was used
to. But to his credit, he fought through it.''

 SOX-ANALYSIS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ By the time the Red Sox and Rangers took the field
Sunday &UR;  &LR; night at the ESPN-appointed hour, Pedro Martinez already
had taken a shaving cream pie in the face from Texas reliever John
Wetteland, his ex-teammate in Montreal, and the scores from around
the American League already had been dropped into their familiar
slots on the ancient left-field scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   It took Martinez much less time to wipe off his face than it did
fans to figure out whether to be cheered or concerned by the
outcomes of the games involving the other playoff contenders.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees lost? Great. That gave the Sox a chance to pull
within two games of the first-place Bombers in the AL East. (Boston
ended up losing, 6-2, and is three games behind New York in the
East and one behind Oakland for the wild card, tied with
Cleveland). The Sox hadn't been this close to the division lead
this late in the season since 1995, when the Sons of Kevin Kennedy
won the division. Last season, the latest the Sox were that close
to the eventual World Series winners was July 5.
</P>
<P>
   But wait: The team that beat the Yanks, the Anaheim Angels,
started the day just three games behind the Sox in the wild-card
race, and on Friday night had rallied from five runs down in the
ninth inning to beat the Bombers, only the second time in Yankees
history they'd blown a lead of that size in the last inning.
</P>
<P>
   The man who did much of Friday's damage? Mo Vaughn. The former
Sox slugger hit a tying three-run home run off Mariano Rivera, who
now has blown more saves (five) than he did all of last season. Mo
makes his first Yawkey Way appearances of the season the next three
nights, and this time he'll be healthy and hungry, meaning there's
little chance he'll duplicate his woeful showing here last year (3
for 20, 8 strikeouts).
</P>
<P>
   The Sox may catch one break against the Halos. Darin Erstad _
who on Friday night made a game-saving catch reminiscent of Yaz's
robbery of Tom Tresh in Billy Rohr's near no-no in '67, then hit a
game-winning home run in the 11th inning _ has a strained left rib
cage and is day to day. Shiggy is healthy, though _ Angels reliever
Shigetoshi Hasegawa hasn't allowed an earned run in his last 23
innings.
</P>
<P>
   So, were the Sox better off with the Yanks losing and Angels
winning? Better to close the gap on the Bombers, even with the
Angels coming here on a roll and Mo bent on payback?
</P>
<P>
   Switch now to Cleveland, where the Indians smoked Seattle, 12-4,
sending the Mariners to their eighth straight loss. Since the
All-Star break, the M's, leaders of the AL West, are two games
under .500 (18-20).
</P>
<P>
   They haven't been alone in their mediocrity. The White Sox, who
still have the best record in the league, are one game over .500
since the break (19-18). The Blue Jays, who were in a virtual tie
with the Yankees for the division lead, are four games under
(16-20). The A's are at .500, while the Angels are minus two
(17-19).
</P>
<P>
   The contender with the best record since the break? The Sons of
Jimy Williams, who after cleaning up on the Devil Rays and Rangers
are 21-15, with the Indians (20-14) just behind. Did you catch the
stat from the Maniacal One in Sunday's newspaper? In their first 97
games, according to statistician Chuck Waseleski, the Sox did not
win a game in which they trailed by two runs; in their last 22
games, they've done it five times.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians started the week by being swept by the A's, and
finished it by clocking the Mariners, who are only the second team
in history to give up nine or more runs in seven straight defeats.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day we look like the 1995 Indians,'' catcher Sandy Alomar
said. ``The next day we look like the 1991 Indians.''
</P>
<P>
   The '95 Tribe came within one pitch of winning the World Series.
The '91 Tribe set a franchise record for losses with 105.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope we have more days left in the season where we're
the '95 Indians,'' Alomar said.
</P>
<P>
   Better for the Red Sox that the Indians lose and the M's win?
Probably, although the M's are just two games ahead of the A's in
the AL West and could wind up competing against Boston in the
wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Sox, the Indians will play 32 games in 31 days
beginning Sept. 1. There will be eight head-to-head meetings
between the teams in 10 days, with back-to-back doubleheaders Sept.
20 and 21.
</P>
<P>
   There probably will be only one survivor. Or they could kill
each other off, allowing a team such as the A's to slip in.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday it was A's 5, Tigers 4, putting Oakland a half-game ahead
of the Sox in the wild-card hunt, although the Sox' loss later on
made it one game again. One minute the A's are running off six wins
in a row. The next, they're dropping six straight.
</P>
<P>
   Their top slugger, Jason Giambi, has an impinged left shoulder,
and gritty veteran Randy Velarde has a strained neck. But the A's
kids have gotten a big lift from Mike Stanley _ you may remember
the name _ who is hitting .359 in his 13 games for the A's since
Dan Duquette cut him loose.
</P>
<P>
   So, an A's loss would have been far preferable . . . except a
Tigers win would have drawn them to .500 and some possible Motown
madness. The Tigers were just five games back in the wild-card
picture.
</P>
<P>
   Confused yet? It won't get any easier in the season's final six
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why we just have to focus on winning our own games,''
Rico Brogna said. ``There's just so many wild-card teams. Win your
own games, and try to win the division.''

FATHER-SON TEAM SHARE LAST NIGHT ON THE FORCE

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Behind a door a kid lay dying. And standing vigil
at his emergency-room bed were Los Angeles Police Department Deputy
Chief Rick Dinse and his son, Officer Sean Dinse.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't supposed to end this way.
</P>
<P>
   Not for Rudy Castillo, 19, victim of a car crash apparently
involving street racers early Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Not for the deputy chief - a retiring veteran of 34 years whose
last duty Saturday was to pass his baton to Sean when the sun rose
on the Foothill police station at the end of the 7 a.m. watch.
</P>
<P>
   And not for the father and son given rare permission by the LAPD
to ride together on graveyard patrol before dad assumed his role
next week as chief of police in Salt Lake City, Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Only tragedy intervened.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a typical day for an officer,'' said the elder Dinse,
his father-and-son ride cut short by their visit to Pacoima
Hospital of the Valley. ``This is what we do.''
</P>
<P>
   The night before, family and friends had gathered at roll call
to send off the cop's cop praised in the department for his sharp
planning, generous ear and fairness with his men.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chief Dinse started his career at Foothill, and he left at
Foothill,'' Capt. Kenneth Garner told a roomful of officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I can say about Dinse: He's a hell of a cop.''
</P>
<P>
   The father: 58, a silver-haired, blue-eyed West Bureau
operations commander in charge of five police divisions. The son:
24, shaved head, identical brown eyes, with two years on street
patrol and a lifetime desire to be a cop.
</P>
<P>
   Both began their careers in the same navy blue uniforms, in the
same room, same station, same streets. Only the doughnut shops,
coffee stops and bars have changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was nervous, anxious,'' recalled the elder Dinse of his
first day. ``My belt squeaked, my shoes squeaked ... sitting in the
front row, with a short haircut like my son has now, and basically
keeping eyes open.''
</P>
<P>
   It was 1966. Nerves were worn thin. Watts riots had just torched
the city. Demonstrations loomed like summer monsoons. Foothill
teemed with activity as officers packing six-shooter Colts cruised
in patrol cars topped with ``coffee can'' lights.
</P>
<P>
   Three decades later, Sean was also on edge his first day. Only
the station was quiet. Instead of a revolver calibrated in inches,
his Barretta measured in millimeters. Instead of paper files, the
department had turned digital.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the younger Dinse unlocked a Crown Victoria patrol car
and loaded his equipment - the two 12-gauge shotguns; the Tazer
electronic stun gun; the bean-bag gun; gas masks; map cases and
logs - into the car.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell you, this is hard,'' said Yvonne Dinse, longtime LAPD
secretary and mother of Rick Dinse's three boys, including Sean.
``Thirty-four years, one starting, one ending.''
</P>
<P>
   The chief took the wheel. But it is Sean who, pecking with his
left hand, directed the car from the laptop computer, central to
today's police units.
</P>
<P>
   The one thing father and son share is empathy and a loathing of
corruption. ``A good cop,'' said Sean, ``is someone who cares - who
came on the job not for the paycheck ... but to help people. This
job is a sacrifice.''
</P>
<P>
   Said his father, who once purged the department of rogue cops
stealing from Hollywood businesses: Corruption ``tarnishes the
badge.''
</P>
<P>
   While the deputy chief secured Los Angeles for large-scale
events such as the Democratic National Convention last week, it was
Sean - somber and intense - who each night gazed into the shadows
in search of crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what's hip and what's not,'' said the self-assured
patrol officer.
</P>
<P>
   Early Saturday, there were calls of shoplifting and
investigations of false burglar alarms and gun reports.
</P>
<P>
   But it is street racers who were the night's prime suspects. As
they moved across the north San Fernando Valley in packs of up to
100 cars in search of the perfect drag strip, officers were called
to intervene.
</P>
<P>
   At each site, spectators lined the road ready to flee police.
When the Dinses pulled up, all scrambled in whirring clouds of dust
and smoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``See what happens,'' Sean said before ticketing a racer for an
illegal U-turn. ``They all peel out, and then they get in
accidents.''
</P>
<P>
   They soon would.
</P>
<P>
   Within the hour, the Dinses were called to a crash in Sun
Valley. Castillo was a passenger in a car that careened into a
light pole, apparently to avoid racers, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Sean escorted Castillo to the hospital. Rick Dinse would emerge
from the emergency room with the terrible verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy expired, 19 years old,'' Dinse said, shaking his head.
``I've got kids not much older than he is. It's a sad, sad thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dinse left the force knowing that, after protecting the DNC
and observing Sean in action, he left a strong legacy with the
LAPD.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so proud of my son,'' he said, ``not just because he's my
son, but because he's a good police officer. He's fair, he cares
about people, he cares about doing the job the right way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight, I saw a mature man.''

FOSTER FINDS `POLITICAL SOUL MATE'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BETH BARRETT 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Ezola Foster makes a habit of grand exits.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, Foster - Pat Buchanan's vice presidential
running mate on the Reform Party ticket - ended her 33-year
teaching career by kindling a near-riot with her comments on
illegal immigrant students. Police had to escort her off campus and
she never went back.
</P>
<P>
   Her career as a Republican ended similarly except she was
arrested, not escorted away, by police. Anaheim police dragged her
to jail when she staged an anti-gay protest at the California
Republican Convention. She won a settlement but wiped the GOP dust
off her four-inch heels forever.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Foster, 62, can flash her smile, newly brightened for the
cameras, into the rearview mirror at the enemies she's collected
over three decades of extremist political activity in L.A. that has
led her in and out of court fights, the John Birch Society and
various other political causes.
</P>
<P>
   Foster harbors no doubt the national spotlight is where she
belongs, alongside Buchanan, her ``political soul mate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been on CNN, on talk shows, on Oprah, all over the
place,'' Foster said in an interview last week, chatting on a
friend's boat at Marina Del Rey, rather than in her Culver City
apartment. ``Only local people don't know me.''
</P>
<P>
   By that, Foster means she's never held a platform long enough to
get out her message: American sovereignty hinges on a patriotism
that ignores racial history, a morality that spurns homosexuality,
a strict immigration policy and a theology rooted in Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, a conservative television commentator, told crowds at
the party's Aug. 11 fractious convention in Long Beach that he and
Foster will promote the same vision as they compete against John
Hagelin, the Natural Law Party and splinter Reform Party candidate,
for $12.6 million in public campaign financing. With the money
comes the mantle to the third party founded eight years ago by
Texas billionaire Ross Perot.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have tangled with her over the years say Foster moved
to the right to fulfill political ambitions. They see her as a
troublemaker who has sued the city and Los Angeles Unified School
District for tens of millions of dollars, riled up impressionable
students and sown divisiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was beyond shocked at even the thought of Ezola Foster being
on a national ticket for vice president of the United States,''
said Frank Ricchiazzi of Laguna Beach and a founder of the Log
Cabin Republican Club, a gay and lesbian group. Ricchiazzi and
Foster in the late 1980s were a familiar dueling duo on local talk
shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once she starts talking, you have to wonder if all the marbles
are there. She's the total, ultra extreme - totally paranoid on
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Visco, a former state GOP officer, said she is not - as
Buchanan says - proof the Reform Party has broadened its base.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally, she was very, very anti-inclusiveness in the
political process. She was a person who had narrow views of both
alternate religions and lifestyles,'' said Visco, a Lancaster
resident active in party affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Foster owes a debt for her political career to Rep. Maxine
Waters, D-Los Angeles, an African-American with impeccable liberal
credentials.
</P>
<P>
   Waters so maddened Foster, then a business education teacher at
David Starr Jordan High School in South Central, with a school sex
education proposal that Foster decided to run against her for state
Assembly in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Foster wanted students to be taught responsibility for their
bodies, their education and their futures. Waters, who did not
return calls, represented the antithesis, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got hooked on the freedoms of the '60s. It was a mistake,''
said Foster, who said her first marriage was annulled when she
learned her husband had a felony conviction. ``But at least I made
it through college a virgin.''
</P>
<P>
   She lost the legislative race, and the support of established
African-American politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Foster attacked the African-American pride movement, saying the
very term made black children think they owed allegiance to an
obscure African country, rather than to America.
</P>
<P>
   She fought the teaching of ebonics, a phonetic system
recognizing certain African-American speech patterns. She was
infuriated by the one-fist ``black power'' salute. She wanted to
meet the Rev. Jesse Jackson for only one reason, to tell him: ``Let
my people go!''
</P>
<P>
   When she was called Uncle Tom, she pointed out the error in
gender. She took to wearing black and white as a symbol of racial
harmony, then defended white LAPD officers who beat Rodney King in
1991. When the city canceled a fund-raising dinner for them, she
sued for $155 million.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Knoll, a gay Republican, initially thought he detected in
Foster the very conservative strain he was looking for, ``a voice
of compassionate conservatism in the wilderness.'' That impression
was bolstered when she attended a Log Cabin meeting at Knoll's
Silver Lake home.
</P>
<P>
   ``She sought our support, she got it and she took it,'' Knoll
said.
</P>
<P>
   Foster now says she didn't know what the Log Cabin was.
</P>
<P>
   ``Homosexuality is sinful, and it's shameful.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Foster had a long friendship with a gay drama coach on
condition he wouldn't date students.

   It was a very un-Nomarlike night, but it was consistent with
what has been the first slump of a remarkably steady season for
Nomar Garciaparra.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers, in fact, show this to be the most prolonged slump
Garciaparra has had since May 1997, his rookie season. He flared a
single in the eighth inning and came around to score on a passed
ball for the Sox' second run in their 6-2 loss Sunday night to the
Texas Rangers, but his 1-for-3 performance left him batting just
.222 (10 for 45) in his last 13 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time he's struggled all year,'' said Scott
Hatteberg, the Red Sox catcher and close friend of Garciaparra.
``We're spoiled. He's hit over .300 in 15 straight months. That's
crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra hit .388 in July. He's at .279 (19 for 68) in 18
games this month. He has 49 multihit games this season, a total
exceeded only by Angels outfielder Darin Erstad (who is bidding to
set an all-time hits record), but he's had two hits in a game only
twice since hitting a home run and double against the Royals here
Aug. 6.
</P>
<P>
   All season, he has been hitting over .400 in Fenway Park, but
he's batting just .190 (4 for 21) on this homestand. His two-K game
Sunday night was his first since July 25, and after whiffing just
four times in his previous 16 games, Garciaparra has gone down on
strikes six times in seven games. That's a startling number for a
guy who has fanned just 39 times in 388 at-bats this season and
ranks fourth in the league in the toughest-to-whiff category.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Pedro Martinez said he told Garciaparra he looked
tired when the team was in Anaheim during its ludicrous five-city,
16-game trip. Manager Jimy Williams intended to give Garciaparra a
night off Thursday, but inserted the shortstop as a pinch hitter in
the seventh inning. He popped out with the bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't play tired,'' Williams said Sunday &UR;  &LR; night. ``He made
a couple of plays the other night that showed me he has as much
life in his legs as he has had all year.''
</P>
<P>
   After finishing his postgame meal, Garciaparra made a call on
his cellphone as he quickly dressed, then left the clubhouse, the
phone to his ear. This would not be a night for fielding questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this game is very, very mental,'' Hatteberg said.
``He's been in a groove for so long and has been so confident, that
when things don't click and don't stay that way, you get that
slight panic, not that he's panicking.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitchers like Texas lefty Doug Davis, who allowed 10 hits and
seven runs in just 2 2/3 innings last Tuesday against the Yankees,
don't normally handle Garciaparra.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't usually see guys like that get Nomar out,''
Hatteberg said. ``But people struggle, even the best.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen a guy as consistent as Nomar has been this
year. He's been as good this year as I've ever seen him. I know
hitting, and you get spoiled watching a guy like that who makes it
look so easy. But it's not that easy.''

LOS ANGELES: date students.

<TEXT>
<P>
   She pushed her point of view in 1987 as a delegate to the state
GOP convention in Anaheim, introducing a resolution to
disenfranchise the Log Cabin Club.
</P>
<P>
   Foster said she was returning to the conference hall when
security guards surrounded her, followed by Anaheim police, who
took her to jail.
</P>
<P>
   The criminal trespassing charges were dropped, and there was a
confidential settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't make up for what happened to me, but it was
acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Foster, a typing and shorthand teacher, made her reputation at
LAUSD as a whistleblower, a promoter of student causes, and a thorn
in administrators' sides. Mostly, she said, they ignored her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember her, oh yeah,'' said former Los Angeles Unified
School District Superintendent Sidney Thompson, who supervised
Foster in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Ezola took a position, it was strong. From my position, I
didn't see any leeway for us to adjust to.''
</P>
<P>
   As a new teacher at Jordan High in the early 1960s, Foster said
she was outraged at how federal funds for minority children were
being spent. She went to the U.S. Department of Education, and some
of her claims were vindicated.
</P>
<P>
   Foster's work record shows she moved to three high schools, as
well as substituted. She said the district engaged in a vendetta
against her.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1996, Foster, while teaching at Bell High School,
appeared on a national talk show with school board member David
Tokofsky and talked in strong terms about how the schools were
overcrowded with children illegally in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, she said fliers showed up in teachers' mailboxes
accusing her of being a liar, racist and worse, she said. Students
cried, teachers took sides and fights broke out. For her own
protection, she was locked inside a classroom and neither the
district nor union came to her defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, I was escorted out by school police. There was no way
I would go back.''
</P>
<P>
   Tokofsky, who followed Foster's activities after their TV
meeting, said: ``It's amazing Buchanan didn't look underneath the
hood, and that he took the skin-deep assessment of her
conservatism.''
</P>
<P>
   The youngest of five children raised by a single mom in Houston,
Texas, Foster spent summers at her grandparents' farm near the
village of Maurice, La., where she helped with the cotton crop.
</P>
<P>
   She attended mostly African-American schools but said she never
felt the sting of racism.
</P>
<P>
   Today, she and Buchanan infuriate many by saying states should
be able to fly the Confederate flag over their capitols, a symbol
many say trivializes the horrors of Southern slavery.
</P>
<P>
   At Texas Southern University in the '60s, Foster said she joined
one sit-in at a Houston drugstore but was pulled away at the last
minute by friends who said her mother lacked the means to bail her
out of jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time, I felt like most of the others, that I was doing
something good for our race,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Foster had been making the talk show circuits for a while when
Buchanan invited her to speak at a Washington, D.C., event which
led to her being named his national co-chairwoman.
</P>
<P>
   Days before the announcement she would be Buchanan's running
mate, his sister, Angela M. ``Bay'' Buchanan, who had run for state
treasurer in California in 1990, got Foster to sever her ties with
the John Birch Society, her organization Americans for Family
Values, and a Chatsworth-based bookstore, Trim Tax.
</P>
<P>
   She said she had only ``proud and happy'' memories of the John
Birch Society, a hard-core anti-Communist group.
</P>
<P>
   On the evening of Aug. 9 - her birthday - Foster; her husband,
Chuck; and the Buchanans went to dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pat turned to me, almost like a marriage proposal,'' Foster
said. ``He said, `Would you be willing to be my running mate for
the Reform Party?' I said yes.''

MAY'S DAY BITTERSWEET

<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ There was that head-to-head win against Colin
Montgomerie in the British Masters last summer and a final-pairing
in the fourth round of the FedEx St. Jude Classic in June, but this
was unlike anything Bob May ever had experienced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I turned to Tiger and said, `Is this what you get every week?'
And he said, `You got it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   He just had stepped out of the fiercest major championship golf
drama in years, yet May wore a smile. He hadn't won, but he had
taken the world's greatest player to the limit. And then even
farther, into a three-hole playoff that May lost despite going
par-par-par.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, he hadn't chopped it up. They were scrambling
pars and he didn't give himself good chances to answer Woods's
birdie on the first playoff hole, but they were indicative of the
spirit he had brought to the competition. He knows he may have been
the only one to give himself a chance, he said, but that was
understandable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't say he is the best golfer ever to play,'' said May,
``because it wouldn't be fair to a lot of the other players that
have played before him. But he may be, when he is done, the best
player. And I went head-to-head with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Just like the old days.
</P>
<P>
   Well, almost like the old days.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Southern California I was before him, and in some newspaper
articles, (Woods) would say, `I am going to beat Bob May's record.'
Which he pretty much proceeded to do,'' said May, who was an
accomplished junior player and later a collegiate star at Oklahoma
State.
</P>
<P>
   They played in the same junior tournaments, though May was 9
years older and Woods ``was still playing nine holes.''
</P>
<P>
   Their routes went in different directions.
</P>
<P>
   May went on to college stardom, PGA Tour failure, European Tour
success, and graduation through a grueling qualifying school test
back in America.
</P>
<P>
   Woods went to another planet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always kept track of him,'' said May, though he wasn't
quite ready for what he saw on the first tee _ a drive that
seemingly wasn't ever going to come down. ``When he hit that tee
ball, over those trees left, I knew it was going to be a different
day today.''
</P>
<P>
   May is not the guy who was supposed to bring down _ or come
close to bringing down _ Woods. That had been a position reserved
for David Duval or Phil Mickelson or Ernie Els. But when he birdied
the par-5 second hole to jump into the lead, people really started
to take note of this guy who had shot a pair of 66s to back up an
opening 72.
</P>
<P>
   He received financial backing from Joe Pesci and Rick Dees
earlier in his career, but ``I haven't talked to Joe in quite a
while,'' said May, who has struggled most of 2000. There was that
tie for second at the FedEx and a tie for 11th at the British Open
last month, but none of his other 16 starts has resulted in any
other Top 20s.
</P>
<P>
   Wild, then, that he would be hearing cheers from thousands of
fans in his quest to stop Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a great player and he has a tendency to run away with
things,'' said May, ``and maybe they saw that and said, `Hey, maybe
we are going to have a match on our hands today.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Which they did, highlighted by a riveting back-side bout that
featured a pair of 5-under-par 31s. Only a burp at the par-4 15th
made May shake his head, the lone bad taste in his mouth. He had a
one-shot lead and seemed destined to make it at least two, but he
missed a 5-foot putt for birdie.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I hit it, I thought, `Oh, this is going to be a good
putt,' '' said May. ``But it just hung out there left. So that was
kind of surprising to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Not as surprising as the battle he gave Woods, whose third
straight major championship had been expected to be a breeze
against an unheralded player such as May.
</P>
<P>
   Even the player acknowledged that reality. ``Tiger plays a
different game than we play, but I wanted to go out and play a
good, solid round,'' said May.
</P>
<P>
   He was asked how it felt to shoot 66 three straight days and not
win. May shook his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are playing against the best player in the world, and he
proved that that is not good enough.''

SUBURBIA SHAKEN BY TEEN DEATHS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Daily News Staff Writer Orith Goldberg contributed to this story) 
By LISA VAN PROYEN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The vicious murders of three teen-agers from the
San Fernando Valley area in recent weeks has challenged the belief
that good schools, strong family ties and vibrant suburban
communities will insulate children from the scourge of drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Coming from drug deals gone awry rather than overdoses, the
murders have stunned police, educators and parents because of the
violence of the deaths and what appears to be the widespread
availability and abuse of drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Police and counselors who work with troubled youths say younger
kids are now dealing drugs _ especially very high-priced and potent
marijuana - on most high school campuses.
</P>
<P>
   Some of them are supplied by organized networks of smugglers and
cultivators, placing even young teens into contact with a very
dangerous world of adult criminals.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is frightening,'' said Monroe High School's Assistant
Principal Thane Opfell. ``It almost sounds like the brutal tactics
used in the 1930s in settling debts. It's particularly tragic that
it's appearing at this age.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it's not unique to just one neighborhood. The pattern
suggests that it could happen anywhere, and we need to be prepared
for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, Chris McCulloch, 13, of La Canada Flintridge
and Blaine Talmo, 14, of Glendale were brutally beaten to death in
a Glendale elementary school playground. Last week, the
bullet-riddled body of 15-year-old Nicholas ``Nick'' Markowitz of
West Hills was found several days after police say he was kidnapped
because of his older brother's drug debts.
</P>
<P>
   Those arrested in the cases are little older than the victims,
all of them from suburban or affluent communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're getting in over their heads,'' said Tim Brown, a Simi
Valley Police Department school resource officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a 14- or 15-year-old owes a drug dealer $100 to $200, it's
the same as a 30-year-old. They'll go after the kid as strongly as
the adults. I don't think we as adults take it as seriously as it
is out there. That culture out there is serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Officer Sue Shine, a school resource officer assigned to
Glendale High School, said the suburban youths are unprepared for
the high-powered world of drug dealing they are encountering.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just doing it because they think everyone's having
fun,'' she said. ``They probably have no idea about the levels of
sophistication of the people growing it and the costs involved in
screwing up dealers.''
</P>
<P>
   Valley narcotics officers said the amount of cash involved is
staggering, with the average price of good-quality marijuana at
$570 per ounce and high-quality pot reaching $2,000 per ounce.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's mind-boggling is the amount of money kids will spend to
buy marijuana,'' said LAPD Officer Don Banta, a narcotics filing
officer. ``The younger kids buy the name-brand, higher-quality
stuff ... It's actually big business. It can be very profitable.''
</P>
<P>
   At Simi Valley High School, the going rate for ``chronic,'' a
more popular type of marijuana, is $300 per ounce, said one student
recovering from his drug addiction through a teen support program
called ACTION in Studio City.
</P>
<P>
   Students get the money to buy the drugs by stealing from their
parents, saving their lunch money for weeks, or pooling their money
with other kids, said the recovering 16-year-old, who declined to
give his name.
</P>
<P>
   Some kids grow the marijuana seeds right in their own closets.
</P>
<P>
   Other kids younger than him opt to sell the drugs for 19- and
20-year-old dealers - and face the consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen kids get beaten up. I've had friends jacked up
because they made a deal to sell it, and then they stole it. It's
going to come back to bite them because $20 is worth more than they
think to these guys,'' said the 16-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   Arrests for substance abuse at or around the Valley's high
schools have increased at eight of the 17 campuses, according to
Los Angeles Unified School District's school police statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Districtwide, about 17 in every 10,000 students were arrested
for a chemical substance offense in the 1998-99 school year, nearly
the same as in 1999-2000, according to the statistics.
</P>
<P>
   North Hollywood High School saw the most marked increase from 24
arrests in the 1997-98 school year, compared to 37 arrests in the
1998-99 year. Reseda, Van Nuys and Monroe high schools also saw
significant increases.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said that within the past couple of years, he has noticed
seventh- and eighth-graders selling drugs in Simi Valley - a new
trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's scary to me is when these Simi Valley kids go to the
Valley or a drug-infested area and they don't know what they're
getting into. It's a serious problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Though marijuana is still the drug of choice at the high school
level, it is what narcotics officers call ``the gateway drug'' to
other drugs, including speed, LSD and ecstasy - the other favorites
for students.
</P>
<P>
   Amanda Rowland, 17, a former Conejo Valley High student, said
chronic is the current hot type of marijuana at schools because
``the high lasts longer, and the hits are longer and faster, and
you don't have to smoke as much.''

KENYANS DOMINATE FALMOUTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FALMOUTH, Mass. _ How many Kenyans does it take to dominate one
of the top road races in the world?
</P>
<P>
   Try a slightly stretched baker's dozen _ 14 _ who made Sunday's
28th Falmouth Road Race a virtually all-African affair. The lead
pack,including 14 Kenyans among the 17 runners, took off from Woods
Hole at a sub-4 1/2-minute-per-mile pace, and as it reached the
1-mile mark around Nobska Lighthouse, the elite speedsters had run
away from the 9,000 plodders behind them. For a while they were on
pace to set a course record, but the winner finished seven seconds
off the mark.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly the entire 7.1-mile run over seaside bluffs and along
shimmering beaches, even into the last mile, the lead shifted among
five runners. But approaching the last hill at Falmouth Heights,
24-year-old Mark Yatich from Kenya reached down for an extra kick
and pulled away from Joseph Kimani, one of the favorites who has
dominated international road running over the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   Yatich finished in 31:43, a 4:28 pace, just three seconds ahead
of Kimani, who set the course record in 1996 (31:36). Third in
31:47 was a US runner, Khalid Khannouchi, a 28-year-old Moroccan
who became a naturalized citizen this year. He holds the world
record in the marathon (2:05:42).
</P>
<P>
   At half a mile out, Khannouchi attempted to grab the lead, and
for a time broke out of the pack. But the rest were not far behind,
and as Khannouchi struggled, Kimani kicked past him. With 200 yards
to the finish, Yatich put on his final burst and passed both.
</P>
<P>
   On the women's side there was little contest. Falmouth newcomer,
Lornah Kiplagat, 26, beat out fellow Kenyan Catherine Ndereba,
winner of this year's Boston Marathon and former course
record-holder here. Named the top road runner in the world by
Runner's World, Ndereba was trying to win her fourth Falmouth.
</P>
<P>
   But Kiplagat took off at a tremendous pace (she ran 4:56-minute
miles) and slowed down only once on her way to setting a course
record of 35:02. Looking back throughout the race, she never did
spot Ndereba and won by 55 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   In third place at 35:58 was another Kenyan, Helen
Kimaiyo-Kipkoskei, who finished just a second behind Ndereba.
</P>
<P>
   Yatich said he had not expected to win, and so ran full out
without trying to strategize. But he felt ``very strong'' as the
course dropped out of the hilly section and hit the flats along the
south-side beaches.
</P>
<P>
   Up the steep hill at Falmouth Heights, Yatich said the speed
work he had done helped him kick into the lead. ``At about 200
meters, I knew I was ready,'' he said. ``There was no need to go
faster before. I was very happy, because for me this is a really
fast time.''
</P>
<P>
   New to Falmouth and just four years into road racing, Yatich
kicked his way into world contention when in 1998 his best-known
performance was a photo-finish loss to the No. 1-ranked runner,
Joseph Korir, at the Bix 7-miler.
</P>
<P>
   Kiplagat has a similar profile. New to Falmouth, and younger
than the top performers, she is the hottest runner on the 10-K
world circuit and has dominated races in Europe, notching five wins
and finishing in the top three seven straight times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not expecting to win this race,'' said the two-time
winner of the Los Angeles Marathon. ``But I started fast, and ran
the first 500 meters with the men. The first mile was not easy, but
then I started to get strong on the hills.''
</P>
<P>
   Kiplagat said her technique is to run up hills slowly, to
conserve energy, then kick hard downhill to take advantage of
gravity. ``It was not so easy on the flats, though,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Several times, Kiplagat looked back down the course, surprised
not to see Ndereba. ``I was able to control my race,'' she said.
``It's no good running too fast if there's nobody coming close to
you.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason no one was close, she was to find out at the finish,
was that Kiplagat was on a course-record pace.
</P>
<P>
   Run in perfect weather, the race dripped with nostalgia. Johnny
Kelley rode in front as course marshal, and some of the old-timers
who made the race famous were back again.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Rodgers, who shares credit for making Falmouth a
world-class event in the 1970s and is widely credited with
popularizing the sport of road running, won the senior division,
beating ancient rival Frank Shorter, whom he has beaten in four of
six Falmouths dating to 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Rodgers, winner of four Boston and four New York
marathons, finished 51st overall with a time of 38.14.
</P>
<P>
   His rival was Milford's Larry Olsen, who led Rodgers at one
point by about 10 yards, only to fall behind by 16 seconds by the
finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still run to win,'' said Rodgers, who has dropped from 130
to 70 miles of training per week since his halcyon days of the
'70s. Looking out at throngs of admirers along the beach, Rodgers
said he was pleased to see so much intensity still involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``And,'' he added, ``I was really happy I caught Olsen.''

LOS ANGELES: smoke as much.''

   ``If you want drugs, you can find them at that school or from
Valley dealers,'' said Rowland, wearing a home arrest anklet as she
attended an ACTION teen support program to get off drugs. ``I'm
proud of myself for getting help. I've been clean since early
March.''
</P>
<P>
   The students hide out at a remote spot on the campus to do
drugs, behind a handball court, in the bathroom and even in the
classroom for the true addicts, some teens said during a teen
support group meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Shine, the Glendale officer, said kids hide marijuana in the
caps of their pens or in their shoes - or core out an apple into a
makeshift bong.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll smoke right out of the apple. If somebody comes up,
they just cover the hole and eat it like an apple,'' she said.
``These students are very savvy. They'll make the drug deals right
in the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an easier way for them to make money than to work at
McDonald's.''
</P>
<P>
   Prices have gone up dramatically, police say, partly because
cultivators - who face felonies if caught by police - are more
sophisticated, using costly indoor lamps to properly groom the
prime marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get less for your money, but it's better stuff,'' Shine
said.
</P>
<P>
   One parent involved in ACTION's parent and teen support program
said after discovering that her 13-year-old son was taking drugs,
she did surveillance on her own at his Simi Valley school.
</P>
<P>
   ``His source was waiting for him right outside the schoolyard,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   She caught the man in a beat-up van selling to her son and
quickly jotted down his license plate number and called it in to
administrators and school police, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me this is an isolated case, and it's at all the
schools,'' she said. ``Basically, nothing was done. He's probably
still out there.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``A lot more parents need to realize what's going on.
I started searching his room, and I wish I had done it sooner. You
got to talk to your kids all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   And communities need to change their perceptions, said Cary
Quashen, president of ACTION, a nonprofit support group for teens
and their parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids will tell you, hey, marijuana is just about legal.
They'll give it to you if you're sick. And you hear from the
parents, well, he's only smoking marijuana. It's a natural herb.
Society is so nonchalant about it. I think that's pretty
dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   For the friends of 15-year-old Nick Markowitz, the murder has
been a rude awakening, and many have drawn a black ink X on their
hands to remind them of what happened.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan Marks, 16, a good friend of Nick Markowitz, said drugs are
quite a problem in affluent areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought it would get this bad,'' Marks said. ``It's
never worth killing anybody. It's money, and money can be replaced.
Life can't.''

FINISHING FIRST SECONDARY TO BLANCHETTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARVIN PAVE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FALMOUTH, Mass. _ Long before he crossed the finish line as the
men's wheelchair winner in the 28th edition of the Falmouth Road
Race Sunday, Craig Blanchette was already a winner in the sparkling
eyes of 14-year-old Shawn Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   Their relationship began four years ago when Blanchette, a
world-class wheelchair marathoner, was hosted by the Nelson family
for the first time at the race, a tradition that has continued each
year.
</P>
<P>
   For Shawn's mother, Patty, a member of the town's disabilities
commission, the invitation has special meaning.
</P>
<P>
   Her son has been battling a congenital and rare bone disorder
called ostegenesis imperfecta that has caused more than 80 bone
fractures and resulted in 14 surgeries in which rods were inserted
into Shawn's legs to strengthen his bones.
</P>
<P>
   A freshman at Falmouth High, Shawn uses a wheelchair and a
walker, but, said his mother, ``His attitude has been positive. He
never complained at all or felt sorry for himself.''
</P>
<P>
   For Blanchette, an eight-time world champion and a bronze medal
winner at the Seoul Paralympics in 1988, the $1,000 he pocketed for
winning Sunday had far less meaning than his bond with the Nelson
family, which also includes Patty's husband, David, and their two
other children, Michaela, 6, and Kendall, 3.
</P>
<P>
   The 32-year-old resident of Olympia, Wash., tried a new sport
this year, competing in a three-wheel, hand-powered cycle that he
has encouraged the Nelsons to look into for Shawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had been coming to Falmouth for a number of years, nine or
10, and I had been put up with other host families in the past,''
said Blanchette, who has competed in five Boston Marathons,
finishing as high as second. ``But sometimes I had to be put up in
a hotel. Then I was matched up with Shawn and his family and I
discovered we had a lot in common. Last year, my wife, Anita, came
out here and we stayed with the Nelsons for six days.''
</P>
<P>
   Blanchette has talked to Shawn about the importance of good
nutrition to make his bones stronger, and he helped fine-tune the
youngster's wheelchair last year. They've also taken day trips
together, and they e-mail each other to stay in touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shawn really looks forward to seeing Craig every year,'' said
Patty Nelson. ``He'd really like to get out there and try racing
and he sees Craig do so much. It's been a really positive influence
for him. And I'm not the kind of parent who wants to overprotect
him and not have him try things. I want him to do as much as he
possibly can and form new friendships and Craig has been a role
model for Shawn in that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Shawn, who would like to get on the Falmouth course next year,
was at the finish line Sunday to greet Blanchette and the pair
shared some quiet postrace time together inside the VIP tent.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, who derives great joy in riding his wheelchair around
the block near his home in East Falmouth and also enjoys swimming,
playing basketball with a friend, and working on his computer,
describes his relationship with Blanchette as ``cool . . . and
fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Blanchette said he also has talked to Shawn about ``enjoying
life and not spending a lot of time worrying about whether he'll be
a great racer someday. I know he enjoys being around it, though,
and I think hand cycling would be something he could try and a good
avenue for him. It's not as technical as wheelchair racing and he
can pretty much sit at the handlebars and let it go.''
</P>
<P>
   Patty Nelson, who worked Sunday at the finish line collecting
computer time chips from the athletes, has extended her involvement
with the local disabled community beyond her home.
</P>
<P>
   As a commission member, she said, ``We've tried to make Falmouth
more accessible. We purchased beach chairs so people in wheelchairs
can get to the beach, and right now I'm working on getting a
playground put in for kids who have disabilities at the Teaticket
Elementary School.''
</P>
<P>
   On a personal level, she also is hoping that a new medication,
taken through injection every two weeks, and which has been
successful with some OI patients, will help her son, and others.
The friendship and support of a champion wheelchair racer, however,
has provided a tonic that never will lose its potency.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a fun day,'' said Shawn, with the afternoon sun
glistening off the ocean matching the bright smile on his face. ``I
look forward to it all year.''

ARMSTRONG MAKES SOLID DEBUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PAUL HARBER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Early in the first half Bruce Armstrong came
out of a huddle and took his stance, as he has for 196
regular-season games and countless exhibition contests for the New
England Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   All was right in the veteran tackle's football life again.
Finally.
</P>
<P>
   The world of professional football is as tumultuous as it is
violent.
</P>
<P>
   An injury can end a season and so can a fat contract, and the
former University of Louisville All-American had both.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago Armstrong was hobbling, wondering if the damaged
anterior cruciate ligament in his knee would hold up. He was
comforted by a $3-million-plus contract and the feeling that he was
a fixture in Patriot Nation _ a 13-year veteran, a six-time
All-Pro, a selection on the Patriots' all-time team. In short, he
felt he was the heart of the team.
</P>
<P>
   While he was able to start all 16 games for the Patriots last
season with the unsturdy knee, he was given the boot when the
season ended.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots' brass figured they needed salary cap room and gave
him an ultimatum: Play for less or take a walk. Armstrong balked.
He had his knee repaired and hoped for a better offer. It never
came.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he accepted a low-ball figure from the Patriots on the
eve of training camp. He returned to the fold so late that his
biographical data in the team media guide was deleted and now has
to be inserted.
</P>
<P>
   All that is history. He is back where he belongs, on the
Patriots' front line. He now can concentrate on football.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to the lineup Sunday during the Patriots' 31-21 loss
to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, their first game at Foxboro Stadium
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong was warmly received as he left the field. His presence
was welcomed, certainly by the person who will benefit the most,
quarterback Drew Bledsoe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's reassuring to have someone like Bruce protecting your
backside out there on the field,'' said New England's franchise
quarterback, who wasn't sacked in the first half, which was when
Armstrong got his playing time.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong's knee held up well during his first appearance this
exhibition season. ``It felt pretty good,'' he said. ``It certainly
was a lot better than last year.''
</P>
<P>
   The difference between playing with a tore ACL and a repaired
one is confidence. He didn't mind the pain last year. ``Pain is
relative,'' said Armstrong. ``It hurts, but it isn't noticeable, if
that's the right word, when you are out there on the field. What
makes a difference is the stability. You know your knee joint is
going to be stable.''
</P>
<P>
   The offense in the opening half gave the Patriots a 14-10 lead.
New England rushed for 104 yards and the Patriots' lone offensive
touchdown game on a 58-yard run by Kevin Faulk.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong likes the new offensive system.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that we will stick with,'' he said. ``The more
you stay with it, the more of an opportunity you have to hit the
home run.''

MILLEN EARNS HIS STRIPES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Matt Millen received a strong endorsement
after working as an umpire in the officiating crew during the
Patriots-Tampa Bay exhibition game Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your reactions were good,'' supervisor of officials Jerry
Seeman told the Fox television analyst and former NFL player.
``Anybody who watched the game wouldn't know you weren't an NFL
umpire.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, with his biceps bulging from his striped sleeves,
Millen looked more like an ex-NFL player in an NFL umpire's
uniform. But Millen was not doing a farcical impersonation. He took
the apprenticeship seriously, and his positioning and instincts
were more than acceptable during his third-quarter stint
substituting for Ron Botchan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was talking to (former supervisor of officials) Red Cashion
and he told me that if you're not going to have fun, don't do it,''
Millen said. ``I enjoyed it. I can't play anymore, and it's the
next best thing. You do the same reads, you are aware of the same
things. It's third down, and you run through your head what you are
going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Full-time officiating is not likely in Millen's future. But this
was not a lark. Millen spent weeks preparing and relished the
experience.
</P>
<P>
   After a 12-year NFL playing career with the Raiders, 49ers, and
Redskins, Millen is hardly a vicarious wannabe. ``I could easily do
this,'' he said. ``All of a sudden you are back in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Other ex-players might not be lining up for what is considered a
thankless task, one in which anonymity signifies competence, and
flair and individuality are suppressed, at best.
</P>
<P>
   But Millen recommends the experience. ``If guys are willing to
do it, especially the interior guys,'' he said, ``part of the whole
thing is a comfort level and not being intimidated in there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started reverting back to when I was playing, and getting
right in there. The guys said, `Ref, give me some room.' I told
them not to worry about me. Then I thought, wait a minute, I've got
to give these guys some room.''
</P>
<P>
   Millen has the type of personality that could revolutionize the
official's role, and he is not likely to stifle it. It is the type
of personality more suited to announcing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised by TV's effect on how things are called,''
Millen said. ``It doesn't influence the call, but it's considered _
where the ball is when (the foul) happened. If there was a hold and
the ball is on the other side of the field, or if they held but did
not impede progress, you let it go.''
</P>
<P>
   Millen's instincts worked against him when Adam Vinatieri lined
up a 50-yard field goal attempt late in the third quarter. ``I
said, `He can't make that field goal,' and so I went to the other
side for a punt,'' Millen said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Vinatieri stayed on the field and went for the field
goal, his try bouncing into the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Millen's reaction: ``I told you he couldn't make that field
goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Millen seemed prepared for nearly everything _ except a pregame
surprise. ``I woke up at 10 minutes to 6 and went and worked out on
the treadmill and lifted some weights,'' Millen said. ``I came back
to my hotel room, and who do you think was waiting there? Random
drug test.''

BISHOP MOSTLY IN CHECK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GREENIDGE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Michael Bishop got to play the entire second
half of Sunday's Patriots-Buccaneers game, seven series, and his
effort was up and down in the 31-21 New England loss.
</P>
<P>
   In connecting on seven of 17 passes for 157 yards, Bishop, eager
to be quarterback Drew Bledsoe's backup, threw a 32-yard touchdown
pass to rookie wide receiver Shockmain Davis in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had an opportunity to throw Shockmain the ball downfield and
he did his job, he made the catch, he got into the end zone,'' said
Bishop.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop was also sacked four times for 37 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I moved the ball, making some good throws, trying to get the
win,'' he said. ``We lost, though. There were ups and downs and I
can't have them keep me from my performance. I can't have them let
me down from doing my job.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did come out and want to get the win. We're a lot better
team than what we've shown,'' said Bishop of the Patriots, who are
2-2 in the exhibition season, with Carolina on tap Thursday. ``If
we can get everybody on the same page, we can be a good team. If
everything goes right, there's no saying how far we can go.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop's only play of the first half, a Hail Mary pass intended
for wide receiver Chris Calloway, was intercepted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were pretty far from the end zone,'' Bishop said. ``I guess
(offensive coordinator) Charlie Weiss wanted to get the ball down
to the end zone, so I went in and I tried to do my job, even though
I was surprised to come in there.''
</P>
<P>
   There were several dropped passes by his receivers. And in the
third quarter, when Bishop tried to throw a screen pass, the ball
slipped from his hand and Jamie Duncan recovered in the end zone to
give Tampa Bay a 17-14 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw J.R. Redmond in the flat on the right on the screen the
other way and once my hand got started, I lost my grip on the
ball,'' Bishop said. ``I couldn't argue with the referee's call,
but I felt I was going forward on the pass. I really should have
jumped on the ball, but I didn't hear the whistle.''
</P>
<P>
   So it was only a so-so outing for Bishop, and it might have been
the last time the former Heisman Trophy candidate plays in the
exhibition season.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop, known for his ability to scramble when he can't find an
opener receiver, felt he did nothing to hurt his chances, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had confidence when I was throwing short, deep, over the
middle of the field,'' he said. ``It's just a matter of me getting
the ball to the receivers in time and the receivers looking the
ball in all the way and making the catch.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop never gets down on himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the ability to play the game,'' he said. ``If I ever
get down on myself, I feel I'm taking something from myself and my
ability goes to waste.''

BLEDSON, OFFENSE MUST GET MOVING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Drew Bledsoe hasn't been turned into
roadkill yet, and certainly that's something the Patriots' offense
can take pride in.
</P>
<P>
   But if this team is to prove its playoff designs aren't
delusions, the offense is going to have to do something a little
more ambitious at some juncture than merely prolong the
quarterback's survival. And so far, though the Patriots rather
sheepishly maintain that they're making progress when in possession
of the ball, it must be impossible to detect with the naked eye,
because both Bledsoe and new coach Bill Belichick pleaded ignorance
Sunday until they could get a gander of the game films.
</P>
<P>
   It must be delayed gratification, for in the immediate aftermath
of the 31-21 exhibition loss to the Buccaneers at Foxboro Stadium,
the only emphatic assessment of offensive coordinator Charlie
Weis's reconstructed attack was a doleful summary from wide
receiver Terry Glenn, who was involved to the tune of one catch for
4 yards during the half that the regulars played.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just not clicking right now,'' said Glenn. ``We're not
in synch. We're not taking what Charlie has given us and put it all
together. We better get our act together soon or there ain't going
to be no time. I don't know what it's going to take, but we better
get our act together quick or it's going to be a long season.''
</P>
<P>
   The deadline, specifically, is two weeks, when the Patriots and
Bucs open the regular season here. And while Bledsoe insisted,
``I'm looking forward to playing them for real,'' witnesses to
Sunday's debacle couldn't fathom why.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it was because the Patriots won the varsity game, 14-10,
before the scrubs took over in the second half. Then again, the
defense produced half that total on Ty Law's 20-yard fumble return
for a touchdown in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps it was because the Patriots regulars didn't once turn
the ball over in the red zone. Then again, the Patriots regulars
didn't once snap the ball in the red zone. The lone offensive TD
came on Kevin Faulk's 58-yard burst up the middle on a routine play
that turned into a glorious fluke. Even Belichick conceded, ``Some
plays went for touchdowns that weren't the way anyone would design
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe completed 10 of 18 passes for a modest 77 yards _ 24 of
them to Tony Simmons on the second play from scrimmage, with no
gain longer than 14 yards thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   Save for Faulk's TD, the offense's deepest penetration was on
its first possession, which advanced to the Tampa 31 but yielded
only a 49-yard field goal miss by Adam Vinatieri.
</P>
<P>
   There also were five abominably timed penalties for 45 yards and
a fumble at midfield that killed New England's second possession
and last semblance of a sustained drive.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Bledsoe could allude only vaguely to signs of quality
but was left with this epitaph:
</P>
<P>
   ``We did some good things today. We moved the ball well and
converted a few third downs (two of six) here and there. We had the
one big play with Kevin and we did do some good things. But if we
continue to commit turnovers and penalties, we're not going to
score against anybody. The bottom line is, if we make mistakes,
there's no way we're going to be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   And make no mistake about this: The Patriots don't need game
films to realize that.

IN RUNNING RACE, FAULK SHOULD BE WINNER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ If the criterion is what you do on the
football field and not what somebody hopes you'll do, the Patriots'
running back competition has been decided for now.
</P>
<P>
   With four days to go before the final exhibition game and 13
days to go before the regular-season opener against the Tampa Bay
Buccaneers, it is clear who has earned the starting job. The ball
should be handed to Kevin Faulk, the little running back from
Louisiana State whose presence you at least notice when he's in the
backfield.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean rookie J.R. Redmond might not deserve the job
before the year is out, and it doesn't mean shopworn Raymont Harris
has no place here. It just means Faulk has done more with his
opportunities than anyone else. Is that not what should decide who
plays and who stays?
</P>
<P>
   This has nothing to do, by the way, with his 58-yard touchdown
run in the first half of Sunday's 31-21 loss to the Buccaneers at
Foxboro Stadium, because that was simply a matter of a perfect
block and a back hitting the hole full bore, as he should.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that it was Faulk who did it and not one of the other
backs may be in part attributable to his quickness or it may not,
but it alone is not a reason to give him the ball on Sept. 3. One
would think any back worthy of an NFL uniform could have run
through that massive hole for long yards.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, it is simply to say that, among Patriots running backs,
Faulk has done the most in the four exhibition games played so far,
both as a runner and a receiver. That doesn't make him Curtis
Martin, but it makes him the best and most productive back they
have at the moment. And I really don't want to hear any noise about
how well somebody else has looked in practice or about Faulk's
vulnerabilities if he plays too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I can be an every-down back,'' Faulk said. ``I just
have to prove it to the coaching staff.''
</P>
<P>
   He still may not have won the job, but what can he do? You get
paid to play on game day, and thus far this summer it has been
Faulk who has done the best playing. Admittedly, Redmond hasn't had
as much of a chance, because of a nagging inflamed tendon in his
groin that led to minor surgery in April and kept him out of
practice until two weeks ago and out of a game until Sunday. But
staying on the field is part of the skill of playing in the NFL,
and thus far the rookie has not been able to do that.
</P>
<P>
   Because of that, he should sit behind Faulk unless he shows
something Thursday night against the Carolina Panthers that hasn't
been seen in these parts since Martin's departure, because Sunday's
eight carries for 7 yards didn't do anything to take the limelight
from Faulk.
</P>
<P>
   As for Harris, he looked good in the exhibition opener against
the 49ers, but that performance was tempered by the fact San
Francisco is godawful on defense and had seven starters out to
boot. He rushed for 58 yards on nine carries that night, but since
then has gained only 30 yards on 18 carries, an average of less
than 2 yards per rush.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, he has not hit the holes with anywhere near the quickness
or enthusiasm he did that first night. After he sat out more than a
year with a broken leg, slow progress might be expected from
Harris, but he should not be rewarded with a starting job simply
because he once rushed for 1,000 yards years ago in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   And Redmond certainly didn't show anything Sunday to justify him
being handed the ball ahead of Faulk, who is averaging 7 yards a
carry (22 carries, 156 yards) and also has had nine receptions for
another 80 yards. Even coach Bill Belichick, who said when he
arrived that Faulk seemed best suited for third-down duty, had to
concede that based on production only one guy has earned a Sept. 3
start.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevin's had good production in all the preseason games,''
Belichick said. ``He's shown an ability to make some yards on his
own. The question is, will he continue to do that as an every-down
player? The question is, how effective will he be if he carries as
a regular back?''
</P>
<P>
   Not at the moment it's not the question. At the moment the
question is, how effective has anyone else been in any situation?
The answer to that answers any questions Belichick might have about
Faulk's ability to hold up under the strain of full-time service.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he'll still deserve the job a month from now is anyone's
guess. Whether he is the long-term answer is an even greater
unknown. But what is clear is that, at the moment, Kevin Faulk is
New England's best running back.
</P>
<P>
   That being the case, he's earned one thing from Bill Belichick
if the coach does what his old mentor, Bill Parcells, always said
he did _ that is, go by what you see.
</P>
<P>
   He's earned the ball.

   Six months ago a loose grouping of reformists, committed to the
rule of law and democratic accountability, won Iran's parliamentary
election. The future looked uncertain but promising. Even though
the conservatives still controlled all the effective instruments of
state power _ the judiciary, the police, the army, the media _ it
was fair to hope they would feel obliged to pay heed to the
strength of the people's voice. So they did _ but only to shut it
up. &QL;

   This week's reunion of divided Korean families was an

dismantling one of the last frontiers of the Cold War. All the hugs

Koreas are continuing to make progress towards unifying their
divided peninsula. Yet the small number who made the journey shows
just how wide the gulf still is.

   Was there ever an airplane so beautiful to look at? No wonder
the fate of Concorde, now indefinitely withdrawn from service by
both British Airways and Air France, inspires a twinge of regret
even in the sternest critic of this ludicrous airborne indulgence.
Alas, Concorde's commercial life is clearly drawing to a close;
even if flights eventually resume following the recent
crash-induced suspension, it will be difficult to rebuild lost
confidence among passengers. At the risk of saying, ``We told you
so,'' it is worth examining the lessons to be gleaned from the
remarkable airplane's history. &QL;

   MONCKS CORNER, S.C. _ Visitors who drive over the Wadboo Bridge,
30 miles from downtown Charleston, S.C., soon come upon a majestic
alley of ancient live oaks, the entrance to the monastery of our
Lady of Mepkin. Twenty-eight Trappist monks live at Mepkin Abbey,
following the simple Cistercian routine of prayer,
scripture-reading and manual labor that was laid sown 900 years ago
in France. To this serene abbey comes an increasingly steady stream
of visitors these days, men and women of all faiths exhausted by
the punishing pace of life and work in 21st-century America. &QL;

Languedoc region. And his role model? While Bove, the media-savvy
leader of France's small farmers, targets McDonald's as the symbol
of the evils of globalization, the silver-haired Guibert has in his
sights a Californian wine giant, Robert Mondavi. In particular,
Guibert wants to block Mondavi's plan for a winery in the beautiful
garrigue, or wooded scrub, right next to his own vineyard. &QL;

   SYDNEY _ When Lorna Cubillo was seven, she and 15 other
aboriginal children were put into a truck by white officials at an
outback settlement in the Northern Territory. ``As the truck left
Phillip Creek, everyone was crying and screaming,'' she says. ``I
remember seeing the mothers chasing the truck. And then they
disappeared in the dust of the track.'' Peter Gunner had a similar
experience when he was six. Mrs. Cubillo is now 62 and Mr. Gunner
is 52. They are members of Australia's ``stolen generation'':
aboriginal people, estimated to number at least 55,000, who were
removed from their families as children and put in foster homes,
many run by churches. &QL;

   NEW YORK _ When the Johns Manville corporation agreed to be
acquired by a buyout firm and thus return to private ownership in
early July, a painful chapter in corporate history came to an end.
From the 1920s until the 1970s, Manville had been the largest
American producer of asbestos, a product belatedly discovered to be
extraordinarily dangerous. Ensuing claims led to a bankruptcy in
1982 that penalized existing shareholders in favor of a trust fund
for victims. Yet if Manville's time in purgatory is drawing to a
close, it looks likely that others will be forced down the same
path by increasingly virulent asbestos-related litigation. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ Historians studying turn-of-the-century events may
be baffled by the Iraqi element. Why, they might ask, did American
and British aircraft bomb a warehouse, and perhaps a railway
station too, in southern Iraq in mid-August 2002? &QL;

   SYDNEY _ When Lorna Cubillo was seven, she and 15 other
aboriginal children were put into a truck by white officials at an
outback settlement in the Northern Territory. ``As the truck left
Phillip Creek, everyone was crying and screaming,'' she says. ``I
remember seeing the mothers chasing the truck. And then they
disappeared in the dust of the track.'' Peter Gunner had a similar
experience when he was six. Mrs. Cubillo is now 62 and Mr. Gunner
is 52. They are members of Australia's ``stolen generation'':
aboriginal people, estimated to number at least 55,000, who were
removed from their families as children and put in foster homes,
many run by churches. &QL;

   NEW YORK _ When the Johns Manville corporation agreed to be
acquired by a buyout firm and thus return to private ownership in
early July, a painful chapter in corporate history came to an end.
From the 1920s until the 1970s, Manville had been the largest
American producer of asbestos, a product belatedly discovered to be
extraordinarily dangerous. Ensuing claims led to a bankruptcy in
1982 that penalized existing shareholders in favor of a trust fund
for victims. Yet if Manville's time in purgatory is drawing to a
close, it looks likely that others will be forced down the same
path by increasingly virulent asbestos-related litigation. &QL;

   Six months ago a loose grouping of reformists, committed (at
least by local standards) to the rule of law and democratic
accountability, won Iran's parliamentary election. The future
looked uncertain but promising.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the conservatives still controlled all the effective
instruments of state power _ the judiciary, the police, the army,
the broadcast media _ it was fair to hope they would feel obliged
to pay heed to the strength of the people's voice. So they did; but
only to shut it up.
</P>
<P>
   President Muhammad Khatami and his followers run the government
and are a majority in parliament. But the power of both
institutions is circumscribed, and their decisions can be overruled
by the clerical establishment, personified by Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei, Iran's ``supreme leader.''
</P>
<P>
   The main reformist message, calling for more openness and
democracy (although still within the clerical system), was spread
by an explosion of free-speaking newspapers and magazines. It was
backed cautiously by academics and incautiously by students.
</P>
<P>
   But hard-liners, recognizing their most effective enemy, cracked
down on the press ferociously. By now, all the liberal papers have
been closed, parliament has been told by Ayatollah Khamenei to
forget even thinking of reopening them, and many prominent
journalists have been arrested.
</P>
<P>
   The illiberalism that darkened Iran before President Khatami's
election in 1997 has not altogether returned. Socially, people can
still breathe more easily than they did under his predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   Young men and women can mix in public without too much fear of
being intimidated by a gang of Islamist bullyboys, or watch
satellite television with less likelihood of a crippling fine.
</P>
<P>
   These changes are probably irreversible. With Iran's vast army
of youngsters facing political and economic dead ends, even
hard-liners recognize the need for a modest degree of tolerance in
social matters.
</P>
<P>
   In other directions, however, doors are closing. Reformers,
these days, are challenged with ``legal violence.'' Academics
returning from international conferences are liable to be accused
of treason _ which makes them reluctant to accept invitations to
travel or play their part on the lecture circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Students, long in the forefront of Iranian politics, have been
battered into caution by the cruel prison sentences meted out to
those of their number, such as Ahmad Batebi, who took part in a
pro-democracy protest last summer.
</P>
<P>
   And the brutality of the police, and of their Islamist helpers,
in squashing a demonstration on the first anniversary of this
protest has discouraged ordinary people from supporting the cause.
</P>
<P>
   What, under these conditions, does ``reform'' amount to? Given
the shackled nature of the presidency, Khatami has based his policy
on the belief that the only way to move forward was to take
Ayatollah Khamenei with him: if he set himself against the supreme
leader, he would be bound to trip.
</P>
<P>
   A fair argument, but it would be more convincing if he and his
movement were in fact getting anywhere. Disillusion with Khatami
and his softly-softly approach is bound to swell.
</P>
<P>
   Iranians have been allowed to vote for what they want, but were
then stopped from getting it. People are now much more alert than
they were to what is going on; they cannot easily be fooled. And
they may not accept stagnation.
</P>
<P>
   If the clerical system cannot be reformed, their minds will turn
to the disintegration of that system. If gentle voices are gagged,
less gentle ones will take over. &QL;

<P>
   This week's reunion of divided Korean families was an
emotionally charged affair, but also an important step in
dismantling one of the last frontiers of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   It involved 100 people from the North and another 100 from the
South travelling to each others' capitals to greet relatives they
had not seen for 50 or more years.
</P>
<P>
   All the hugs and tears were a welcome sign that the two Koreas
are continuing to make progress towards unifying their divided
peninsula. Yet the small number who made the journey shows just how
wide the gulf is.
</P>
<P>
   Those from prosperous, democratic South Korea were ordinary
people, mostly very elderly, who were selected in a computer
lottery; those from impoverished North Korea were mostly
luminaries, handpicked for their loyalty to the Stalinist regime
and carefully watched over by minders.
</P>
<P>
   And, however they were chosen, these were the lucky ones.
Millions of other Koreans have relatives whom they have not seen
for half a century, and can but hope that next time it will be
their turn. The signs are that there may be a next time.
</P>
<P>
   This week's reunion was a direct result of the summit held in
June in the North's capital, Pyongyang, between that country's
leader, Kim Jong Il, and the South's president, Kim Dae Jung.
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the hermit kingdom began to emerge from his shell
earlier this year in a diplomatic charm offensive. But what is he
up to?
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics observe that whether Kim Jong Il is genuinely
interested in reforming his regime or simply trying to shore it up,
he expects substantial rewards for his country. So far, things have
gone well for him.
</P>
<P>
   This week the two Koreas also opened liaison offices in
Panmunjom, a village in the demilitarized zone where the armistice
was negotiated that ended the Korean War in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   Next month work should begin on reconnecting the cross-border
railway. Power lines could be next, with the South helping the
North to overcome its electricity shortages. Southern companies are
being offered investment opportunities in the North.
</P>
<P>
   The two Kims plan further cabinet-level talks, which could lead
to a visit by Kim Jong Il to the South's capital, Seoul. Or could
not: he has indicated that his journey will depend on continued
``progress.'' Translation: concessions, perhaps from non-Korean
parts of the world as well.
</P>
<P>
   Outsiders, though, do not see the issues quite as the Koreans
do. A collapse of the North's economy would worry the outside
world, but not, directly, much damage it; in contrast, the results
could devastate the economy of the South.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, the Americans are deeply alarmed at the possibility
that North Korea may develop long-range missiles that could reach
the western United States; but that would add little to the
military threat faced by South Korea from the North.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Jong Il has said what he would like the Americans to do:
drop his country from their list of states that sponsor terrorism.
This would allow it access to more international aid. It was
originally included in the list for harboring members of the
Japanese Red Army who had hijacked a Japanese airliner in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   The North's subsequent nasty behavior has given the Americans no
reason to change their minds: North Korean agents are accused of
planting the bomb in Yangon, the capital of Myanmar, which in 1983
killed 17 visiting South Koreans, including several cabinet
ministers. They are blamed for the blowing up of a South Korean
airliner in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea also has been belligerent over international efforts
that would, in effect, pay it for freezing its nuclear program.
Then, two years ago it test-fired a missile over Japan.
</P>
<P>
   It is the rest of the world that needs to see more progress from
North Korea. Kim Jong Il clearly likes to appear to foreigners
arriving in Pyongyang as a modern, if Mao-suited, man who is a
movie buff and connoisseur of French wine. Yet he remains
worryingly unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
   When Vladimir Putin visited Pyongyang last month, the North's
leader told the Russian president that it was prepared to stop
selling missiles to other nations if the Americans would launch its
satellites for it. Yet this week the North Korean leader told a
group of visitors from the South that he had only been joking.
</P>
<P>
   The two Koreas face a huge task in restoring _ rather,
reinventing _ relations. They have made remarkable progress. It is
to be hoped that they continue to do so. But Kim Jong Il has still
to convince the world that he is sincere about opening up, if he
wants his country to stop being considered as a dangerous rogue
nation. &QL;

   ``It is impossible that old prejudices and hostilities should
longer exist, while such an instrument has been created for the
exchange of thought between all the nations of the earth.'' Thus
Victorian enthusiasts, acclaiming the arrival in 1858 of the first
transatlantic telegraph cable.
</P>
<P>
   People say that sort of thing about new technologies, even
today. Biotechnology is said to be the cure for world hunger. The
sequencing of the human genome will supposedly eradicate cancer and
other diseases.
</P>
<P>
   The wildest optimism, though, has greeted the Internet. A whole
industry of cybergurus has enthralled audiences (and made a fine
living) with exuberant claims that the Internet will prevent wars,
reduce pollution, and combat various forms of inequality.
</P>
<P>
   However, although the Internet is still young enough to inspire
idealism, it has also been around long enough to test whether the
prophets can be right.
</P>
<P>
   Grandest of all the claims are those made by some of the savants
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology about the Internet's
potential as a force for peace.
</P>
<P>
   One guru, Nicholas Negroponte, has declared that, thanks to the
Internet, the children of the future ``are not going to know what
nationalism is.'' His colleague, Michael Dertouzos, has written
that digital communications will bring ``computer-aided peace''
which ``may help stave off future flare-ups of ethnic hatred and
national breakups.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea is that improved communications will reduce
misunderstandings and avert conflict. This is not new, alas, any
more than were the claims for the peacemaking possibilities of
other new technologies.
</P>
<P>
   In the early years of the 20th century, airplanes were expected
to end wars, by promoting international communication and (less
credibly) by making armies obsolete, since they would be vulnerable
to attack from the air.
</P>
<P>
   After the First World War had dispelled such notions, it was the
turn of radio. ``Nation shall speak peace unto nation,'' ran the
fine motto of Britain's BBC World Service. Sadly, Rwanda's Radio
Mille Collines disproved the idea that radio was an intrinsically
pacific force once and for all.
</P>
<P>
   The mistake people make is to assume that wars are caused simply
by the failure of different peoples to understand each other
adequately. Indeed, even if that were true, the Internet can also
be used to advocate conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Hate speech and intolerance flourish in its murkier corners,
where governments (as France is now discovering) find it hard to
intervene.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Internet undeniably fosters communication, it will
not put an end to war. But might it reduce energy consumption and
pollution? The Center for Energy and Climate Solutions (CECS), a
Washington think-tank, has advanced just such a case, based largely
on energy consumption figures for 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   While the American economy grew by 9 percent over those two
years, energy demand was almost unchanged _ because, the CECS
ventures, the Internet ``can turn paper and CDs into electrons, and
replace trucks with fiber-optic cable.'' No wonder one enthusiastic
newspaper headline begged, ``Shop online _ save the earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, earth-saving is harder than that. Certainly, shopping
online from home is far less polluting than driving to a shopping
mall. Ordering groceries online, and having them delivered, means
that, if the logistics are handled efficiently, one truck journey
can replace dozens of families' separate car trips. Reading
newspapers, magazines and other documents online is more efficient
than printing and transporting them physically.
</P>
<P>
   Yet doing things online is more energy-efficient only if it
genuinely displaces real-world activities. If people shop online as
well as visiting the bricks-and-mortar store, the result is an
overall increase in energy consumption.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the Internet, it is now easy for Europeans to order
books and have them extravagantly air-freighted from America before
they are available in Europe. And it is more efficient to read
documents online only if doing so replaces, rather than adds to,
the amount of printed bumf.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, as more and more offices and homes connect to the
Internet, millions of PCs, printers, servers and other devices
gobble significant quantities of energy.
</P>
<P>
   Home computers are becoming part of the fabric of everyday life,
and are increasingly left switched on all the time. One
controversial assessment concluded that fully 8 percent of
electricity consumption in America is due to Internet-connected
computers.
</P>
<P>
   The construction of vast ``server farms'' _ warehouses full of
computers and their attendant cooling systems _ has contributed to
the overloading of the electrical power network that has caused
brownouts in Silicon Valley. &QL;

   What about the belief that the Internet will reduce inequality?
According to a study carried out by America's Department of
Commerce, households with annual incomes above $75,000 are more
than 20 times as likely to have Internet access as the poorest
households.
</P>
<P>
   President Bill Clinton, struck by the ``digital divide'' between
rich and poor, argues that universal Internet access would help to
reduce income inequality.
</P>
<P>
   But, as the cost of using the Internet continues to fall
(services offering free access are becoming the norm, and a basic
PC can now be had for little more than a video recorder or a large
television), the true reason for the digital divide between rich
and poor will become apparent.
</P>
<P>
   The poor are not shunning the Internet because they cannot
afford it: the problem is that they lack the skills to exploit it
effectively. So it is difficult to see how connecting the poor to
the Internet will improve their finances. It would make more sense
to aim for universal literacy than universal Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, even in the more ludicrous claims for the Internet, there
may be germs of truth. This open network, so hard for governments
to control, may indeed help to give more power to individual
citizens and encourage democracies. As democratic governments
rarely fight each other, that might promote peace. &QL;

   Even inequality may, in some cases, be reduced thanks to the
Internet. A computer programmer in Bangalore or Siberia can use the
Internet to work for a software company in Seattle without leaving
home, and can expect to be paid a wage that is closer to that of
his virtual colleagues at the other end of the cable.

   The effect is to reduce income inequality between people doing
similar jobs in different countries, but to increase the inequality

   The Internet changes many things. It has had a dramatic impact

   ``It is impossible that old prejudices and hostilities should
longer exist, while such an instrument has been created for the
exchange of thought between all the nations of the earth.'' Thus
Victorian enthusiasts, acclaiming the arrival in 1858 of the first
transatlantic telegraph cable.
</P>
<P>
   People say that sort of thing about new technologies, even
today. Biotechnology is said to be the cure for world hunger. The
sequencing of the human genome will supposedly eradicate cancer and
other diseases.
</P>
<P>
   The wildest optimism, though, has greeted the Internet. A whole
industry of cybergurus has enthralled audiences (and made a fine
living) with exuberant claims that the Internet will prevent wars,
reduce pollution, and combat various forms of inequality.

<P>
   Was there ever an airplane so beautiful to look at? No wonder
the fate of Concorde, now indefinitely withdrawn from service by
British Airways as well as Air France, inspires a twinge of regret
even in the sternest critic of this ludicrous airborne indulgence.
</P>
<P>
   Few critics have been sterner than The Economist which, in the
late 1960s, conducted a campaign against the use of taxpayers'
money on a project that would never recoup its capital costs.
</P>
<P>
   Concorde's commercial life is clearly drawing to a close: even
if flights eventually resume, it will be difficult to rebuild lost
confidence among passengers.
</P>
<P>
   At the risk of saying, ``We told you so,'' it is worth examining
the lessons to be gleaned from the airplane's history.
</P>
<P>
   Concorde was an engineer's delight: it took the jet-bomber
technologies that had evolved at the end of the Second World War
and pushed them to the frontiers of the possible, or indeed beyond
the frontiers, given that the aircraft's initial prototype could
not have crossed the Atlantic with a full passenger load.
</P>
<P>
   But the technology turned out to be a blind alley. Glamorous
though supersonic travel seemed to be, it was also so noisy that
most governments banned it over their countries.
</P>
<P>
   At subsonic speeds, the aircraft guzzles fuel. And Concorde's
limited range means that it cannot fly supersonically across the
world's largest body of water, the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the elderly aircraft's technical limits could now be
overcome. Indeed, governments and aerospace companies have
periodically flirted with building a son-of-Concorde, which could
cross the Pacific and carry three times as many passengers.
</P>
<P>
   But a sign of Concorde's commercial failure is that its design
has not been refined and replaced. One reason is that some design
limits are insuperable. A bigger airplane would make a bigger boom;
and more Concordes would do more environmental harm to the ozone
layer.
</P>
<P>
   However, a greater problem than the technology is the market.
Concorde was built in the days when air travel was for the elite.
In fact, it could never have covered its operating costs merely
from chief executives prepared to scrunch into its small body and
pay $5,000 or so to save four hours getting to New York, London or
Paris.
</P>
<P>
   It has become profitable only by dint of clever marketing,
especially by BA, of supersonic travel to tourists such as those
killed in last month's crash.
</P>
<P>
   For air travel has taken off in a quite different direction from
the one that Concorde's engineers and bureaucrat backers expected.
Flying is a mass market, with two-thirds of passengers travelling
for fun, not for business.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing, building for the market, understood that capacity
mattered more than speed: its hugely successful 767s fly more
slowly than did the 707 (which in turn flew more slowly than the
VC10).
</P>
<P>
   While Concorde sped off on a flight path to nowhere, the true
advance in air travel has turned out to come from refinements of
large jets, which have grown steadily cheaper and more reliable.
</P>
<P>
   If commercial supersonic travel has a future, it is more likely
to be in the executive jet than the commercial carrier. A smaller
Concorde would make a smaller boom, and enough seriously rich folk
might want something even grander than their own Gulfstream V to
justify the immense cost.
</P>
<P>
   For the great majority of business travellers, however, there
are far better ways to speed up the irksome business of air travel.
One is to invest in ground transport: time can be saved by
unclogging (or leapfrogging) the roads between airports and city
centers.
</P>
<P>
   Another is to improve the management of flights. It is far
easier to end delays caused by air-traffic control than to quiet a
sonic boom.
</P>
<P>
   A third is to dismantle the hub-and-spoke system of routes
which, especially in the United States, compounds travel delays by
forcing passengers to take two or three flights to reach their
destination, any one of which may ruin their journey by running
late.
</P>
<P>
   The technology that will do most to speed up air travel in the
next couple of decades is on the ground, in computers and not in
the sky, however lovely the bodywork. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ It is fitting that Bill Clinton should have given
his valedictory performance at a Democratic National Convention in
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   No group has stood more solidly behind the boy from Arkansas
than the Hollywood crowd. And no group better symbolizes both the
attraction and the ultimate hollowness of his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton arrived in office eight years ago surrounded by a
praetorian guard of Rhodes scholars and policy wonks. But over time
his center of gravity shifted relentlessly from Ivy League
universities to Hollywood swimming pools.
</P>
<P>
   The entertainment community was probably the only group of
sensate Americans that never harbored any doubts about his behavior
in the Monica Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   And the grateful president became such a familiar figure in L.A.
that the locals will tell you he has both a mansion and a job
waiting for him when he retires, courtesy of Tom Hanks and Steven
Spielberg.
</P>
<P>
   The film industry's adulation for Clinton was palpable this
week. On Saturday evening Stan Lee, the creator of Spider-Man,
hosted a $25,000-a-couple bash for Hillary Rodham Clinton's Senate
campaign, with guests gorging themselves on lobster and beef and
listening to such deep political thinkers as Whoopi Goldberg and
Ted Danson.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning the Clintons headed off to another Malibu
estate, Barbra Streisand's, this time to raise money for the
president's library in Little Rock.
</P>
<P>
   A few Democrats worried that the first couple were soaking up
attention and money that should have gone to Al Gore. But by the
time they left town on Tuesday she had a reported $4 million and he
had $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is the heir to a long tradition of mutual attraction
between the capitals of glamour and power.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin Roosevelt and Dwight Eisenhower both cozied up to the
Hollywood moguls (FDR even wrote a screenplay). John Kennedy
partied with Frank Sinatra and dallied with Marilyn Monroe. Ronald
Reagan traded in a career as a B-list actor for one as an A-list
president.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton has carried the relationship to new heights.
Previous presidents have always been careful to keep Hollywood at
arm's length. Clinton grew ever more dependent on Tinseltown with
every scandal that broke over his head, culminating in his use of
Harry Thomason to produce his finger-wagging denial that he ever
had sex with ``that woman.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hollywood crowd took to using the Lincoln Bedroom as their
favorite hotel in the capital: no sooner had Barbra moved out than
``Hanoi'' Jane Fonda moved in.
</P>
<P>
   They increasingly dominated the guest lists to glitzy state
dinners. And they encouraged everything that was least impressive
about Clinton, from his moral evasiveness to his over-reliance on
personal charm.
</P>
<P>
   If Kennedy is forever associated with the intellectuals who
designed the New Frontier, Clinton will forever be associated with
the stars who made him one of their own.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton years brought two other depressing changes in the
Hollywood-Washington connection. The first was the explosion in the
quantity of cash changing hands. The Democratic Party's various
national committees now receive an estimated 20 percent of their
money from the Los Angeles area.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, the entertainment industry had already given the
Democrats some $50 million during the Clinton years, more than any
other interest group except the trade unions and the trial lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The second change is that Hollywood has become almost a
one-party town. Hollywood Republicans were already a beleaguered
minority when Reagan came to power. (A Reagan aide once sent out
2,000 letters seeking support from the president's old stamping
ground. He got 100 replies, 90 of them hate letters.) But now they
can probably be numbered on the fingers of one hand.
</P>
<P>
   Young actors who harbor secret doubts about liberal orthodoxies
have little choice but to hide their true feelings in Tinseltown.
</P>
<P>
   So what? Isn't money the lubricant of American politics? And
aren't most artists unrepentant lefties? Perhaps. But it is worth
noting that people do not give huge amounts of money without
expecting something in return.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood's massive financial muscle has succeeded in
marginalizing important discussions, not least about the malevolent
impact of the industry's love affair with violence, just as it has
succeeded in opening foreign markets to Hollywood's products.
</P>
<P>
   It is also worth noting that filmmakers who present relentlessly
partisan views of the world risk provoking a reaction.
</P>
<P>
   America is never going to recover from the culture war that has
disfigured its politics for a generation if prime-time programs
such as ``The West Wing,'' a political soap opera about an
idealized version of the Clinton White House, routinely portray
religious fundamentalists as bigots and supporters of school
vouchers as closet members of the Ku Klux Klan.
</P>
<P>
   After Clinton's departure from office, things will be different.
The film industry's political bias prevents it from embracing
George W. Bush. But it cannot conceal its disappointment with
Clinton's chosen successor, as if it were being asked to replace a
favorite star with a reject from the afternoon soaps. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (100-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 850) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Gore has added to the tension by choosing one of Hollywood's
leading critics, Joseph Lieberman, as his running mate. Lieberman
makes no secret of the fact that he thinks some of Hollywood's
products are polluting the country's culture: to dramatize his
point, he presents a silver-sewer award to the worst offenders.
</P>
<P>
   He has backed legislation that Hollywood hates, from the 1996
law requiring that television sets include the v-chip technology
which lets parents filter what their children watch to his more
recent bid to promote official inquiries into whether entertainment
companies are marketing violent material to children. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,050) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   This does not mean that the imaginary metro line between Capitol
Hill and Bel Air will close down any time soon. Politicians will
always need money (and will always prefer to ask for it in
Hollywood rather than at conventions of chartered accountants in
Peoria). And the more thoughtful film types will always crave the
validation that comes from associating with the powerful.
</P>
<P>
   But it does mean that the relationship between the capital of
power and the capital of glamour is about to get a lot less intense
_ and less stomach-turning _ than it has been under Clinton. &QL;

   ALBUQUERQUE AND SANTA FE, N.M. _ The Rio Grande starts life
majestically, cutting deep through the volcanic canyons of the
Colorado plateau. But by the time it reaches the desert plains of
southern New Mexico it is a shade of its former self, depleted by
irrigation channels that feed the state's thirsty crops.
</P>
<P>
   Now the river faces a new challenge: fast-growing cities
increasingly desperate for water.
</P>
<P>
   Fights over water have dominated the history of the American
Southwest. In an area where land is abundant and cheap, the only
thing standing in the path of unbridled population growth is the
supply of water in the region's rivers and aquifers.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, New Mexico has avoided the water battles that
have torn apart Arizonans and Californians. Yet, with the state's
population expected to grow hugely over the next 25 years, and with
most of that growth projected in the largest cities of Albuquerque,
Santa Fe and Las Cruces, the state has become a new battleground in
the familiar tussles between developers, environmentalists, city
officials and the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   The demand for water in New Mexico's cities used to be met by
underground aquifers. But those reserves are expected to be largely
depleted over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Albuquerque and Santa Fe are planning a shift to surface water
by 2004, which means tapping (reluctantly, they insist) the flows
of the Rio Grande.
</P>
<P>
   By the terms of an agreement known as the San Juan-Chama
project, the cities have rights each year to over 50,000 acre-feet
of water that has been diverted from the Colorado River to the Rio
Grande (an acre-foot is enough water to cover an acre to the depth
of a foot).
</P>
<P>
   The cities insist that the plan will be phased in gradually, to
minimize its effect on water levels in the river. Environmentalists
do not believe them. The scheme, they say, will simply place
further demands on an already over-exploited stretch of water.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 50 years, farmers have been sucking an
ever-increasing amount out of the Rio Grande. According to John
Horning of the Forest Guardians, based in Santa Fe, New Mexico's
farmers have for years had carte blanche to divert the river as
they see fit, creating an inefficient system of irrigation canals
that wastes more water than it actually delivers to crops.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, environmentalists claim that water diversions
upstream have acted as a tourniquet, jeopardizing wildlife habitats
farther down the river.
</P>
<P>
   The matter is currently tied up in court, with a bundle of
lawsuits brought by environmentalists to protect endangered
species, such as the silvery minnow, that live in the southern
stretches of the river in New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits contend that, under the terms of the federal
Endangered Species Act, an adequate water flow must be maintained
to ensure a proper habitat for the minnow.
</P>
<P>
   In a victory for environmentalists, federal courts recently
ruled that 170,000 acre-feet of Rio Grande water be allocated this
year to allow silvery minnows to swim in the style to which they
are accustomed.
</P>
<P>
   Such federal mandates do not sit well with New Mexico's water
officials, who fear they will hinder the state as it attempts to
deliver water to Texas under the Rio Grande Compact.
</P>
<P>
   The compact, made in 1938, divides the Rio Grande between
Colorado, New Mexico and Texas, and requires New Mexico to deliver
over 700,000 acre-feet of water each year to the Elephant Butte
reservoir in the southern part of the state. It is then sent along
to El Paso, in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But as upstream burdens on the Rio Grande multiply, New Mexico
is finding it increasingly difficult to fulfil the terms of the
compact.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the trouble is that, when the deal was signed, New
Mexico had fewer demands for agricultural and municipal water than
its neighbors to the north and south. So it was given less. Now its
cities are growing fast, and it needs more.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, concerns about the Rio Grande's endangered
wildlife have also led to the closure of a big channel in the south
that once delivered water to Elephant Butte more efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   For Norman Gaume of New Mexico's Interstate Stream Commission,
it is simple. There is just not enough water to meet the demands of
everyone who wants it. Hence the need for hard decisions.
</P>
<P>
   But, as the battle begins, one thing seems certain: New Mexico
will have to keep the Texans happy. Like the neighborhood bully who
can out-muscle anyone, Texas will settle for nothing less.
</P>
<P>
   Gaume recalls the ominous words of a Texas commissioner of the
Rio Grande Compact: ``Deliver, or we'll see you in court.'' &QL;

reservoir in the southern part of the state. It is then sent along
to El Paso, in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But as upstream burdens on the Rio Grande multiply, New Mexico
is finding it increasingly difficult to fulfil the terms of the
compact.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the trouble is that, when the deal was signed, New
Mexico had fewer demands for agricultural and municipal water than
its neighbors to the north and south. So it was given less. Now its
cities are growing fast, and it needs more.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, concerns about the Rio Grande's endangered
wildlife have also led to the closure of a big channel in the south
that once delivered water to Elephant Butte more efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   For Norman Gaume of New Mexico's Interstate Stream Commission,
it is simple. There is just not enough water to meet the demands of
everyone who wants it. Hence the need for hard decisions.
</P>
<P>
   But, as the battle begins, one thing seems certain: New Mexico
will have to keep the Texans happy. Like the neighborhood bully who
can out-muscle anyone, Texas will settle for nothing less.
</P>
<P>
   Gaume recalls the ominous words of a Texas commissioner of the
Rio Grande Compact: ``Deliver, or we'll see you in court.'' &QL;

   MONCKS CORNER, S.C. _ Visitors who drive over the Wadboo Bridge,
30 miles from downtown Charleston, S.C., soon come upon a majestic
alley of ancient live oaks, the entrance to the monastery of Our
Lady of Mepkin.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-eight Trappist monks live at Mepkin Abbey, following the
simple Cistercian routine of prayer, scripture-reading and manual
labor that was laid down 900 years ago in France.
</P>
<P>
   To this serene abbey comes an increasing stream of visitors, men
and women of all faiths exhausted by the punishing pace of life and
work in 21st-century America.
</P>
<P>
   These ``retreatants'' usually stay in the abbey between one and
six days. They pray with the monks (attending the first service of
the day, at 3:20 in the morning, if they wish), observe the same
silence as the monks, eat the same vegetarian fare.
</P>
<P>
   The abbey's guest facilities, most with private baths, are full
much of the time, and rooms for weekends are booked solid for the
next six months. Both single people and married couples can be
accommodated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most come for the silence,'' explains Brother Joshua as he
takes day visitors around the church and the grounds. The monks
hope that their visitors will ``find peace, joy and perspective on
life.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the aim of Henry Luce, publisher of Time, and his wife,
Clare Boothe Luce, playwright, congresswoman and diplomat, when in
1949 they gave the Trappists a large part of the property, which
they had acquired in 1936. The Luces are buried in the abbey
grounds, on a placid green hill overlooking the Cooper River.
</P>
<P>
   Monasteries and spiritual centers throughout the United States
find that demand is booming. Type the words ``spiritual retreat''
into an Internet search engine and it will offer you dozens of Web
sites describing centers for Christians, Jews, Buddhists, Naive
Americans, Hindus, New Agers.
</P>
<P>
   If you cannot actually go there, you can at least take a
breather from the hustle and bustle by making a virtual retreat in
cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Click on Mepkin Abbey's (www.mepkinabbey.org) Web site, and you
can link up to the Web pages of many other Trappist monasteries,
including the Abbey of Gethsemani in Kentucky, Mepkin's parent
community.
</P>
<P>
   Gethsemani's Web site devotes a full article to its most famous
monk, Thomas Merton, author of ``Elected Silence'' and other books.
</P>
<P>
   The advent of the Internet is a mixed blessing for the
monasteries of the 21st century. Mepkin's colorful Web site guides
viewers through the abbey's history, philosophy and services; at
least half of the retreatants book their reservations by e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   This is wonderful, in its way. Yet the Internet can clash with
the monks' way of life: instead of retreating from the world, they
can hook up with it by going on-line.
</P>
<P>
   So Father Francis, Mepkin's abbot (trained in the 1970s as a
concert organist at the Juilliard School in New York City), keeps a
tight rein on Internet use; only a handful of monks have access to
it. The rest have an upcoming consolation.
</P>
<P>
   The 11,000-square-foot, two-story Clare Boothe Luce Library in
the abbey grounds, due to open next January, will house up to
80,000 theological volumes (all computer-catalogued for
availability through the Internet).
</P>
<P>
   Another building project, a new ``seniors'' wing for the
monastery's many ageing monks, is scheduled to open later this
summer. Mepkin has five middle-aged men waiting to join (reflecting
a trend in Catholicism in which men are treating the priesthood as
a second career). Some people even think that older men make better
monks than young ones.
</P>
<P>
   The abbot is reconciled to the fact that a life of poverty,
solitude and simplicity does not appeal to many young men today. A
week is one thing, a lifetime another. &QL;

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ If there is one component of Russia's conventional
armed forces that still keeps western defense planners awake at
night, it is the submarine fleet.
</P>
<P>
   With most of Russia's surface ships rusting away, and the number
of battle-ready army divisions languishing at less than a tenth of
the old Soviet total, it is all the more striking that Moscow's
subs have retained their ability to play underwater games of
hide-and-seek with their American counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Submarines, moreover, are the only sort of big weapons platform
that post-Soviet Russia has continued to build for itself, rather
than for shady overseas customers.
</P>
<P>
   It is less than a year since the Severodvinsk shipyard in the
Arctic turned out its latest version of the Akula (Shark), a sneaky
sub that has managed to pop up unexpectedly near naval bases in
America. Lower-tech, but still stealthy and formidable, are the
diesel-powered submarines that Russia has supplied to China, India
and Iran.
</P>
<P>
   As for the giant submarines that carry Russia's ballistic
missiles, their strategic importance is huge, and growing. By 2003,
some 60 percent of Russia's long-range arsenal will be deployed on
these boats, up from 43 percent now.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring, when the newly elected President Vladimir Putin
wanted to prove his macho credentials, a sleepover on a nuclear
submarine seemed a natural way of doing it.
</P>
<P>
   All this helps to explain the profound embarrassment that the
Russian leadership, civilian and military, must be feeling over the
disaster which befell the Kursk, a nuclear-powered (though
apparently not nuclear-armed) submarine in the Barents Sea, near
Norway, on Aug. 12.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 100 sailors, over half of them officers, confined
to a dark, bitter-cold, unventilated metal box on the ocean floor,
the navy found itself struggling, and failing, to cope not just
with a human disaster but a public-relations fiasco as well.
</P>
<P>
   It looked bad enough that no submarine rescue vessel was on
hand, as would normally be expected during a big maritime exercise.
Then the top brass maintained its prickly refusal to accept western
help as it undertook three unsuccessful attempts to dock a rescue
capsule with the ill-fated sub.
</P>
<P>
   Even if that failed, said the navy, it could still use
inflatable pontoons to raise the vessel. When, on Aug. 16, the
Russians finally overcame their reluctance and accepted foreign
help, it looked to be too late.
</P>
<P>
   With a British mini-submarine and Norwegian divers on their way
to the site, but not expected to get there until Saturday, the
Russians confirmed that they were no longer picking up signs of
life from the sub.
</P>
<P>
   It looked as though, in effect, some of the Arctic fleet's most
senior officers, along with their men, were sacrificed to a cold
Soviet-style concept of secrecy and pride.
</P>
<P>
   The sub was taking a leading part in Russia's biggest show of
naval force for five years: a war game in the Arctic, to be
followed by the deployment of an aircraft carrier, the Kuznetsov,
in the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
   All these moves were supposed to give substance to Putin's
recent pledge that Russia would soon return to the high seas as an
oceangoing naval power, capable of defending trade routes _ or
busting embargoes.
</P>
<P>
   While military muscle-flexing goes down well, many Russians were
puzzled, exasperated and dismayed by the behavior of both the top
brass and their president during the Kursk debacle. At one point,
naval commanders suggested that a collision had occurred; then they
spoke of an explosion or a brush with an old mine.
</P>
<P>
   There was particularly harsh media criticism of the belated call
for help, and this while the hitherto popular President Putin
remained on his vacation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (125-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 625) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The accident that forced the Kursk to the ocean floor, about 150
metres (490 feet) below the surface, was mysterious and
devastating. With its double-layered hull, this class of submarine,
known as the Oskar-2, was designed to withstand torpedo attacks,
while packing enough punch to sink aircraft carriers.
</P>
<P>
   Even, for example, extensive flooding of its torpedo bays would
not, by itself, have crippled the Kursk; western specialists were
baffled over what could have incapacitated the boat and forced the
crew to resort to battery power, lasting for only a few days.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a vivid illustration of the appalling state of the
Russian submarine fleet,'' says Joanna Kidd of Britain's
International Institute for Strategic Studies.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the Kursk was an antique: it was built in 1995. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF 125-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 900) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The incident shows the serious problems afflicting all parts of
Russia's defense establishment, even those that command high
prestige and can generate export earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The future looks as problematic for Russia's submarine fleet as
the other services. While 20 new attack submarines have entered
service since the Soviet collapse, the pace is slowing: only five
have been commissioned since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a massive question mark over Russia's ability to
construct enough new strategic submarines to carry a bigger part of
its nuclear deterrent; all 21 of the large boats now in service
will reach the end of their service life within ten to 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Russia can hardly afford to maintain its submarines, let alone
build new ones. It has designed a new missile-carrying boat, the
Borey, but construction of the first model is slow; it will be
finished by 2008 at best. &QL;

   ANIANE _ ``Jose Bov(acute)e is my friend,'' declares Aim(acute)e
Guibert, the 75-year-old maker of Daumas Gassac wines, the finest
of the Languedoc region.
</P>
<P>
   And his role model? While Bov(acute)e, the pipe-smoking and
media-savvy leader of France's small farmers, targets McDonald's as
the symbol of the evils of globalization, the silver-haired Guibert
_ a speaker at a protest rally when Bov(acute)e went on trial in
June for trashing a McDonald's building site _ has in his sights a
Californian wine giant, Robert Mondavi.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Guibert wants to block Mondavi's plan for a
winery in the beautiful garrigue, or wooded scrub, right next to
his own vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   It is an uneven contest. Guibert's family-owned domaine,
nestling in the hills above the town of Aniane, produces a mere
120,000 bottles a year of its superb red wine _ Robert Parker,
America's taste pundit, positively drools over it _ and 70,000 of
white _ ``also a knockout,'' as Parker puts it.
</P>
<P>
   Mondavi, though still family-controlled, is a quoted company
that produces over 90 million bottles a year, with an annual net
income of over $370 million.
</P>
<P>
   To hedge its bets geographically, the firm already produces wine
in Italy, Chile and southern France.
</P>
<P>
   Guibert, whose vines are tended by hand and allowed to mature
with no artificial irrigation, mixes respect with derision: ``Have
you seen how Americans make wine? It's an industrial product.
Everything is controlled _ and the end is beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   Guibert's chances do not look promising. Mondavi has a polished
public-relations operation in place. Its local representative,
David Pearson, whom Guibert dismisses as ``an American violinist''
playing on public opinion, spent two years searching for this
oenologically perfect spot.
</P>
<P>
   Mondavi, he says, does not plan mass production but just 240,000
bottles a year of a high-quality Syrah-based red wine made with
much the same care as Daumas Gassac.
</P>
<P>
   As to the charge of environmental damage, he notes that Guibert
himself also cleared the garrigue to make his wine.
</P>
<P>
   One ecologists' group even suggests that the Mondavi plan, which
covers ten plots, separated by garrigue, may promote biodiversity.
</P>
<P>
   The project, which depends on Mondavi obtaining a 99-year lease
on communal land, also has local political support. The Socialist
mayor of nearby Montpellier, George Fr(circumflex)eche, and his
friends in Aniane back it. Last month the Aniane town council
approved the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Mondavi is offering to help the 232 members of the
local wine cooperative to upgrade and market their wines.
</P>
<P>
   Given that 40 percent of last year's harvest is still unsold,
and the region's wine growers have taken to the streets to protest
at foreign imports, the offer is hard to refuse.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, though the final decision rests with the
national agricultural minister, and Guibert vows to keep up a legal
challenge, the Americans may well start clearing their land by next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Like it or not, locals are resigned. ``The wine-growers of
Aniane,'' comments one, ``will end up as the workers of Mondavi.'' &QL;

<P>
   SYDNEY _ When Lorna Cubillo was seven, she and 15 other
aboriginal children were put into a truck by white officials at an
outback settlement in the Northern Territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the truck left Phillip Creek, everyone was crying and
screaming,'' she says. ``I remember mothers beating their heads
with sticks and rocks. They were bleeding. They threw dirt over
themselves. I remember seeing the mothers chasing the truck. And
then they disappeared in the dust of the track.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Gunner had a similar experience when he was six and living
in an aboriginal camp at Utopia Station, a cattle property near
Alice Springs. ``I didn't see the welfare blokes and they suddenly
grabbed me by the arms and dragged me towards the truck. My mother
was there. She was crying and so were her sisters. I thought the
men were taking me away to be killed.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Cubillo is now 62 and Mr. Gunner is 52. They are members of
Australia's ``stolen generation'': aboriginal people, estimated to
number at least 55,000, who were removed from their families as
children and put in foster homes, many run by churches.
</P>
<P>
   At the home where she ended up in Darwin, Cubillo was assaulted
by a missionary; Gunner was sexually assaulted at his Alice Springs
home, also by a missionary.
</P>
<P>
   Like thousands of their kind, they lost all contact with their
families.
</P>
<P>
   Having lived with the traumas all their lives, Cubillo and
Gunner launched a court action against the Australian government
last year, claiming they were unlawfully abducted and that the
government in Canberra breached its duty of care towards them.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Australia's six states pursued similar native-child
separation policies for more than 40 years until the mid-1960s.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubillo-Gunner action was seen as a test case over an issue
that has caused soul-searching in Australia since a report in 1997
revealed for the first time the full story of the stolen
generation.
</P>
<P>
   The government, led by the prime minister, John Howard, fought
the case and applied early on to have it thrown out of court.
Maurice O'Loughlin, the federal judge hearing it, refused.
</P>
<P>
   That persistence produced hopes of victory among supporters of
the pair. These were heightened when O'Loughlin took the
unprecedented step of asking that his judgment in Darwin on Aug. 11
be shown live on television.
</P>
<P>
   They were disappointed. O'Loughlin accepted the two aborigines'
accounts of their sufferings as children. But he dismissed their
cases, because he found no evidence that the native patrol officers
who removed them had violated the law at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a huge void,'' he concluded. ``We know that Mrs.
Cubillo was taken away, but we do not know why.'' This is the nub
of where the campaign is likely to go from here.
</P>
<P>
   The Howard government, keen to avoid liability for compensation
payments, has argued that the stolen children were placed in
welfare institutions for their own good.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the government sparked widespread outrage
when it submitted to a parliamentary inquiry that the stolen
generation did not really exist, because the numbers of children
involved were small. O'Loughlin slapped that argument down,
pointedly declaring that neither the evidence nor his judgment
``deny the existence of the stolen generation.''
</P>
<P>
   There is evidence that, at least until the 1950s, the separation
policies were driven by racial more than welfare concerns: to
assimilate the mainly mixed-race children who were removed, in the
belief that white Australia would eventually triumph and the
aboriginal race would die out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Breeding out the color'' was how some officials at the time
described the policy.
</P>
<P>
   The case has become a key one for modern Australia's moves
towards reconciliation with its indigenous people. The judgment,
with its narrow focus on questions of law, has shown how inadequate
the court system is to resolve this issue, with its complex and
painful historical dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the judge concluded that the infant Gunner was not
removed in 1956 against his mother's wishes: he cited as evidence
her thumbprint on a form of request that the boy be given a
``western education.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard has taken the judgment as justification for his
government's refusal to make a national apology to the stolen
generation. But the issue will not go away, and it could bring the
government under more scrutiny as Australia prepares to host the
Olympic Games next month.
</P>
<P>
   The government spent A$10 million ($5.8 million) fighting the
case _ money, say its critics, that would have been better spent
compensating those who were stolen.
</P>
<P>
   Another 1,000 compensation cases are in preparation, and the
Cubillo-Gunner one may go to appeal. ``We've been knocked on the
head so many times,'' says Gunner. ``But they will not destroy our
spirit.'' &QL;

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ Bad news for female managers: Their subordinates
resent being disciplined by them. Men and women alike would far
rather be scolded by a male boss than a female one.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a study of gender and discipline at work, by Leanne
Atwater, a professor at the School of Management at Arizona State
University, and two colleagues, finds that women dislike being told
off by another woman even more than men do.
</P>
<P>
   Many studies of male and female bosses have claimed that the
sexes differ in their styles of leadership: women do better at the
people side, men at the getting-the-job-done side.
</P>
<P>
   Sociologists have studied the different reactions of girls and
boys to discipline at school: boys get used to being reprimanded
whereas girls, who are more rarely rebuked, take it more
personally.
</P>
<P>
   But nobody seems to have studied discipline and gender at work.
Atwater and her colleagues interviewed 163 workers from a broad
range of jobs who had been disciplined in a variety of ways, from
being fired to being ticked off.
</P>
<P>
   In about 40 percent of cases, they found, subordinates changed
their behavior as a result of their telling-off, and female bosses
were as successful in this as men.
</P>
<P>
   But male bosses were much more severe than women: they were
three times as likely to suspend or sack a subordinate, and only
half as likely to give merely an oral wigging.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, when female subordinates were asked if they felt
responsible for their bad behavior, 52 percent said no when a
female boss read the riot act _ but only 18 percent when the boss
was male.
</P>
<P>
   One explanation for such differences, suggested by a member of
the audience at the Academy of Management conference in Toronto,
where the paper was recently presented, is that women tend to
resolve conflicts quickly _ and are therefore blamed for
overreacting _ while men wait in the hope that things will blow
over.
</P>
<P>
   Another explanation, from Alice Eagly, a professor of psychology
at Northwestern University, is that women are recent arrivals in
managerial roles, and so have less legitimacy than men.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a problem of ``gender spillover'': people assume
women are kind and gentle at home, and expect the same at work.
</P>
<P>
   Spillover, though, works both ways. The paper is called ``Wait
Until Your Father Gets Home,'' a line that small family
subordinates are all too used to hearing. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Sociologists have studied the different reactions of girls and
boys to discipline at school: boys get used to being reprimanded
whereas girls, who are more rarely rebuked, take it more
personally.
</P>
<P>
   But nobody seems to have studied discipline and gender at work.
Atwater and her colleagues interviewed 163 workers from a broad
range of jobs who had been disciplined in a variety of ways, from
being fired to being ticked off.
</P>
<P>
   In about 40 percent of cases, they found, subordinates changed
their behavior as a result of their telling-off, and female bosses
were as successful in this as men.
</P>
<P>
   But male bosses were much more severe than women: they were
three times as likely to suspend or sack a subordinate, and only
half as likely to give merely an oral wigging.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, when female subordinates were asked if they felt
responsible for their bad behavior, 52 percent said no when a
female boss read the riot act _ but only 18 percent when the boss
was male.
</P>
<P>
   One explanation for such differences, suggested by a member of
the audience at the Academy of Management conference in Toronto,
where the paper was recently presented, is that women tend to
resolve conflicts quickly _ and are therefore blamed for
overreacting _ while men wait in the hope that things will blow
over.
</P>
<P>
   Another explanation, from Alice Eagly, a professor of psychology
at Northwestern University, is that women are recent arrivals in
managerial roles, and so have less legitimacy than men.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a problem of ``gender spillover'': people assume
women are kind and gentle at home, and expect the same at work.
</P>
<P>
   Spillover, though, works both ways. The paper is called ``Wait
Until Your Father Gets Home,'' a line that small family
subordinates are all too used to hearing. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ Bad news for female managers: Their subordinates
resent being disciplined by them. Men and women alike would far
rather be scolded by a male boss than a female one.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a study of gender and discipline at work, by Leanne
Atwater, a professor at the School of Management at Arizona State
University, and two colleagues, finds that women dislike being told
off by another woman even more than men do.
</P>
<P>
   Many studies of male and female bosses have claimed that the
sexes differ in their styles of leadership: women do better at the
people side, men at the getting-the-job-done side.
</P>
<P>
   Sociologists have studied the different reactions of girls and
boys to discipline at school: boys get used to being reprimanded
whereas girls, who are more rarely rebuked, take it more
personally.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ When the Johns Manville Corporation agreed to be
acquired by a buyout firm and thus return to private ownership in
early July, a painful chapter in corporate history came to an end.
</P>
<P>
   From the 1920s until the 1970s, Manville had been the largest
American producer of asbestos, a product belatedly discovered to be
extraordinarily dangerous. Ensuing claims led to a bankruptcy in
1982 that penalized existing shareholders in favor of a trust fund
for victims.
</P>
<P>
   Yet if Manville's time in purgatory is drawing to a close, it
looks likely that others will be forced down the same path by
increasingly virulent asbestos-related litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Since March, the shares of four large industrial firms _ Owens
Corning, Armstrong Industries, USG and W.R. Grace _ have been
hammered. The two with most financial strength, Owens Corning
(insulation) and Armstrong (flooring), have seen their credit
ratings downgraded as well.
</P>
<P>
   In each case, the companies had previously said they had
reserves sufficient to cover fully any asbestos claims, but they
have recently been forced to bump up their estimates of potential
liabilities, thus raising the suspicion that further increases are
to come.
</P>
<P>
   More devastatingly, another two firms _ Pittsburgh Corning
(glass insulation) and Babcock and Wilcox (boilers) _ have this
year gone bankrupt, citing asbestos claims as the reason.
</P>
<P>
   The filing by Babcock came after it had already settled 340,000
claims at a cost of $1.6 billion and had become unable to see any
resolution. ``The claims,'' the company groaned, ``have become
intolerable.''
</P>
<P>
   What is the alternative? Elihu Inselbuch, a lawyer for
plaintiffs in both of these cases and another asbestos-related
bankruptcy, Raytech Corp., is blunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The liabilities exceed the value of assets of all these
companies,'' he says. ``Even a liability half the size puts them
under water. There's nothing you can get but the company.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, expect the Manville model to be repeated.
Expect, too, the number of litigious victims to rise.
</P>
<P>
   When Manville first filed for bankruptcy in 1982, it reckoned on
17,000 claims. It had upped that fivefold by 1988 and has so far
settled 320,000 claims, with another 70,000 pending. It expects at
least 500,000 more, with the final claim to be submitted in 2049.
</P>
<P>
   In total, it has paid out almost $2.4 billion, another $1
billion awaits disbursement, and yet another $1.5 billion should
come from Manville's sale. In time, these numbers may appear small.
</P>
<P>
   Owens Corning's involvement with asbestos stemmed from a single
product, an insulated pipe manufactured between 1958 and 1972, with
total sales of $135 million (less than $800 million in today's
money). Yet it has already paid out $4 billion in claims.
</P>
<P>
   A number of factors push up these claims. Asbestos-related
problems have a long latency period, while treatment has become
more expensive.
</P>
<P>
   The potential for cashing in has also become more widely known
(provoking several fraud investigations). And plaintiffs' lawyers
have become more imaginative, going after not only producers of
asbestos products, but also firms that merely used asbestos, says
Kenneth Bradley, editor of Asbestos Litigation Reporter.
</P>
<P>
   He cites as an example a $34 million decision that went against
a division of Royal Dutch/Shell, an oil company, in April. Shell
never made anything from asbestos but, like many oil firms, used it
in its refineries.
</P>
<P>
   Other firms that must be surprised to find themselves caught up
in lawsuits include Campbell's Soup and Gerber, a baby-food maker.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor may be timing. According to a lawyer involved in
the cases, earlier this year efforts failed to pass federal
legislation that would control payments.
</P>
<P>
   While these drew wide support, they faced strong opposition from
trial lawyers as well as a likely veto from President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, so the idea goes, the Congress and government may
change and be less sympathetic to endless lawsuits. Thus there is a
rush to file suits fast.
</P>
<P>
   There are signs that the asbestos-related companies, sick of
taking body blows, are starting to lash out themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In an intriguing reversal of roles, the Manville Trust, along
with several other defendants in asbestos cases, will go before a
Federal Appeals Court next month to get clearance for
multibillion-dollar claims against tobacco manufacturers (Owens
Corning has filed a similar suit in California).
</P>
<P>
   The premise is that the effects of asbestos poisoning are far
worse when combined with smoking cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   Even the most battered old bruisers, it seems, can still swing
the odd punch. &QL;

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ Historians studying turn-of-the-century events may
be baffled by the Iraqi element. Why, they might ask, did American
and British aircraft bomb a warehouse, and perhaps a railway
station too, in southern Iraq in mid-August 2000?
</P>
<P>
   Simple, the texts will say. To protect the southern Iraqis from
the dictator in Baghdad, American and British aircraft are
patrolling the skies, preventing the Iraqis from attacking their
dissidents. Every now and then, when radar is turned in their
direction, they drop bombs on Iraqi antiaircraft sites.
</P>
<P>
   Precision bombing, regrettably, is not always as precise as it
should be. But did the patrols at least render southern Iraqis
safer from persecution? There is little evidence they did.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam Hussein will go down in the history books as one of the
nastier dictators. The question is whether his sins justify
American and British petulance at their failure to get rid of him.
</P>
<P>
   The air patrols and the bombing, more effective in protecting
the autonomous Kurdish zone in the north than in the unliberated
south, are in any event a pinprick in Iraq's flesh compared with
the continuing ten-year United Nations sanctions on Iraq,
preventing it from selling its oil freely.
</P>
<P>
   The original reason for the sanctions was right and proper.
Iraq, defeated in war after invading and occupying its neighbor,
Kuwait, was to be made to destroy all its most unpleasant weapons,
and to be monitored in a way that made future production
improbable. The sanctions would then be lifted.

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ Historians studying turn-of-the-century events may
be baffled by the Iraqi element. Why, they might ask, did American
and British aircraft bomb a warehouse, and perhaps a railway
station too, in southern Iraq in mid-August 2000?
</P>
<P>
   Simple, the texts will say. To protect the southern Iraqis from
the dictator in Baghdad, American and British aircraft are
patrolling the skies, preventing the Iraqis from attacking their
dissidents. Every now and then, when radar is turned in their
direction, they drop bombs on Iraqi antiaircraft sites.
</P>
<P>
   Precision bombing, regrettably, is not always as precise as it
should be. But did the patrols at least render southern Iraqis
safer from persecution? There is little evidence they did.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam Hussein will go down in the history books as one of the
nastier dictators. The question is whether his sins justify
American and British petulance at their failure to get rid of him.
</P>
<P>
   The air patrols and the bombing, more effective in protecting
the autonomous Kurdish zone in the north than in the unliberated
south, are in any event a pinprick in Iraq's flesh compared with
the continuing ten-year United Nations sanctions on Iraq,
preventing it from selling its oil freely.
</P>
<P>
   The original reason for the sanctions was right and proper.
Iraq, defeated in war after invading and occupying its neighbor,
Kuwait, was to be made to destroy all its most unpleasant weapons,
and to be monitored in a way that made future production
improbable. The sanctions would then be lifted.
</P>
<P>
   After strenuous efforts, the elimination of weapons was nearly
complete. Not quite: Iraq, defiant to the last, kept some
biological bits and pieces tucked away.
</P>
<P>
   Following a series of rows, and some fierce American bombing,
the inspection regime collapsed. Nowadays nobody can control or
monitor whatever horrible weapons Iraq may be developing.
</P>
<P>
   But the sanctions regime continues, even though its original
purpose has gone up in smoke.

<P>
   &UR; CLOSE TO THE WIND &LR; , by Pete Goss. (Carroll &AMP; Graf, $15.95.)
Competing in a round-the-world single-handed yacht race, the author
ended up rescuing a fellow sailor and battling six-story waves.
Writing in The New York Times Book Review last year, Barbara Lloyd
said, ``You are immersed in his passion.''
</P>
<P>
   Another disastrous ocean race, off Australia, is recounted in
 &UR; KNOCKDOWN: The Harrowing True Account of a Yacht Race Turned
Deadly &LR; , by Martin Dugard (Pocket Books, $13.95). This is ``a
melodramatic but nonetheless riveting chronicle,'' Elizabeth
Hightower wrote in 1999, ``a story that simply won't let go.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A CERTAIN AGE &LR; , by Tama Janowitz. (Anchor, $13.) The Hamptons,
in New York, are the setting for the tragicomic story of a young
woman of diminished prospects who sees marriage to a wealthy man as
the only thing that can save her. The novel ``offers nimble
commentary on the mating scene and upmarket beach house
architecture,'' Henry Alford wrote last summer.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A SEASON IN THE SUN &LR; , by Roger Kahn. (University of Nebraska,
$12.95.) The author of ``The Boys of Summer'' traveled the nation
in mid-1976, talking baseball with players at various levels, from
small-college teams to World Series champions. ``My only complaint
against `A Season in the Sun' is its length _ there isn't enough of
it,'' Donald Hall said in The New York Times Book Review in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Nebraska Press has also reissued Kahn's  &UR; GOOD
ENOUGH TO DREAM &LR;  ($15.95), about his year as president and part
owner of the low-minor-league Utica Blue Sox. This ``incongruous
owner'' is ``a skilled storyteller who was presented with a
lifetime's supply of colorful characters,'' Bob Ryan wrote in 1985.
Both books have new afterwords by the author.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A RAGE TO LIVE: A Biography of Richard and Isabel Burton &LR; , by
Mary S. Lovell. (Norton, $19.95.) An eminent, or perhaps notorious,
Victorian, Sir Richard Burton was an explorer, scholar and linguist
who translated the ``Kama Sutra'' and slipped into the forbidden
city of Mecca, in Arab disguise. This is ``an extraordinary
biography,'' James R. Kincaid wrote in The New York Times Book
Review in 1999. The author shows Isabel Burton to be ``as
resolutely tactless as her husband but also as courageous, defiant
and smart.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CHARLOTTE GRAY &LR; , by Sebastian Faulks. (Vintage International,
$14.) This novel follows a Scottish woman's journey into
Nazi-occupied France during World War II to find a missing RAF
pilot. ``What is essentially a love story turns into a sensitive,
powerful reflection on moral anguish in Vichy France,'' Anita Gates
wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PARADISE, NEW YORK &LR; , by Eileen Pollack. (Temple University,
$17.95.) In a coming-of-age story, a young white woman tries to
save her family's crumbling Catskills resort and falls in love with
the reclusive handyman, who is black. ``Pollack's first novel
succeeds, sometimes too didactically, in taking on such large
themes as racism and bigotry, love and loyalty,'' Ruth Coughlin
wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MURDER DUET: A Musical Case &LR; , by Batya Gur, translated by Dalya
Bilu. (Harper Perennial, $14.) The cerebral Israeli policeman
Michael Ohayon returns in the fourth in a series of mysteries, this
time investigating the murders of classical musicians. ``Gur's
introspective detective unravels her complicated plot with his
usual intelligence,'' Marilyn Stasio said in The New York Times
Book Review last year. ``But for pure reading pleasure, nothing
touches the smart discussions on music and art.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A THIRST FOR RAIN &LR; , by Roslyn Carrington. (Kensington, $12.)
The lives of neighbors who share a cramped communal yard intersect
and collide in this first novel, set in the hills of Trinidad
during a four-month drought. ``The stage will be washed clean but
the strains of Carrington's powerful redemption song will linger,''
Anderson Tepper wrote in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BOMBSHELL: The Life and Death of Jean Harlow &LR; , by David Stenn.
(Lightning Bug Press, $24.95.) The brief career of a Hollywood
legend who was both sex symbol and comedian is recounted in a
well-documented biography, with a new section of previously
unpublished movie stills. ``Without judgment and without smacking
his lips ... Stenn tells how Harlow's life had run amok even before
she became a star,'' Jeanine Basinger said in The New York Times
Book Review in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Another Hollywood biography by the same author is  &UR; CLARA BOW:
Runnin' Wild &LR;  (Cooper Square, $21.95), which contains a new
filmography. Bow's sex appeal brought her the title of the ``It''
girl, but she was a has-been by the age of 25. ``This is a touching
portrait of a sad and turbulent life,'' Sharon Shervington wrote in
1988.

This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-to,

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: New grand jury should not charge Clinton
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Bill Clinton is indicted and faces potential prison time
after he leaves the presidency for lying under oath about going too
far with Monica Lewinsky, so be it. As all my arch-fiend criminal
friends say, don't do the crime if you can't do the time. (My
arch-fiend criminal friends are into couplets.)
</P>
<P>
   After all, the president got himself into this fix and there is
no reason why an ex-president should be cut any legal slack the
rest of us wouldn't get.
</P>
<P>
   And that is precisely why Clinton shouldn't be charged. Almost
no one else would be in the same circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the mop-up independent counsel, Robert W. Ray, has
impaneled still another grand jury just to cover his own tail if he
decides not to indict. He has already cleared the president and
First Lady in the travel office firings and the matter of the
prodigal FBI files, which, you will recall, were supposed to be
big-time scandals. Maybe Ray would like to be able to plead that a
grand jury made it clear to him indictment would be futile.
</P>
<P>
   Far more typically, however, prosecutors use grand juries to
rubber-stamp indictments the prosecutor was committed to in the
first place. If that's so here, hope the jury summons the gumption
and independence to cool Ray down.
</P>
<P>
   Indictments for perjury and obstruction are usually filed in
circumstances such as Clinton's only if the falsities were
egregious, caused financial or other harm and justice has not
otherwise been done. None of those apply.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton lied only when he was finally trapped by what he knew
was a years-long, richly funded and multi-pronged political drive
to get something, anything, on him, and to maneuver him, when the
Monica thing hit the grapevine, with partisan lawsuits meant to
torpedo his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   No one was out anything because he lied about private sex.
(Indeed, you could even make an argument that a gentleman SHOULD
lie to protect his lover.) Remember that the testimony was
eventually ruled irrelevant anyway.
</P>
<P>
   And has justice not been done? Clinton had to pay $850,000 to
get out of the Paula Jones lawsuit that right-wing foundations
filed and bankrolled to corner him. A federal judge has fined him
$90,000 for contempt of court for ``false, misleading and evasive
answers that were designed to obstruct the judicial process.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was impeached at enormous personal cost, his presidency
will permanently be knocked down at least one letter grade and he
faces disbarment.
</P>
<P>
   (Another low blow. Seven of the 14 members of the Arkansas
Supreme Court's Committee on Professional Conduct recused
themselves because of past political ties to the president, leaving
the issue to what amounted to a lynch mob. Even then, the
recommendation to disbar was not unanimous, meaning it is being
pressed by a small fraction of the whole panel.)
</P>
<P>
   Letting Clinton skate wouldn't be a case of a double standard in
justice. Forcing him to trial would be. He doesn't deserve that and
the nation doesn't need it.

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Aug. 20, moved Saturday and are repeated Monday.
</P>
<P>
   On the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   PARTY-LOYALTY-REVIEW (Washington) _ Although some rhetorical
sameness wafted from the two recent presidential conventions, there
was little of the partisan bite of yesteryear. Yet two-thirds of
Americans still consider themselves Democrats or Republicans. Party
still matters, and party attachment is still considered a good
predictors of how people will vote _ if they vote. But appealing to
those loyalties, while still wooing the independents who decide
elections, is a complex challenge these days. By Robin Toner.
(moved in `a' category)
</P>
<P>
   FOREST-FIRES-REVIEW (Seattle) _ Amid the worst wildfire year in
nearly half a century, much political finger-pointing is under way.
But the Forest Service, for its part, blames Smokey the Bear and
fire suppression efforts. ``Most of these areas that used to burn
every 10 years or so haven't had a fire in a half-century,'' said a
Forest Service fire ecologist. ``These forests are long overdue.
They were just ready to go.'' By Timothy Egan. (moved in `a'
catgegory)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   SUBMARINE-STORIES-REVIEW (Undated) _ The world has been
transfixed by the sinking of the Russian submarine Kursk and the
desperate attempts to reach the 118 men inside. Tales of sea
adventure and calamity, both in fact and fiction, have always held
deep appeal. But what is it about the sea _ and especially
submarines _ that makes being trapped below the waves often
resonate even more than similar disasters on land, like mine
cave-ins? Part of the answer is that for all the advances in
science, the sea remains a mysterious _ and mystical _ force. By
Christopher Drew.
</P>
<P>
   DISABILITY-STUDIES-REVIEW (San Francisco) _ Pressing the
frontier of disability: it has expanded beyond law, medicine and
public policy into academia, in which it provides another point of
view for Richard III or discusses whether the tippy-toed Barbie
doll is technically disabled. Major universities are developing
disability studies programs. This fall the first international
conference on disability studies will be held in Washington. By
Patricia Leigh Brown.
</P>
<P>
   BASEBALL-VIOLENCE-REVIEW (Undated) _ There have been some ugly
incidents on the baseball field this season but so far nothing has
approached the horrifying moment 35 years ago when politics
intruded on baseball with a shock that many recall vividly today.
What people remember is the violence that exploded on Aug. 22,
1965, during a game at Candlestick Park in the bitterly contested
National League pennant race between the Los Angeles Dodgers and
the San Francisco Giants. But few recall the politics that fueled
it. By Allen Barra.
</P>
<P>
   (will also move in `s' category)
</P>
<P>
   VEEPS-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ With the election 79 days away,
Dick Cheney and Joe Lieberman have already done just about
everything running mates can do for their tickets, from reflecting
well on the presidential nominees who chose them to providing a
lift for their national conventions. But those contributions have
been significant. A look at Cheney, Lieberman and other vice
presidential nominees of campaigns past. By Adam Clymer.
</P>
<P>
   GORE-KISS-REVIEW (Undated) _ In Al Gore's campaign to change his
robotic image, nothing may have helped more than the big smooch. It
also may have signaled that Gore (unlikes some presidents we know)
would be faithful to his wife. By Caryn James.
</P>
<P>
   SOUNDOFMUSIC-SINGALONG-REVIEW (New York) _ ``The Sing-a-Long
Sound of Music,'' the audience participation of the 1965 film
classic, will open here. During standards such as ``Sixteen Going
On Seventeen,'' ``So Long, Farewell'' and ``Climb Ev'ry Mountain,''
moviegoers will sing along to the lyrics, which appear on the
screen as subtitles. By Thomas Vinciguerra.
</P>
<P>
   MILLIONAIRE-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire'' has turned into an empire, with 27 versions being
produced and broadcast in countries around the world. The questions
are almost approaching educational. Some examples are presented.
</P>
<P>
   NY-VIRUS-REVIEW (New York) _ Commercial enterprise springs from
almost every tragedy, and the West Nile virus is no exception. Some
of these ventures, however, seem a bit more dubious than others. By
Jennifer Steinhauer.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Moved in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   IRAN-MEDIA-REVIEW (Undated) _ Iran's crackdown on
reform-oriented writers, editors and media spreads to cartoons. The
conservative courts have closed 24 reformist publications since
late April. A magazine called Tavana was banned after publishing a
caricature of President Mohammad Khatami, who is himself a
reformer. But it showed him without his clerical turban and robe.
That, the court said, amounted to defamation. By Susan Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   U.N.-CARTOONISTS-REVIEW (United Nations) _ At the United
Nations, where one person's joke can strike other people from other
cultures as incomprehensible or offensive, diplomats favor the
universal language of the political cartoon. Over the next few
weeks, a panel of diplomats and American celebrities will choose
the winner of a $10,000 prize for the best political cartoon on a
U.N. theme. By Barbara Crossette.
</P>
<P>
   INDONESIA-JOKES-REVIEW (Jakarta) _ A look at some of the jokes
told by President Abdurrahman Wahid. By Seth Mydans.

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Aug. 20, moved Saturday and are repeated Monday.
</P>
<P>
   On the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   PARTY-LOYALTY-REVIEW (Washington) _ Although some rhetorical
sameness wafted from the two recent presidential conventions, there
was little of the partisan bite of yesteryear. Yet two-thirds of
Americans still consider themselves Democrats or Republicans. Party
still matters, and party attachment is still considered a good
predictors of how people will vote _ if they vote. But appealing to
those loyalties, while still wooing the independents who decide
elections, is a complex challenge these days. By Robin Toner.
(moved in `a' category)
</P>
<P>
   FOREST-FIRES-REVIEW (Seattle) _ Amid the worst wildfire year in
nearly half a century, much political finger-pointing is under way.
But the Forest Service, for its part, blames Smokey the Bear and
fire suppression efforts. ``Most of these areas that used to burn
every 10 years or so haven't had a fire in a half-century,'' said a
Forest Service fire ecologist. ``These forests are long overdue.
They were just ready to go.'' By Timothy Egan. (moved in `a'
catgegory)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   SUBMARINE-STORIES-REVIEW (Undated) _ The world has been
transfixed by the sinking of the Russian submarine Kursk and the
desperate attempts to reach the 118 men inside. Tales of sea
adventure and calamity, both in fact and fiction, have always held
deep appeal. But what is it about the sea _ and especially
submarines _ that makes being trapped below the waves often
resonate even more than similar disasters on land, like mine
cave-ins? Part of the answer is that for all the advances in
science, the sea remains a mysterious _ and mystical _ force. By
Christopher Drew.
</P>
<P>
   DISABILITY-STUDIES-REVIEW (San Francisco) _ Pressing the
frontier of disability: it has expanded beyond law, medicine and
public policy into academia, in which it provides another point of
view for Richard III or discusses whether the tippy-toed Barbie
doll is technically disabled. Major universities are developing
disability studies programs. This fall the first international
conference on disability studies will be held in Washington. By
Patricia Leigh Brown.
</P>
<P>
   BASEBALL-VIOLENCE-REVIEW (Undated) _ There have been some ugly
incidents on the baseball field this season but so far nothing has
approached the horrifying moment 35 years ago when politics
intruded on baseball with a shock that many recall vividly today.
What people remember is the violence that exploded on Aug. 22,
1965, during a game at Candlestick Park in the bitterly contested
National League pennant race between the Los Angeles Dodgers and
the San Francisco Giants. But few recall the politics that fueled
it. By Allen Barra.
</P>
<P>
   (will also move in `s' category)
</P>
<P>
   VEEPS-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ With the election 79 days away,
Dick Cheney and Joe Lieberman have already done just about
everything running mates can do for their tickets, from reflecting
well on the presidential nominees who chose them to providing a
lift for their national conventions. But those contributions have
been significant. A look at Cheney, Lieberman and other vice
presidential nominees of campaigns past. By Adam Clymer.
</P>
<P>
   GORE-KISS-REVIEW (Undated) _ In Al Gore's campaign to change his
robotic image, nothing may have helped more than the big smooch. It
also may have signaled that Gore (unlikes some presidents we know)
would be faithful to his wife. By Caryn James.
</P>
<P>
   SOUNDOFMUSIC-SINGALONG-REVIEW (New York) _ ``The Sing-a-Long
Sound of Music,'' the audience participation of the 1965 film
classic, will open here. During standards such as ``Sixteen Going
On Seventeen,'' ``So Long, Farewell'' and ``Climb Ev'ry Mountain,''
moviegoers will sing along to the lyrics, which appear on the
screen as subtitles. By Thomas Vinciguerra.
</P>
<P>
   MILLIONAIRE-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire'' has turned into an empire, with 27 versions being
produced and broadcast in countries around the world. The questions
are almost approaching educational. Some examples are presented.
</P>
<P>
   NY-VIRUS-REVIEW (New York) _ Commercial enterprise springs from
almost every tragedy, and the West Nile virus is no exception. Some
of these ventures, however, seem a bit more dubious than others. By
Jennifer Steinhauer.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Moved in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   IRAN-MEDIA-REVIEW (Undated) _ Iran's crackdown on
reform-oriented writers, editors and media spreads to cartoons. The
conservative courts have closed 24 reformist publications since
late April. A magazine called Tavana was banned after publishing a
caricature of President Mohammad Khatami, who is himself a
reformer. But it showed him without his clerical turban and robe.
That, the court said, amounted to defamation. By Susan Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   U.N.-CARTOONISTS-REVIEW (United Nations) _ At the United
Nations, where one person's joke can strike other people from other
cultures as incomprehensible or offensive, diplomats favor the
universal language of the political cartoon. Over the next few
weeks, a panel of diplomats and American celebrities will choose
the winner of a $10,000 prize for the best political cartoon on a
U.N. theme. By Barbara Crossette.
</P>
<P>
   INDONESIA-JOKES-REVIEW (Jakarta) _ A look at some of the jokes
told by President Abdurrahman Wahid. By Seth Mydans.

   SEATTLE _ Exactly ninety years ago, on Aug. 20, 1910, in the
choking heat of a summer without rain in the northern Rockies, the
sun disappeared from the sky and a sound not unlike cannon fire
began rattling throughout Montana and Idaho. The Big Burn, as the
3-million-acre firestorm of 1910 was called, eventually consumed
entire towns, killed 87 people and burned a lesson into the
fledgling U.S. Forest Service.
</P>
<P>
   Thereafter, the service vowed, it would snuff out every fire, at
one point swearing to do so by 10 a.m. on the day after the fire
started. The best-known forester of that time, Gifford Pinchot,
equated wildfire with slavery as a historic scourge of the nation.
Another, Bernhard Fernow, blamed ``bad habits and loose morals''
for the fires.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in the midst of the worst wildfire year in nearly half a
century, a new round of finger-pointing is under way. Touring
Montana last week, House Speaker Dennis Hastert blamed the Clinton
administration for not logging the tinder-dry forests.
Environmentalists pointed at the timber industry and development
for altering forest ecology and creating an artificial landscape
ripe for catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   But the Forest Service remains focused on its own primary
culprit: the symbol of fire eradication, Smokey the Bear.
</P>
<P>
   The era of prevention and suppression represented by Smokey and
his shovel may have been good for safety, but it was not the best
thing for forests. The agency had reached that conclusion even
before receiving the additional evidence that foresters drew from
the fires that tore through almost half of Yellowstone National
Park in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Fire is as much a part of nature as creeks and wildflowers. Most
forests have a natural cycle, in which a purging burn comes through
every 10, 20, 50 or 100 years. The cycle may be suppressed,
foresters say, but only at the cost of more powerful fires when it
re-emerges.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a problem when people say these fires are destroying
all these areas,'' said Wiebe, the former Smokejumper. ``It's just
not correct to say a forest is destroyed by fire.''
</P>
<P>
   During the decades when fires were routinely suppressed, forests
choked themselves with excess growth, creating better habitats for
tree-killing insects. The dying trees became tinder.
</P>
<P>
   ``These forests are long overdue,'' said Mick Harrington, a
research fire ecologist with the Forest Service in Montana, a state
that has just been declared a disaster area. ``They were just ready
to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The fires that have already run through 5 million acres this
year are hotter, faster-burning, more ferocious than any burns of
modern times, say the people battling them. And a number of reports
say future fire seasons may be worse, identifying about 40 million
acres of public land as being at risk of catastrophic fire.
</P>
<P>
   Fire suppression is only part of the problem. In some forests,
experts say, logging has removed the biggest and most
fire-resistant trees. Their replacements _ some planted, some
natural _ are crowded stands of young and disease-prone trees, with
500 or more to the acre, where there used to be 50. Foresters also
point to other elements _ excessive grazing by cattle and sheep,
diversion of rivers to newly developing areas _ that have
contributed to what some call ghost forests, spectral stands of
diseased and dying timber now baking, if not yet burning, in the
August sun.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there are many new areas demanding fire protection.
Homes and vacation cottages that have sprung up at the edge of
national forest boundaries have become firefighters' front lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've become so good at putting out fires because that's what
the public wants,'' said Lindon Wiebe, a fire ecology specialist
with the Forest Service in Washington, and a former Smokejumper, as
the service's firefighters are called. ``But what we can do is
pretty small compared to what Mother Nature wants to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as people have gradually learned not to build homes in
areas prone to flooding, they need to understand the danger of
erecting structures in fire zones, says Dr. Phil Omi, a professor
of forest fire science at Colorado State University and director of
the Western Forest Fire Research Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody has got to get the message to these people that they
are putting themselves at risk, whether it's the insurance industry
or the government,'' Omi said. But he said he could not blame the
Forest Service, or homeowners, for being slow to understand the
nature of wild fire in the West. ``Our understanding of forest fire
ecology is relatively new,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Those trying to address the future fire threat are focusing on
two solutions: taking out more trees by logging or thinning, and
deliberately setting fires.
</P>
<P>
   Under Clinton, logging in national forests has declined by
nearly 75 percent, and some critics blame this decline for the
explosive fires. A number of Western senators back the idea of
allowing the timber industry to remove more trees.
</P>
<P>
   However, environmental groups point out that the biggest fires
in Montana and Idaho are burning not in wilderness areas, but in
land that has been developed or logged. Such areas also account for
90 percent of the acreage identified as most vulnerable to
wildfire, the Forest Service says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Commercial logging is not a prescription for forest health _
it is one of the major causes of unhealthy forest conditions,''
said Thomas Powers, chairman of the economics department at the
University of Montana, whose specialty is natural resource issues.
</P>
<P>
   The other solution _ planned fire _ has become a public
relations debacle. Last year, a record 1.4 million acres of Forest
Service land was deliberately burned. Most prescribed burns go off
without trouble. But it only takes one to stir public ire. And this
year, the one that got away, a 43,000-acre blaze set by the
National Park Service near Los Alamos, N.M., destroyed more than
200 homes.
</P>
<P>
   And no matter how convinced the experts are that Los Alamos was
an exception, the fires now raging in every state of the West look
horrific on television, blackening national treasures like Mesa
Verde National Park and raining embers on popular campgrounds.

THE FUNNY, BUT FICTIONAL, MULLAH 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating)  (The Week in Review)  
 By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt _ In the classic Iranian children's tale, the
fictional Mullah Nasreddin rode his donkey facing backwards but
arrived at his destination all the same. He delighted in taking
advantage of the villagers who, in their turn, poked fun at him. He
ate a lot. He paid for nothing. The world, through his myopic and
literal eyes, was a puzzlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I survive this life without dying,'' the wise fool of a
clergyman once sighed, ``I'd be surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   In these days of bitter confrontation between hard-line clerics
and liberal writers in Iran, even a figure as beloved as the Mullah
Nasreddin might feel threatened.
</P>
<P>
   Each week brings the imprisonment or trial of another group of
writers, journalists and editors, and the conservative courts have
closed 24 reformist publications since late April. A magazine
called Tavana was banned after publishing a caricature of President
Mohammad Khatami, who is himself a reformer. But it showed him
without his clerical turban and robe. That, the court said,
amounted to defamation.
</P>
<P>
   Just this past week, another well-known writer, Ibrahim Nabavi,
was sent to prison without a trial after critics filed 75
complaints against him in Press Court.
</P>
<P>
   Nabavi was recently honored by his peers as the country's best
political satirist, but he had another credit to his name. Four
months ago, he published a new edition of the stories of Mullah
Nasreddin, the first time anyone dared to revive the old jokes in
print since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. The book was a hit, in
Iranian terms, selling more than 10,000 copies.
</P>
<P>
   Like other jailed writers, Nabavi is accused by his critics of
ridiculing and tarnishing the image of Islamic clerics in his
newspaper columns. But, as the enduring popularity of Mullah
Nasreddin jokes demonstrates, Iranians have been doing the same for
generations. And the mullah himself, sometimes a miserly bumbler
and sometimes a clever rascal, satirizes Muslim clerics better than
anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Mullah Nasreddin stories are sometimes said to have originated
in Turkey and spread from there, along with the mystical and joyful
Islamic sect of Sufism, to neighboring Muslim lands. But he is a
universal figure. Jokes about country priests, for example, have
long been a staple in Catholic countries like France or Spain,
where men of religion involved themselves in politics or exercised
daily authority over ordinary people. Tales of foolish, even venal,
village sheiks or mullahs are also staple fare in Egyptian and
Iraqi humor.
</P>
<P>
   Mullah Nasreddin _ mullah means a learned man _ is their Iranian
cousin.
</P>
<P>
   Often the jokes ridicule the mullah's pretensions to cleverness.
In one, he takes off his shoes and falls asleep under a tree, only
to find upon waking that someone has made off with the shoes. He
decides to trick the thief into coming back so he removes his
clothes and puts them where his shoes had been. Unfortunately, he
falls asleep again. When he awakes, his clothes are gone.
</P>
<P>
   Another shows the mullah as a sneak. He goes on a trip with
three men. At lunchtime, each brings out the piece of bread he has
brought with him. Mullah Nasreddin says he is not hungry and will
show his generosity by giving his bread to his friends. ``In
return,'' he tells them, ``each of you can give me half of your
bread.''
</P>
<P>
   Often the mullah takes advantage of his neighbors. He borrows a
pot from one and returns two pots. Explaining his beneficence, he
says that the first pot gave birth to the second. Later, he borrows
another pot. This time he never returns it. When his neighbor
complains, the mullah says the pot died.
</P>
<P>
   The neighbor is incensed. ``How can a pot die?'' he demands.
</P>
<P>
   ``You believed it when a pot gave birth,'' Mullah Nasreddin
replies. ``Why should you not believe that a pot died?''
</P>
<P>
   In his introduction to his retelling of the folk tales, Nabavi
wrote that he regarded Mullah Nasreddin as a somewhat noble figure.
The stories emanated from countries that were under foreign
occupation, he wrote, and the mullah was an example of someone who
decided to confront an oppressive system by being ``ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not want to be optimistic,'' Nabavi said, ``but I see him
as the rational reaction of people against tyranny.''
</P>
<P>
   When the book came out earlier this year, Nabavi and his
publishers tried to take precautions. The title mullah was excised
from all the stories: Mullah Nasreddin, as he was called in older
editions of the jokes, became simply Nasreddin. Ahmad Beheshti, an
executive of the Rezaneh publishing house, said the honorific was
removed to head off any problems with the government, which
licenses each book in Iran before it is published.
</P>
<P>
   But Nabavi also took a bit of license with the old stories. In
the traditional tales, these days found only in the homes of older
Iranians who kept their childhood books, the cleric complained that
one neighbor never invited him for a meal. The neighbor told him it
was because the mullah never stopped eating when he went to
someone's house. ``I promise to tell you a story between each
bite,'' the mullah promised him.
</P>
<P>
   In Nabavi's modern version, the mullah slyly played on his
neighbor's religious feelings. ``I promise,'' he said, ``to pray
for you between each bite.''
</P>
<P>
   In the hostile atmosphere of Iranian political life these days,
when Muslim clerics seem to be striking out at anyone who questions
their authority, such a revision might well cause offense.
</P>
<P>
   Nabavi may have anticipated as much. In his book, he noted,
``Mullah Nasreddin has different faces: he can be a wise man or a
stupid man. Both images can be educational.''

THE FUNNY, BUT FICTIONAL, MULLAH 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating)  (The Week in Review)

<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt _ In the classic Iranian children's tale, the
fictional Mullah Nasreddin rode his donkey facing backwards but
arrived at his destination all the same. He delighted in taking
advantage of the villagers who, in their turn, poked fun at him. He
ate a lot. He paid for nothing. The world, through his myopic and
literal eyes, was a puzzlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I survive this life without dying,'' the wise fool of a
clergyman once sighed, ``I'd be surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   In these days of bitter confrontation between hard-line clerics
and liberal writers in Iran, even a figure as beloved as the Mullah
Nasreddin might feel threatened.
</P>
<P>
   Each week brings the imprisonment or trial of another group of
writers, journalists and editors, and the conservative courts have
closed 24 reformist publications since late April. A magazine
called Tavana was banned after publishing a caricature of President
Mohammad Khatami, who is himself a reformer. But it showed him
without his clerical turban and robe. That, the court said,
amounted to defamation.
</P>
<P>
   Just this past week, another well-known writer, Ibrahim Nabavi,
was sent to prison without a trial after critics filed 75
complaints against him in Press Court.
</P>
<P>
   Nabavi was recently honored by his peers as the country's best
political satirist, but he had another credit to his name. Four
months ago, he published a new edition of the stories of Mullah
Nasreddin, the first time anyone dared to revive the old jokes in
print since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. The book was a hit, in
Iranian terms, selling more than 10,000 copies.
</P>
<P>
   Like other jailed writers, Nabavi is accused by his critics of
ridiculing and tarnishing the image of Islamic clerics in his
newspaper columns. But, as the enduring popularity of Mullah
Nasreddin jokes demonstrates, Iranians have been doing the same for
generations. And the mullah himself, sometimes a miserly bumbler
and sometimes a clever rascal, satirizes Muslim clerics better than
anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Mullah Nasreddin stories are sometimes said to have originated
in Turkey and spread from there, along with the mystical and joyful
Islamic sect of Sufism, to neighboring Muslim lands. But he is a
universal figure. Jokes about country priests, for example, have
long been a staple in Catholic countries like France or Spain,
where men of religion involved themselves in politics or exercised
daily authority over ordinary people. Tales of foolish, even venal,
village sheiks or mullahs are also staple fare in Egyptian and
Iraqi humor.
</P>
<P>
   Mullah Nasreddin _ mullah means a learned man _ is their Iranian
cousin.
</P>
<P>
   Often the jokes ridicule the mullah's pretensions to cleverness.
In one, he takes off his shoes and falls asleep under a tree, only
to find upon waking that someone has made off with the shoes. He
decides to trick the thief into coming back so he removes his
clothes and puts them where his shoes had been. Unfortunately, he
falls asleep again. When he awakes, his clothes are gone.
</P>
<P>
   Another shows the mullah as a sneak. He goes on a trip with
three men. At lunchtime, each brings out the piece of bread he has
brought with him. Mullah Nasreddin says he is not hungry and will
show his generosity by giving his bread to his friends. ``In
return,'' he tells them, ``each of you can give me half of your
bread.''
</P>
<P>
   Often the mullah takes advantage of his neighbors. He borrows a
pot from one and returns two pots. Explaining his beneficence, he
says that the first pot gave birth to the second. Later, he borrows
another pot. This time he never returns it. When his neighbor
complains, the mullah says the pot died.
</P>
<P>
   The neighbor is incensed. ``How can a pot die?'' he demands.
</P>
<P>
   ``You believed it when a pot gave birth,'' Mullah Nasreddin
replies. ``Why should you not believe that a pot died?''
</P>
<P>
   In his introduction to his retelling of the folk tales, Nabavi
wrote that he regarded Mullah Nasreddin as a somewhat noble figure.
The stories emanated from countries that were under foreign
occupation, he wrote, and the mullah was an example of someone who
decided to confront an oppressive system by being ``ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not want to be optimistic,'' Nabavi said, ``but I see him
as the rational reaction of people against tyranny.''
</P>
<P>
   When the book came out earlier this year, Nabavi and his
publishers tried to take precautions. The title mullah was excised
from all the stories: Mullah Nasreddin, as he was called in older
editions of the jokes, became simply Nasreddin. Ahmad Beheshti, an
executive of the Rezaneh publishing house, said the honorific was
removed to head off any problems with the government, which
licenses each book in Iran before it is published.
</P>

WITH POLITICS AT THE PLATE, BASEBALL WENT BALLISTIC

<P>
   This baseball season has witnessed a record number of hit
batters and bench-clearing brawls, but so far nothing to match the
most horrifying clash in the sport's history. The racial tensions
and tumultuous politics of the 1960s intruded on baseball 35 years
ago Tuesday with a shock that many fans recall vividly today.
</P>
<P>
   What people remember is the violence. They do not recall, if
they ever knew, the politics that fueled it. On Aug. 22, 1965, the
Los Angeles Dodgers were playing the San Francisco Giants in a
crucial game at Candlestick Park during perhaps the most bitterly
contested pennant race in National League history. No other
incentive would have been needed to pack the ballpark in a game
between the two oldest rivals in the National League, but this one
had the added allure of a marquee matchup between the league's best
pitchers: the Giants' Juan Marichal and the Dodgers' Sandy Koufax.
</P>
<P>
   Neither ace was at his best that day, and by the third inning
the score was 2-1, Los Angeles _ a typical score for a nine-inning
Marichal-Koufax match. Marichal, who was not averse to throwing
inside, knocked down Ron Fairly and Maury Wills. Koufax, who
disliked brush-back pitches he was afraid might kill someone, was
pressured by his catcher, John Roseboro, to retaliate with a
high-and-inside fastball when Marichal came to bat. On the next
pitch, low and inside, Roseboro dropped the ball and picked it up
behind Marichal. He then threw it back to Koufax, barely missing
Marichal's head. Marichal thought it was closer than that; he would
forever claim that the ball nicked his ear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roseboro was sending him a message,'' says Charles Einstein, a
biographer of Willie Mays and a collaborator on Marichal's
biography. Whatever message Roseboro sent, Marichal didn't like it.
He spun around, bat in hand, and began screaming: ``Why you do
that? Why you do that?'' (Einstein said some choice Spanish terms
were sprinkled in as well.)
</P>
<P>
   What has been excised from our collective memory of the incident
is that it was Roseboro who charged Marichal, not the other way
around. For most of the 42,000-plus crowd, the first indication
that something was wrong came when they saw Marichal smashing
Roseboro's head with his bat. Blood immediately began to flow from
a deep scalp wound; to many stunned onlookers it appeared as if
Roseboro's eye had been knocked out. Players and coaches on both
teams rushed toward home plate. Willie Mays, a close friend of
Roseboro's, got there first. He immediately grabbed the Dodger
catcher, partly to protect him and partly, as he later revealed, to
keep him from attacking Marichal. As Mays led Roseboro off the
field he cradled his bleeding head and moaned, ``Johnny, Johnny,
I'm so sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   When order was finally restored, a shaken Koufax walked the next
two hitters and then gave up a three-run homer to Mays, giving the
Giants a 4-2 victory. They may not have realized it that night, but
the Giants season was over. Marichal, 19-9 before the incident,
lost three of his last four decisions after coming back from an
eight-day suspension, which was seen as remarkably light. (Marichal
was also fined $1,750 by the league.)
</P>
<P>
   Brawls in the 1960s were nearly as common as today. Back then,
many fights were caused by batters retaliating against pitchers,
who were permitted a great deal of leeway in moving hitters off the
plate. But no one could recall a fight in which a player attacked
another player with a bat.
</P>
<P>
   The Marichal-Roseboro clash was all the more shocking because
the men's behavior was entirely uncharacteristic. Roseboro, 32, was
a solid, levelheaded player, and Marichal, 27, whose nickname was
the Dominican Dandy, had a reputation as an amiable practical joker
off the field.
</P>
<P>
   The sports media characterized the incident as racial, but in
fact no racial antagonism survived it. What happened was the result
of off-the-field pressures catching two ordinary men in an
extraordinary situation. Roseboro, who later admitted to provoking
the incident, was distraught, as were many other black players,
over the mass disturbances that had been sweeping through Watts in
his home city, Los Angeles. ``It was really the year I came of
age,'' he said later. ``It was the first time I began to pick up a
paper and skip the sports section altogether. Much of the time I
was on the field I had to keep reminding myself that baseball was
important. I'd wake up in the morning and say to myself, `Why are
they playing games? Why can't we do something about Watts and the
people who live there?'''
</P>
<P>
   Marichal had even more to think about. His native country, the
Dominican Republic, was locked in a bloody civil war, and Marichal
found himself rushing to the phone every day to check the fortunes
of friends and family, particularly those of another Juan Marichal,
his cousin, a politician who would become vice president the
following year. ``Thinking back on it,'' Willie Mays said a few
years ago, ``I really don't think Juan should have been playing at
all. He was pretty strung out, full of fear and anger, and holding
it inside. How can you tell a city and a team that they have to
lose a pennant because of problems they don't know about happening
thousands of miles away?''
</P>
<P>
   Summing it up years later, Roseboro said: ``For millions of
Americans, the pennant race was a diversion from the problems that
were sweeping over the country. For some of us, it was just one
more huge burden.''
</P>
<P>
   For Marichal, it was a burden that continued long after his
playing days. Though he won more games than any other pitcher in
the 1960s, he was snubbed for the Hall of Fame in 1981, his first
year of eligibility, then again in 1982. He might not have made it
in 1983 if not for a public campaign by Roseboro. A grateful
Marichal thanked him.
</P>
<P>
   Maury Wills may have hit on the moral of the story several years
ago when he said, ``Next time you see a ballplayer go a little nuts
on the field, consider that he just might have as many
off-the-field problems as you have.''

<P>
   Blame the British. The simple game show they started in
September 1998 has replicated like bacteria in warm agar. ``Who
Wants to Be a Millionaire'' has turned into a global subculture,
with 27 licensed versions being broadcast in 29 countries.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens more countries have already bought franchise rights from
the show's British creator, Celador Productions, and there are, of
course, at least a few unlicensed knockoffs. So far, the format
remains the same, with contestants facing questions worth
escalating amounts of money.
</P>
<P>
   At least half the fun for the show's American fans is kvetching
about how easy the questions are, and how, if they were on the
show, they'd win that million dollars, easy. That scornful
pleasure, too, is spreading around the globe. But just how common
is common knowledge? Here's your chance to see whether you, too,
could be a crorepati, a multi-miljonair, a miljonaariksi, a
milliardario . . .

   Blame the British. The simple game show they started in
September 1998 has replicated like bacteria in warm agar. ``Who
Wants to Be a Millionaire'' has turned into a global subculture,
with 27 licensed versions being broadcast in 29 countries.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens more countries have already bought franchise rights from
the show's British creator, Celador Productions, and there are, of
course, at least a few unlicensed knockoffs. So far, the format
remains the same, with contestants facing questions worth
escalating amounts of money.
</P>
<P>
   At least half the fun for the show's American fans is kvetching
about how easy the questions are, and how, if they were on the
show, they'd win that million dollars, easy. That scornful
pleasure, too, is spreading around the globe. But just how common
is common knowledge? Here's your chance to see whether you, too,
could be a crorepati, a multi-miljonair, a miljonaariksi, a
milliardario . . .

   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ There is no such thing as a political
movement based on jokes, President Abdurrahman Wahid once wrote.
But Wahid himself may be the evidence to the contrary. He jokes to
relieve tension, to instruct, to make a point. In fact, his address
to Parliament last week sounded a bit like a nightclub act.
</P>
<P>
   One joke, suggesting the need for cross-cultural understanding,
involved a non-Muslim bus driver who was knocked unconscious in an
accident. As he lay dying, a Muslim urged him to save his soul by
calling out the name of Allah.
</P>
<P>
   ``Say the name! Say the name!'' the man insisted.
</P>
<P>
   The bus driver opened his eyes briefly and murmured, ``Grogol,''
the name of the next stop on the line.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few more.
</P>
<P>
   _ Why in the tough times of former President Suharto did so many
Indonesians go to Singapore for dental work? Were dentists in
Indonesia so inferior?
</P>
<P>
   No, it was not that. It was just that nobody in Indonesia was
allowed to open his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   _ One day Suharto was caught in a flood and rescued by a farmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know who I am?'' he said. ``I'm the president of
Indonesia. As thanks, I'll give you anything you want.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want one thing,'' said the farmer. ``Please don't tell
anybody I rescued you.''
</P>
<P>
   _ When Wahid, who is virtually blind, was elected last October
he named his taciturn rival, Megawati Sukarnoputri, as vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an ideal team,'' he said. ``The president can't see
and the vice president can't talk.''
</P>
<P>
   _ An undertaker was unable to fold the hands of a corpse. The
body was stiff and one arm remained outstretched.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can I do?'' he asked the local religious leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was the man's profession?''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a policeman.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In that case,'' said the religious leader, ``just put 10,000
rupiah in his other hand and he'll bring his arm down.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Wahid was reported to have told this anecdote to President
Clinton:
</P>
<P>
   Winston Churchill was taking a walk with Clement Atlee,
Britain's Labor prime minister at the end of World War II.
Churchill said he needed to relieve himself and asked for some
privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why?'' Atlee asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because,'' said Churchill, ``whenever you see something big
you want to nationalize it.''

   _ Why in the tough times of former President Suharto did so many
Indonesians go to Singapore for dental work? Were dentists in
Indonesia so inferior?
</P>
<P>
   No, it was not that. It was just that nobody in Indonesia was
allowed to open his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   _ One day Suharto was caught in a flood and rescued by a farmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know who I am?'' he said. ``I'm the president of
Indonesia. As thanks, I'll give you anything you want.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want one thing,'' said the farmer. ``Please don't tell
anybody I rescued you.''
</P>
<P>
   _ When Wahid, who is virtually blind, was elected last October
he named his taciturn rival, Megawati Sukarnoputri, as vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an ideal team,'' he said. ``The president can't see
and the vice president can't talk.''
</P>
<P>
   _ An undertaker was unable to fold the hands of a corpse. The
body was stiff and one arm remained outstretched.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can I do?'' he asked the local religious leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was the man's profession?''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a policeman.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In that case,'' said the religious leader, ``just put 10,000
rupiah in his other hand and he'll bring his arm down.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Wahid was reported to have told this anecdote to President
Clinton:
</P>
<P>
   Winston Churchill was taking a walk with Clement Atlee,
Britain's Labor prime minister at the end of World War II.
Churchill said he needed to relieve himself and asked for some
privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why?'' Atlee asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because,'' said Churchill, ``whenever you see something big
you want to nationalize it.''

WHY FORESTERS PREFER TO FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE

   SEATTLE _ Exactly ninety years ago, on Aug. 20, 1910, in the
choking heat of a summer without rain in the northern Rockies, the
sun disappeared from the sky and a sound not unlike cannon fire
began rattling throughout Montana and Idaho. The Big Burn, as the
3-million-acre firestorm of 1910 was called, eventually consumed
entire towns, killed 87 people and burned a lesson into the
fledgling U.S. Forest Service.
</P>
<P>
   Thereafter, the service vowed, it would snuff out every fire, at
one point swearing to do so by 10 a.m. on the day after the fire
started. The best-known forester of that time, Gifford Pinchot,
equated wildfire with slavery as a historic scourge of the nation.
Another, Bernhard Fernow, blamed ``bad habits and loose morals''
for the fires.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in the midst of the worst wildfire year in nearly half a
century, a new round of finger-pointing is under way. Touring
Montana last week, House Speaker Dennis Hastert blamed the Clinton
administration for not logging the tinder-dry forests.
Environmentalists pointed at the timber industry and development
for altering forest ecology and creating an artificial landscape
ripe for catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   But the Forest Service remains focused on its own primary
culprit: the symbol of fire eradication, Smokey the Bear.
</P>
<P>
   The era of prevention and suppression represented by Smokey and
his shovel may have been good for safety, but it was not the best
thing for forests. The agency had reached that conclusion even
before receiving the additional evidence that foresters drew from
the fires that tore through almost half of Yellowstone National
Park in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Fire is as much a part of nature as creeks and wildflowers. Most
forests have a natural cycle, in which a purging burn comes through
every 10, 20, 50 or 100 years. The cycle may be suppressed,
foresters say, but only at the cost of more powerful fires when it
re-emerges.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a problem when people say these fires are destroying
all these areas,'' said Wiebe, the former Smokejumper. ``It's just
not correct to say a forest is destroyed by fire.''
</P>
<P>
   During the decades when fires were routinely suppressed, forests
choked themselves with excess growth, creating better habitats for
tree-killing insects. The dying trees became tinder.
</P>
<P>
   ``These forests are long overdue,'' said Mick Harrington, a
research fire ecologist with the Forest Service in Montana, a state
that has just been declared a disaster area. ``They were just ready
to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The fires that have already run through 5 million acres this
year are hotter, faster-burning, more ferocious than any burns of
modern times, say the people battling them. And a number of reports
say future fire seasons may be worse, identifying about 40 million
acres of public land as being at risk of catastrophic fire.
</P>
<P>
   Fire suppression is only part of the problem. In some forests,
experts say, logging has removed the biggest and most
fire-resistant trees. Their replacements _ some planted, some
natural _ are crowded stands of young and disease-prone trees, with
500 or more to the acre, where there used to be 50. Foresters also
point to other elements _ excessive grazing by cattle and sheep,
diversion of rivers to newly developing areas _ that have
contributed to what some call ghost forests, spectral stands of
diseased and dying timber now baking, if not yet burning, in the
August sun.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there are many new areas demanding fire protection.
Homes and vacation cottages that have sprung up at the edge of
national forest boundaries have become firefighters' front lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've become so good at putting out fires because that's what
the public wants,'' said Lindon Wiebe, a fire ecology specialist
with the Forest Service in Washington, and a former Smokejumper, as
the service's firefighters are called. ``But what we can do is
pretty small compared to what Mother Nature wants to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as people have gradually learned not to build homes in
areas prone to flooding, they need to understand the danger of
erecting structures in fire zones, says Dr. Phil Omi, a professor
of forest fire science at Colorado State University and director of
the Western Forest Fire Research Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody has got to get the message to these people that they
are putting themselves at risk, whether it's the insurance industry
or the government,'' Omi said. But he said he could not blame the
Forest Service, or homeowners, for being slow to understand the
nature of wild fire in the West. ``Our understanding of forest fire
ecology is relatively new,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Those trying to address the future fire threat are focusing on
two solutions: taking out more trees by logging or thinning, and
deliberately setting fires.
</P>
<P>
   Under Clinton, logging in national forests has declined by
nearly 75 percent, and some critics blame this decline for the
explosive fires. A number of Western senators back the idea of
allowing the timber industry to remove more trees.
</P>
<P>
   However, environmental groups point out that the biggest fires
in Montana and Idaho are burning not in wilderness areas, but in
land that has been developed or logged. Such areas also account for
90 percent of the acreage identified as most vulnerable to
wildfire, the Forest Service says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Commercial logging is not a prescription for forest health _
it is one of the major causes of unhealthy forest conditions,''
said Thomas Powers, chairman of the economics department at the
University of Montana, whose specialty is natural resource issues.
</P>
<P>
   The other solution _ planned fire _ has become a public
relations debacle. Last year, a record 1.4 million acres of Forest
Service land was deliberately burned. Most prescribed burns go off
without trouble. But it only takes one to stir public ire. And this
year, the one that got away, a 43,000-acre blaze set by the
National Park Service near Los Alamos, N.M., destroyed more than
200 homes.
</P>
<P>
   And no matter how convinced the experts are that Los Alamos was
an exception, the fires now raging in every state of the West look
horrific on television, blackening national treasures like Mesa
Verde National Park and raining embers on popular campgrounds.

THE HIDDEN HILARITY OF DIPLOMACY

<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ At the United Nations, where one person's joke
can strike 100 other people from 100 other cultures as
incomprehensible, if not offensive, diplomats, ever cautious and
circumspect, take refuge in the universal language of the political
cartoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Diplomats relish the irony of so many political situations,''
said Kamalesh Sharma, India's ambassador to the United Nations.
``In most diplomatic missions in New York, you'll find that a
particularly appealing cartoon is pinned up so that the delectation
can continue for days and days.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few weeks, a panel of diplomats _ Sharma among
them _ and American celebrities will choose the winner of a $10,000
prize for the best political cartoon on a United Nations theme.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months hundreds of entries have poured in from around
the world, from Iran to Ethiopia to Cuba, said Ranan Lurie, the
cartoonist and caricaturist who put up the prize money for the
competition, which is sponsored by the United Nations
Correspondents' Association. Shashi Tharoor, Secretary-General Kofi
Annan's communications director, piloted the project through the
organization, telling skeptical U.N. bureaucrats that it was a new
way to ``propagate the message of the U.N.''
</P>
<P>
   The jury assembled by Lurie could lend itself to a cartoon. It
is headed by Elie Wiesel and will include seven ambassadors, from
North America, Europe, Africa and Asia; an actor, Jeff Bridges; an
athlete, David Cone; an author, Norman Mailer; Floyd Abrams, the
First Amendment lawyer; James Hoge, editor of Foreign Affairs, and
William J. Rowe, publisher of Times-Mirror Newspapers in
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Lurie, who is best known as a caricaturist, says good political
cartoonists need five things: the training to practice ``pure good
journalism,'' professional artistic standards, the ability to
capture personality through caricature, humor and the gift of
condensing all that into a quick message.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the good political cartoon is really the smart bomb of
the media,'' said Lurie, who publishes a magazine, Cartoon News
International, for young people. ``The advantage of the political
cartoon versus the written article is that it will deliver in seven
seconds what an article will not deliver in 17 minutes. Once you've
invested your very important and precious seven seconds you become
wiser. You know what is happening in Chechnya. You know what is
happening in East Timor. Besides, a cartoon is good for you, like
ice cream with vitamins. Better than broccoli.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharma said his all-time favorite cartoon dealt with the botched
attempt to rescue American hostages in Iran during the Carter
administration. In the cartoon, tragedy was touched by the absurd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember a helicopter whirring away and this GI is throwing
on the ground dozens and dozens of rabbits,'' Sharma said of the
drawing. ``They're all sitting there on the ground cross-eyed,
wondering what they're doing. And a GI on the ground is yelling
through the noise of the rotor: `I said, a  &UR; rapid &LR;  deployment
force!'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows what a complex business any item of global
politics is, so a cartoon humanizes it,'' Sharma said. ``After all
the jargon you read in the paper and positions taken and all the
heat which is generated, in the end it says: Look, human beings are
fractious, but if human beings can laugh, there's hope.''

CHOOSING A RUNNING MATE MATTERS. OR, MATTERED. 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating)  (The Week in Review)  
 By ADAM CLYMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Vice presidential candidates, like the Perseid
meteor shower, briefly light up midsummer skies. Usually, that's as
long as they matter because people vote for presidents, not vice
presidents.
</P>
<P>
   With the election only some 11 weeks away, Dick Cheney, a former
congressman and defense secretary, and Sen. Joseph Lieberman of
Connecticut have already done just about everything running mates
can do for their tickets, from reflecting well on the presidential
candidates who chose them to providing a lift for their national
conventions.
</P>
<P>
   But those contributions have been significant. Cheney and
Lieberman were serious choices, men voters can imagine as
president, and displayed Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and Vice
President Al Gore in a ``presidential'' manner, making a critical
big decision in a serious way.
</P>
<P>
   Neither man was a crassly political choice, someone selected
simply to carry a big state, as Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania
would have been for Bush, or Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois for Gore.
Wyoming's three electoral votes were safe for Bush before he picked
its former congressman; Connecticut's eight were almost as solidly
secure for Gore before he chose its junior senator.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's choice of his father's defense secretary for a running
mate was ``safe and responsible,'' said professor Stephen Wayne, a
Georgetown University political scientist. ``It basically gave us
an indication that if George W. Bush is elected, he will be a
president who uses advisers in making decisions.'' Or, as a more
caustic academic student of presidential elections, professor
Nelson W. Polsby of the University of California at Berkeley, put
it, ``Cheney was picked to indemnify Bush against the charge that
he was ignorant.''
</P>
<P>
   The selection of Lieberman, the first Jew on a national ticket,
was more dramatic. As Wayne put it, ``the choice was unexpected and
courageous'' _ words not usually associated with Gore. Bob Shrum, a
key Gore strategist, said, ``People began taking a fresh look at Al
Gore through his choice of Joe Lieberman.'' And he brought
something else through his aura of incorruptibility and moral
outrage against President Clinton's dalliance with a White House
intern. As Polsby observed, ``Lieberman was picked to indemnify
Gore against the charge that he was sleazy.''
</P>
<P>
   And each fulfilled the other main duty of a vice presidential
choice. Each dominated public attention for several days, keeping
the other side out of the news and presumably out of voter's minds.
</P>
<P>
   That was especially important for Gore, whose staff leaked the
Lieberman choice on the Monday after the Republican convention _
stopping Bush's momentum cold. ``The Gore campaign had been in the
doldrums,'' Wayne said. ``If Gore wins the election, we'll say this
was the beginning, the jump start.''
</P>
<P>
   The publicity for Cheney was overwhelmingly positive, but
included some negative recollections of his voting record,
including his votes against banning ``cop killer'' bullets that
penetrate policemen's Kevlar vests. Cheney also voted against a
resolution urging freedom for Nelson Mandela, who was then
imprisoned.
</P>
<P>
   The attention focused on Lieberman was even more upbeat. No one
attacked him _ perhaps for fear of sounding anti-Semitic _ except
for a few blacks who were largely silenced by reminders from Rep.
John Lewis and the Rev. Jesse Jackson that Lieberman had marched
with the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Some of his more conservative
votes, like experiments with school vouchers, were instantly and
publicly forgiven on the assurance that Gore, not Lieberman, would
make policy.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it is not a certainty that Cheney or Lieberman will
have no continuing influence on this election. But take the most
obvious possibility _ Lieberman's religion. Jews already vote
heavily, and heavily Democratic. So Lieberman is not likely to
change their direct impact on the vote the way John F. Kennedy
brought Catholics back to their Democratic roots. He might cost his
ticket votes because of his religion or gain votes from people who
concluded that opposition to him was unworthy.
</P>
<P>
   But neither effect is likely to be large.
</P>
<P>
   That was not always true. Geographic balance meant more when the
country's regions were more distinct, and plainly Lyndon B. Johnson
carried Texas for Kennedy in 1960. Shrum thinks Bill Clinton's
choice of Gore in 1992 had a lasting effect, helping eke out some
narrow victories in Southern states and reinforcing a message of
youth and change.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes vice presidential nominations were necessary
investments just to get a nomination. Franklin D. Roosevelt won
over Texas delegates in 1932 with a promise to make John Nance
Garner his vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas E. Dewey's aides promised Rep. Charles E. Halleck of
Indiana the No. 2 spot in 1948 in exchange for Indiana's delegates.
(Dewey reneged and picked Gov. Earl Warren of California. He lost
California anyway.)
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes vice presidential candidates hurt a ticket by
creating a distraction or embarrassment. It is hard to imagine this
year's buttoned-down, dare-to-be-cautious vice presidential duo
committing a gaffe like Henry Cabot Lodge's 1960 promise that as
president, Richard M. Nixon would appoint a black to the Cabinet,
an offer that could have cost votes in the South.
</P>
<P>
   More often the distractions have developed from a disclosure of
hitherto unexamined parts of the candidate's past, like the secret
sources of Nixon's finances in 1952, Thomas Eagleton's electroshock
therapy in 1972, Geraldine Ferraro's husband's murky business ties
in 1984 and Dan Quayle's avoidance of the draft in 1988. And none
of those embarrassments were decisive in those elections.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in most elections, vice presidential nominees embody the
enduring truth of the following observation by Thomas Marshall,
Woodrow Wilson's vice president: ``Once there were two brothers:
One ran away to sea, the other was elected vice president _ and
nothing was ever heard from either of them again.''

CHOOSING A RUNNING MATE MATTERS. OR, MATTERED. 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating)  (The Week in Review)  
 By ADAM CLYMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Vice presidential candidates, like the Perseid
meteor shower, briefly light up midsummer skies. Usually, that's as
long as they matter because people vote for presidents, not vice
presidents.
</P>
<P>
   With the election only some 11 weeks away, Dick Cheney, a former
congressman and defense secretary, and Sen. Joseph Lieberman of
Connecticut have already done just about everything running mates
can do for their tickets, from reflecting well on the presidential
candidates who chose them to providing a lift for their national
conventions.
</P>
<P>
   But those contributions have been significant. Cheney and
Lieberman were serious choices, men voters can imagine as
president, and displayed Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and Vice
President Al Gore in a ``presidential'' manner, making a critical
big decision in a serious way.
</P>
<P>
   Neither man was a crassly political choice, someone selected
simply to carry a big state, as Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania
would have been for Bush, or Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois for Gore.
Wyoming's three electoral votes were safe for Bush before he picked
its former congressman; Connecticut's eight were almost as solidly
secure for Gore before he chose its junior senator.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's choice of his father's defense secretary for a running
mate was ``safe and responsible,'' said professor Stephen Wayne, a
Georgetown University political scientist. ``It basically gave us
an indication that if George W. Bush is elected, he will be a
president who uses advisers in making decisions.'' Or, as a more
caustic academic student of presidential elections, professor
Nelson W. Polsby of the University of California at Berkeley, put
it, ``Cheney was picked to indemnify Bush against the charge that
he was ignorant.''
</P>
<P>
   The selection of Lieberman, the first Jew on a national ticket,
was more dramatic. As Wayne put it, ``the choice was unexpected and
courageous'' _ words not usually associated with Gore. Bob Shrum, a
key Gore strategist, said, ``People began taking a fresh look at Al
Gore through his choice of Joe Lieberman.'' And he brought
something else through his aura of incorruptibility and moral
outrage against President Clinton's dalliance with a White House
intern. As Polsby observed, ``Lieberman was picked to indemnify
Gore against the charge that he was sleazy.''
</P>
<P>
   And each fulfilled the other main duty of a vice presidential
choice. Each dominated public attention for several days, keeping
the other side out of the news and presumably out of voter's minds.
</P>
<P>
   That was especially important for Gore, whose staff leaked the
Lieberman choice on the Monday after the Republican convention _
stopping Bush's momentum cold. ``The Gore campaign had been in the
doldrums,'' Wayne said. ``If Gore wins the election, we'll say this
was the beginning, the jump start.''
</P>
<P>
   The publicity for Cheney was overwhelmingly positive, but
included some negative recollections of his voting record,
including his votes against banning ``cop killer'' bullets that
penetrate policemen's Kevlar vests. Cheney also voted against a
resolution urging freedom for Nelson Mandela, who was then
imprisoned.
</P>
<P>
   The attention focused on Lieberman was even more upbeat. No one
attacked him _ perhaps for fear of sounding anti-Semitic _ except
for a few blacks who were largely silenced by reminders from Rep.
John Lewis and the Rev. Jesse Jackson that Lieberman had marched
with the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Some of his more conservative
votes, like experiments with school vouchers, were instantly and
publicly forgiven on the assurance that Gore, not Lieberman, would
make policy.

   NEW YORK _ Commercial enterprise springs from almost every
tragedy, and the West Nile virus is no exception. Some of these
ventures, however, seem a bit more dubious than others.
</P>
<P>
   The virus, which killed seven people last year and has sickened
scores of others in the New York metropolitan region, is
transmitted by mosquitoes, so it stands to reason that those who
make a living killing them have benefited somewhat from the
outbreak.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer New Yorkers, scrambling to ward off the illness,
cornered the market on insect repellent. The city also made a hefty
purchase of pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   Fair enough. The mosquitoes must be eliminated, thus someone
must make a killing on the killing. But what can be said about Tire
Conversion Technologies Inc.? Recently its public relations
spokeswoman promoted the company as a possible West Nile eliminator
because it converts old tires for use in a variety of products. The
city and state have urged residents to get rid of discarded tires,
which are a breeding ground for mosquitoes. With the help of Tire
Conversion, its press release said, ``the mosquito that causes the
West Nile virus will have one less place to call home.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, small nit. The company cannot actually use the tires lying
about on residents' lawns and elsewhere, harboring mosquito larvae.
In the near future, the tires would be collected first, said Nicole
Stein, who wrote the release. The company's response ``is not a
solution now,'' she said. ``I see it as a West Nile tangent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is going to help in the future,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   But why the press release now? ``We saw that tires are in the
media a lot,'' Stein said.
</P>
<P>
   Moving right along. Dirad Technologies operates the West Nile
Information Line for New York City from its base in Albany. The
line provides information about West Nile symptoms and
transmission; the insecticides used; and the spraying schedule. New
Yorkers can also call to report dead birds on their property.
</P>
<P>
   Dirad produces its own press release, with the apparent goal of
drumming up more business around the state, and even the country. A
sample: ``This exotic contagion has spread as far as Boston and
will likely continue to grow . . .'' Edward Tierney, Dirad's
general manager, said: ``I am hoping to get more municipalities
using this. In Albany they use a live operator, and you call the
guy and he is, like, `Can you hold on a second?' This gives
constituents answers in real time.''
</P>
<P>
   Others are simply flacking themselves. Dr. James Rahal, head of
infectious diseases at New York Hospital Medical Center of Queens,
sent out letters last spring saying he was available to chat with
reporters about the virus. More recently, one public relations firm
promoted Fordham University researchers who were saying that
another mosquito, Aedes japonicus, might, just might, transmit West
Nile, too.
</P>
<P>
   Interesting stuff, for sure, but maybe, just maybe, not for the
front page. Not yet.

   A Run on Meat, and Not by Humans &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From hemisphere to hemisphere and around the globe comes news
about meat, and it's enough to put you off your feed.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for instance, the report from Britain, where thousands of
pigs have been slaughtered because of an outbreak of swine fever.
``People are at their wits' end,'' lamented James Black, vice
chairman of the National Pig Association.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the United States joined several European countries
in banning imports of live pigs, pig semen and related products
from Britain, which is still struggling with huge economic losses
from an outbreak of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, commonly
known as mad cow disease, that began several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Swine fever, like mad cow disease, is usually controlled only by
the destruction of infected animals. Outbreaks decimated herds in
the Netherlands and Germany in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike mad cow disease, swine fever is not thought to be a
threat to humans. About 50 people in Britain have died from
Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease, which has been linked to mad cow
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, a federal judge ordered two flocks of sheep
belonging to a Vermont couple to be destroyed out of concern that
they had a version of mad cow disease.
</P>
<P>
   In Malaysia, about 100 people died last year and a million pigs
were slaughtered because of the spread of the newly discovered
Nipah virus, which is in the same class of viruses as ebola and
AIDS. Researchers recently confirmed a chain of infection from
fruit bats to pigs and then to humans.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, an outbreak of hoof-and-mouth disease in Argentina
prompted the announcement last week of a temporary halt in beef
exports to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Bon appetit.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Hut Was There &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Forest Service drew some derision last year when it
told the Appalachian Mountain Club to make sure a hut the group was
rebuilding in New Hampshire's White Mountains was wheelchair
accessible according to federal rules. The Galehead hut is perched
2,000 feet up a boulder-strewn trail, doubters pointed out; a
wheelchair would never make it.
</P>
<P>
   Never say never.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, three hikers in wheelchairs engineered for rough
terrain and two hikers on crutches made it up the 4.6-mile trail in
about 12 hours, under their own steam but with plenty of help from
friends, family members and volunteers. They conquered the
mountain, they said, to show that their determination should not be
underestimated _ and for a fun hike in the woods.
</P>
<P>
   Their Galehead trek and the hubbub over the hut highlight a
tricky question: Just how accessible must the naturally
not-very-accessible wilderness become?
</P>
<P>
   Forest Service officials say they have no plans to pave trails,
but when it comes to new buildings, however remote, the answer is:
very accessible.
</P>
<P>
   Trial for Kennedy Nephew In 1975 Killing in Connecticut
</P>
<P>
   A Connecticut juvenile court judge ruled that Michael Skakel, a
nephew of Ethel Kennedy, should stand trial for the 1975 killing of
Martha Moxley, who was his 15-year-old next-door neighbor in
Greenwich's gated Belle Haven enclave. The judge has yet to decide
whether Skakel, who is now 39, should be tried as a juvenile or as
an adult. Conviction by a judge in juvenile court could mean a
sentence of less than four years; conviction by a jury in Superior
Court could bring a life term.
</P>
<P>
   Rising Tire-Related Toll
</P>
<P>
   Nobody has figured out yet why Firestone tires have been failing
on Ford Explorers, but the government has raised to 62 its tally of
deaths attributed to the tires in consumer complaints filed with
regulators. Most occurred when the tires failed at high speed and
the Explorers rolled over. State Farm, the nation's largest auto
insurer, said that it began billing Firestone for tire incidents in
1997, and mentioned the problem to regulators in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   A Threat to California's Oaks
</P>
<P>
   Up and down the California coast, thousands of oak trees are
dying of a fast-spreading new disease called sudden oak death
syndrome. In just five years, it has spread from one to three
species of oak and across 350 miles of coastline. Scientists fear
it may move outside the state and afflict other species of trees,
and the Agriculture Department says it will discuss its options in
fighting the disease next week. It appears to be caused by a
species of funguslike organism closely related to the pest that
caused Irish potato blight.
</P>
<P>
   The Concorde Is Grounded
</P>
<P>
   Following last month's fatal crash near Paris, Britain and
France formally grounded the Concorde after investigators
determined that a problem with its tires made the world's only
commercial supersonic airliner unsafe. Investigators found that the
crash, which killed 113, originated in a tire blowout that caused
chunks of rubber to rupture a fuel tank. The Concorde will fly
again only when its manufacturers devise safeguards against a
repetition, aviation authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   When the Nominee Knew
</P>
<P>
   More than two and a half years after an independent counsel
began investigating President Clinton's relationship with a White
House intern, a new grand jury has been impaneled to review the
case again, government officials said. The independent counsel,
Robert Ray, convened the panel last month after saying he would
consider whether Clinton could be charged with wrongdoing in the
Monica Lewinsky matter once he leaves office. Democrats and
Republicans piled criticism on the anonymous leak about the grand
jury, disclosed just hours before Vice President Al Gore accepted
the Democratic Presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   It's Melting
</P>
<P>
   An ice-free patch of ocean about a mile wide has opened at the
very top of the world, a sight that has presumably never before
been seen by human beings and is more evidence that global warming
may be real. The last time that scientists can be certain the pole
was awash in water was more than 50 million years ago. ``It was
totally unexpected,'' Dr. James J. McCarthy, an oceanographer and
director of the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard
University, said after lecturing aboard a tourist cruise on a
Russian icebreaker earlier this month. He said that six years ago,
the ice near the North Pole was 6 to 9 feet thick.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Law Firms Limit Aid to Poor
</P>
<P>
   Despite record profits, many of the nation's biggest law firms
have cut back on pro bono work so sharply that they now fall far
below professional standards for representing people who cannot
afford to pay. Flooded with business and pressed to bill more time
to pay for rising salaries, lawyers at the top 100 firms now
average 36 hours a year on pro bono cases, instead of the 50 hours
urged by the American Bar Association.
</P>
<P>
   Pussycats at the IRS?
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago Congress mandated the firing of any IRS worker who
harasses a taxpayer. The first 830 complaints investigated found
none met the standard for harassment, a congressional report
showed, while some cases appeared to be false accusations made to
derail audits and collections. The IRS said it fired four employees
for threatening an unwarranted audit, one for covering up a
mistake, two for understating their income on tax returns and 102
others for not filing tax returns.
</P>
<P>
   Somalis Form a Government
</P>
<P>
   Somalis inaugurated their first national assembly since the
nation's central government fell in 1991. The next step will be
selecting executive positions, which will be divided along clan
lines, much like the assembly seats. More crucial will be the
transfer of government back to Somalia from the neighboring country
of Djibouti, where peace talks have been taking place since March.
</P>
<P>
   Czar Beatified
</P>
<P>
   The Russian Orthodox Church, continuing its recovery from 70
years of atheist Soviet rule, established a detailed social
doctrine outlining the church's position on issues such as
abortion, bioethics, homosexuality and private property. The
document was accepted by the church's approximately 150 hierarchs,
who met as the Council of Bishops, the church's second-highest
body. But the bishops most symbolic action was their unanimous
decision to canonize the Czar Nicholas II and his family as
``passion bearers,'' for their humility in going to their deaths, a
move long demanded by the church's right wing.
</P>
<P>
   Curb on Phone Surveillance
</P>
<P>
   A federal appeals court struck down many of the new technical
standards imposed on telephone companies that had broadly expanded
the ability of law enforcement agencies to eavesdrop on the phone
calls of criminal suspects. The decision, prompted by complaints
from phone companies and privacy-rights advocates, forces the
government to reconsider the standards at a time when federal
agents have struggled to keep up with rapid technological advances
that have made it harder to monitor possible crimes.
</P>
<P>
   New Hope for Nerve Disease
</P>
<P>
   Bone marrow cells that would normally turn into tendon,
cartilage, bone, muscle and fat can also turn into nerve cells,
scientists report. All that is needed is to add a simple mixture of
chemicals to a broth that nourishes the marrow cells in the
laboratory. While cautioning that the work is in its earliest
stages, researchers say it may eventually offer a new source of
nerve cells to treat spinal cord injuries or diseases like
Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.

   A Run on Meat, and Not by Humans &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From hemisphere to hemisphere and around the globe comes news
about meat, and it's enough to put you off your feed.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for instance, the report from Britain, where thousands of
pigs have been slaughtered because of an outbreak of swine fever.
``People are at their wits' end,'' lamented James Black, vice
chairman of the National Pig Association.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the United States joined several European countries
in banning imports of live pigs, pig semen and related products
from Britain, which is still struggling with huge economic losses
from an outbreak of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, commonly
known as mad cow disease, that began several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Swine fever, like mad cow disease, is usually controlled only by
the destruction of infected animals. Outbreaks decimated herds in
the Netherlands and Germany in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike mad cow disease, swine fever is not thought to be a
threat to humans. About 50 people in Britain have died from
Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease, which has been linked to mad cow
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, a federal judge ordered two flocks of sheep
belonging to a Vermont couple to be destroyed out of concern that
they had a version of mad cow disease.
</P>
<P>
   In Malaysia, about 100 people died last year and a million pigs
were slaughtered because of the spread of the newly discovered
Nipah virus, which is in the same class of viruses as ebola and
AIDS. Researchers recently confirmed a chain of infection from
fruit bats to pigs and then to humans.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, an outbreak of hoof-and-mouth disease in Argentina
prompted the announcement last week of a temporary halt in beef
exports to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Bon appetit.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Hut Was There &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Forest Service drew some derision last year when it
told the Appalachian Mountain Club to make sure a hut the group was
rebuilding in New Hampshire's White Mountains was wheelchair
accessible according to federal rules. The Galehead hut is perched
2,000 feet up a boulder-strewn trail, doubters pointed out; a
wheelchair would never make it.
</P>
<P>
   Never say never.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, three hikers in wheelchairs engineered for rough
terrain and two hikers on crutches made it up the 4.6-mile trail in
about 12 hours, under their own steam but with plenty of help from
friends, family members and volunteers. They conquered the
mountain, they said, to show that their determination should not be
underestimated _ and for a fun hike in the woods.
</P>
<P>
   Their Galehead trek and the hubbub over the hut highlight a
tricky question: Just how accessible must the naturally
not-very-accessible wilderness become?
</P>
<P>
   Forest Service officials say they have no plans to pave trails,
but when it comes to new buildings, however remote, the answer is:
very accessible.
</P>
<P>
   Trial for Kennedy Nephew In 1975 Killing in Connecticut
</P>
<P>
   A Connecticut juvenile court judge ruled that Michael Skakel, a
nephew of Ethel Kennedy, should stand trial for the 1975 killing of
Martha Moxley, who was his 15-year-old next-door neighbor in
Greenwich's gated Belle Haven enclave. The judge has yet to decide
whether Skakel, who is now 39, should be tried as a juvenile or as
an adult. Conviction by a judge in juvenile court could mean a
sentence of less than four years; conviction by a jury in Superior
Court could bring a life term.
</P>
<P>
   Rising Tire-Related Toll
</P>
<P>
   Nobody has figured out yet why Firestone tires have been failing
on Ford Explorers, but the government has raised to 62 its tally of
deaths attributed to the tires in consumer complaints filed with
regulators. Most occurred when the tires failed at high speed and
the Explorers rolled over. State Farm, the nation's largest auto
insurer, said that it began billing Firestone for tire incidents in
1997, and mentioned the problem to regulators in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   A Threat to California's Oaks
</P>
<P>
   Up and down the California coast, thousands of oak trees are
dying of a fast-spreading new disease called sudden oak death
syndrome. In just five years, it has spread from one to three
species of oak and across 350 miles of coastline. Scientists fear
it may move outside the state and afflict other species of trees,
and the Agriculture Department says it will discuss its options in
fighting the disease next week. It appears to be caused by a
species of funguslike organism closely related to the pest that
caused Irish potato blight.
</P>
<P>
   The Concorde Is Grounded
</P>
<P>
   Following last month's fatal crash near Paris, Britain and
France formally grounded the Concorde after investigators
determined that a problem with its tires made the world's only
commercial supersonic airliner unsafe. Investigators found that the
crash, which killed 113, originated in a tire blowout that caused
chunks of rubber to rupture a fuel tank. The Concorde will fly
again only when its manufacturers devise safeguards against a
repetition, aviation authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   When the Nominee Knew
</P>
<P>
   More than two and a half years after an independent counsel
began investigating President Clinton's relationship with a White
House intern, a new grand jury has been impaneled to review the
case again, government officials said. The independent counsel,
Robert Ray, convened the panel last month after saying he would
consider whether Clinton could be charged with wrongdoing in the
Monica Lewinsky matter once he leaves office. Democrats and
Republicans piled criticism on the anonymous leak about the grand
jury, disclosed just hours before Vice President Al Gore accepted
the Democratic Presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   It's Melting
</P>
<P>
   An ice-free patch of ocean about a mile wide has opened at the
very top of the world, a sight that has presumably never before
been seen by human beings and is more evidence that global warming
may be real. The last time that scientists can be certain the pole
was awash in water was more than 50 million years ago. ``It was
totally unexpected,'' Dr. James J. McCarthy, an oceanographer and
director of the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard
University, said after lecturing aboard a tourist cruise on a
Russian icebreaker earlier this month. He said that six years ago,
the ice near the North Pole was 6 to 9 feet thick.
</P>

<P>
   Law Firms Limit Aid to Poor
</P>
<P>
   Despite record profits, many of the nation's biggest law firms
have cut back on pro bono work so sharply that they now fall far
below professional standards for representing people who cannot
afford to pay. Flooded with business and pressed to bill more time
to pay for rising salaries, lawyers at the top 100 firms now
average 36 hours a year on pro bono cases, instead of the 50 hours
urged by the American Bar Association.
</P>
<P>
   Pussycats at the IRS?
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago Congress mandated the firing of any IRS worker who
harasses a taxpayer. The first 830 complaints investigated found
none met the standard for harassment, a congressional report
showed, while some cases appeared to be false accusations made to
derail audits and collections. The IRS said it fired four employees
for threatening an unwarranted audit, one for covering up a
mistake, two for understating their income on tax returns and 102
others for not filing tax returns.
</P>
<P>
   Somalis Form a Government
</P>
<P>
   Somalis inaugurated their first national assembly since the
nation's central government fell in 1991. The next step will be
selecting executive positions, which will be divided along clan
lines, much like the assembly seats. More crucial will be the
transfer of government back to Somalia from the neighboring country
of Djibouti, where peace talks have been taking place since March.
</P>
<P>
   Czar Beatified
</P>
<P>
   The Russian Orthodox Church, continuing its recovery from 70
years of atheist Soviet rule, established a detailed social
doctrine outlining the church's position on issues such as
abortion, bioethics, homosexuality and private property. The
document was accepted by the church's approximately 150 hierarchs,
who met as the Council of Bishops, the church's second-highest
body. But the bishops most symbolic action was their unanimous
decision to canonize the Czar Nicholas II and his family as
``passion bearers,'' for their humility in going to their deaths, a
move long demanded by the church's right wing.
</P>
<P>
   Curb on Phone Surveillance
</P>
<P>
   A federal appeals court struck down many of the new technical
standards imposed on telephone companies that had broadly expanded
the ability of law enforcement agencies to eavesdrop on the phone
calls of criminal suspects. The decision, prompted by complaints
from phone companies and privacy-rights advocates, forces the
government to reconsider the standards at a time when federal
agents have struggled to keep up with rapid technological advances
that have made it harder to monitor possible crimes.
</P>
<P>
   New Hope for Nerve Disease
</P>
<P>
   Bone marrow cells that would normally turn into tendon,
cartilage, bone, muscle and fat can also turn into nerve cells,
scientists report. All that is needed is to add a simple mixture of
chemicals to a broth that nourishes the marrow cells in the
laboratory. While cautioning that the work is in its earliest
stages, researchers say it may eventually offer a new source of
nerve cells to treat spinal cord injuries or diseases like
Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.

NEW CULTURE ON CAMPUS: SEEING AHAB AND BARBIE THROUGH THE LENS OF
DISABILITY

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ To its proponents, it is the next unsung
academic frontier.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't an aspect of social policy or experience that
isn't deeply caught up in disability issues,'' said Susan Schweik,
an associate professor of English at the University of California
at Berkeley, who teaches a course on disability and literature.
``It's one of the great issues, like race, class and gender.''
</P>
<P>
   Disability has spread from the more familiar precincts of the
law, medicine and public policy into the humanities _ from Richard
III to labor history to discussions on whether the tippy-toed
Barbie doll is technically disabled.
</P>
<P>
   In Berkeley, which is the birthplace of activism among disabled
people, an oral history archive of the Independent Living Movement
is scheduled to open this fall at the university. Schweik is
developing an undergraduate liberal arts degree in disability
studies (the University of Illinois at Chicago and Syracuse
University offer doctorates). At San Francisco State University, a
diverse group including philosophers, literature professors,
theater scholars, historians and others, fewer than half with
disabilities themselves, recently completed a summer institute
financed by the National Endowment for the Humanities aimed at
creating disability studies in the humanities. And this fall the
first international conference on disability studies will be held
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The liberal arts are supposed to pose fundamental questions
like, what makes a person human, and what is justice?'' said
Catherine J. Kudlick, a historian at the University of California
at Davis, who studies the blind historical experience and who is
legally blind. ``Disability studies provide new ways of approaching
these questions.''
</P>
<P>
   The field is potentially vast. A literature course might, for
example, examine Captain Ahab of Herman Melville's ``Moby-Dick'' or
Benjy, William Faulkner's cognitively disabled (as he would now be
called) character in ``The Sound and the Fury.'' ``Disability has
always been used as a literary metaphor,'' said Rosemarie
Garland-Thomson, an English professor at Howard University and
co-director of Berkeley's institute. ``It's a highly culturally
charged situation that lends itself to deep and complicated
meanings.''
</P>
<P>
   The blossoming culture of disability might be seen as the second
wave. The academic aspect emerged in the 1980s in political science
and sociology, which focused mainly on research for reforming
public policies. Its scholarly emergence paralleled the political
activity that culminated in the Americans With Disabilities Act of
1990, which made equal access for the disabled a civil rights
issue.
</P>
<P>
   This new culture encompasses the arts, from performance art to
life writing (as expressed by insiders); sporting events; and the
influence policies have had on the dominant culture, whether
reflected in the Washington subway system or the extra-wide toilet
stalls beloved by luggage toters and nursing mothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're finally seeing a breakdown of the tragic but brave
model,'' said professor Paul K. Longmore, the San Francisco State
historian who organized the institute and who gets about in a
wheelchair. Longmore, co-editor of ``The New Disability History:
American Perspectives,'' to be published later this year by New
York University Press, says research is becoming increasingly
sophisticated.
</P>
<P>
   History has been an especially rich vein. ``Disability is
everywhere in history, once you begin looking for it, but
conspicuously absent in the histories we write,'' said Douglas
Baynton, a University of Iowa historian.
</P>
<P>
   New scholarship is rapidly changing that, unearthing attitudes
behind laws like 19th-century Chicago's ``unsightly beggar
ordinances,'' which barred from public view any person ``who is
diseased, maimed, mutilated or in any way deformed so as to be an
unsightly or disgusting object.''
</P>
<P>
   The historians in this field are using these newly uncovered
primary sources, studying 19th-century periodicals like the
Locomotive Engineers Monthly Journal, which ran passionate
philosophical debates on how to deal with frequent accidents among
railroad engineers, including how disability might affect their
manhood and whether they should be given alternative jobs in
railway stations.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the trend see it as yet another example of the
political correctness and identity politics ravaging academia.
``The past 20 years has seen the humanities getting narrower and
narrower,'' said John M. Ellis, a retired professor of German
literature at the University of California Santa Cruz and author of
``Literature Lost: Social Agendas and the Corruption of the
Humanities'' (Yale University Press, 1999). ``Like the focus on
race, class and gender, this sounds to be like the usual
victimology of the humanities spinning out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   But Longmore and his colleagues argue that disability studies
enrich many disciplines. ``We're doing critical analysis, not
political advocacy,'' Longmore said.
</P>
<P>
   He does acknowledge, however, that there is an unavoidable
aspect of heritage hunting from past to the present. It has caused
some to reexamine figures like Milton, Beethoven and Franklin D.
Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's understandable that any previously marginalized group
would want to find models in history,'' Longmore said. ``But we
need to dig deeper to analyze group experiences, public policies
and cultural values. Heroes are not enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Though it seems specialized, disability studies _ the corporal
dimension of the human experience and its consequences _ could wind
up being one of the most inclusive academic fields of all. As
Longmore points out, ``It's a social group that all people will
join if they live long enough.''

DO YOU REALLY CALL THAT SOUND MUSIC?

(Repeating)  (The Week in Review)  
 By THOMAS VINCIGUERRA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In her 1965 review of ``The Sound of Music'' for The
New York Herald Tribune, Judith Crist wrote, ``The movie is for the
5-to-7 set and their mommies who think their kids aren't up to the
stinging sophistication and biting wit of `Mary Poppins.'''
</P>
<P>
   The rest is history.
</P>
<P>
   Today, as the highest grossing film musical of all time
approaches its 35th anniversary, it is about to begin yet another
life _ this time as official, rather than accidental, kitsch. .
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 6, ``Sing-a-Long Sound of Music,'' the audience
participation version of the movie that has been playing to
delirious crowds at the Prince Charles Cinema in London, will make
its debut in New York at the Ziegfeld Theater.
</P>
<P>
   The basic premise is simple: During such deathless Rodgers and
Hammerstein standards as ``Sixteen Going On Seventeen,'' ``So Long,
Farewell'' and ``Climb Ev'ry Mountain,'' moviegoers sing along to
the lyrics, which appear on the screen as subtitles.
</P>
<P>
   Singing along, however, is just one of the evening's many
opportunities for self-expression. In London, when Julie Andrews'
fellow nuns ask, ``How do you solve a problem like Maria?'' the
crowd holds up postcards printed with question marks. When Captain
von Trapp (Christopher Plummer) first kisses Maria, they let loose
a hail of party poppers.
</P>
<P>
   Attendees wear nuns' habits and lederhosen; others dress as
Nazis, the Alps (covered in shaving cream) and as representations
of song lyrics _ like wild geese, with cutouts of the moon mounted
on their wings, as described in ``My Favorite Things.''
</P>
<P>
   Bert Fink, a spokesman for the Rodgers and Hammerstein
Organization, which controls the copyright on the composers' music
and lyrics, thinks such strenuous glee is, for the English, the
adult equivalent of the breathless outbursts at traditional English
Punch and Judy shows. Example: when Julie Andrews cannot find
material to make play clothes for the von Trapp tykes, the audience
yells, ``The curtains, Maria!''
</P>
<P>
   In July, home-grown performances were mounted in Boston and
Austin, Texas. Charmian Carr, who portrayed the eldest von Trapp
daughter, Liesl, was the guest of honor in Austin. Carr, the author
of ``Forever Liesl: A Memoir of the Sound of Music'' (Viking,
2000), recalled that during one scene in which Plummer tenderly
touched Andrews' nose, a chant of ``Get the booger, captain!''
arose.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hysterical,'' she said. ``There were 1,300 people and
they were sitting in the aisles. It was sacrilegious, but great
fun. It could just be that there are so many people who really do
love the movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Others are more cynical. Crist, for example.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's so popular because the world has come to realize
what a really godawful thing the film is,'' she said. ``In 35 years
it's become even sappier. There's a point where it's so bad that it
becomes funny.''
</P>
<P>
   As with ``Mommie Dearest'' and ``Valley of the Dolls,'' this
camp aspect of ``Sing-a-Long Sound of Music'' has made it a hit
with gay viewers. The production began as an entry in the London
Lesbian and Gay Film Festival; the Austin Gay and Lesbian
International Film Festival co-produced the Texas event to benefit
Project Transitions, a nonprofit group that provides hospice care
and housing for AIDS victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just thought it would be fun,'' said Charlotte Hale, the
executive director of Project Transitions. ``Certainly the gay
community liked it, but a lot of mainstream people were there.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the show is being dizzily promoted as all-family
entertainment. ``Wave your edelweiss!'' reads a press release.
``Cheer the von Trapp kids! Bark at Rolf (the telegram boy)! Boo
the Nazis! Hiss the baroness!''
</P>
<P>
   Camp aside, the movie also seems to have a powerful emotional
effect on a lot of apparently normal people. Even ushers at the
singalongs have been seen to choke up during the finale.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the countless renderings of ``Do-Re-Mi'' and ``My
Favorite Things'' in grade school and in Muzak-filled elevators
have left permanent musical saccharine deposits in the collective
consciousness. Perhaps, like the Kevin Bacon Game, ``Sing-a-Long
Sound of Music'' was a form of cinemania just waiting to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kenneth Tynan said that movies are the most dominant
repository of memory we have,'' said the film critic Andrew Sarris.
``I suppose this is just a manifestation of that. Everyone
remembers `The Sound of Music.' You can blast it but you can't
obliterate it, I guess.''

   NEW YORK _ In her 1965 review of ``The Sound of Music'' for The
New York Herald Tribune, Judith Crist wrote, ``The movie is for the
5-to-7 set and their mommies who think their kids aren't up to the
stinging sophistication and biting wit of `Mary Poppins.'''
</P>
<P>
   The rest is history.
</P>
<P>
   Today, as the highest grossing film musical of all time
approaches its 35th anniversary, it is about to begin yet another
life _ this time as official, rather than accidental, kitsch. .
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 6, ``Sing-a-Long Sound of Music,'' the audience
participation version of the movie that has been playing to
delirious crowds at the Prince Charles Cinema in London, will make
its debut in New York at the Ziegfeld Theater.
</P>
<P>
   The basic premise is simple: During such deathless Rodgers and
Hammerstein standards as ``Sixteen Going On Seventeen,'' ``So Long,
Farewell'' and ``Climb Ev'ry Mountain,'' moviegoers sing along to
the lyrics, which appear on the screen as subtitles.
</P>
<P>
   Singing along, however, is just one of the evening's many
opportunities for self-expression. In London, when Julie Andrews'
fellow nuns ask, ``How do you solve a problem like Maria?'' the
crowd holds up postcards printed with question marks. When Captain
von Trapp (Christopher Plummer) first kisses Maria, they let loose
a hail of party poppers.
</P>
<P>
   Attendees wear nuns' habits and lederhosen; others dress as
Nazis, the Alps (covered in shaving cream) and as representations
of song lyrics _ like wild geese, with cutouts of the moon mounted
on their wings, as described in ``My Favorite Things.''
</P>
<P>
   Bert Fink, a spokesman for the Rodgers and Hammerstein
Organization, which controls the copyright on the composers' music
and lyrics, thinks such strenuous glee is, for the English, the
adult equivalent of the breathless outbursts at traditional English
Punch and Judy shows. Example: when Julie Andrews cannot find
material to make play clothes for the von Trapp tykes, the audience
yells, ``The curtains, Maria!''
</P>
<P>
   In July, home-grown performances were mounted in Boston and
Austin, Texas. Charmian Carr, who portrayed the eldest von Trapp
daughter, Liesl, was the guest of honor in Austin. Carr, the author
of ``Forever Liesl: A Memoir of the Sound of Music'' (Viking,
2000), recalled that during one scene in which Plummer tenderly
touched Andrews' nose, a chant of ``Get the booger, captain!''
arose.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hysterical,'' she said. ``There were 1,300 people and
they were sitting in the aisles. It was sacrilegious, but great
fun. It could just be that there are so many people who really do
love the movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Others are more cynical. Crist, for example.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's so popular because the world has come to realize
what a really godawful thing the film is,'' she said. ``In 35 years
it's become even sappier. There's a point where it's so bad that it
becomes funny.''
</P>
<P>
   As with ``Mommie Dearest'' and ``Valley of the Dolls,'' this
camp aspect of ``Sing-a-Long Sound of Music'' has made it a hit
with gay viewers. The production began as an entry in the London
Lesbian and Gay Film Festival; the Austin Gay and Lesbian
International Film Festival co-produced the Texas event to benefit
Project Transitions, a nonprofit group that provides hospice care
and housing for AIDS victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just thought it would be fun,'' said Charlotte Hale, the
executive director of Project Transitions. ``Certainly the gay
community liked it, but a lot of mainstream people were there.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the show is being dizzily promoted as all-family
entertainment. ``Wave your edelweiss!'' reads a press release.
``Cheer the von Trapp kids! Bark at Rolf (the telegram boy)! Boo
the Nazis! Hiss the baroness!''
</P>
<P>
   Camp aside, the movie also seems to have a powerful emotional
effect on a lot of apparently normal people. Even ushers at the
singalongs have been seen to choke up during the finale.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the countless renderings of ``Do-Re-Mi'' and ``My
Favorite Things'' in grade school and in Muzak-filled elevators
have left permanent musical saccharine deposits in the collective
consciousness. Perhaps, like the Kevin Bacon Game, ``Sing-a-Long
Sound of Music'' was a form of cinemania just waiting to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kenneth Tynan said that movies are the most dominant
repository of memory we have,'' said the film critic Andrew Sarris.
``I suppose this is just a manifestation of that. Everyone
remembers `The Sound of Music.' You can blast it but you can't
obliterate it, I guess.''

RUNNING SILENT, DEEP AND SOMETIMES DEADLY

<P>
   There is a famous bit of publishing lore about how Tom Clancy's
first novel, ``The Hunt for Red October,'' caught on in the
mid-1980s. President Reagan read the tale of submarine disaster and
derring-do and mentioned publicly that it was mesmerizing. The
novel, published by the tiny Naval Institute Press, quickly became
a runaway best seller.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan's instincts for pure and simple drama catapulted Clancy
to fame. But they also help explain why the world has been so
transfixed by the sinking of the Russian submarine Kursk in the
Barents Sea and the desperate attempts to reach the 118 men either
trapped or dead inside. At week's end, rescue attempts were
unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knows that tales of sea adventure and calamity have
always held deep appeal, and best sellers like ``The Perfect
Storm'' and movies like ``Titanic,'' ``Das Boot'' and ``U-571''
have tapped into that fascination. But what is it about the sea _
and especially submarines _ that often makes the drama of those
trapped below the waves resonate more than similar disasters on
land, like mine cave-ins?
</P>
<P>
   Part of the answer is that for all the advances in science, the
sea remains a mysterious _ and mystical _ force. Since the 1960s,
every achievement in the space program has been covered so minutely
by the news media that outer space has a familiar feel. But once
you slip below the ocean's waves, you enter a dark, unpredictable
and often claustrophobic world that, in some ways, rivals space as
the final frontier.
</P>
<P>
   A frontier, but one so hauntingly close as to still feel a part
of daily life. At just 350 feet down, the men stuck on the Kursk
were tantalizingly near to safety last week, even as storms and
rough seas frustrated rescue efforts. If the Washington monument
were standing at that depth, only two-thirds of it would be under
water.
</P>
<P>
   What also sticks so hard in many people's hearts is a sense of
the courage and ingenuity of the men who volunteer to serve on
what, as some like to point out in happier times, are the only
ships that are actually designed to sink.
</P>
<P>
   Through frantic depth-charge scenes in World War II movies, many
people are attracted to the strong, and enviable, bond that unites
so many of these men when danger strikes. When the alarm bells ring
on a submarine, ``You have to be able to rely on the first man who
comes to the scene to do what needs to be done,'' said Carlisle
A.H. Trost, a retired admiral and a former chief of naval
operations.
</P>
<P>
   When he was a young submarine officer during the Cold War, Trost
and several of his mates were briefly overcome by gases while
disengaging a torpedo that had suddenly begun to ignite. Partly as
a result of the common risk of such accidents, he said, there also
is ``a bond of camaraderie'' between American and Russian
submariners, a sense of brotherhood, that always transcended the
antagonisms between the countries.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the allure has been deepened by new revelations about
this formerly secret world.
</P>
<P>
   Since the start of the Cold War, the use of submarines for
spying has been cloaked under the tightest secrecy. And it is only
in the last few years that some of those exploits have surfaced.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. submarines, for instance, have spent lots of time off
Russian naval ports, waiting to intercept radio communications and
check out the capabilities of each new class of Russian missile
boats. The stakes were high. The goal of these submarines was
nothing less than to avoid another Pearl Harbor, a surprise attack
in the much deadlier age of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, the United States also sent a few specially
equipped submarines into Soviet seas to dispatch divers, who tapped
into underwater communications cables and retrieved pieces of
Soviet test missiles.
</P>
<P>
   But despite all this heroism, it has only been at the time of
accidents like the Kursk sinking that the public has had a chance
to peer inside this hidden world.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Navy lost two nuclear-powered submarines, the USS
Thresher and the USS Scorpion, in the 1960s. The Scorpion sank in
an accident on the way home from the Mediterranean, and no one
realized it in time to stop family members from waiting for her on
a rainy dock in Norfolk, Va.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians have suffered far greater calamity, losing more
than 500 men in submarine accidents over the last 40 years,
according to the newspaper Izvestia. The loss of the Kursk is
particularly poignant because many of the men were in their 20s and
the submarine was not on a risky military adventure, but simply
taking part in a training cruise. And the exercise, the largest in
recent years, seems to have been held as much for political reasons
as for tactical ones, in a forlorn bid to recapture some of the
Russian navy's former power and glory.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is the image of men possibly huddled in the hull,
banging for attention as the air turned foul and the sea churned
through their sub, that will linger most.

   In Vice President Al Gore's campaign to change his robotic
image, nothing may have helped more than the big smooch. Gore
stepped on stage at the Democratic Convention on Thursday and
greeted his wife, Tipper, with a quick embrace and a kiss on the
lips. But instead of letting go, as nice politicians are supposed
to, he wrapped her tighter in his arms, closed his eyes and gave
her a full-mouthed kiss that lasted a exceptionally long time.
(Actually three seconds; we have tapes; we've counted.)
</P>
<P>
   When he remembered where he was _ on national television about
to accept his party's nomination for president _ he backed away and
went on with his business.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, he could not really have forgotten the cameras for a
second, and soon commentators were speculating about how calculated
the kiss was. Mrs. Gore had spent days on the talk show circuit
trying to humanize her husband's image, after all. And here was the
living proof of his humanity, and a photograph the papers couldn't
resist.
</P>
<P>
   The next day MSNBC had two people on the case. Chip Reid
reported that he had interviewed the Gores' daughter, Karenna Gore
Schiff, who told him that kind of kissing goes on around the house
all the time. He did not report whether the Gore children had spent
much of their youth saying, ``Yuck! Mom! Dad!''
</P>
<P>
   More substantively, Claire Shipman of NBC speculated to Don Imus
that the kiss sent a message. It signaled that Al Gore (unlike some
presidents we know) is a faithful husband. Excellent point; imagine
what would have happened if the Clintons had dared such a scene.
Though some viewers were charmed by the Gore kiss and others
squirmed, no one doubted that it was based on reality. There you
have what really makes it seem odd. The kiss struck everyone as a
political gesture based on truth, and nothing is rarer than that.
</P>
<P>
   In itself, the kiss had an old-fashioned, romantic innocence. It
resembled the moment at a wedding when the groom is asked to kiss
the bride and the guests can only wonder: Will he give her a chaste
little peck or go for it? In an earlier era, the full-mouthed
bridal kiss said, ``We can have sex now, we're married.'' Among the
list of promises Gore made in his speech, the ultimate promise may
have been the one he sent with body language: to restore
All-American marital sex to the White House.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For all the talk about the great race to the center
this year, nobody who watched the two conventions, skimmed the
parties' platforms or scrutinized the candidates' stands would
mistake the Democrat for the Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, much of the time a certain rhetorical sameness wafted from
the main stages of the convention halls, and there was little of
the partisan bite of yesteryear. But political passions kept
bubbling up, just offstage. And even among the voters at large, at
a time of peace and prosperity, with few great burning issues
pushing people in one direction or another, two-thirds of Americans
still consider themselves Democrats or Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Party, in other words, still matters.
</P>
<P>
   Party attachment is still considered one of the best predictors
of how people will vote _ if they vote. But appealing to those
loyalties, while still wooing the Independents who decide
elections, is a complicated challenge these days. Particularly for
Vice President Al Gore, many analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times/CBS News Poll shows that the Democrats have a
slight edge when it comes to party affiliation: Asked in four
national polls this year how they identify themselves, an average
of 35 percent of Americans said they were Democrats, 30 percent
Republicans, 28 percent Independents and 7 percent (probably the
least likely to vote) said they had no opinions.
</P>
<P>
   In a Times/CBS poll conducted last month, the Democratic Party
was still considered the party that would do a better job on health
care, education and ``making the right decisions'' on Social
Security _ all issues high on the voters' agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Party was given the edge on upholding traditional
family values, making sure the military stays strong and ensuring a
healthy economy. Each party, in other words, brings its nominee
certain strengths this fall.
</P>
<P>
   But until last week, Democratic voters have not embraced Gore's
candidacy with the enthusiasm Republicans have brought to Gov.
George W. Bush; the last pre-convention Times/CBS poll showed Gore
drawing 75 percent of the Democrats, while Bush got 86 percent of
the Republicans. ``I think they wasted half their convention just
trying to get strong Democrats and soft Democrats home,'' said Bill
McInturff, a Republican pollster. (Post-convention polls will tell
how successful they were.)
</P>
<P>
   There are obvious reasons why Gore has had to work harder for
voters who should be rightfully his: The Democratic Party has held
the presidency for eight years. The strains are showing between
liberals and ``New Democrats'' who want to keep the party in the
center. And the Gore candidacy has had its fits and starts.
</P>
<P>
   This was the landscape for Gore's acceptance speech Thursday
night: He needed to energize his base, but he was also keenly aware
of the swing voters turned off by partisan appeals. On one level,
his speech was profoundly Democratic. He offered himself as a
populist crusader willing to fight ``powerful forces'' _ like big
HMOs and profit-hungry pharmaceutical companies _ on behalf of
``working families.''
</P>
<P>
   But in sharp contrast to convention speeches of yesteryear,
Gore's never mentioned the words Democrat or Republican, noted
Martin Wattenberg, a political scientist at the University of
California-Irvine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's populist, but it's a broad populism,'' said Stan
Greenberg, Gore's pollster. ``It's saying, let's make sure the
whole society is able to do well.''
</P>
<P>
   To galvanize his party, and to pull back many of the
Independents who lean their way, Gore needs to draw sharp contrasts
with the Republicans, many Democratic strategists agree,
particularly on basic issues like tax cuts and health care.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans have not made it easy.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated Democrats say Bush is preaching a message _ that he
is a different kind of Republican, more sensitive and moderate _
that is distinctly at odds with his basic conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the task that Gore and the Democrats face in the fall
is to tell voters that George W. Bush really is an old-style
Republican,'' said Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster. In other
words, to block Bush's move to the center, now that he has
consolidated his own party.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats are eager to make that case and highlight the
stakes: What kind of Supreme Court justices would a Bush
administration, operating with a Republican Senate, appoint?
</P>
<P>
   Who would most profit from his tax cuts?
</P>
<P>
   What would his budget proposals mean for Medicare?
</P>
<P>
   How does Bush's health care record in Texas, which ranks high
among states in the percentage of uninsured, gibe with his promise
to provide health coverage nationwide?
</P>
<P>
   But the Gore campaign is in something of a strategic box, one
Republican strategist argued, speaking on condition that he not be
identified. While the Democrats need to highlight the differences
between the parties, overt partisanship gives the Bush campaign the
higher moral ground.
</P>
<P>
   Day after day, the Bush campaign chastised the Democrats for any
hint of partisan attacks at their convention. In fact, party
strategists say, Bush is convinced that the voters are weary of
such fights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush has seriously studied what has happened since Republicans
gained control of Congress in 1994,'' said Linda DiVall, a
Republican poll taker. ``Frankly, Republicans don't do well when we
get into a fight with Clinton or a fight among ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, of course, has the luxury of denouncing partisanship and
muting the differences. Eight years in the wilderness, and a
profound disdain for the Clinton administration, go a long way
toward keeping Republican voters unified and motivated.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Bush has ably capitalized on his party's traditional
strengths _ most notably, in the aftermath of the Clinton scandals,
the notion that Republicans have stronger moral values. And he has
dealt with his party's vulnerabilities, presenting a multi-ethnic,
family-friendly convention program.
</P>
<P>
   With all his ``rhetorical convergence,'' as the political
scientist Thomas Mann puts it, some voters might well ask just
whether there's much difference between the parties _ an argument
at the heart of Ralph Nader's third-party campaign.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

 &UR; BC-PARTY-LOYALTY-REVIEW-2NDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: third-party campaign. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But, of course, in their attitudes toward government, their
approach to social issues like abortion and gay rights, their
economic philosophy and their approach to restructuring Medicare
and Social Security, the differences are large and enduring.
</P>
<P>
   And each party's reliable supporters are quite distinctive, too.
</P>
<P>
   Party affiliation is still, quite often, passed down from parent
to child, some political scientists say.
</P>
<P>
   Economic status is still strongly linked with party attachment,
although Republicans have attracted more lower-income members
through the party's embrace of social conservatives, while
Democrats have drawn more white-collar voters.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Bartels, a professor of politics at Princeton University,
maintains that party loyalty was a greater factor in presidential
voting in the 1990s than at any time since the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   And McInturff notes that, if anything, partisan voters have
become even more so thanks to the polarizing figures of President
Clinton and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich _ but for the same
reason people in the middle may have become even more turned off by
partisanship.
</P>
<P>
   Another twist is the unpredictable but undeniable role of third
parties. Wattenberg noted that since the Civil War, third party
voting has not totaled more than 5 percent of the overall vote in
two consecutive elections _ until 1992 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   All of which suggests the complicated politics that awaits the
voters this fall: a fierce, nonpartisan partisan struggle. For
Gore, the campaign will be about ``fighting for working families,''
and for Bush, ``compassionate conservatism.'' In other words, the
parties are dead, long live the parties.

NONPARTISANS IN A PARTISAN STRUGGLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating)  (The Week in Review)  
 By ROBIN TONER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For all the talk about the great race to the center
this year, nobody who watched the two conventions, skimmed the
parties' platforms or scrutinized the candidates' stands would
mistake the Democrat for the Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, much of the time a certain rhetorical sameness wafted from
the main stages of the convention halls, and there was little of
the partisan bite of yesteryear. But political passions kept
bubbling up, just offstage. And even among the voters at large, at
a time of peace and prosperity, with few great burning issues
pushing people in one direction or another, two-thirds of Americans
still consider themselves Democrats or Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Party, in other words, still matters.
</P>
<P>
   Party attachment is still considered one of the best predictors
of how people will vote _ if they vote. But appealing to those
loyalties, while still wooing the Independents who decide
elections, is a complicated challenge these days. Particularly for
Vice President Al Gore, many analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times/CBS News Poll shows that the Democrats have a
slight edge when it comes to party affiliation: Asked in four
national polls this year how they identify themselves, an average
of 35 percent of Americans said they were Democrats, 30 percent
Republicans, 28 percent Independents and 7 percent (probably the
least likely to vote) said they had no opinions.
</P>
<P>
   In a Times/CBS poll conducted last month, the Democratic Party
was still considered the party that would do a better job on health
care, education and ``making the right decisions'' on Social
Security _ all issues high on the voters' agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Party was given the edge on upholding traditional
family values, making sure the military stays strong and ensuring a
healthy economy. Each party, in other words, brings its nominee
certain strengths this fall.
</P>
<P>
   But until last week, Democratic voters have not embraced Gore's
candidacy with the enthusiasm Republicans have brought to Gov.
George W. Bush; the last pre-convention Times/CBS poll showed Gore
drawing 75 percent of the Democrats, while Bush got 86 percent of
the Republicans. ``I think they wasted half their convention just
trying to get strong Democrats and soft Democrats home,'' said Bill
McInturff, a Republican pollster. (Post-convention polls will tell
how successful they were.)
</P>
<P>
   There are obvious reasons why Gore has had to work harder for
voters who should be rightfully his: The Democratic Party has held
the presidency for eight years. The strains are showing between
liberals and ``New Democrats'' who want to keep the party in the
center. And the Gore candidacy has had its fits and starts.
</P>
<P>
   This was the landscape for Gore's acceptance speech Thursday
night: He needed to energize his base, but he was also keenly aware
of the swing voters turned off by partisan appeals. On one level,
his speech was profoundly Democratic. He offered himself as a
populist crusader willing to fight ``powerful forces'' _ like big
HMOs and profit-hungry pharmaceutical companies _ on behalf of
``working families.''
</P>
<P>
   But in sharp contrast to convention speeches of yesteryear,
Gore's never mentioned the words Democrat or Republican, noted
Martin Wattenberg, a political scientist at the University of
California-Irvine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's populist, but it's a broad populism,'' said Stan
Greenberg, Gore's pollster. ``It's saying, let's make sure the
whole society is able to do well.''
</P>
<P>
   To galvanize his party, and to pull back many of the
Independents who lean their way, Gore needs to draw sharp contrasts
with the Republicans, many Democratic strategists agree,
particularly on basic issues like tax cuts and health care.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans have not made it easy.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated Democrats say Bush is preaching a message _ that he
is a different kind of Republican, more sensitive and moderate _
that is distinctly at odds with his basic conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the task that Gore and the Democrats face in the fall
is to tell voters that George W. Bush really is an old-style
Republican,'' said Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster. In other
words, to block Bush's move to the center, now that he has
consolidated his own party.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats are eager to make that case and highlight the
stakes: What kind of Supreme Court justices would a Bush
administration, operating with a Republican Senate, appoint?
</P>
<P>
   Who would most profit from his tax cuts?
</P>
<P>
   What would his budget proposals mean for Medicare?
</P>
<P>
   How does Bush's health care record in Texas, which ranks high
among states in the percentage of uninsured, gibe with his promise
to provide health coverage nationwide?
</P>

<P>
   There's one and only one show on TV tonight for most viewers:
the final ``Survivor'' episode _ a three-hour tour beginning at 8
on CBS.
</P>
<P>
   Once derided as a joke, ``Survivor'' has become a legitimate
phenomenon. It is, as everyone said in the beginning, a cross
between ``Gilligan's Island'' and ``Lord of the Flies.'' But it
also turned out to have more interesting characters and better
drama than many of TV's fictional series. With a little help from
the Internet, where the show is Topic A, ``Survivor'' has also
become the summer's highest-rated series, and a goldmine for CBS.
</P>
<P>
   The original 16 castaways have been whittled down to four _ Tagi
Alliance hardcores Richard, Susan and Rudy, and the wavering,
conflicted Kelly. In tonight's episode, two more will be eliminated
before a jury of seven ejected castaways chooses the $1 million
winner from the final duo. And of course there will be challenges,
including fire-walking.
</P>
<P>
   You have to give kudos to CBS and the castaways for keeping the
winner's identity secret all these weeks, despite intense scrutiny
and no doubt a bit of detective work by various media outlets
intent on spoiling the suspense.
</P>
<P>
   One thing CBS can be criticized for, however, is the co-opting
of its news department. First ``Early Show'' newsreader Julie Chen
was drafted to host the godawful ``Big Brother.'' And tonight at
10, after the two-hour ``Survivor'' finale, ``Early Show'' main man
Bryant Gumbel will host an hourlong ``Survivor Reunion'' with all
the castaways, which will get a huge audience but should not be
confused with a news show. (Bryant ought to ask that dumbbell ``I'm
voting in alphabetical order'' Sean to show us his diploma and
prove he's a neurologist.)
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, considering how it looked a couple of months ago,
we'll be sad to see this crew go, especially the lovely Colleen and
the conniving Richard. But of course they're not really going
anywhere. Most of the castaways already have new gigs to capitalize
on their fame. Richard's guest-hosting a radio show in Rhode
Island, and Sean has been named medical correspondent for
``Extra.''
</P>
<P>

HINES COLUMN 8/20 (sun) &HT;    BUSH, GORE: STATUS QUO ANTE HOOPLA
 &HT;    By Cragg Hines
 &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   CThe conventions are over, and the two major presidential
candidates still face essentially the same task they did before the
lavish infomercials.
</P>
<P>
   Neither George W. Bush nor Al Gore has closed the sale. There's
still some life in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The electorate finds Bush likable and capable of leading but
still has some questions about his grasp of _ and position on _
important issues. Gore is over the hump on the experience issue
(and perhaps even too far over, given his two decades in
Washington), but major questions remain about his leadership
abilities.
</P>
<P>
   Robert S. Strauss, the former Democratic national chairman, put
Gore's problem in a question last week: ``Do they find him
appealing enough?''
</P>
<P>
   Polling over the next two weeks will tell whether the convention
helped Gore truly close that gap. Because as the convention started
and as the four-night miniseries played out, Bush had a decided
upper hand. Overnight polling as the convention closed showed a
predictable bounce for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the Republican show in Philadelphia, Bush was
beginning to dominate both the issue and character debate. An
esoteric but revealing scatter graph by the Gallup Organization,
combining issues and character questions, showed a significant tilt
to Bush. Based on polling July 25-26, the graph assesses which
candidate scored better with likely voters on 14 issues and nine
personal characteristics.
</P>
<P>
   Suffice to say there were more dots _ and more important ones _
on Bush's side of the center bar, topping out with the Republican's
better showing on honesty and trustworthiness and his being
perceived as a strong and decisive leader. Gore had a marginal
advantage on what the Democrats see as their iron triangle of
issues: health care, education and Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   The favorable finding for Bush has been reflected in national
polling and in the important state-by-state Electoral College
assessments. As the Democratic convention ended, independent
analyst Charlie Cook listed only three states and the District of
Columbia, with a total of 52 electoral votes, as ``solid Gore,''
whereas 18 states, with 140 electoral votes, were ``solid Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding in ``likely'' and ``leaning'' states, Gore got to 174,
while Bush surged to 250, just 20 short of the 270 needed to win.
Nailing down just one or two states from the 12 in Cook's ``toss
up'' list could tilt the contest, perhaps irretrievably, against
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Against this at least momentarily inhospitable backdrop, top
Democratic strategists departed Los Angeles honing various defense
mechanisms to get them through to Labor Day and over the next 11
weeks. The snap polls showing a Gore convention bump is a
short-term tonic, but experienced hands know not to take the
numbers too seriously for a couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats' riskiest tack seems to be the attempt to keep
moving forward the date by which Gore can turn the race around. The
favorite marker for Democrats is the prospect of Bush-Gore &QL; 
face-offs.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as the debates are out there, anything is
recoverable,'' Strauss said. But even he said fellow Gore partisans
may be putting too much faith in the vice president's ability to
deliver a knockout blow in a one-on-one with Bush.
</P>
<P>
   An added segment of the party is banking on Gore's ability,
beginning with his convention speech, to transform the race into an
issues-driven campaign. They take such pains developing this theme
because they know Gore has little chance of besting the
congenitally personable Bush with some misbegotten charm offensive.
</P>
<P>
   James Carville, Bill Clinton's chief strategist in 1992, argues
that Gore should relentlessly lay out his issues and confront Bush
straightforwardly to say: ``We've simply got a different view of
the world here, hoss.''
</P>
<P>
   Until the last day of the convention, Democrats hoped the
meeting had gotten one issue out of the way: President Clinton.
Even such a Clinton defender as Carville said: ``Between now and
November, I think it's Gore's turn.'' Then came the new leak that
special prosecutor Robert Ray was before a new grand jury with
evidence about Clinton in the White House sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates were outraged, hoped for a backlash, but remained
wary. Just days before, Democratic national chairman Ed Rendell had
said, perhaps presciently, of Republicans: ``These guys want this
election to be about Monica Lewinsky.''

   Texas Democrats struggling to find hero
</P>
<P>
   By CLAY ROBISION
</P>
<P>
   C. 2000 Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In the City of Angels, even a fallen angel could
be a star last week, particularly for a Texas Democratic Party
fallen on hard times.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Cisneros' ability to quicken partisan pulses with a mere
sprint through the Democratic National Convention was testimony to
the obvious. Despite an extramarital affair and a federal
indictment, the former San Antonio mayor and Clinton Cabinet
officer is still a commanding presence for many Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros, who recently returned to Texas to launch a new
business venture, may yet run for statewide office, although almost
certainly not in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact that Texas Democrats can find a potential hero in
damaged goods speaks more about the disrepair of their party than
about Cisneros. Their once-dominant party is struggling, simply to
find someone who can win a statewide office under its &QL; 
banner.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats haven't pulled that trick since 1994, and they aren't
likely to this year. The best they can hope for in November, as
Gov. George W. Bush carries Texas in the presidential race, is to
hang on to their slim majority in the Texas House, perhaps regain a
one-vote margin in the state Senate and, maybe, watch Bush's
national bid fail.
</P>
<P>
   Many other Democrats are running or hope they will be during
this rebuilding era for their party. Some wannabes are new, some
have been wannabes for a long time, and others may already be
has-beens.
</P>
<P>
   But without touting Cisneros, which is not the purpose of this
discussion, none has the former mayor's proven star quality.
</P>
<P>
   It is too early to predict a Democratic lineup for 2002, when
most statewide offices, including governor and one U.S. Senate
seat, will be on the ballot. That lineup may be affected by three
key events _ this fall's presidential race, the struggle for
partisan control of the Texas Senate and the new congressional
district lines after the Legislature and the courts complete next
year's redistricting chore.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush is elected to the White House, Republican Lt. Gov. Rick
Perry will be promoted and will be an incumbent governor running
for a full term two years from now. That not only would discourage
other Republicans from challenging Perry, it also could discourage
some Democrats. If Bush loses his presidential bid, the 2002
governor's race could be wide open because Bush already has said he
wouldn't seek another term.
</P>
<P>
   If Perry moves up to the governor's office and Democrats regain
control of the Senate, a Democratic state senator will be selected
interim lieutenant governor by his colleagues. That, in turn, could
change some of the jockeying for lieutenant governor two years from
now.
</P>
<P>
   And some Democratic members of Congress who find themselves in
unwinnable districts after redistricting may be more willing to run
for statewide office. U.S. Rep. Ken Bentsen of Houston, for that
reason, is considered a potential Senate candidate, and he was
visible among Texas delegates in Los Angeles, hosting breakfast and
passing out T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Republican U.S. Sen. Phil Gramm will be formidable if he seeks
re-election in 2002. There has been some speculation that he won't,
but it may be wishful thinking among Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Many expect wealthy Laredo businessman Tony Sanchez Jr. to run
for governor as a Democrat in 2002. Sanchez is not widely known,
but if he runs, he will have one essential ingredient _ money _
and, as a Hispanic, will have an edge in the Democratic primary.
</P>
<P>
   Former Comptroller John Sharp, who lost a tough lieutenant
governor's race to Perry two years ago, would like to run again for
that office _ or perhaps for the Senate. Former Land Commissioner
Garry Mauro, who was clobbered by Bush in the 1998 governor's race,
also wants to run again for something. But he may already have had
his last chance.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Hobby of Houston, another wealthy businessman who lost a
close race for comptroller two years ago, is believed to be eyeing
another statewide race.
</P>
<P>
   And the plaintiffs' lawyers will almost surely find and fund
someone to challenge Attorney General John Cornyn, who has been
fighting their legal fees, particularly in Texas' tobacco suit. Two
mayors _ Kirk Watson of Austin and Ron Kirk of Dallas _ are often
mentioned as prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats, who pride themselves on their diversity, are
concerned that women don't figure prominently in the early wannabe
list. A possible statewide candidate is state party chair Molly
Beth Malcolm, who has been getting national attention attacking
Bush's Texas record but won't say whether she is interested in
running for elective &QL; 
office.

 &HT;    Same school, different eras, new unease
 &HT;    By Mark Lane
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Why is it considered natural, laudable and
an affirmation of family tradition when kids go to their parents'
old colleges, yet if they end up at the same high school, everyone
gets uncomfortable?
</P>
<P>
   Case in point: look at George W. Bush. He went to Yale like his
father and grandfather and it's considered part of a heritage. But
because he also went to the same prep school as his father, people
snicker about how WASP and preppy and weird that seems.
</P>
<P>
   From the students' point of view, going to the same school is no
bargain, either. They are regaled with stories from the school's
past predating their birth, stuff they could care less about that
happened in a milieu they visualize as being around the time the
Civil War ended and Elvis was on the radio.
</P>
<P>
   And they fret about running into anyone who might still be on
the job after all those years.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, though, they are confronted with the nagging fear that
maybe, by following this all-too-familiar path, they face an eerie
yet real risk of _ worst of all fates _ Ending Up Like Their
Parents. That somehow, by walking these same overfamiliar halls and
sitting in the same rooms, they might be warped into the same shape
as the parental units.
</P>
<P>
   It makes one shudder.
</P>
<P>
   Now that my kids are at my old high school, I've been
considering these issues.
</P>
<P>
   From the front, the school looks familiar. The same red brick
and concrete stairs as when I was there. Lounging on the steps are
students in ripped jeans and shorts. Given the inexplicable
currents of nostalgia in kids' fashion, the scene is far, far too
familiar for comfort.
</P>
<P>
   What if I need to go to the assistant principal's office? I am
sure to look guilty. Just out of reflex. As it is, when I venture
on campus, I sneak past the main office or pick up my stride to a
jog when passing the attendance office.
</P>
<P>
   I already know many of the routes students take when they skip
out of class and most of the more common destinations the kids aim
for after they escape. How do I explain such knowledge to the kids?
``Well, that's what people tell me,'' I say.
</P>
<P>
   I know the nooks where one can kill time unobtrusively if
somebody with a score to settle is roaming the halls looking for
you or if you've slipped away from student assemblies. Is this
valuable information to be shared, or something best kept to
yourself, lest it be used for evil rather than self-defense?
</P>
<P>
   And there are larger issues here, too. This is America. We are a
mobile society. On the go.
</P>
<P>
   Finding yourself in the same neighborhood after 30 years is
considered suspect in our culture. A sign of failure or lack of
ambition. No matter how many places you've seen between sessions.
</P>
<P>
   And demographically, it is a bit abnormal. Last year, 16 percent
of the adult population packed up and moved, according to the U.S.
Census Bureau. And that number represented a historic low. And
we're even more mobile here in Florida, the Moving Van State.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is continuity of experiences between generations a very
American concept. It's pre-rock'n'roll. Pre-modern. Sorta medieval.
Things just are not supposed to be that way.
</P>
<P>
   I've attempted to allay the kids' concerns by dropping them off
unobtrusively and not right in front of the school. Somehow this
feels better. And I agree. But I also quickly remind them that I
had walked to this school under my own power.
</P>
<P>
   Uphill. Both ways.
</P>
<P>
   They roll their eyes and run off. The Old School Problem isn't
so easily dispelled.

 &HT;    `Survivor' sites ensure you never have to be off island
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ We know where you'll be this Wednesday night, oh yes
we do. You'll be with the rest of your fellow ``Survivor'' addicts
parked comfortably on your couch watching the big three-hour season
finale of the desert island drama. You will be watching, hoping and
praying that Richard, the biggest rat on the island, hasn't
manipulated his way into becoming the million-dollar sole survivor.
</P>
<P>
   For those of you who believe you have better things to do on
Wednesday nights, ``Survivor'' is CBS' surprise blockbuster hit
that has lured more people than anyone imagined back to the former
Tiffany network to see how a group of strangers initially divided
into two tribes is able to survive not only the rigors of island
life, but the rigors of coping with one of the most disparate
collections of personalities ever assembled on network television.
</P>
<P>
   While ``Survivor'' may have brought CBS back from the dead, it
has also resurrected one of the most wonderful things about the Web
_ personal fan pages devoted to TV shows. Whether you are a diehard
fan or somebody who desperately needs to catch up before the big
finale on Wednesday, check out the fan pages devoted to all things
``Survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Survivor'' fan pages are so refreshing, particularly to
those of us who follow Internet goings-on. They're well-designed,
informative and fun sites built by fans who just want to have a
little fun with their favorite TV show.
</P>
<P>
   The best of the best ``Survivor'' sites is SurvivorSucks.com
(www.survivorsucks.com). It describes itself as ``A fan site for
those who love to hate `Survivor' on CBS.'' A word of warning
before you surf on over, though: some of the language might not be
suitable for younger ``Survivor'' fans, as the site's title clearly
indicates. However, that said, it's still a great guilty pleasure
for adult fans. (Several Web executives secretly admit to being
addicted to this site but asked not to have it included in articles
written about them or ``Survivor.'')
</P>
<P>
   You'll appreciate the effort that went into this site _ the
tongue-in-cheek episode commentaries and the news section, which
features clear-eyed analysis of who will be forced to grab his or
her backpack, turn in the torch and get off the island.
</P>
<P>
   Bonus points to the site designers for putting this in text that
has to be highlighted to be read, so the people who want to be
surprised can stay in suspense.
</P>
<P>
   The message boards are filled with comments from people who
clearly think the show is hilarious and want to share their
opinions with other fans.
</P>
<P>
   If you love the show, you'll love this site. The sarcastic
analysis and commentary from the site's creators keep fans coming
back for more. Hopefully the site will stay up for a while _ even
after Wednesday's finale.
</P>
<P>
   Another surprisingly good ``Survivor'' site comes from CBS
itself. Up until now, CBS has been fumbling around in the dark
trying to find a Web strategy or anything that will draw users to
its site.
</P>
<P>
   With its mini-``Survivor'' site
(www.cbs.com/network/tvshows/mini/survivor), CBS scores big.
</P>
<P>
   The site includes the inevitable show summaries, video of the
tribe members talking about their experiences, an opportunity to
vote for the next person to get the boot and cast profiles.
</P>
<P>
   We could probably do without the merchandizing section, but who
can blame CBS for wanting to cash in on the show's runaway
popularity?
</P>
<P>
   CBS makes up for its shameless product pitches with a very cool
interactive map of the island that's definitely worth a look
(www.cbs.com/network/tvshows/mini/survivor/island/fsetflash.shtml).
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the parody sites. Ed Bain's Pop Corn Culture site
(homestead.icast.com
</P>
<P>
   /edbain/files/SURVIVOR.htm) offers up a short film that runs
well on a 28.8k bps modem that poses the question: What would
happen if the ``Survivor'' cast was sent to Russian space station
Mir instead of the island?
</P>
<P>
   And, if you think you have what it takes to become a survivor
yourself, or are wondering how those dreadful people got there in
the first place, check out TC Conway's application for ``Survivor
II'' (www.tcconway.com
</P>
<P>
   /AboutTC-App.asp).
</P>
<P>
   CBS isn't taking applications any longer, but it is amusing to
see what you need to do to get yourself marooned on an island.
</P>
<P>
   As the late comic Jimmy Durante used to say, ``everybody wants
to get into the act'' when it comes to ``Survivor.'' There are tons
of articles and essays on the show from almost every entertainment
site you can think of. Everyone seems to have an opinion, but be
sure to check out Linda Stasi's New York Post essay on the show.
(www
</P>
<P>
   .nypostonline.com/entertainment/35143.htm).
</P>
<P>
   She used to hate ``Survivor,'' she writes. ``Now I just hate the
survivors ... literally and figuratively. What I really hate,
though, is that the show is actually just a mirror of modern
corporate life.''
</P>
<P>
   This is what a lot of us have secretly been thinking all along,
and truth be told, that's probably why we watch. Thank goodness for
the fan sites that remind us to lighten up _ it's just a TV show,
after all.

 &HT;    `Perfect Dark' fun, but expect action rather than a story
 &HT;    By Vox Day
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ ``Perfect Dark'' is a sequel of sorts to
``Goldeneye,'' the game that brought computer-style 3-D action to
the Nintendo 64 for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   While it combines nearly every annoying marketing element in the
book, ``Perfect Dark'' is simply an excellent action game.
</P>
<P>
   Lacking the ability to network between machines, video games
have lagged well behind computer counterparts in the multiplayer
3-D action game first demonstrated in ``Doom.''
</P>
<P>
   While computer gamers have had a mind-boggling array of
player-modified weapons, levels and characters to choose from,
along with up to 15 teammates and opponents, video gamers have been
stuck playing with at most three opponents while peering at a
screen divided into two or four parts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perfect Dark'' changes none of that; it's a function of the
hardware technology, not the software. But it does provide a
training facility that, in its willingness to stack the odds
against you with AI-controlled simdroids, provides a fair
approximation of the pulse-rate-lifting stress and excitement that
multiplayer action does.
</P>
<P>
   There are 10 different challenges in the training section, and I
found myself still playing them long after I would have finished
playing most games.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, I still haven't gotten to the real game itself. I
guess that's really beside the point, since the story line is the
usual mishmash of silly alien conspiracy stuff that has plagued so
many games ever since the ``X-Files'' was first televised.
</P>
<P>
   This, too, is in keeping with tradition _ one of the many
admirable things about ``Doom'' was its refusal to pretend that it
had any plot or story line. ``Perfect Dark'' might as well have
done the same. It's all about the action, you see.
</P>
<P>
   The graphics are good, with windows that shatter, walls that
show damage and good lighting effects. There are many weapons,
ranging from clip-emptying burst fire machines to single-shot
silencers and remote mines.
</P>
<P>
   My personal favorite is to have an autofiring Cyclone in each
hand; this seems to do the trick quite nicely on most enemies. I'm
impressed with this game, mostly because I really didn't expect to
see action this exciting on a single-player system setup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perfect Dark'' is not nearly perfect, but it will certainly
give any action gamer his or her money's worth. P.S.: You need the
4-megabyte expansion pack to play the solo missions.
</P>
<P>
   `PERFECT DARK'

</P>

   Price: $59.99

 &HT;    Playing around on the Web
 &HT;    By Mary Jo DiLonardo
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Long gone are the days of painful piano lessons in
Mrs. Crotchety's parlor. No more glowering looks and accusations
that you haven't been practicing. No more ominous ticking of the
dusty metronome as you struggle to keep up.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the wonderful world of the Web.
</P>
<P>
   With a couple clicks of the mouse, you can soon be tickling the
ivories or strumming a guitar without ever having to leave the
comfort of your home. Music education has jumped on the Internet
bandwagon offering online instrument lessons _ via video, sound
and/or text _ and how-to-play-music software.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Internet's most prominent music sites, Guitar.com
offers a huge library of video guitar lessons _ both from music
instructors and from well-known musicians such as B.B. King and
Richie Havens. The site also features chord and scale generators to
help players tune their guitars.
</P>
<P>
   Rock legend Havens recently called Guitar.com one of his
favorite Web sites. ``I go here and learn,'' he said. ``They have
tablature, guitar chords and teachers that you can hook into and
learn from directly.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Bradshaw often uses his Web site, www.cyberfret.com, as an
additional resource for the 65 guitar students he teaches each week
in Columbus, Ohio. The Web site, however, is designed primarily for
people learning the guitar on their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guitar has traditionally been an instrument that people have
taught themselves,'' says Bradshaw. ``Now they have a very powerful
tool that can help them learn: the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradshaw uses computer technology even with traditional
in-person students. He uses a computer to play background
accompaniments for songs that students are playing. With the
computer, he says, he can change the key, tempo, or even style of a
song, unlike playing along with a CD.
</P>
<P>
   One great advantage to using online technology is the
availability of multimedia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students can watch a technique being demonstrated over and
over, or even at different camera angles,'' Bradshaw explains.
``They can listen to examples, or play along with a virtual band.
Related material can be easily accessed through linking to other
pages within the site, or to Web sites anywhere in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere around 1,500 people visit Vision Music
(www.visionmusic.com) each day for guitar instruction, says site
creator and instructor Mark Stefani who lives in Tualatin, Ore.,
just outside of Portland.
</P>
<P>
   The site offers everything from an ``eye test'' to help
first-year students assess their abilities and figure out where
they need work, to a database of articles on technique, motivation
and practice. In addition, it is the host for ``Jam Central
Station,'' a round-the-clock online jam session for players of all
instruments.
</P>
<P>
   Although Stefani says his site can be a supplement for students
taking traditional music lessons, he sees it as a broader
educational tool.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized that it was serving a unique purpose in providing
musicians around the world who couldn't afford private lessons an
opportunity to learn and to be inspired,'' he says. ``This group
numbers in the thousands, including retired folks on a limited
budget, kids, etc.''
</P>
<P>
   While many of the online instructional sites are accessible
whenever you get the urge, some offer actual lessons at explicit
times.
</P>
<P>
   At www.RiffInteractive.com, students log on to a chat session at
a specific time and join 20-30 other students for guitar lessons.
An interface allows the instructor to send out music notation,
pictures, and sound and video clips. While these group lessons are
free, one-to-one lessons _ via NetMeeting's two-way streaming video
_ are $40 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Then every lesson is archived in a database for students to call
up at will.
</P>
<P>
   The main demographic for the online lessons are men age 16-35,
according to Riff Interactive's Steve Roeder. He says plans are in
the works for similar sites teaching drums and keyboards.
</P>
<P>
   Music teachers can stake out a spot to create their lessons and
instantly post them online for their students at sites like
NotationStation.net. They can use a free online notation service
(notation is a way of writing out musical notes) provided and send
students to their own personal area on the site.
</P>
<P>
   Then students have the tools to compose, edit, print and listen
to music, along with the ability to input notation through the
keyboard or mouse, or from a live instrument via MIDI files.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of NotationStation.net is for teachers to extend
their reach beyond the classroom,'' says founder Nathaniel Weiss.
``Kids are using computers all the time, and this provides an
immersive, collaborative environment to make the music they learn
in school come alive.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to getting music instruction online, there's plenty
of software available that allows would-be players to learn at
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest thing for any instructor to do is to get people to
practice,'' admits Laurie Arthur, president of PlayPro, a company
that manufactures instructional music software.
</P>
<P>
   ``Practicing by yourself is pretty boring. With PlayPro, there's
always a band behind you and it's much more fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the people who usually take traditional music lessons _
kids and teenagers _ the audience for educational music software is
much broader, says Arthur.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a whole pool of people out there who'd love to play in
a band or just get their chops back but their schedule just doesn't
allow private lessons.''
</P>
<P>
   The quickest students have made it through the software program
is three months, says Arthur. On average, it takes the average
person about six to nine months to complete the instructional
program. The software ranges from $49-$89.
</P>
<P>
   Technology has its plusses and minuses, says guitarist and
country singer Keith Urban, who appears in a series of video
lessons at the House of Blues Web site (www.hob.com) . Urban, a
highly respected player who has worked with Garth Brooks and the
Dixie Chicks, was a self-taught guitar prodigy by the age of 6. He
laughs that he never had access to an instructional video as a kid
_ much less online lessons.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you didn't know technically how to do something you had to
find your own way and it created a lot of originality and your own
style,'' says Urban, whose downloadable video lessons include a
how-to for classic country ``chicken picking.'' Chicken picking is
a style of playing that's popular with country musicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there is some advantage to being able to see people show
you certain things. There are some things that you really know how
to do them or you won't be able to do it,'' he admits.
</P>
<P>
   Though technology has its positives, Urban's sure some things
won't change. He says, hopefully, ``I don't think technology will
ever overpower creativity.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, there's one other thing technology can't help you do.
</P>
<P>
   ``From almost 30 years of dedicated teaching I've learned that
you can't make people practice,'' Stefani laughs. ``The only thing
you can do is to hopefully inspire them and fuel the flame that
flickers within.''

   Colony Wars III: Red Sun, short on plot, heavy on carnagec. 2000
Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ FOR THE CONSOLE
</P>
<P>
   Your name is Valdemar, and you're slogging away in some future
dead-end job when a regal, bald general appears in a dream and
reveals that you are the Chosen One. For what have you been chosen?
Well, from there it gets a bit hazy. Consistently vague and random
visions may ultimately distract you from the only tangible goal of
Colony Wars III: Red Sun ($30; www. midway.com; for the
PlayStation), which is to kill everything you see. If you accept
the limitations of this objective going in, then you will be free
to appreciate the game for what it is: an enjoyable, intergalactic
shoot-em-up. With aurally and visually pleasing lasers, explosions
and spaceships, ``Red Sun'' is the gaming equivalent of a good
summer blockbuster, with a thundering, cinematic soundtrack to
match. Technically above average, ``Red Sun'' graphics feature few
rough edges, and although the close-ups of Valdemar and friends are
downright creepy, most of the full motion video scenes are
stunning. Plot junkies may find ``Red Sun'' inferior to the first
two Colony Wars episodes, as the mystery of the Red Sun is never
especially compelling. But if you relish the thought of laser
cannon carnage on its own terms, then ``Red Sun,'' with its 50-plus
missions, could be a lovely way to (after) burn an hour or six.

   ($40; www.activision.com; for the PlayStation), which is a game
simpatico with the recent summer blockbuster, which in turn is
based on an immensely popular comic and cartoon franchise.
Unfortunately, the game is merely another means to brand name us
with X-Men; it has little to do with the film. In fact, it only
vaguely resembles a modern video game in the first place. Mutant
Academy is a well-drawn, well-animated 2-D fighting game _ and
that's it. There's no adventure akin to a movie plot, just the
various super-anti-heroes duking it out in a face-to-face,
side-scrolling romp. Even on the aging PlayStation console, most
fighting games are known to contain so much more than flat-action
eye-candy, such as three dimensions. Nevertheless, X-Men Mutant
Academy is a very good 2-D fighting game complete with trademark
super-moves and painful powers of mutant punishment. But it's the
weakest member in the grand amalgamation scheme of console,
cartoon, comic and cinematic extravaganza.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially reinventing the ``First Person Shooter'' genre,
Warren Spector's ($40; www.eidosinteractive.com; for Windows and
Mac) blends a deep and completely malleable role-playing story line
with the traditional wander-and-frag games of death and
indiscriminate dismemberment. In the game, produced by Texas' Ion
Storm and ported to the Mac by Austin's Aspyr Media Inc., cause and
effect decisions concerning in-game characters and environments
directly affect this feature-rich game. Deus Ex gives gamers the
opportunity to customize skills and skill levels with a suite of
``nanotech augmentations.'' This enhances, as an understated
example, one's strength or combat prowess while forgoing the
slippery skills of stealth or, visa versa, making the game as
frenzied and violent or intensely subdued as desired. Breathtaking
``real life'' visuals and a wholly immersive world of exhausted
chaos promise to make Deus Ex the new benchmark for digital
adventure.

   FOR THE DESKTOP
</P>
<P>
   Based on a venerable Dungeons &AMP; Dragons-style pen-and-paper
game, Vampire: The Masquerade _ Redemption ($45;
www.activision.com; for Windows) drops you into an immersive 3-D
world where role-playing, action and puzzle-solving are well
balanced. That's the good news. Creeping about in the shadows as
the undead anti-hero Christof and hacking away at one's enemies or
drinking the blood of one's victims is sinister fun. The
smooth-running landscapes and special effects are detailed and
atmospheric. The controls are intuitive (toggle between third and
first person), the cinematic cut scenes are lovely and the
characters who join your party are interesting and even helpful.
But the most highly anticipated aspect of the game, storyteller
mode, in which one player builds and controls a world as the game
is running, disappoints in that it requires a sure hand at the helm
_ something difficult to find in the twitchfest of the Internet _
and generally degenerates into a free-for-all. But given the right
circumstances _ a well-built local network game with all the
players physically in a room together _ Vampire has the potential
for transcending even its worst glitches.

   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   When you're hot, you're hot _ but you should have some say in
the matter. Consider then the Convair 900 ``Prestige'' Evaporative
Air Cooler ($300; www.convair.net.au). Not to be confused with
conventional air conditioners, evaporative coolers employ a
contrary, environmentally friendly means to comfort-zone ends. Air
is drawn through a large, wet filter pad by a powerful (and
distinctly audible) fan, a process similarly seen in nature when
air is cooled when it passes over an ocean or large body of water.
The Prestige holds up to four gallons of water and has a tank gauge
to monitor consumption. As a self-contained, free-standing unit
requiring only an AC power source, the Convair 900 Prestige does
not require permanent installation of gaudy bulk. It can be wheeled
to any room as needed, including the storage shed during the
off-seasons. Essentially a humidifier, the Convair Prestige is
innately less effective in extremely humid climates, but when it's
simpatico with the environment, the Prestige is very cool.

   ONE SHARP DVD PLAYER
</P>
<P>
   I've always been an early adopter. I'm too young to have jumped
on the bulkiest, most-expensive Beta VCR, but when CD players were
introduced, I hustled out and picked up an awkward, heavy,
way-too-expensive, top-loading monolith of a unit. It wasn't long
before I'd broken my oath not to duplicate my album collection on
disc, either. So when consumer DVD units began appearing, I took a
deep breath. This time, I'd be the smart one. I'd wait 'til they
were out a while, 'til the price dropped. Well, it might be time to
jump in. Having lived with Sharp's DV-770U DVD Player ($300;
www.sharpelectronics.com) for a few weeks, I am impressed. Okay, I
don't have anything (except VHS) to compare it to, but Sharp's
Digital Gamma Correction (which enhances picture quality by
adjusting color values in dim areas according to picture
brightness) and Digital Super Picture (it increases the sharpness
of images) sure seemed to render a crisp, clear picture in the day
and too far into the night. It sports all the standard DVD features
(Dolby Digital sound, noise reduction, audio CD compatibility) and
a remote control that looks like it could operate the USS
Enterprise. Watch long and prosper.

 &HT;    Anyone can play guitar?
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   Look, you're never going be a true Austinite until you've
learned a few chords and opened for Jerry Jeff Walker. But, what's
that? You don't know how to play guitar? Before you sign up for
lessons, check out eMedia Guitar Method CD-ROM ($60 for Windows and
Macintosh, www.emedia.org). The CD-ROM teaches you guitar basics
with features like an animated fretboard, fretronome, a ``virtual''
guitar neck that illustrates where to put your fingers and a
selection of classic songs to practice, such as ``La Bamba'' and
``House of the Rising Sun.'' Other volumes of the software include
a roster of new songs and help from guitar whiz Peter Frampton.
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU CAN KICK IT, THIS WILL RECORD IT
</P>
<P>
   OK, you've learned how to play the guitar and you've put
together a band. The problem is that the major record labels aren't
calling. What do you do? You make your own garage-band-grunge CD.
Helping you in this is Sony's new ECM-MS907 one-point stereo
microphone ($100, www.sony.com). The microphone fits all Sony
minidisc and DAT players and offers superior sound recording in the
right situations, such as recording instruments. However, it didn't
work well in picking up vocals. It also boasts 90- and 120-degree
recording so you can bring the whole orchestra. A piece of advice:
Invite the whole band, can the droning lyrics and get right to the
guitar solo.
</P>
<P>
   LOOK GOOD WHILE YOU LISTEN
</P>
<P>
   You want to look good while listening to your tunes. That's why
you need to pick up Sony's Street Style Discman ($160,
www.sony.com). The industrial-looking Discman is a must-have for
the trendy, on-the-go set. The device is finished in chrome and red
translucent plastic and has a carrying strap, making it the
ultimate accoutrement to a rollerblading escapade. The Street Style
Discman also comes with Street Style headphones, which wrap around
the back of the head and provide awesome sound. If you think this
portable CD player just looks good, think again. This Discman is
equipped with Sony's patented ESP2, which is some of the best skip
protection on the market. With ESP2 and the Street Style Discman,
you'll never miss a beat _ and look good in the process.

 &HT;    Keep track of financesBy Sue Cleere and Jacki Rudd
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   I've heard of Web sites that keep track of your financial
information but haven't found any. By giving them your logins and
passwords they can display your balances from different banks,
mutual funds and other accounts on one Web page. Do these sites
exist, or is it just wishful dreaming?
</P>
<P>
   _ Derek Marks, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Derek, your dreams have come true! We found all kinds of
Web sites that keep track of your financial information, securely.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: I set up my checking account and two credit cards within
minutes on two Web sites. Give AltaVista MyAccounts a try at
myaccounts1.altavista.com. You'll first have to register with
AltaVista, then create a MyAccounts login. Another option is MyCiti
(myaccounts.myciti.com). I was thrilled to see that all my
financial records could be accessed via the same online service.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: It's important to note that you first should create an
online account with your bank, credit card company or financial
institution before trying to add them as a site.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Next, create an account with one of these financial
tracking services. They'll ask some personal info, and in two
minutes you're ready to add sites. Pick from banking, credit cards,
bills, investments, personal finances, etc. For instance, I
selected banking and got a long list of banks that allow online
banking. I clicked on a link for my bank, was prompted for the same
name and password that my bank originally asked for and, viola! My
account showed up.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Jeez, she started clicking ``add site'' like crazy. Next
thing I knew she had it all set up. Now, she just has to log in
once and she gets all her financial info in one nifty little
package.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Two companies behind this technology are VerticalOne
(verticalone.com), an Atlanta-based company, and Yodlee
(yodlee.com/solutions). Both let you create a financial tracking
account. Interfaces vary, but they both let you set up an account
with a few clicks. What's really cool is they have a hand-held
solution. It's a Windows application that lets you push your
financial info to your Palm Pilot.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: If you have a Palm VII, a zippy way of getting your
financial info is to download the AccountMinder application
(accountminder.com). Sync the new app on your Palm, create an
AccountMinder account, set up your financial info and you're ready
to rock and roll. Pop up the antenna on your Palm VII, log in to
AccountMinder and your account balances are in the palm of your
hand.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: All transactions were secure, easy and took no time to set
up. For a list of other sites using this type offinancial tracking
software, click on the Yodlee.com link.

 &HT;    Nifty search engine vindicates ad-saturated Net software
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It is inevitable, I suppose, that our society will
commercialize anything and everything remotely capable of bearing
up under it.
</P>
<P>
   Race cars are so plastered with advertising you can scarcely see
the paint. Athletes are walking (or running, or jumping or
whatever) billboards. Speaking of billboards, I see we now have
mobile billboards, dragged around town on trailers.
</P>
<P>
   So I probably shouldn't be surprised or shocked by
commercialized software. I was, however.
</P>
<P>
   A company called IWare makes a product called uWare, the beta
version of which I blithely mounted on my computer without really
knowing what it was about, other than assurances that it would
enhance my Internet experience.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, it might do that, but I was about to rip it out
by the roots before I discovered that. For the most part, it is
nothing more than an advertising carrier for a host of
e-businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The program produces a new taskbar at the bottom of the screen.
Its chief features are a set of Touch Tiles and a long panel of
rotating ads for various e-businesses. The Touch Tiles it comes
with are also e-businesses. Clicking the tiles or the long panel
will take you to the specified e-business site.
</P>
<P>
   There are a herd of them, all of which have paid IWare something
to be included in uWare. Among them are eBay and AutoNation,
Harley-Davidson and Cigar Aficionado magazine, all sorts of things.
I have not seen one, however, that I care to visit.
</P>
<P>
   There is even a tile called Deals, featuring specials that Iware
has arranged for the benefit of its audience.
</P>
<P>
   The Touch Tiles can be thrown out and replaced by items of your
own choosing. I don't see any way to get rid of the long panel,
however. Incidentally, the program says ``uWare updates daily,''
which I presume means that every day when you log onto the
Internet, the program goes scurrying off in search of newly signed
advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   The program, of course, is free. My indignation would be
boundless were it not.
</P>
<P>
   It was almost boundless anyway until I discovered the Search
tile.
</P>
<P>
   This is a multiengine search so nifty that I am contemplating
allowing the entire mess to stay alive.
</P>
<P>
   This feature has both a ``content'' search and a ``product''
search, although it's hard to see why you couldn't find products in
a content search. Whatever the case, it employs seven of the most
popular search engines to answer your queries.
</P>
<P>
   The thing that impressed me is its exactitude. I asked it for
``blackpowder cartridge.'' Every choice it presented fit that
parameter.
</P>
<P>
   No cartridge without blackpowder, no blackpowder without
cartridge. No duplicates. Very nice.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if you are a shopaholic, uWare may be just the ticket
for you. In that case, go to www.uware.com and download your own
copy of the beta release.

   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   Photocopying bound materials has always been an awkward affair
and often a damaging one to the originals. Enter Minolta's
BookScribe 2000 ($9,995; www.minoltausa.com), a digital face-up
book copier that eliminates the need to squash your precious tomes
flat and upside down. The BookScribe is ideally suited to law
offices, libraries, accounting firms or any place with old ledgers
and antiquated hardbacks _ especially those that are falling apart
at the seams. A single top-down scan allows for a separate print of
either left or right page or a double-page spread on a single
sheet. The BookScribe 2000 boasts simple operation for
high-quality, digital printing _ and with no distortion thanks to
the imbedded curvature correction capacity. The BookScribe is also
adjustable, allowing even thick volumes to be scanned without spine
damage. And if you're really gung ho about transferring that
ancient registry to the digital age, the BookScribe 2000 is
PC-ready and upgradeable to act as a digital scanner.

   NOTE TO SELF: PRESS RECORD
</P>
<P>
   Inclined to talk to yourself? The VN180 Digital Voice Recorder
($79.99, 90-minute version; $99.99, 180-minute version;
www.olympusamerica .com) is for people who like to take verbal
notes as they move through their day. This Olympus hand-held device
can hold up to three hours of audio. There are three folders in
which you can store as many as 180 messages each: one for personal,
one for business and one for a built-in scheduler. The recorder has
up to 20 verbal alarms to remind you of important events. The user
also can set the sensitivity of the built-in microphone, which has
a voice-activated option. Along with the earphone and headphone
jacks, we would have liked one more feature: a USB or infrared
connection that would allow messages to be easily downloaded into a
computer or other Internet device. Still, for less than $100, this
little gadget is competitive with good personal tape recorders and
has a lot more features.

 &HT;    Before fixing something, make certain it's really broken
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The beeping was driving me crazy.
</P>
<P>
   Every few minutes, as I drove to work in the car I bought a few
weeks ago, it beeped at me.
</P>
<P>
   Since it is a way-too-fancy car with a built-in computer, I
figured I had accidentally set one of the many alarms for
temperature, time or _ for all I know _ approaching meteor showers.
So I tried resetting all the electronics. The next morning, as I
drove to work, the car beeped at me again. It wasn't a loud beep.
But it was torturous, nonetheless, sitting in the car waiting for
the next beep.
</P>
<P>
   In desperation (and in violation of the ``Rules for Guys'') I
read the car's manual. Based on that, I reset some of the controls.
But the car still beeped. Finally, I disconnected the battery
cables, figuring that would be equivalent to rebooting the computer
and would return it to normal settings, stopping the danged
beeping.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning the car beeped at me like a led it on _ instead
of seeing the frequency _ the display said: CODE. Since I had owned
a car like that before, I knew I needed to punch in the security
code. And, being practically a genius, I remembered the code.
</P>
<P>
   I punched it in. That didn't work. I tried again and again and
nothing worked. Then I checked the card that had the code number on
it and discovered I had the code number wrong.
</P>
<P>
   No problem I thought. I took the card with the correct code down
to the car and punched the correct numbers in. Those stupid letters
_ CODE _ stayed on the display. No matter how many times I punched
in the correct code, the radio wouldn't work.

 &HT;    `WSB' a few hits short of being a real winner
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Sega Sports has created a problem for itself.
</P>
<P>
   So good is the company's product line _ which set the industry
standards with the classics ``Virtua Tennis'' and ``NFL 2K'' _ that
it is criticized when its sports games are not perfect.
</P>
<P>
   That is the case with ``World Series Baseball 2K1,'' which was
released only a few weeks ago. The game has been routinely
criticized for not having a manual defense option. In other words,
the computer plays defense for your team.
</P>
<P>
   ``WSB'' is the first baseball title for Dreamcast and has better
graphics than all of its competitors on PlayStation and Nintendo
64. The national anthem before the game is a nice opening, with the
exception of the overhead shot of the stadium showing nothing but
empty seats.
</P>
<P>
   The first amazing detail you notice is the starting pitcher
kicking around on the mound, causing dust to fly into the air. The
players resemble their lifelike batting stances.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the plays just make you gasp. The first baseman dives
for a ground ball _ automatically _ then he makes a toss to the
pitcher at the base for the out as he falls head-first into the
dirt.
</P>
<P>
   When your team hits a homer in front of the home crowd,
fireworks go off. After a victory, teammates give each other
high-fives on the field in stunning detail.
</P>
<P>
   But it is simply too hard to overlook the automatic defense. A
ball is hit right up the middle, and your pitcher won't even stick
his glove out for it _ turning an easy out into a single. When a
fly ball is hit, the outfielders seem to wait forever before
getting a jump. The automatic defense is bound to cost you at least
one or two runs per nine-inning contest.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching on ``WSB'' requires unbelievable patience. It requires
four rapid _ and sometimes confusing _ controller movements in a
row. First you choose the pitch, then start the pitch. As the
pitcher goes through the windup, you pick a location. Finally, you
have to press a button again to determine the energy meter. It
takes maybe a week of intensive play to get the process down.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, hitting is _ by far _ the best part of the game.
You control a circle in the strike zone that determines where you
want to focus your swing.
</P>
<P>
   The replays during the game make no sense. For instance, on a
single hit to center field, what you will see sometimes is the ball
going by the pitcher, with the center fielder picking it up and
tossing it to the cutoff man.
</P>
<P>
   On replays where guys are thrown out, sometimes it will end
before the tag is made.
</P>
<P>
   ``WSB'' didn't arrive in stores until after the All-Star break,
which does have one major advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The rosters are updated through about late May, with players
such as rookie sensation Rafael Furcal of the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   While many of the players' real-life attributes are represented
in the game, some are not. For instance, the computerized Greg
Maddux can throw fastballs up to 95 mph. While we're discussing
shortfalls, the play-by-play announcer is both repetitive and
annoying.
</P>
<P>
   ``WSB'' was a notable effort that fell short of expectations. It
is still worth purchasing if you own a Dreamcast, but the baseball
title clearly ranks behind PlayStation's ``Triple Play 2001'' (EA
Sports) and Nintendo's ``All-Star Baseball 2001'' (Acclaim) as far
as overall game play. Expect a much better product from Sega Sports
next season.

 &HT;    World War II game isn't merely for history buffs
 &HT;    By Yusuf Davis
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Software reviewer Dave Basinger said ``Combat
Mission'' is an excellent PC game, even though he doesn't know much
about World War II.
</P>
<P>
   He knows who won, and he's happy with the results. So all the
game maker's claims about historical accuracy and weapon
authenticity are lost on him. All he knows is that he likes playing
the combat simulation, and that's good enough for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a really, really good game,'' said Dave. ``It took a
little while to grow on me, but now that I've figured it out, I'm
really into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dave said that if it weren't for school and chores, he would be
doing combat quite a bit more in the coming months. As it is, he
will have to put first things first and play this game when and if
he can.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've only been playing for a couple of weeks, and I can see
how addictive it can be,'' the 15-year-old said. ``Unfortunately,
my parents don't let me play as much as I would like to.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Combat Mission'' is a WWII tactical warfare game for one to
two players. It combines depth of story line with ease of use in
3-D battlefield environments. According to its maker, the 3-D
effect is not just to look good; rather it improves the accuracy of
the simulation for game play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty fun and easy to play,'' Dave said. ``The graphics
aren't all that great, though. I guess that's the only downside to
it, but after you play it for a while you really don't pay that
much attention to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The game takes players from Normandy in 1944 to Germany in 1945
on WWII's two Western fronts. Players can choose to play either
side of the conflict and battle across historically accurate plains
and villages or into the woods and cities.
</P>
<P>
   If gamers are unhappy with the scenarios, they can use the
program's editor to change the settings to suit their preferences.
</P>
<P>
   Players command a force as small as a platoon or as large as a
reinforced battalion. Each man and weapon is kept track of for
maximum realism.
</P>
<P>
   As good as the game play is, Dave said the sound effects are
what really sold him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The machine gun fire and other sound effects were awesome,''
Dave said. ``It was like a good movie soundtrack.''
</P>

 &HT;    The incredible Seaman lives on your very own TV screen
 &HT;    By Troy Oxford
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ About 20 years ago I ordered Sea Monkeys from an ad I
saw in a comic book. The advertisement depicted a quirky humanoid
family living happy aquatic lives. When the package arrived, I
opened it eagerly and tried to bring life to these ``advanced''
beings in a powdered form.
</P>
<P>
   My excitement faded within a week, and these ``beings'' sadly
turned out to be tiny brine shrimp. My dreams of interacting with
my very own seahorse-riding people were left unfulfilled _ until
now.
</P>
<P>
   Sega recently created a new life form for my Dreamcast, and it
delivers everything it promises. This life form is named
``Seaman,'' and it's a milestone for video game consoles.
</P>
<P>
   Using a microphone that is included and your controller, you
raise, nurture and interact with a creature that would make Darwin
start from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of living in a foul-smelling fishbowl, Seaman resides on
your TV screen and depends on you to reach adulthood. Following
daily routines of maintaining his environment, providing him with
food and talking to him will result in the evolution of Seaman.
</P>
<P>
   Starting out as a strange tadpolelike creature, Seaman will
evolve to a snobby fish/man who amazingly recognizes many of your
words. He asked me when my birthday was, acknowledged what I said,
and informed me of some celebrities that had the same birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Although rude and apathetic at times, Seaman is fun to interact
with. You can tickle him, pick him up out of the water and even
flick him in the nose if he becomes too obnoxious.
</P>
<P>
   This simulation is not for everyone, however.
</P>
<P>
   Those impatient folks who want to bring Seaman to adulthood in a
couple of days will be disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   The evolution is a gradual process, and the results will be more
satisfactory if you follow the general guidelines and attend to the
fishy fellow.
</P>
<P>
   Also worth noting, ``Seaman'' requires a Visual Memory Unit, or
VMU, with 64 blocks of memory available.
</P>
<P>
   The strange concept, advanced voice recognition and narration by
``Star Trek'' veteran Leonard Nimoy make ``Seaman'' one of the
outstanding titles for the Dreamcast. I only wish I could feed him
those darned Sea Monkeys!

 &HT;    `Survivor' sites ensure you never have to be off island
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ We know where you'll be this Wednesday night, oh yes
we do. You'll be with the rest of your fellow ``Survivor'' addicts
parked comfortably on your couch watching the big three-hour season
finale of the desert island drama. You will be watching, hoping and
praying that Richard, the biggest rat on the island, hasn't
manipulated his way into becoming the million-dollar sole survivor.
</P>
<P>
   For those of you who believe you have better things to do on
Wednesday nights, ``Survivor'' is CBS' surprise blockbuster hit
that has lured more people than anyone imagined back to the former
Tiffany network to see how a group of strangers initially divided
into two tribes is able to survive not only the rigors of island
life, but the rigors of coping with one of the most disparate
collections of personalities ever assembled on network television.
</P>
<P>
   While ``Survivor'' may have brought CBS back from the dead, it
has also resurrected one of the most wonderful things about the Web
_ personal fan pages devoted to TV shows. Whether you are a diehard
fan or somebody who desperately needs to catch up before the big
finale on Wednesday, check out the fan pages devoted to all things
``Survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Survivor'' fan pages are so refreshing, particularly to
those of us who follow Internet goings-on. They're well-designed,
informative and fun sites built by fans who just want to have a
little fun with their favorite TV show.
</P>
<P>
   The best of the best ``Survivor'' sites is SurvivorSucks.com
(www.survivorsucks.com). It describes itself as ``A fan site for
those who love to hate `Survivor' on CBS.'' A word of warning
before you surf on over, though: some of the language might not be
suitable for younger ``Survivor'' fans, as the site's title clearly
indicates. However, that said, it's still a great guilty pleasure
for adult fans. (Several Web executives secretly admit to being
addicted to this site but asked not to have it included in articles
written about them or ``Survivor.'')
</P>
<P>
   You'll appreciate the effort that went into this site _ the
tongue-in-cheek episode commentaries and the news section, which
features clear-eyed analysis of who will be forced to grab his or
her backpack, turn in the torch and get off the island.
</P>
<P>
   Bonus points to the site designers for putting this in text that
has to be highlighted to be read, so the people who want to be
surprised can stay in suspense.
</P>
<P>
   The message boards are filled with comments from people who
clearly think the show is hilarious and want to share their
opinions with other fans.
</P>
<P>
   If you love the show, you'll love this site. The sarcastic
analysis and commentary from the site's creators keep fans coming
back for more. Hopefully the site will stay up for a while _ even
after Wednesday's finale.
</P>
<P>
   Another surprisingly good ``Survivor'' site comes from CBS
itself. Up until now, CBS has been fumbling around in the dark
trying to find a Web strategy or anything that will draw users to
its site.
</P>
<P>
   With its mini-``Survivor'' site
(www.cbs.com/network/tvshows/mini/survivor), CBS scores big.
</P>
<P>
   The site includes the inevitable show summaries, video of the
tribe members talking about their experiences, an opportunity to
vote for the next person to get the boot and cast profiles.
</P>
<P>
   We could probably do without the merchandizing section, but who
can blame CBS for wanting to cash in on the show's runaway
popularity?
</P>
<P>
   CBS makes up for its shameless product pitches with a very cool
interactive map of the island that's definitely worth a look
(www.cbs.com/network/tvshows/mini/survivor/island/fsetflash.shtml).
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the parody sites. Ed Bain's Pop Corn Culture site
(homestead.icast.com
</P>
<P>
   /edbain/files/SURVIVOR.htm) offers up a short film that runs
well on a 28.8k bps modem that poses the question: What would
happen if the ``Survivor'' cast was sent to Russian space station
Mir instead of the island?
</P>
<P>
   And, if you think you have what it takes to become a survivor
yourself, or are wondering how those dreadful people got there in
the first place, check out TC Conway's application for ``Survivor
II'' (www.tcconway.com
</P>
<P>
   /AboutTC-App.asp).
</P>
<P>
   CBS isn't taking applications any longer, but it is amusing to
see what you need to do to get yourself marooned on an island.
</P>
<P>
   As the late comic Jimmy Durante used to say, ``everybody wants
to get into the act'' when it comes to ``Survivor.'' There are tons
of articles and essays on the show from almost every entertainment
site you can think of. Everyone seems to have an opinion, but be
sure to check out Linda Stasi's New York Post essay on the show.
(www
</P>
<P>
   .nypostonline.com/entertainment/35143.htm).
</P>
<P>
   She used to hate ``Survivor,'' she writes. ``Now I just hate the
survivors ... literally and figuratively. What I really hate,
though, is that the show is actually just a mirror of modern
corporate life.''
</P>
<P>
   This is what a lot of us have secretly been thinking all along,
and truth be told, that's probably why we watch. Thank goodness for
the fan sites that remind us to lighten up _ it's just a TV show,
after all.

 &HT;    `WSB' a few hits short of being a real winner
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Sega Sports has created a problem for itself.
</P>
<P>
   So good is the company's product line _ which set the industry
standards with the classics ``Virtua Tennis'' and ``NFL 2K'' _ that
it is criticized when its sports games are not perfect.
</P>
<P>
   That is the case with ``World Series Baseball 2K1,'' which was
released only a few weeks ago. The game has been routinely
criticized for not having a manual defense option. In other words,
the computer plays defense for your team.
</P>
<P>
   ``WSB'' is the first baseball title for Dreamcast and has better
graphics than all of its competitors on PlayStation and Nintendo
64. The national anthem before the game is a nice opening, with the
exception of the overhead shot of the stadium showing nothing but
empty seats.
</P>
<P>
   The first amazing detail you notice is the starting pitcher
kicking around on the mound, causing dust to fly into the air. The
players resemble their lifelike batting stances.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the plays just make you gasp. The first baseman dives
for a ground ball _ automatically _ then he makes a toss to the
pitcher at the base for the out as he falls head-first into the
dirt.
</P>
<P>
   When your team hits a homer in front of the home crowd,
fireworks go off. After a victory, teammates give each other
high-fives on the field in stunning detail.
</P>
<P>
   But it is simply too hard to overlook the automatic defense. A
ball is hit right up the middle, and your pitcher won't even stick
his glove out for it _ turning an easy out into a single. When a
fly ball is hit, the outfielders seem to wait forever before
getting a jump. The automatic defense is bound to cost you at least
one or two runs per nine-inning contest.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching on ``WSB'' requires unbelievable patience. It requires
four rapid _ and sometimes confusing _ controller movements in a
row. First you choose the pitch, then start the pitch. As the
pitcher goes through the windup, you pick a location. Finally, you
have to press a button again to determine the energy meter. It
takes maybe a week of intensive play to get the process down.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, hitting is _ by far _ the best part of the game.
You control a circle in the strike zone that determines where you
want to focus your swing.
</P>
<P>
   The replays during the game make no sense. For instance, on a
single hit to center field, what you will see sometimes is the ball
going by the pitcher, with the center fielder picking it up and
tossing it to the cutoff man.
</P>
<P>
   On replays where guys are thrown out, sometimes it will end
before the tag is made.
</P>
<P>
   ``WSB'' didn't arrive in stores until after the All-Star break,
which does have one major advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The rosters are updated through about late May, with players
such as rookie sensation Rafael Furcal of the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   While many of the players' real-life attributes are represented
in the game, some are not. For instance, the computerized Greg
Maddux can throw fastballs up to 95 mph. While we're discussing
shortfalls, the play-by-play announcer is both repetitive and
annoying.
</P>
<P>
   ``WSB'' was a notable effort that fell short of expectations. It
is still worth purchasing if you own a Dreamcast, but the baseball
title clearly ranks behind PlayStation's ``Triple Play 2001'' (EA
Sports) and Nintendo's ``All-Star Baseball 2001'' (Acclaim) as far
as overall game play. Expect a much better product from Sega Sports
next season.

 &HT;    `Perfect Dark' fun, but expect action rather than a story
 &HT;    By Vox Day
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ ``Perfect Dark'' is a sequel of sorts to
``Goldeneye,'' the game that brought computer-style 3-D action to
the Nintendo 64 for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   While it combines nearly every annoying marketing element in the
book, ``Perfect Dark'' is simply an excellent action game.
</P>
<P>
   Lacking the ability to network between machines, video games
have lagged well behind computer counterparts in the multiplayer
3-D action game first demonstrated in ``Doom.''
</P>
<P>
   While computer gamers have had a mind-boggling array of
player-modified weapons, levels and characters to choose from,
along with up to 15 teammates and opponents, video gamers have been
stuck playing with at most three opponents while peering at a
screen divided into two or four parts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perfect Dark'' changes none of that; it's a function of the
hardware technology, not the software. But it does provide a
training facility that, in its willingness to stack the odds
against you with AI-controlled simdroids, provides a fair
approximation of the pulse-rate-lifting stress and excitement that
multiplayer action does.
</P>
<P>
   There are 10 different challenges in the training section, and I
found myself still playing them long after I would have finished
playing most games.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, I still haven't gotten to the real game itself. I
guess that's really beside the point, since the story line is the
usual mishmash of silly alien conspiracy stuff that has plagued so
many games ever since the ``X-Files'' was first televised.
</P>
<P>
   This, too, is in keeping with tradition _ one of the many
admirable things about ``Doom'' was its refusal to pretend that it
had any plot or story line. ``Perfect Dark'' might as well have
done the same. It's all about the action, you see.
</P>
<P>
   The graphics are good, with windows that shatter, walls that
show damage and good lighting effects. There are many weapons,
ranging from clip-emptying burst fire machines to single-shot
silencers and remote mines.
</P>
<P>
   My personal favorite is to have an autofiring Cyclone in each
hand; this seems to do the trick quite nicely on most enemies. I'm
impressed with this game, mostly because I really didn't expect to
see action this exciting on a single-player system setup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perfect Dark'' is not nearly perfect, but it will certainly
give any action gamer his or her money's worth. P.S.: You need the
4-megabyte expansion pack to play the solo missions.

 &HT;    Keep track of financesBy Sue Cleere and Jacki Rudd
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   I've heard of Web sites that keep track of your financial
information but haven't found any. By giving them your logins and
passwords they can display your balances from different banks,
mutual funds and other accounts on one Web page. Do these sites
exist, or is it just wishful dreaming?
</P>
<P>
   _ Derek Marks, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Derek, your dreams have come true! We found all kinds of
Web sites that keep track of your financial information, securely.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: I set up my checking account and two credit cards within
minutes on two Web sites. Give AltaVista MyAccounts a try at
myaccounts1.altavista.com. You'll first have to register with
AltaVista, then create a MyAccounts login. Another option is MyCiti
(myaccounts.myciti.com). I was thrilled to see that all my
financial records could be accessed via the same online service.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: It's important to note that you first should create an
online account with your bank, credit card company or financial
institution before trying to add them as a site.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Next, create an account with one of these financial
tracking services. They'll ask some personal info, and in two
minutes you're ready to add sites. Pick from banking, credit cards,
bills, investments, personal finances, etc. For instance, I
selected banking and got a long list of banks that allow online
banking. I clicked on a link for my bank, was prompted for the same
name and password that my bank originally asked for and, viola! My
account showed up.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Jeez, she started clicking ``add site'' like crazy. Next
thing I knew she had it all set up. Now, she just has to log in
once and she gets all her financial info in one nifty little
package.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Two companies behind this technology are VerticalOne
(verticalone.com), an Atlanta-based company, and Yodlee
(yodlee.com/solutions). Both let you create a financial tracking
account. Interfaces vary, but they both let you set up an account
with a few clicks. What's really cool is they have a hand-held
solution. It's a Windows application that lets you push your
financial info to your Palm Pilot.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: If you have a Palm VII, a zippy way of getting your
financial info is to download the AccountMinder application
(accountminder.com). Sync the new app on your Palm, create an
AccountMinder account, set up your financial info and you're ready
to rock and roll. Pop up the antenna on your Palm VII, log in to
AccountMinder and your account balances are in the palm of your
hand.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: All transactions were secure, easy and took no time to set
up. For a list of other sites using this type offinancial tracking
software, click on the Yodlee.com link.
</P>

 &HT;    Nifty search engine vindicates ad-saturated Net software
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It is inevitable, I suppose, that our society will
commercialize anything and everything remotely capable of bearing
up under it.
</P>
<P>
   Race cars are so plastered with advertising you can scarcely see
the paint. Athletes are walking (or running, or jumping or
whatever) billboards. Speaking of billboards, I see we now have
mobile billboards, dragged around town on trailers.
</P>
<P>
   So I probably shouldn't be surprised or shocked by
commercialized software. I was, however.
</P>
<P>
   A company called IWare makes a product called uWare, the beta
version of which I blithely mounted on my computer without really
knowing what it was about, other than assurances that it would
enhance my Internet experience.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, it might do that, but I was about to rip it out
by the roots before I discovered that. For the most part, it is
nothing more than an advertising carrier for a host of
e-businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The program produces a new taskbar at the bottom of the screen.
Its chief features are a set of Touch Tiles and a long panel of
rotating ads for various e-businesses. The Touch Tiles it comes
with are also e-businesses. Clicking the tiles or the long panel
will take you to the specified e-business site.
</P>
<P>
   There are a herd of them, all of which have paid IWare something
to be included in uWare. Among them are eBay and AutoNation,
Harley-Davidson and Cigar Aficionado magazine, all sorts of things.
I have not seen one, however, that I care to visit.
</P>
<P>
   There is even a tile called Deals, featuring specials that Iware
has arranged for the benefit of its audience.
</P>
<P>
   The Touch Tiles can be thrown out and replaced by items of your
own choosing. I don't see any way to get rid of the long panel,
however. Incidentally, the program says ``uWare updates daily,''
which I presume means that every day when you log onto the
Internet, the program goes scurrying off in search of newly signed
advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   The program, of course, is free. My indignation would be
boundless were it not.
</P>
<P>
   It was almost boundless anyway until I discovered the Search
tile.
</P>
<P>
   This is a multiengine search so nifty that I am contemplating
allowing the entire mess to stay alive.
</P>
<P>
   This feature has both a ``content'' search and a ``product''
search, although it's hard to see why you couldn't find products in
a content search. Whatever the case, it employs seven of the most
popular search engines to answer your queries.
</P>
<P>
   The thing that impressed me is its exactitude. I asked it for
``blackpowder cartridge.'' Every choice it presented fit that
parameter.
</P>
<P>
   No cartridge without blackpowder, no blackpowder without
cartridge. No duplicates. Very nice.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if you are a shopaholic, uWare may be just the ticket
for you. In that case, go to www.uware.com and download your own
copy of the beta release.

 &HT;    Before fixing something, make certain it's really broken
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The beeping was driving me crazy.
</P>
<P>
   Every few minutes, as I drove to work in the car I bought a few
weeks ago, it beeped at me.
</P>
<P>
   Since it is a way-too-fancy car with a built-in computer, I
figured I had accidentally set one of the many alarms for
temperature, time or _ for all I know _ approaching meteor showers.
So I tried resetting all the electronics. The next morning, as I
drove to work, the car beeped at me again. It wasn't a loud beep.
But it was torturous, nonetheless, sitting in the car waiting for
the next beep.
</P>
<P>
   In desperation (and in violation of the ``Rules for Guys'') I
read the car's manual. Based on that, I reset some of the controls.
But the car still beeped. Finally, I disconnected the battery
cables, figuring that would be equivalent to rebooting the computer
and would return it to normal settings, stopping the danged
beeping.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning the car beeped at me like a lovesick duckling.
It made me jumpy.
</P>
<P>
   When I got to the newspaper garage, I reached over to the glove
compartment to check the manual once again. That's when I noticed a
tiny object on the passenger side floorboard.
</P>
<P>
   It was a pager. A beeping pager.
</P>
<P>
   An acquaintance of mine had dropped her pager. Since there were
messages waiting, the pager was beeping.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes life hands a guy like me a column that only requires
telling, not writing. This is one of those times.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the lesson: I broke a basic rule of repairing computers,
cars or choo choo trains.
</P>
<P>
   I started fixing something before I knew what was wrong. In
almost every case, this results in messing up something brand new
and not fixing the old problem either.
</P>
<P>
   In my case, my efforts to fix the beeping messed up the computer
system. Disconnecting the battery made the radio stop working. When
I turned it on _ instead of seeing the frequency _ the display
said: CODE. Since I had owned a car like that before, I knew I
needed to punch in the security code. And, being practically a
genius, I remembered the code.
</P>
<P>
   I punched it in. That didn't work. I tried again and again and
nothing worked. Then I checked the card that had the code number on
it and discovered I had the code number wrong.
</P>
<P>
   No problem I thought. I took the card with the correct code down
to the car and punched the correct numbers in. Those stupid letters
_ CODE _ stayed on the display. No matter how many times I punched
in the correct code, the radio wouldn't work.
</P>
<P>
   In terror and desperation, I turned to the manual again. It told
me that after three incorrect tries the radio would not accept any
code, including the correct one, for an hour and a half. So I
turned off the key and waited. Then I tried the code again. It
still didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   That's when I turned to the Internet. I figured that one of the
Internet's newsgroups _ little gatherings where the information is
more specialized and in-depth than on the Web _ would be devoted to
my car. Sure enough, there was a newsgroup for my car make (as well
as one for any make you can imagine).
</P>
<P>
   Within five minutes of checking out the messages posted there, I
learned what I was doing wrong. The hour-plus wait the manual
mentioned meant the radio had to be turned on for that period of
time. You couldn't turn off the key, as I had done.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually I got everything fixed.
</P>
<P>
   But the point of this story is that nothing at all was broken
before I embarked on three days of fixing. So learn from me. The
next time something goes wrong with your favorite computer or
gadget, make sure you understand the problem before fixing it.
</P>
<P>
   You'll save a lot of beeping time.

 &HT;    Playing around on the Web
 &HT;    By Mary Jo DiLonardo
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Long gone are the days of painful piano lessons in
Mrs. Crotchety's parlor. No more glowering looks and accusations
that you haven't been practicing. No more ominous ticking of the
dusty metronome as you struggle to keep up.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the wonderful world of the Web.
</P>
<P>
   With a couple clicks of the mouse, you can soon be tickling the
ivories or strumming a guitar without ever having to leave the
comfort of your home. Music education has jumped on the Internet
bandwagon offering online instrument lessons _ via video, sound
and/or text _ and how-to-play-music software.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Internet's most prominent music sites, Guitar.com
offers a huge library of video guitar lessons _ both from music
instructors and from well-known musicians such as B.B. King and
Richie Havens. The site also features chord and scale generators to
help players tune their guitars.
</P>
<P>
   Rock legend Havens recently called Guitar.com one of his
favorite Web sites. ``I go here and learn,'' he said. ``They have
tablature, guitar chords and teachers that you can hook into and
learn from directly.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Bradshaw often uses his Web site, www.cyberfret.com, as an
additional resource for the 65 guitar students he teaches each week
in Columbus, Ohio. The Web site, however, is designed primarily for
people learning the guitar on their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guitar has traditionally been an instrument that people have
taught themselves,'' says Bradshaw. ``Now they have a very powerful
tool that can help them learn: the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradshaw uses computer technology even with traditional
in-person students. He uses a computer to play background
accompaniments for songs that students are playing. With the
computer, he says, he can change the key, tempo, or even style of a
song, unlike playing along with a CD.
</P>
<P>
   One great advantage to using online technology is the
availability of multimedia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students can watch a technique being demonstrated over and
over, or even at different camera angles,'' Bradshaw explains.
``They can listen to examples, or play along with a virtual band.
Related material can be easily accessed through linking to other
pages within the site, or to Web sites anywhere in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere around 1,500 people visit Vision Music
(www.visionmusic.com) each day for guitar instruction, says site
creator and instructor Mark Stefani who lives in Tualatin, Ore.,
just outside of Portland.
</P>
<P>
   The site offers everything from an ``eye test'' to help
first-year students assess their abilities and figure out where
they need work, to a database of articles on technique, motivation
and practice. In addition, it is the host for ``Jam Central
Station,'' a round-the-clock online jam session for players of all
instruments.
</P>
<P>
   Although Stefani says his site can be a supplement for students
taking traditional music lessons, he sees it as a broader
educational tool.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized that it was serving a unique purpose in providing
musicians around the world who couldn't afford private lessons an
opportunity to learn and to be inspired,'' he says. ``This group
numbers in the thousands, including retired folks on a limited
budget, kids, etc.''
</P>
<P>
   While many of the online instructional sites are accessible
whenever you get the urge, some offer actual lessons at explicit
times.
</P>
<P>
   At www.RiffInteractive.com, students log on to a chat session at
a specific time and join 20-30 other students for guitar lessons.
An interface allows the instructor to send out music notation,
pictures, and sound and video clips. While these group lessons are
free, one-to-one lessons _ via NetMeeting's two-way streaming video
_ are $40 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Then every lesson is archived in a database for students to call
up at will.
</P>
<P>
   The main demographic for the online lessons are men age 16-35,
according to Riff Interactive's Steve Roeder. He says plans are in
the works for similar sites teaching drums and keyboards.
</P>
<P>
   Music teachers can stake out a spot to create their lessons and
instantly post them online for their students at sites like
NotationStation.net. They can use a free online notation service
(notation is a way of writing out musical notes) provided and send
students to their own personal area on the site.
</P>
<P>
   Then students have the tools to compose, edit, print and listen
to music, along with the ability to input notation through the
keyboard or mouse, or from a live instrument via MIDI files.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of NotationStation.net is for teachers to extend
their reach beyond the classroom,'' says founder Nathaniel Weiss.
``Kids are using computers all the time, and this provides an
immersive, collaborative environment to make the music they learn
in school come alive.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to getting music instruction online, there's plenty
of software available that allows would-be players to learn at
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest thing for any instructor to do is to get people to
practice,'' admits Laurie Acken picking is a style of playing
that's popular with country musicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there is some advantage to being able to see people show
you certain things. There are some things that you really know how
to do them or you won't be able to do it,'' he admits.
</P>
<P>
   Though technology has its positives, Urban's sure some things
won't change. He says, hopefully, ``I don't think technology will
ever overpower creativity.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, there's one other thing technology can't help you do.
</P>
<P>
   ``From almost 30 years of dedicated teaching I've learned that
you can't make people practice,'' Stefani laughs. ``The only thing
you can do is to hopefully inspire them and fuel the flame that
flickers within.''

   Colony Wars III: Red Sun, short on plot, heavy on carnagec. 2000
Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ FOR THE CONSOLE
</P>
<P>
   Your name is Valdemar, and you're slogging away in some future
dead-end job when a regal, bald general appears in a dream and
reveals that you are the Chosen One. For what have you been chosen?
Well, from there it gets a bit hazy. Consistently vague and random
visions may ultimately distract you from the only tangible goal of
Colony Wars III: Red Sun ($30; www. midway.com; for the
PlayStation), which is to kill everything you see. If you accept
the limitations of this objective going in, then you will be free
to appreciate the game for what it is: an enjoyable, intergalactic
shoot-em-up. With aurally and visually pleasing lasers, explosions
and spaceships, ``Red Sun'' is the gaming equivalent of a good
summer blockbuster, with a thundering, cinematic soundtrack to
match. Technically above average, ``Red Sun'' graphics feature few
rough edges, and although the close-ups of Valdemar and friends are
downright creepy, most of the full motion video scenes are
stunning. Plot junkies may find ``Red Sun'' inferior to the first
two Colony Wars episodes, as the mystery of the Red Sun is never
especially compelling. But if you relish the thought of laser
cannon carnage on its own terms, then ``Red Sun,'' with its 50-plus
missions, could be a lovely way to (after) burn an hour or six.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jeremy Egner
</P>
<P>
   ($40; www.activision.com; for the PlayStation), which is a game
simpatico with the recent summer blockbuster, which in turn is
based on an immensely popular comic and cartoon franchise.
Unfortunately, the game is merely another means to brand name us
with X-Men; it has little to do with the film. In fact, it only
vaguely resembles a modern video game in the first place. Mutant
Academy is a well-drawn, well-animated 2-D fighting game _ and
that's it. There's no adventure akin to a movie plot, just the
various super-anti-heroes duking it out in a face-to-face,
side-scrolling romp. Even on the aging PlayStation console, most
fighting games are known to contain so much more than flat-action
eye-candy, such as three dimensions. Nevertheless, X-Men Mutant
Academy is a very good 2-D fighting game complete with trademark
super-moves and painful powers of mutant punishment. But it's the
weakest member in the grand amalgamation scheme of console,
cartoon, comic and cinematic extravaganza.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially reinventing the ``First Person Shooter'' genre,
Warren Spector's ($40; www.eidosinteractive.com; for Windows and
Mac) blends a deep and completely malleable role-playing story line
with the traditional wander-and-frag games of death and
indiscriminate dismemberment. In the game, produced by Texas' Ion
Storm and ported to the Mac by Austin's Aspyr Media Inc., cause and
effect decisions concerning in-game characters and environments
directly affect this feature-rich game. Deus Ex gives gamers the
opportunity to customize skills and skill levels with a suite of
``nanotech augmentations.'' This enhances, as an understated
example, one's strength or combat prowess while forgoing the
slippery skills of stealth or, visa versa, making the game as
frenzied and violent or intensely subdued as desired. Breathtaking
``real life'' visuals and a wholly immersive world of exhausted
chaos promise to make Deus Ex the new benchmark for digital
adventure.
</P>
<P>
   _ Shaun Conlin
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE DESKTOP
</P>
<P>
   Based on a venerable Dungeons &AMP; Dragons-style pen-and-paper
game, Vampire: The Masquerade _ Redemption ($45;
www.activision.com; for Windows) drops you into an immersive 3-D
world where role-playing, action and puzzle-solving are well
balanced. That's the good news. Creeping about in the shadows as
the undead anti-hero Christof and hacking away at one's enemies or
drinking the blood of one's victims is sinister fun. The
smooth-running landscapes and special effects are detailed and
atmospheric. The controls are intuitive (toggle between third and
first person), the cinematic cut scenes are lovely and the
characters who join your party are interesting and even helpful.
But the most highly anticipated aspect of the game, storyteller
mode, in which one player builds and controls a world as the game
is running, disappoints in that it requires a sure hand at the helm
_ something difficult to find in the twitchfest of the Internet _
and generally degenerates into a free-for-all. But given the right
circumstances _ a well-built local network game with all the
players physically in a room together _ Vampire has the potential
for transcending even its worst glitches.

   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   When you're hot, you're hot _ but you should have some say in
the matter. Consider then the Convair 900 ``Prestige'' Evaporative
Air Cooler ($300; www.convair.net.au). Not to be confused with
conventional air conditioners, evaporative coolers employ a
contrary, environmentally friendly means to comfort-zone ends. Air
is drawn through a large, wet filter pad by a powerful (and
distinctly audible) fan, a process similarly seen in nature when
air is cooled when it passes over an ocean or large body of water.
The Prestige holds up to four gallons of water and has a tank gauge
to monitor consumption. As a self-contained, free-standing unit
requiring only an AC power source, the Convair 900 Prestige does
not require permanent installation of gaudy bulk. It can be wheeled
to any room as needed, including the storage shed during the
off-seasons. Essentially a humidifier, the Convair Prestige is
innately less effective in extremely humid climates, but when it's
simpatico with the environment, the Prestige is very cool.

   ONE SHARP DVD PLAYER
</P>
<P>
   I've always been an early adopter. I'm too young to have jumped
on the bulkiest, most-expensive Beta VCR, but when CD players were
introduced, I hustled out and picked up an awkward, heavy,
way-too-expensive, top-loading monolith of a unit. It wasn't long
before I'd broken my oath not to duplicate my album collection on
disc, either. So when consumer DVD units began appearing, I took a
deep breath. This time, I'd be the smart one. I'd wait 'til they
were out a while, 'til the price dropped. Well, it might be time to
jump in. Having lived with Sharp's DV-770U DVD Player ($300;
www.sharpelectronics.com) for a few weeks, I am impressed. Okay, I
don't have anything (except VHS) to compare it to, but Sharp's
Digital Gamma Correction (which enhances picture quality by
adjusting color values in dim areas according to picture
brightness) and Digital Super Picture (it increases the sharpn much
as I would like to.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Combat Mission'' is a WWII tactical warfare game for one to
two players. It combines depth of story line with ease of use in
3-D battlefield environments. According to its maker, the 3-D
effect is not just to look good; rather it improves the accuracy of
the simulation for game play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty fun and easy to play,'' Dave said. ``The graphics
aren't all that great, though. I guess that's the only downside to
it, but after you play it for a while you really don't pay that
much attention to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The game takes players from Normandy in 1944 to Germany in 1945
on WWII's two Western fronts. Players can choose to play either
side of the conflict and battle across historically accurate plains
and villages or into the woods and cities.
</P>
<P>
   If gamers are unhappy with the scenarios, they can use the
program's editor to change the settings to suit their preferences.
</P>
<P>
   Players command a force as small as a platoon or as large as a
reinforced battalion. Each man and weapon is kept track of for
maximum realism.
</P>
<P>
   As good as the game play is, Dave said the sound effects are
what really sold him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The machine gun fire and other sound effects were awesome,''
Dave said. ``It was like a good movie soundtrack.''

 &HT;    Anyone can play guitar?

   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   Look, you're never going be a true Austinite until you've
learned a few chords and opened for Jerry Jeff Walker. But, what's
that? You don't know how to play guitar? Before you sign up for
lessons, check out eMedia Guitar Method CD-ROM ($60 for Windows and
Macintosh, www.emedia.org). The CD-ROM teaches you guitar basics
with features like an animated fretboard, fretronome, a ``virtual''
guitar neck that illustrates where to put your fingers and a
selection of classic songs to practice, such as ``La Bamba'' and
``House of the Rising Sun.'' Other volumes of the software include
a roster of new songs and help from guitar whiz Peter Frampton.
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU CAN KICK IT, THIS WILL RECORD IT
</P>
<P>
   OK, you've learned how to play the guitar and you've put
together a band. The problem is that the major record labels aren't
calling. What do you do? You make your own garage-band-grunge CD.
Helping you in this is Sony's new ECM-MS907 one-point stereo
microphone ($100, www.sony.com). The microphone fits all Sony
minidisc and DAT players and offers superior sound recording in the
right situations, such as recording instruments. However, it didn't
work well in picking up vocals. It also boasts 90- and 120-degree
recording so you can bring the whole orchestra. A piece of advice:
Invite the whole band, can the droning lyrics and get right to the
guitar solo.
</P>
<P>
   LOOK GOOD WHILE YOU LISTEN
</P>
<P>
   You want to look good while listening to your tunes. That's why
you need to pick up Sony's Street Style Discman ($160,
www.sony.com). The industrial-looking Discman is a must-have for
the trendy, on-the-go set. The device is finished in chrome and red
translucent plastic and has a carrying strap, making it the
ultimate accoutrement to a rollerblading escapade. The Street Style
Discman also comes with Street Style headphones, which wrap around
the back of the head and provide awesome sound. If you think this
portable CD player just looks good, think again. This Discman is
equipped with Sony's patented ESP2, which is some of the best skip
protection on the market. With ESP2 and the Street Style Discman,
you'll never miss a beat _ and look good in the process.

 &HT;    The incredible Seaman lives on your very own TV screen
 &HT;    By Troy Oxford
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ About 20 years ago I ordered Sea Monkeys from an ad I
saw in a comic book. The advertisement depicted a quirky humanoid
family living happy aquatic lives. When the package arrived, I
opened it eagerly and tried to bring life to these ``advanced''
beings in a powdered form.
</P>
<P>
   My excitement faded within a week, and these ``beings'' sadly
turned out to be tiny brine shrimp. My dreams of interacting with
my very own seahorse-riding people were left unfulfilled _ until
now.
</P>
<P>
   Sega recently created a new life form for my Dreamcast, and it
delivers everything it promises. This life form is named
``Seaman,'' and it's a milestone for video game consoles.
</P>
<P>
   Using a microphone that is included and your controller, you
raise, nurture and interact with a creature that would make Darwin
start from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of living in a foul-smelling fishbowl, Seaman resides on
your TV screen and depends on you to reach adulthood. Following
daily routines of maintaining his environment, providing him with
food and talking to him will result in the evolution of Seaman.
</P>
<P>
   Starting out as a strange tadpolelike creature, Seaman will
evolve to a snobby fish/man who amazingly recognizes many of your
words. He asked me when my birthday was, acknowledged what I said,
and informed me of some celebrities that had the same birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Although rude and apathetic at times, Seaman is fun to interact
with. You can tickle him, pick him up out of the water and even
flick him in the nose if he becomes too obnoxious.
</P>
<P>
   This simulation is not for everyone, however.
</P>
<P>
   Those impatient folks who want to bring Seaman to adulthood in a
couple of days will be disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   The evolution is a gradual process, and the results will be more
satisfactory if you follow the general guidelines and attend to the
fishy fellow.
</P>
<P>
   Also worth noting, ``Seaman'' requires a Visual Memory Unit, or
VMU, with 64 blocks of memory available.
</P>
<P>
   The strange concept, advanced voice recognition and narration by
``Star Trek'' veteran Leonard Nimoy make ``Seaman'' one of the
outstanding titles for the Dreamcast. I only wish I could feed him
those darned Sea Monkeys!

   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   Photocopying bound materials has always been an awkward affair
and often a damaging one to the originals. Enter Minolta's
BookScribe 2000 ($9,995; www.minoltausa.com), a digital face-up
book copier that eliminates the need to squash your precious tomes
flat and upside down. The BookScribe is ideally suited to law
offices, libraries, accounting firms or any place with old ledgers
and antiquated hardbacks _ especially those that are falling apart
at the seams. A single top-down scan allows for a separate print of
either left or right page or a double-page spread on a single
sheet. The BookScribe 2000 boasts simple operation for
high-quality, digital printing _ and with no distortion thanks to
the imbedded curvature correction capacity. The BookScribe is also
adjustable, allowing even thick volumes to be scanned without spine
damage. And if you're really gung ho about transferring that
ancient registry to the digital age, the BookScribe 2000 is
PC-ready and upgradeable to act as a digital scanner.

   NOTE TO SELF: PRESS RECORD
</P>
<P>
   Inclined to talk to yourself? The VN180 Digital Voice Recorder
($79.99, 90-minute version; $99.99, 180-minute version;
www.olympusamerica .com) is for people who like to take verbal
notes as they move through their day. This Olympus hand-held device
can hold up to three hours of audio. There are three folders in
which you can store as many as 180 messages each: one for personal,
one for business and one for a built-in scheduler. The recorder has
up to 20 verbal alarms to remind you of important events. The user
also can set the sensitivity of the built-in microphone, which has
a voice-activated option. Along with the earphone and headphone
jacks, we would have liked one more feature: a USB or infrared
connection that would allow messages to be easily downloaded into a
computer or other Internet device. Still, for less than $100, this
little gadget is competitive with good personal tape recorders and
has a lot more features.

 &HT;    Consumer Q&AMP;A
 &HT;    By Jane Greig
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Q: OK, I give up. I've searched everywhere on
and off the Web for a foley fork, a cooking utensil I'm starting to
think doesn't exist anymore. I'm sure your older readers will
remember their grandmothers using a foley fork to cut lard into
flour.
</P>
<P>
   _ J.H.
</P>
<P>
   A: Foley is a brand name, not a generic name. The fork you
described is indispensable (meatloaf to Bisquick). A four-tine
pastry blending fork is available in the King Arthur Baker's
Catalogue ($3.95 plus shipping and handling). The tines and the
short handle allow your wrist to do the work. Call (800) 827-6836
or visit www.kingarthurflour.com to order.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My fiance and I are marrying next June and want to dispense
with some of the less ``PC'' traditions _ namely, the
bouquet/garter toss. We're planning an evening wedding, so my
fiance came up with the idea of releasing fireflies to symbolize
good wishes. I know that you can order butterflies for release at
weddings _ can you do the same with fireflies? How much does it
cost (we're on a very tight budget)?
</P>
<P>
   _ Barbara S.
</P>
<P>
   A: Price is not the object _ availability is. According to the
nation's premiere firefly researcher, University of Florida
professor James Lloyd, firefly numbers are decreasing and there is
no commercial source for them. What's going on? Dropping water
tables and pollution certainly contribute to the diminishing
firefly population. Increased urbanization and resulting ambient
light keep the remaining fireflies from efficiently using their
light to find mates and procreate. Lloyd would prefer
well-intentioned couples contribute to firefly research rather that
attempt a release. Q: Where may I purchase buckwheat hulls such as
those used in pillows when they were in fashion?
</P>
<P>
   _ J. D. Reed
</P>
<P>
   A: You must be getting a jump on holiday gifts. Remember,
buckwheat hull needs to be free of mold and dust in order to make
good pillow stuffing. Buckwheat hulls are sold by retailers such as
James Farrell &AMP; Co. ($40 for 18-pound bag, $30 for 10-pound bag,
shipping included), 506 Second Ave., 3100, Seattle, WA 98104, or
call (206) 623-1993 to order. On the right coast, Birkett Mills
sells them at www.thebirkettmills.com or (315) 536-331. A 5-pound
bag is $8.95, plus shipping, and a 44-pound bag is $39.50, plus
shipping.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My husband and I have bet on your answer. What actor played
Eldin, the painter redoing Murphy Brown's apartment? I say it was
Oliver Platt. My husband can't remember the actor's name but he is
sure it wasn't Oliver. If I win, he has to take me to Jamaica for a
week, and if he wins I have to wash his car once a week for the
next three months. Please let me be right!
</P>
<P>
   _Lenora M.
</P>
<P>
   A: Get out the bucket, Lenora, you are in the car-washing
business.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Pastorelli played Eldin Bernecky, the ever-present
painter-cum-nanny. By the by, Oliver Platt looks like Pastorelli's
long-lost brother.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a number of baseball caps. Wearing these caps has
resulted in their becoming soiled and in need of cleaning. I have
tried soaking to no avail. Do you know a way to make the caps clean
as new?
</P>
<P>
   _ Bob Logan
</P>
<P>
   A: Maybe not clean as new, but much cleaner. Test them for
colorfastness, then pick up a Ball Cap Buddy for less than $3. This
frame keeps your cap in good shape through a washing machine or
dishwasher cycle. Cleaner than those gentle soaks.
</P>

 &HT;    Anime is one of the world's favorite exports. But how did this
art form develop?
 &HT;    By Yina Liang
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ ``Pokemon.'' ``Sailor Moon.'' ``Dragonball Z.'' ``Card
Captor Sakura.'' ``Gundam Wing.'' ``Hello Kitty.'' ``Tenchi Muyo.''
</P>
<P>
   What do all these popular cartoons have in common? They were
made in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese animation, or anime (a-NUH-may), has grown very popular
in the past few years. It has invaded our TVs, video stores and
even the big screen.
</P>
<P>
   Japan produces more animation than any other country.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Akins, the creative director at Cartoon Network and
executive producer of Toonami, a popular group of anime programs,
says about 150 new episodes of anime are produced every three
months in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   So how did it all start?
</P>
<P>
   Steve Pearl, an anime expert who operates anime Web sites,
explains that modern anime began in the late 19th century when
Japanese graphic artists began copying the bubbles, dialogue and
serialization of Western comic strips.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese called the comics ``manga'' (mahn-gah), which means
``random pictures.''
</P>
<P>
   By the 1940s, the success of American animated movies such as
``Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'' influenced some Japanese
graphic artists to experiment with animation. However, World War II
interrupted the Japanese development of this new form of
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   In 1951, while Japan was still recovering from the war, a man
named Osamu Tezuka introduced a manga called ``Mighty Atom.'' It
was inspired by the cartoons of Walt Disney.
</P>
<P>
   In 1963, ``Mighty Atom'' became the first anime. It was released
a year later in the United States as ``Astro Boy.'' The success of
this animated ``Mighty Atom'' brought about a whole new industry
for Japan, producing one hit series after another.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these shows were based on popular manga; others were
original or adapted from books or other sources.
</P>
<P>
   Over the decades, the family tree of anime has developed into
branches of diverse themes while keeping a similar style.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese artists gave birth to action and adventure shows like
``Speed Racer'' in the '60s, science fiction and robot shows like
``Captain Harlock: Space Pirate'' and ``Mobile Suit Gundam'' in the
'70s and soap opera and comedies like ``Maison Ikkoku'' and
``Ranma'' in the '80s.
</P>
<P>
   By the '90s, the popularity of animated features and videos
embraced an even larger worldwide audience. Shows that were made
for children, such as ``Sailor Moon'' and ``Pokemon,'' also
attracted teenage and adult fans.
</P>
<P>
   The most distinct features of modern anime are intricate plots,
a wide variety of topics and styles, and detailed art.
</P>
<P>
   Akins explains that ``boys are attracted to the action and
robots, and girls are attracted to anime's strong female
characters.''
</P>
<P>
   In just a century, what began as an imitation of Western art has
evolved into one of the largest graphic entertainment industries in
the world.

 &HT;    Gore grabs nomination
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, when Vice President Al Gore accepted the Democratic
presidential nomination, he promised to fight for America's working
families. In his speech, Gore said he would improve health care for
poor children and senior citizens, cut taxes for working families
and fight for better public education.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and his vice presidential pick, Sen. Joe Lieberman, then
left the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles to campaign
along the Mississippi River.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Gore and Republican presidential candidate George W.
Bush have agreed to debate on television three times this fall.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIAN SUB DRAMA UNFOLDS
</P>
<P>
   Hopes that Russian sailors might be saved from a sunken
submarine faded last week. Bad weather and a huge hole in the boat
blocked rescue attempts for days. The nuclear-powered sub, the
Kursk, sank quickly in the Barents Sea following at least one
explosion. The 118 submariners on board were performing naval
exercises at the time.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Russia refused offers of help from other countries.
Later the Russians allowed Britain and Norway to send rescue ships.
No one knows for sure how long the submarine's oxygen supply could
last, but some Russians said they didn't expect to find any
survivors on board.
</P>
<P>
   COED TEAM ROCKS SOFTBALL
</P>
<P>
   Boys and girls on the same softball team might not seem like a
big deal. But it is a big deal when the Little League Softball
World Series title is at stake.
</P>
<P>
   Five 16-year-old boys in Arizona joined a girls' softball team
this summer after their boys' baseball league disbanded. The coed
team played well and made it to the Softball World Series
tournament in Kalamazoo, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Now tournament officials and other teams are crying foul.
Critics say the boys have an unfair advantage and could hurt the
16-year-old girls. Some teams are refusing to play the Arizona
squad.
</P>
<P>
   The national Little League board of directors will meet this
week to discuss the situation.

   LANE-COLUMN _ DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Why is it considered
natural, laudable and an affirmation of family tradition when kids
go to their parents' old colleges, yet if they end up at the same
high school, everyone gets uncomfortable? Case in point: look at
George W. Bush. He went to Yale like his father and grandfather and
it's considered part of a heritage. But because he also went to the
same prep school as his father, people snicker about how WASP and
preppy and weird that seems. (Lane, Daytona Beach News-Journal)

 &HT;    Consumer Q&AMP;A
 &HT;    By Jane Greig
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Q: OK, I give up. I've searched everywhere on
and off the Web for a foley fork, a cooking utensil I'm starting to
think doesn't exist anymore. I'm sure your older readers will
remember their grandmothers using a foley fork to cut lard into
flour.
</P>
<P>
   _ J.H.
</P>
<P>
   A: Foley is a brand name, not a generic name. The fork you
described is indispensable (meatloaf to Bisquick). A four-tine
pastry blending fork is available in the King Arthur Baker's
Catalogue ($3.95 plus shipping and handling). The tines and the
short handle allow your wrist to do the work. Call (800) 827-6836
or visit www.kingarthurflour.com to order.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My fiance and I are marrying next June and want to dispense
with some of the less ``PC'' traditions _ namely, the
bouquet/garter toss. We're planning an evening wedding, so my
fiance came up with the idea of releasing fireflies to symbolize
good wishes. I know that you can order butterflies for release at
weddings _ can you do the same with fireflies? How much does it
cost (we're on a very tight budget)?
</P>
<P>
   _ Barbara S.
</P>
<P>
   A: Price is not the object _ availability is. According to the
nation's premiere firefly researcher, University of Florida
professor James Lloyd, firefly numbers are decreasing and there is
no commercial source for them. What's going on? Dropping water
tables and pollution certainly contribute to the diminishing
firefly population. Increased urbanization and resulting ambient
light keep the remaining fireflies from efficiently using their
light to find mates and procreate. Lloyd would prefer
well-intentioned couples contribute to firefly research rather that
attempt a release. Q: Where may I purchase buckwheat hulls such as
those used in pillows when they were in fashion?
</P>
<P>
   _ J. D. Reed
</P>
<P>
   A: You must be getting a jump on holiday gifts. Remember,
buckwheat hull needs to be free of mold and dust in order to make
good pillow stuffing. Buckwheat hulls are sold by retailers such as
James Farrell &AMP; Co. ($40 for 18-pound bag, $30 for 10-pound bag,
shipping included), 506 Second Ave., 3100, Seattle, WA 98104, or
call (206) 623-1993 to order. On the right coast, Birkett Mills
sells them at www.thebirkettmills.com or (315) 536-331. A 5-pound
bag is $8.95, plus shipping, and a 44-pound bag is $39.50, plus
shipping.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My husband and I have bet on your answer. What actor played
Eldin, the painter redoing Murphy Brown's apartment? I say it was
Oliver Platt. My husband can't remember the actor's name but he is
sure it wasn't Oliver. If I win, he has to take me to Jamaica for a
week, and if he wins I have to wash his car once a week for the
next three months. Please let me be right!
</P>
<P>
   _Lenora M.
</P>
<P>
   A: Get out the bucket, Lenora, you are in the car-washing
business.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Pastorelli played Eldin Bernecky, the ever-present
painter-cum-nanny. By the by, Oliver Platt looks like Pastorelli's
long-lost brother.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a number of baseball caps. Wearing these caps has
resulted in their becoming soiled and in need of cleaning. I have
tried soaking to no avail. Do you know a way to make the caps clean
as new?
</P>
<P>
   _ Bob Logan
</P>
<P>
   A: Maybe not clean as new, but much cleaner. Test them for
colorfastness, then pick up a Ball Cap Buddy for less than $3. This
frame keeps your cap in good shape through a washing machine or
dishwasher cycle. Cleaner than those gentle soaks.

   LANE-COLUMN _ DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Why is it considered
natural, laudable and an affirmation of family tradition when kids
go to their parents' old colleges, yet if they end up at the same
high school, everyone gets uncomfortable? Case in point: look at
George W. Bush. He went to Yale like his father and grandfather and
it's considered part of a heritage. But because he also went to the
same prep school as his father, people snicker about how WASP and
preppy and weird that seems. (Lane, Daytona Beach News-Journal)

ONLINE SELLERS GIVE COLLEGE BOOKSTORES A RUN FOR THEIR MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT BERNARD NELSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   College life looks and feels different today than it did even a
decade ago. Typewriters, pay phones, and library research are out.
Laptops, cell phones, and Internet research are in.
</P>
<P>
   But students continue to lug around as many heavy, hardcover
textbooks as their predecessors ever did _ and pay more for the
privilege. Full-time students routinely spend hundreds of dollars
on texts at the beginning of each semester, only to sell them for
cents on the dollar four months later.
</P>
<P>
   As would-be scholars return to school in the next few weeks,
though, a handful of Web sites are vying to break the near monopoly
campus bookstores have enjoyed for generations. The sites make it
surprisingly easy to comparison shop for textbooks online and even
get the tomes delivered to your doorstep (or dorm room) in time for
the first class.
</P>
<P>
   The technology involved isn't cutting edge, but it is useful. In
short, the sites troll a bunch of online booksellers checking price
and availability of the texts you want, then create an express
checkout with your retailer of choice.
</P>
<P>
   To test the services, I looked up the required reading for a
trio of randomly selected fall classes at local universities. Then
I compared both the new and used prices at the campus store with
those online.
</P>
<P>
   To my surprise, the bookstores more than held their own. In
every case, the on-campus price was better than most of the ones at
online sellers _ quashing the oft-repeated grumble about colleges
gouging their own. The old alma mater looks especially good when
you consider shipping and handling charges at online sellers, not
to mention the extra time and hassle involved.
</P>
<P>
   Students, though, don't buy dozens of copies of the same book;
they must concern themselves only with the single lowest price they
can find. In that regard, the book-search sites were useful.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the searches turned up at least one text that could be
had for less than the going rate on campus. How much less, and how
easy the search was, depended on the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   For the sake of students and the parents who fund them, then,
here's a rundown of the sites tested:
</P>
<P>
   --www.addall.com is probably my all-around favorite. It's simple
(books only), comprehensive (checks 41 online sellers), fast
(promises to complete all searches in 25 seconds or less), and ad
free (no banners). The prices it tracked down tended to be good,
too.
</P>
<P>
   You can search for books directly from the home page, unlike
some of the others, which make you click a couple of layers deep
before starting a query. And you can search by title, author,
keyword, or ISB number.
</P>
<P>
   Once you do get a list of books, Addall.com presents them from
lowest cost to highest and includes nice details such as shipping
costs, sales tax, and number of days until the book can be in your
hands. Not all the sites were as complete.
</P>
<P>
   My only complaint: It would have been easier if new and used
books were separated into different lists. I was able to figure out
which were which, but it would've been simpler if I didn't have to.
</P>
<P>
   --www.bookfinder.com doesn't work with as many stores as
Addall.com and it isn't quite as simple to work with, but it does
include a handful of retailers that specialize in rare and antique
books. College students might not find that terribly useful, but
book lovers in general might.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, among the eight sellers Bookfinder.com checks for
new books are giants Amazon, Barnes &AMP; Noble, and Powell's Books (a
sprawling independent retailer in Portland, Ore., that bills itself
as ``the largest used and new bookstore in the world''). So you're
still likely to find whatever you need on Bookfinder.com.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest irritant with this site is that it doesn't include
shipping and handling charges in the lists it provides. And, in my
searches at least, it did include a handful of wrong titles along
with the ones I wanted.
</P>
<P>
   --www.dealtime.com found the best prices among the sites tested,
but only because it included one seller they didn't: elgrande.com.
Otherwise, the prices it found tended to be in line with those of
the others.
</P>
<P>
   If the elgrande.com prices are legitimate, you'll probably find
a few good deals by going through this appropriately named
book-hunting service. Regardless, the site is helpful and easy to
use.
</P>
<P>
   As with addall.com, you can search by title, author, keyword, or
ISBN. And the results include shipping costs, time until delivery,
and _ in the case of overseas booksellers _ conversion of prices to
US dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The conversion turns out to be important, since dealtime.com
surveys quite a few international sellers. But it also surveys the
big domestic players, so you'll get plenty of options.
</P>
<P>
   --www.ecompare.com is a shopping-comparison service for a
variety of things, books among them. That's not necessarily a bad
thing, as long as the book search is comprehensive and easy to use.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, it is. Ecompare.com surveys 25 sellers of new
books and usually finds competitive prices.
</P>
<P>
   The site's biggest strength is its simplicity. You can search by
title, author, keyword, or ISBN, and the results are a thing of
beauty. It simply lists bookstore, price, availability, and
shipping costs, and limits the list to one from each bookstore.
Most of the others were more jumbled and more difficult to
navigate.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't search used books at all, though, which is a
weakness.
</P>
<P>
   --www.mysimon.com made a name for itself during the holidays
last year as a comprehensive ``shopping bot,'' or shopping search
engine. Books are one of the many things it will shop for in your
stead.
</P>
<P>
   In a different twist, you can tell Mysimon.com that you want
hardcover, paperback, or audio books. And once you have a list,
retailers are shown with their reliability ratings from Gomez
Advisors.
</P>
<P>
   You can also pare down the final list by ``merchant services''
you want, such as international shipping or acceptance of Discover
Card.

PROPOSED FUNDS AREN'T LIKELY TO SMOOTH INVESTOR'S BUMPY RIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Q. I invested in March, just before the big market drop, and
now I have negative returns. I am considering American Century
Income and Growth fund and Invesco Dynamics fund, as well as making
a small investment in Marsico Focus fund. I want moderate
investments, as I have only eight or nine years for an investment
time frame. Would I be wiser to consider a group of Vanguard index
funds, or just add more to the Index 500 position?
</P>
<P>
   S.R., Chattanooga, Tenn. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. If you're unhappy with the bumpy ride, chances are it won't
improve much with the three funds you suggest. All, of course, have
attractive records, but two of them would significantly increase
your risk level. Let's take them one by one:
</P>
<P>
   --Marsico Focus, like all of the so-called focus funds, has a
compact portfolio of 38 stocks, as of the last report from
Morningstar Mutual Funds. It produced a 51.3 percent gain in 1998,
its first year, and followed with 55.3 percent last year. This
year, it is off 5.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of its holdings are solid and well-established
companies, but the very fact that its portfolio is concentrated in
so few stocks adds an extra element of risk. Most funds have 100 to
122 stocks, and poor performances by a few of them can be more
easily offset than in a fund holding fewer investments. Like all of
the funds you now hold, Marsico Focus has a portfolio dominated by
large-cap stocks, so the move would not take you away from the
large-cap investments.
</P>
<P>
   --Invesco Dynamics has a portfolio of mid-cap growth stocks and
boasts a 13.7 percent year-to-date total return. The fund tends to
focus on health and technology issues and has produced strong
returns in recent years, gaining 23.3 percent in 1998 and 71.8
percent in 1999. But the gains come with an expensive portfolio,
which has an average price-to-earnings ratio of 52.9.
</P>
<P>
   It could be an attractive holding if it represented a small part
of an otherwise diversified portfolio, but like Marsico Focus it
should hardly be a major holding in a portfolio you want to
characterize as moderate. But by adding a mid-cap element to your
portfolio, it would improve overall diversification.
</P>
<P>
   --American Century Income and Growth is a different matter
entirely _ a solid, well-established, value-oriented fund that has
been running nearly in tandem with the Standard and Poor's 500
Index in recent years, or at least a whole lot closer than most of
its peers in the value universe can claim. This is the only one of
the three funds you suggest that could truly be considered part of
a moderate portfolio. And including it would give you a foot in the
value segment of the market.
</P>
<P>
   Would an amalgam of these funds and those you already hold be
better than an all-index portfolio? My take is that it would have
more upside potential and, accordingly, more risk.
</P>
<P>
   I'd split my bets, sticking with the Vanguard Index 500 position
as your core holding. Then, put $5,000 in American Century Income
and Growth fund, taking the money from the Janus Worldwide account.
I would then divide the remaining $10,000 in Janus Worldwide,
leaving $5,000 where it is and putting the other $5,000 in Janus
Overseas. The latter is more purely an overseas play, mostly
invested in international stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Janus Worldwide, in contrast, holds a little more than 30
percent of its assets in large-cap domestic stocks _ pretty much
the same fare you have covered with your position in Vanguard Index
500. Until late last year, Janus Overseas was running behind the
Standard and Poor's 500 Index; since then, it has been leading it.
This is the point of real diversification, to be in different
markets that will operate in different market cycles.
</P>
<P>
   As for the final $10,000, I would divide it evenly among the
three riskier funds you have been considering.
</P>
<P>
   The only fund we haven't discussed is Janus Mercury, which you
already have and which is somewhat akin to the Marsico and Invesco
funds, holding a fairly compact (but not focused) portfolio of 72
large-cap growth stocks, with major concentrations in service and
technology issues and with a heavier-than-normal diet of
Internet-related stocks. Its price-to-earnings ratio is a heady
52.9, but these stocks drove it to a 1998 total return of 55.8
percent, followed by a 96.2 percent gain this year. As this is
written, the year-to-date return is a negative 2.7 percent. Given
the current climate, I wouldn't worry about that 2.7 percent loss,
but given its focus on expensive stocks in risky market sectors, I
would limit your investment here to $3,333.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My wife and I need $1,500 a month. Where should we invest to
reduce our tax liability? I will have to start drawing from the 457
and IRA accounts at age 70 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   C.S., Arlington, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. There are two basic avenues you might explore to reduce
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   --Move into a municipal bond fund that holds securities that are
free of both state and federal taxes. A good choice might be the
Fidelity Spartan Massachusetts Municipal Income fund, which wins
top grades from Morningstar Mutual Funds and has a current tax-free
yield of 4.94 percent.
</P>
<P>
   --The other investment vehicle likely to reduce your tax
liability is stocks _ either a portfolio of common stocks or a
mutual fund, particularly a stock index fund. Since there is
relatively little turnover within index funds, they do not tend to
produce high levels of capital gains, and the dividend yield from
stocks and stock funds is currently very low.
</P>
<P>
   But looking at your portfolio, which shows no stock investments
(unless some of the 457 plan is in stocks) I hesitate to suggest
that you go into stocks in a big way. Some people simply don't like
the element of risk that comes with stocks. If you are one of those
people, stick with the municipal bonds.
</P>
<P>
   But if I were in your shoes, I would put about $169,000 in the
municipal bond fund, taking the money from the Scudder GNMA
position, the CD, and the rest from the proceeds of your real
estate sale. That would leave you with $110,000. I suggest you then
transfer $100,000 of it to a money market fund, such as Fidelity
Cash Reserves. Then, invest the remaining $10,000 in shares in
Fidelity Spartan 500 Index fund, which simply seeks to track the
results of the Standard and Poor's 500 Index.
</P>
<P>
   I suggest you instruct Fidelity to move $3,000 a month from the
money market fund to Spartan 500 Index fund. This procedure is
called dollar-cost averaging, and since that sequence of
investments would spread your investment over 36 months (presuming
5 percent average returns from the money fund) it would offer some
protection against a short-term market downturn. (If there is a
price dip, your later purchases would be at lower prices, and each
purchase at lower prices would bring your average cost per share
down.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q. I am interested in the assumptions you make in calculating
long-term growth in an investment account. In a previous column,
you projected the growth of a $500,000 account with $10,500 annual
contributions and 10 percent annual investment returns to
$1,532,563. I come up with $1,464,214. Where have I gone wrong?
</P>
<P>
   V.M., Burlington, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. You made your calculations based upon annual contributions
made on the final day of each year. My calculations were based on
120 monthly contributions of $875, each made at the end of the
month, and with monthly compounding, using the actual number of
days in the month. For example, in your tally of the growth of the
questioner's 401(k) contributions, you posted $10,500 as the
balance at the end of the first year; in my calculation, the
balance at the end of the first year was $10,994. However, I have
tried adjusting a number of less critical presumptions to come up
with $1,532,563, and I can't duplicate it; I probably garbled it.
The number should have been $1,523,623.

DEALERS SLOW TO EMBRACE ELECTRIC-GAS TOYOTA PRIUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anara Guard says Toyota Motor Corp. isn't making it easy to do
the right thing.
</P>
<P>
   The Newton, Mass. resident currently drives a 15-year-old Jeep
Cherokee with 84,000 miles on it. She needs a new car, and she and
her husband are seriously considering buying the new electric/gas
hybrid Toyota Prius, which gets 52 miles to the gallon in the city
and runs 90 percent cleaner than the average car.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're greens _ we recycle and we try to do the right thing,''
she said, explaining her interest.
</P>
<P>
   But it hasn't been easy getting behind the wheel of the Prius
(pronounced Pree-us) for a test drive. Guard has been reading about
the revolutionary car for more than six months now, but she says
neither Toyota nor its local dealers have been responsive to
requests for information or a test drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand why you have made it so difficult for
consumers to purchase your vehicle!'' she said in a July 31 e-mail
to Toyota. ``My older car is getting more rickety by the day. If
Toyota cannot provide me with some assistance, I will be purchasing
another vehicle.''
</P>
<P>
   Guard's story is troubling. The Prius, as well as its hybrid
cousin the Insight from Honda, are cars that could revolutionize
the way Americans drive. With gas prices high, oil markets
unstable, and automobiles the leading cause of air pollution, the
arrival of the hybrids could not be more welcome. Consumers should
be encouraged, not discouraged, from taking a test drive.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota officials attribute most of Guard's problems to bad
timing. She started asking questions about the Prius in April and
May, before Toyota was ready to provide many answers. Her requests
for a test drive, prompted by ads and news articles on the car,
came before local dealers received a test-drive vehicle and
training on the new car.
</P>
<P>
   The test-drive vehicles arrived in New England one month late,
at the end of July. Several dealers I called now seemed geared up
for customers, but they said the hybrids, despite their gas savings
and environmental benefits, are not easy sells because of their
unfamiliar technology, high cost, and scarcity.
</P>
<P>
   The Prius and the Insight are both being manufactured in Japan
and shipped to the United States in limited quantities. Honda hopes
to sell 6,500 Insights this year, while Toyota, despite rumors of
stepped-up production, is sticking with its plan to ship 12,000
vehicles to the United States over the next 12 months. That's about
1,000 cars a month for some 1,200 dealers, a paltry number that may
explain why some dealers aren't too excited about the Prius yet.
Nine of the 71 Toyota dealers in New England have chosen not to
sell the car.
</P>
<P>
   The slow pace of Prius production is understandable from the
standpoint of a manufacturer uncertain whether the concept will
take off, but it's frustrating for consumers accustomed to
immediate gratification.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota's Web site says an order placed today should yield a
Prius in November to mid-December, or about three to four months. A
Honda spokesman said the wait for Insights is one to two months.
</P>
<P>
   Not only do customers have to order a hybrid and wait, they also
have to pay a premium. Toyota says it is losing money on each Prius
it sells, but even so, the car is expensive. At $20,400, the car
has many attractive standard features (air conditioning, power
windows and locks, an eight-year warranty, and a free roadside
assistance plan), but the five-passenger vehicle is comparable in
size to the much cheaper Echo or Corolla. The Insight may be an
even tougher sell. The hatchback seats two but costs $18,800, or
nearly $20,000 with air conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   Citing the long wait for a car and the high cost, Albert Gray,
sales manager for Ira Toyota in Danvers, Mass., said he would
characterize consumer interest in the Prius as ``low to medium.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Smenton, business development manager at Boch Toyota in
Norwood, Mass., said consumers interested in the Prius are the type
who want to be the first on their block with the latest gadget. He
expects the customer base to change as production increases and
customers learn the advantages of hybrid technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're seeing the first stages of a revolution in the car
market,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With a car so different, Toyota decided to sell it differently.
The company felt Internet users were its most likely target market,
so it used its Web site (http://prius.toyota.com) to steer initial
customers to dealers who would actually place the orders. The
Internet referral process is still in place, but customers can now
go directly to a dealer.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota also wanted consumers to take the Prius for a day-long
test drive rather than the standard 20-minute spin around the
block. But most dealers I contacted said consumer interest is so
strong they can't spare their test-drive vehicle for that long.
Some will rent their Prius for $60 a day, however.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota officials are generally pleased with Prius sales so far.
As of last week, Toyota had 3,100 confirmed orders. Close to 2,000
customers have placed orders for the Prius sight unseen, without
even taking a test drive, said Ernest Bastien, vehicle operations
manager with Toyota in Torrance, Ca.
</P>
<P>
   In New England, which was the last of Toyota's 12 sales
territories to receive test-drive vehicles, 215 cars have been
ordered. Four have been delivered so far. Acton Toyota has sold the
most, but 49 of the 62 dealers selling the Prius have sold at least
one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now we're thrilled with the results we're getting,''
Bastien said.
</P>
<P>
   Even Guard isn't giving up. Her calls to Toyota customer service
were finally answered late last week and she plans to take a test
drive sometime this week. She's not certain whether she'll end up
buying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pay a hefty price and wait months and months,'' she said of
the situation. ``I think that's asking a lot of consumers. You have
to be sure that this is the only vehicle you want.''
</P>
<P>
   A disconcerting recall
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Janet Bruno of Woburn, Mass. got a letter last month from
General Motors that scared her. The letter said the company had
learned of a ``condition that can cause the driver's air bag in
your car to deploy unexpectedly, without a crash, as you start your
car or during normal driving.''
</P>
<P>
   Even scarier, as far as Bruno was concerned, was the news that
it would take GM at least six months to assemble the necessary
parts to repair the problem. ``General Motors needs to move to
alleviate this situation now, not starting in six months,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   GM blames its air bag problem on corrosion of the air bag's
inflator wiring. The company said it has received 115 reports of
bags deploying in noncrash situations, prompting the letters to the
268,000 owners of 1995 and 1996 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supremes and
1995 Buick Regals.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Martin, a GM spokesman, acknowledged the letter would be
disconcerting. But he said the company felt it had to alert
customers now rather than later. He said it will unfortunately take
time to inventory the necessary parts and said the risk of injury
is small if drivers take the necessary precautions.
</P>
<P>
   Martin said drivers should sit the proper distance from the
steering wheel and immediately pull over and call Oldsmobile for
emergency assistance if the air bag light on their dash comes on
and doesn't go off.
</P>
<P>
   In 60 of the 115 incidents, Martin said drivers suffered minor
injuries. ``There was nothing more serious than that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But every time she gets behind the wheel of her car, Bruno
worries. What if she's driving down the highway when the air bag
deploys? What happens if she loses control and hits other cars?
</P>
<P>
   ``To tell you the truth,'' she said. ``I'm petrified to drive
the car.''

KEEPING IT SIMPLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN TRAUSCH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an age of smart money and savvy deal-making, it's good to see
someone look into a television camera and say: ``So, what's a
stock?''
</P>
<P>
   Beginning at the beginning is beneath a lot of people today.
They figure we're all on Step 5 or 6 in the workbook, way past the
basics, and into a serious relationship with a sector fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``A stock is a little piece of a company,'' Julie Stav says in
the national PBS debut of her television show ``Get Your Share.''
She explains how Home Depot was ``cut up into 600,000 pieces in
1981, selling for $12 each,'' and that if someone had invested
$1,000 back then, the person would have $1.3 million today.
</P>
<P>
   That's a stock all right.
</P>
<P>
   ``A client said to me, `What's an IRA?' and she had one,'' says
Stav in a phone interview. ``I said, `Good for her!' People confuse
lack of information with lack of intelligence. When people say, `I
have a really stupid question,' I tell them that those are my
favorites. Always ask. That's how you learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Stav has lived the axiom. The 47-year-old Calabassas, Calif.,
stockbroker and financial planner came to the United States from
Cuba in 1967 at age 14, knowing no English. She was classified as
``mentally retarded'' at a Los Angeles high school because of the
language barrier. The experience steeled her resolve to go to
college and become a teacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had English coming out of those kids' ears,'' she says of
her years as a first grade teacher in an inner city school, ``and I
taught the rest in the language they knew best.''
</P>
<P>
   That's how she approaches the market: ``I'm always teaching. I
want it to be fun. I want you to get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Stav did not ``get it'' easily and had to take her broker's
license exam three times. ``I studied at night after work at my
kitchen table while my kid was asleep.'' She pursued the brokerage
career after a divorce in 1986 left her ``with 33 cents in my
checking account.''
</P>
<P>
   She began that career by holding free financial seminars in
libraries, beauty shops, and storefronts, reaching out to Latinas
with the basics and helping them form investment clubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were people just like me, managing their household
budgets and married to tradition-bound Latin men. Many of the
people I met were afraid of the stock market. I told them to relax.
I wasn't selling anything. I didn't care if they ever saw me again.
I love watching the light bulbs going on. It's like teaching a kid
to read.''
</P>
<P>
   Her TV show, available in Spanish and English, might seem
pedestrian to the cognoscente, but she gets the information across.
</P>
<P>
   One of her props is a three-drawer bureau, representing money
management. She explains that day-to-day expensese come out of the
top ``underwear drawer,'' as she pulls out boxer shorts decorated
with dollar signs. Long-term retirement and college funds are in
the bottom ``itchy blanket drawer,'' and stock market investments
are in the middle, feeding top and bottom.
</P>
<P>
   She believes in the power of small money, encouraging people to
get into the market for as little as $5 or $10 a month, going with
a discount broker or online trader. She advises people to sell when
a stock drops 10 percent, and knows that runs counter to the more
traditional advice to ``buy and hold.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If holding is your thing, fine,'' she says. ``But I say don't
marry a stock when your money can be working elsewhere. This is my
recipe for the market. I'm not claiming it's the only one, or the
best. It's like my recipe for paella _ it's one way to do it, and I
know it works.''
</P>
<P>
   Mutual funds are fine too, she says, but for the passive
investor. ``Buying individual stocks is for people who want to
drive the car. Mutual funds are for people who want to sleep in the
back seat.''
</P>
<P>
   Too simplistic? Too bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are totally kicking butt,'' she says. ``Little old ladies
come up to me and say they feel empowered. So do men, but they're
not as quick to admit they don't know something.''
</P>
<P>
   With her frankly bleached hair, she's heard every dumb-blonde
joke in the book, but doesn't care: ``Honey, I know I'm not dumb _
and I know I'm not blonde.''
</P>
<P>
   She just might do for the market what Julia Child did for
bouillabaisse. Stay tuned.

SHOPPING ON THE INTERNET IS KILLING SERENDIPITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CLEA SIMON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the old days, shopping for books and music could be
difficult. We'd trek to the outlets that claimed to physically
contain the works of our favorite artists. But often we didn't see
what we wanted once we arrived, so we'd have to flag down a
salesperson, or make a special order.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the days of Internet shopping, and the world's
inventories were made accessible in the click of a mouse. Nothing
was out of stock, very little too esoteric to be found, and if we
wavered between choices we could seek advice from experts who were
happy to offer recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for consumers of the most portable, affordable arts and
entertainment _ music, books, even videos _ this brave new consumer
experience is missing something.
</P>
<P>
   Gone is the chance that as we head into the world music
department seeking a Nathan and the Zydeco Cha-Chas CD we will hear
and fall instantly in love with the hip-shifting merengue of Juan
Luis Guerra. Lost is the opportunity to browse the titles of a
favorite author and stumble upon an intriguing work by an
unrecognized writer on the shelf directly above.
</P>
<P>
   Because for all its ease, Internet shopping does not offer the
element of serendipity, the happy chance that put the joy into
non-Web browsing.
</P>
<P>
   There can be little doubt that the Internet has been a boon to
the arts, basically by providing low-cost, global exposure. Through
the Web, musicians can distribute their music everywhere via MP3
technology. Painters and other visual artists show to potential
buyers, albeit in reduced form, through online galleries. Midlist
authors can reach readers in the hinterlands thanks to Web
superstores such as Amazon and Barnes and Noble.com. Documentary
films may be getting a new shot at life via Internet distribution,
say reports from the latest Sundance festival, and independent
films (such as ``The Blair Witch Project'') have clearly benefited
from Internet buzz and from online festivals, like the Yahoo
Internet Life fete.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the biggest benefactors in the Internet shopping spree
have been the most easily consumable arts. Books now make up 24
percent of all Internet sales, and music in the forms of CDs or
tapes, 19 percent, according to a recent survey by Arbitron/Edison
Media Research. The main reasons for these sales are convenience
and selection. Whatever you want, you can find it on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that you shopped the inventory,'' says Don
MacKinnon, president of the Seattle-based Hear Music, which sells
CDs online and in its 18 North American stores. ``Now we all have
the same inventory.''
</P>
<P>
   The consumer mindset has been further changed by the Web's
round-the-clock access. As Paul Capelli, the senior public
relations manager for Amazon, points out, ``If you go back five
years people would say, `Stores open at 10 and they close at 6, so
I shop between 10 and 6.' Now people are saying, `Why can't I shop
at 11 at night?' ''
</P>
<P>
   No reason at all, say Web retailers, who have gotten very good
at giving consumers what they want.
</P>
<P>
   These sites are also becoming surprisingly adept at figuring out
what we are likely to want next and offering it to us in an
increasing variety of ways. The most basic is that which compares
our purchase history with those of other consumers, such as the
window that pops up to announce ``Readers who bought this book also
bought . . .'' on Amazon or the recommendations on CD Now that
combine personal buying history with the users' ratings of various
recordings.
</P>
<P>
   As this kind of advance marketing has grown more subtle, it has
sought to discover not only what we buy but how people develop
tastes and loyalties, and now aims at duplicating that process,
which for Internet retailers has largely meant adding more human
input. On the Web, that translated first to customer reviews, which
Amazon began posting in 1996, and more recently to options such as
purchaser groups, which offer the user the opportunity to see what
others in various cities or ZIP codes have bought.
</P>
<P>
   Although this marketing is consumer driven, relying on the
voluntary input of thousands of shoppers, the next wave of Web
marketing is beginning to think for itself. Increasingly sites are
promoting specific items through a blend of explicit and implicit
data, says Lisa Allen, a senior analyst with Forrester Research, an
independent Internet and emerging technologies research firm. In
other words, she explains, the latest technologies factor in not
only her recent purchases of mysteries and world music, but also
what other Web sites she has visited and how long she has viewed
each one.
</P>
<P>
   Still, such chains of logic cannot answer all our needs. No
matter how sophisticated such technology becomes in determining
what we believe we want, it can't figure out what we would like if
we stumbled across it by chance.
</P>
<P>
   In brief, in a decision-driven, logic-driven model, there is no
room for serendipity. ``When people talk about the brick and mortar
retail experience they say, `Well, you can touch the fabric,' ''
says MacKinnon, whose business was recently acquired by Starbucks.
``But the beauty is you have this peripheral vision, you see things
and they intrigue you. You would walk into a little bookstore, and
you'd go to Pynchon and find Barbara Pym or Poe. There is no
peripheral vision on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   There are some exceptions, of course, and these involve a return
to a more traditional model, in which we shopped at a particular
store because we trusted the store's point of view. That store
didn't offer everything, but we knew it was likely to have what we
wanted. And as Web sites all increasingly offer everything, we as
consumers may begin to seek out the more discriminating.
</P>
<P>
   This trend has already started on some book and music sites,
although the tastes being touted are more likely to be celebrities'
(as on Radio SonicNet) than experts' or fans'. Most notably, the
reintroduction of a more humanely scaled chaos can be seen in
online visual arts sites. Such sites are more likely to re-create
the concept of a global gallery, perhaps in part because their
products are less easily quantifiable. ``Viewers who bought Picasso
also bought Bracque . . .'' makes little sense in a field that
relies less on cognitive connections about which the average buyer
has scant knowledge. However, by using this format, the site risks
missing out on the consumer who really wants an olive green,
couch-sized oil painting and can't spare the time to browse.
</P>
<P>
   It is the targeting of such time-pressed consumers that
continues to make logic-based suggestions the marketing mode of
choice. As Allen puts it, traditionally, ``merchandisers have
talked about the art of retail. Online it becomes more the science
of retail.'' All of which threatens to involve us in an
increasingly closed circle, in which all that we are ever offered
is anything that we have ever previously bought. And while such a
fate is not unthinkable for more pragmatic purchases, to those of
us who see ourselves as supporters of the arts, even in a small
way, it is terrible.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are books you want to touch, you want to see,'' says
Sanj Kharbande, general manager of Wordsworth, an independent
bookstore in Harvard Square that also sells through its Web site.
``I can throw up an excerpt, and an interview with the author,''
says Kharbande. ``But there are some books you have to pick up and
have a reaction to.''

GORE'S BIG LEAP FORWARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; LOS ANGELES &UR;  &LR; _ Seated behind Al Gore near the stage, Senator
Barbara Mikulski of Maryland was fixated on the Democratic
nominee's footwork.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would kind of drift backwards a step or two in his
transitions,'' said the veteran who entered Congress with Gore in
1976. ``And then as he began another major point, he would step
right into it toward the microphone. Kinda like a fighter; in fact,
exactly like a fighter.''
</P>
<P>
   Takes one to know one, but Gore's performance on the last night
of a complicated (by definition for a sitting vice president)
convention also met a modern challenge _ to leaven the image of
fighter for others with personal appeal. In today's political
culture, voters want to welcome a candidate in their homes via
television. Most people want to fall in like, if not in love.
</P>
<P>
   The focus two weeks ago in Philadelphia was that for George W.
Bush, all this was not business, it was personal. It was all about
him, as personality and potential governing style.
</P>
<P>
   For Al Gore as of early August _ just getting ready to pick a
vice presidential nominess and and prepare his own show _ all this
wasn't personal, it was business. As things unfolded here, it
turned out that in Gore's planning and execution the personal and
the business merged.
</P>
<P>
   The way they merged surprised me.
</P>
<P>
   In the several days preceding the Gore (as well as the Joe
Lieberman) acceptance speeches, I heard from campaign officials
about the critical importance of rhythm and speed as keys to a
conversational tone that would get him into people's homes as a
welcome (if temporary) guest, not as an intruding, traveling
salesman.I reacted by putting aside what I had trouble following,
by basically dismissing it as political consultant babble.
</P>
<P>
   Was I wrong! From the fifth word of the speech, what I had been
told but ignored somehow kicked in and made sense. The initial
phrase _ ``I speak tonight of gratitude'' _ was anything but
typical of Gore the vice president and stiff figure. In that role,
each word would be fairly loud and come fairly slow.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore the nominee went straight and quickly to the downbeat,
to the word ``gratitude.'' More speed meant less volume; he was
both conversational and got straight to the initial point that he
was grateful.
</P>
<P>
   In musical notation terms, Gore the vice president marked his
rhetoric Lento _ slow to the point of ponderous. In his case, the
effect was usually artificially solemn, preachy.
</P>
<P>
   The score for Gore the nominee on Thursday night was marked
Allegro, not rapid but flowing the way a clear stream does. With
modern sound systems, a speaker doesn't have to shout to be heard
in a hall; and he shouldn't shout to be listened to in voters'
homes. By maintaining a flow, Gore was able to make himself
welcome. And that meant Gore could concentrate on content,
business, issues, and message.
</P>
<P>
   For the two-dimensional in mindset, Gore's laser-like focus on
the concerns of working families is inevitably termed ``populist.''
It is not; it is progressive. There's a difference. Populism is
anger; it is about retaliation on behalf of the downtrodden against
the money-covered titans of commerce and politics; it is mostly
about redistribution of wealth and power.
</P>
<P>
   Progressivism is reform, working family, middle-class as well as
working poor politics. As in the turn-of-20th century model (Teddy
Roosevelt) for those leaving rural life for an industrial economy,
it seeks a social contract for those (in Bill Clinton's phrase, who
work hard and play by the rules) in the post-industrial economy, to
help people in a confusing world where ``powerful forces and
powerful interests stand in your way.'' Getting this right is in
the country's interest, not simply the interest of one class.
</P>
<P>
   The best clue was that after a specific thematic opening, Gore
began an even more detailed discussion of national priorities with
campaign finance reform. This was a steal from John McCain, who
presented a cleansing of money politics as the key to accomplishing
all his other goals.
</P>
<P>
   Progressivism also has a darker side _ not just preachy but
moralistic in an intrusive, superior way. It reached its apogee in
the absurdity of prohibition.
</P>
<P>
   But these matters pale before the fact that Gore has
accomplished the difficult task for a vice president of emerging.
He's right that the people who count want to know the details, but
Gore the vice president had trouble getting past the threshold to
start that conversation. By being conversational, the nominee now
has an attentive audience.

LEAK ON CLINTON INVESTIGATION IS BACKFIRING IN A BIG WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT A. JORDAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two events last week gave Al Gore a much-needed boost in his
campaign for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, accepting the Democratic Party's nomination for president
on Thursday night, gave perhaps the best speech of his political
life at a time when he needed to do so. His populist approach,
framed in such phrases as, ``They are for the powerful. We are for
the people,'' resonated with the throng at the Democratic
convention and earned him high marks among delegates interviewed
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   The other event, which happened just hours before Gore took to
the podium, was the leak to the media that Independent Counsel
Robert Ray had convened a grand jury to determine whether President
Clinton should be indicted on criminal charges involving his
testimony in the Monica Lewinsky case.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt the leak was timed to cloud Gore's most important
moment in the political sun. But the immediate reaction among
Democrats and even independents suggested that this tactic, whether
by Republicans or GOP supporters or Ray's office, had already begun
to backfire in Gore's favor.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually every delegate interviewed saw the leak as a
deliberate, despicable attempt by the Republicans to keep the vice
president linked to the Clinton scandal on the very night when Gore
announced that he was his own man.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, this tactic will rally Clinton's supporters, many
of whom were only lukewarm to Gore's candidacy. As Republicans
know, the attempt by the right-wing element of their party to
convict Clinton on impeachment charges not only failed, but
backfired. The polls showed after Congress acquitted Clinton of the
charges that the president's popularity was still high, if not
higher, while the GOP's favorability ratings dropped because of the
electorate's dim view of the Republicans' efforts to drive a
popular president from office.
</P>
<P>
   That's why it was no coincidence that none of the right-wing
Republicans involved in the impeachment crusade were on prime time
during the Republican National Convention. The Bush campaign tried
to keep them at a distance because of their negative image. Now the
Bush campaign is attempting publicly to keep the leak about the
grand jury at a distance, knowing that any link to it will harm
Bush's candidacy while energizing Gore's.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who looked as presidential last Thursday to his supporters
as Bush did to his backers during the GOP convention, caught up to
Bush in at least one poll because of the bounce he got from his
speech.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of GOP criticism, Gore's speech achieved its purpose
of showing the television audience that Gore was more than a
candidate of substance, a positive attribute on its own. He also
showed he was someone whom voters could feel comfortable with, an
important emotional factor for the electorate.
</P>
<P>
   As his campaign had hoped, Gore's speech gave a huge lift to his
candidacy. And the leak about the grand-jury investigation is
likely to help Gore even more as the reaction of Clinton supporters
to the timing of the leak continues to grow.
</P>
<P>
   There is some speculation among Republicans as to whether the
leak came not from Ray's office, but from the White House,
particularly since the reporter who wrote the story covers the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   Even some political pundits familiar with the White House
suggested that was a possibility, arguing that White House
strategists would be wise enough to know that the timing of the
link, ostensibly designed to keep Gore connected to the scandal
involving Lewinsky, would backfire against the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, some GOP supporters further argued that the leak
was not likely to have come from Ray's office since Ray had cleared
the president and the first lady on the Travelgate investigation
involving the firing of workers in the White House travel office
shortly after Clinton took office.
</P>
<P>
   And, they added, there is the strong possibility that Ray could
have convened the grand jury as a process toward closing the
investigation of whether Clinton committed criminal perjury
violations in his testimony about his relationship with Lewinsky.
Perhaps, the GOP supporters concluded, this is a likely ending to
the convening of the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   But these scenarios have as much credibility as the suggestions
that the leak came directly from Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his advisers may be wise enough to know that an
attempt to wreck Gore's most important political night with such a
leak would backfire against the Republicans. But it's entirely
another matter to take such a risk that, if traced to the president
or his staff, would do irreparable harm to Clinton and destroy
Gore's candidacy. It's more likely that this leak, especially its
timing, was by people not working in Gore's best interests who
wanted the grand-jury investigation to overshadow and diminish his
acceptance speech at the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the grand-jury leak is receiving almost as much
attention as Gore's speech _ but not the kind of publicity the
leakers apparently intended.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats and independents see this leak as a desperate
attempt by the GOP or an anti-Gore element to keep Gore connected
to the negative side of the Clinton presidency.
</P>
<P>
   However, the leak did not overshadow Gore's substantive agenda.
Rather, it exposed the GOP's lack of such an agenda and its
never-ending dependence on the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal to bring
first Clinton, and now Gore, down.
</P>
<P>
   While the Bush campaign vows to end the Clinton-Gore era, this
grand jury leak, and Gore's strong performance at the convention,
may do more to bring an end to the Bush-Cheney era before it even
begins.

TIME TO EXCITE, NOT RECITE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EILEEN MCNAMARA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It would have been enough for Al Gore to be his own man. Did he
also have to be his own speechwriter?
</P>
<P>
   One wonders what possessed a campaign saddled with a
less-than-engaging candidate to cede to the vice president the
crucial task of crafting a message meant to energize the
electorate. Aides reportedly whittled Gore's initial 12,000-word
opus to a more manageable 5,700, but no amount of editing could
insert inspiration into a speech so sorely lacking in it.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the reassurance they needed from their party's
presidential nominee, jittery Democrats heard all their fears
reinforced the other night when Gore delivered an earnest and
thoroughly plodding acceptance speech at the Staples Center in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Those who bemoan the fact that the national political
conventions are no longer where the real decisions get made suffer
a misplaced nostalgia for back room deals and cigar-chomping power
brokers. Richard J. Daley is dead; may he rest in peace.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that the early primaries have reduced modern
conventions to scripted party infomercials and well-oiled stage
productions, but there is value in a pep rally. It can ignite the
passions of those inside the hall who will hold the signs, stuff
the envelopes and get out the vote in November. It can engage the
imaginations of those watching at home who find fewer and fewer
reasons to vote with each election cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Lieberman understood the power of a pep rally. It was not
his grudging endorsement of affirmative action in an otherwise
lackluster speech that mattered nearly as much as the Connecticut
senator's simple boyish delight in finding himself _ the son of a
Jewish baker _ on the Democratic ticket as a vice presidential
candidate. His core message _ ``Is this a great country or what?''
_ resonated with any parent who ever beamed with pride at the
family's first college graduate, with any immigrant who ever
purchased his own home, with any child who ever won an elementary
school spelling bee.
</P>
<P>
   There will be time enough in the fall for voters to sort out the
many conflicts between Gore's views and Lieberman's more
conservative positions on affirmative action, school vouchers and
abortion rights. A pep rally is about presenting a unified front
against the opposing team.
</P>
<P>
   The man at the top of the ticket missed the moment entirely,
choosing to outline the specifics in his playbook instead of
singing a rousing chorus of the team's fight song. Sure, policy
should trump personality, and competence should count more than
charisma. Voters want and need to know how Gore would save Social
Security and Medicare. But not in August. Not while they are
watching TV in their vacation rental at the beach or at the lake.
</P>
<P>
   It is a mystery whom Gore thought he was connecting with the
other night with his talk of targeted tax cuts and budget
surpluses. Does he really think that there is a policy wonk bloc in
the crucial mid-Atlantic and Midwest swing states? The Republican
nominee's speech in Philadelphia _ written for him, not by him _
was short on specifics but long on evocations of the kind of
America he envisions. Won't it be ironic if Texas Governor George
W. Bush is the one to call Al Gore to account in this campaign for
his lack of ``the vision thing?''
</P>
<P>
   No one moment should cripple a campaign. No single speech should
define a candidate, but too often they do. Remember a stumbling Ted
Kennedy in 1980 unable to explain why he wanted to be president?
Remember a bloodless Michael Dukakis in 1988 unwilling to concede
that he would want to strangle anyone who raped and murdered his
wife?
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore is an accomplished debater, a skill that will highlight
his command of policy issues in the presidential debates Bush has
agreed to participate in this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Gore should have a humming economy on his side and an electorate
that, by any measure, is better off now than it was eight years ago
when the Clinton-Gore ticket reclaimed the White House for the
Democrats. His record outshines Bush on the issues that the
majority of voters consistently identify as the most important this
election year. On education, health care, and the environment, Bush
is vulnerable to charges that in Texas he has not done nearly
enough.
</P>
<P>
   Gore may yet prove to be a commanding presence at a campaign
podium. The Democrats can only hope that vacationing Americans went
out for a late movie Thursday night.

   In the six weeks after it opened July 1 at the St. Louis Art
Museum, the exhibit attracted 62,000 visitors. ``This already is
one of the top 10 attended shows in the past 10 years,'' said the
museum's director, Brent Benjamin, in a recent interview, ``and
it's not even two-thirds of the way through its run.''
</P>
<P>
   It continues through Sept. 24.
</P>
<P>
   It was Benjamin's idea to suspend the museum admission charge
during the run of ``Wonderland'' as a ``millennium gift to the
city.'' He also saw the free-entry policy as a way to encourage a
broad audience to experience contemporary art. Clearly it is having
the intended effect. The crowds also bear out the message Benjamin
says he's been picking up from St. Louisans: ``They want the museum
to challenge them.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the enjoyment of ``Wonderland'' is to watch museum
visitors young and old interacting with the exhibit's diverse
expressions.
</P>
<P>
   An audio piece by widely exhibited Canadian artist Janet Cardiff
requires viewers to strap on a pair of headphones and a pouch with
a portable CD player and head out of the museum for a walk on the
wooded grounds. On a hot August weekday, parents and children and
dozens of senior citizens gamely lined up for their turns, and
could be seen pausing along the path, per Cardiff's instructions,
to examine the fallen trees and vistas that caught the artist's
eye.
</P>
<P>
   Although it must be said that after 15 minutes of this,
Cardiff's voice begins to feel like a self-important gnat in the
ear, the experience is a memorable one. The exercise of squaring
and comparing one's own sensations and reflections of the walk with
Cardiff's account of the stroll she took several months earlier is
absorbing.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent telephone interview, the exhibit's curator, Rochelle
Steiner, said she ``set out to make a show that would have the
ability to operate on many levels'' _ to have something for both
the art specialist and the novice.
</P>
<P>
   Steiner, who came to the St. Louis Art Museum from the Walker
Art Center in Minneapolis in 1996, spent three years working on
``Wonderland.'' The exhibit ranks as one of the ``most ambitious
exhibitions of contemporary art in the museum's history,''
according to the accompanying catalog. Seven of the 10 pieces on
view are brand-new commissions for this show.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all addressing the idea of space, how space might be
organized and how we as viewers are affected by our space,''
Steiner said. ``Each makes a surrounding or an environment that
gives us this sense of wonder.''  &LR; brkhel:Stop, look, listen,
participate
</P>
<P>
   Although this international exhibit does not pretend to be a
survey of what's happening in contemporary art, it does pick up on
certain contemporary art trends. The artists exhibit a high degree
of inventiveness with materials, they embrace electronics and
digital technology, and they tend to cast viewers as active
participants in their works of art.
</P>
<P>
   Thematically most of the works cue off nature or architecture or
a combination of both.
</P>
<P>
   Danish-born Olafur Eliasson leads off the exhibit with a
20-foot-high geodesic dome he erected over the Neptune fountain in
the museum's main hall. Strobe lights illumine the dome's darkened,
mirrored interior, endowing the movements of perambulating viewers
with a jerky, stop-action quality. It's damp inside the dome from
the rushing water of the fountain _ and somewhat disorienting, due
to the pulsing lights and the kaleidoscopic effect of the
all-surrounding mirrors.
</P>
<P>
   Eliasson's dome typifies the spirit of this show: It contains
nothing overtly threatening or combative but carries just enough of
an edge to provoke new responses to the familiar.
</P>
<P>
   Entering the special exhibition galleries, even the most jaded
consumer of TV violence stops dead in their tracks at the spectacle
of a young woman, clad in a fetching blue frock and red shoes,
strolling in slow motion down an urban street and stopping
periodically to smash in the windows of parked cars.
</P>
<P>
   Put up to this mischief by Swiss video artist Pipilotti Rist,
the woman employs a metal facsimile of a long-stemmed ``red-hot
poker'' flower as her instrument of destruction and moves in time
to a seductive electronic soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time she is alone, but other pedestrians
occasionally appear in the frame. A policeman who sidles into the
picture provides a moment of tension, but relief comes when ``he''
turns out to be a she, who smiles at the ecstatic vandal and raises
her hand in salute before sauntering on.
</P>
<P>
   This urban ramble is the topic of one of two color videos by
Rist projected on adjacent walls. Tilting, twirling and
consummately sensuous views of the garden whence the ``flower''
weapon came make up the second projection and set up an underlying
nature//culture opposition within the work as a whole. But the
piece also percolates with new ideas about the old equation of
woman and nature and about the nature of woman's power.
</P>
<P>
   Like Rist, Ernesto Neto has enjoyed a good deal of exposure
recently in a long list of international biennials and other big
global shows. For ``Wonderland,'' the Brazilian artist created a
full gallery installation employing his signature nylon fabric,
which stretches tentlike across the ceiling and dips down in the
form of rounded stalactite ``columns'' filled with aromatic spices.
</P>
<P>
   In her selections for this show, Steiner didn't confine herself
to artists with big resumes. ``Wonderland'' serves as a
high-profile introduction for Minneapolis-based Bill Klaila, who
responded to the invitation with a piece called ``Virtual Bog.'' In
a darkened gallery filled with the sound of crickets chirping, the
artist has projected a digitized bog image onto the floor.
Periodically its surface shivers with the plop of virtual water
drops, activated by viewer footsteps.  &LR; brkhel:Reduced means,
heightened sensations
</P>
<P>
   Newark, N.J., artist Steven Hendee, who creates faceted
environments out of foam board and gaffer's tape, also gets a boost
from appearing in the international context of ``Wonderland.'' Some
have compared the feel of Hendee's luminous architectural
environments to cathedral interiors. But standing within his
``Abandon.exe'' is also like finding oneself physically occupying a
three-dimensional drawing.
</P>
<P>
   Hendee's piece exemplifies this exhibit's overall embrace of
reductiveness. The works here offer a real departure from
installations of the last decade that bombard the viewer with lots
of stuff, idiosyncratically organized.
</P>
<P>
   The shift is particularly obvious in German artist Gregor
Schneider's ``Totally Isolated Guest Room, ur 12,'' part of an
ongoing project that involves constructing, then excising and
exhibiting, rooms and passages in his house in Rheydt. At the
recent ``Carnegie International'' exhibit in Pittsburgh, Schneider
showed a cluttered and complex ensemble of rooms. In St. Louis, he
is represented by a simple four-walled space containing only a bed,
a radiator and a stool.
</P>
<P>
   In this same reductive vein, New York artist Teresita Fernandez
offers the equivalent of a three-dimensional minimalist painting in
her ``Landscape (Projected).'' Narrow PVC pipes form a maze pattern
on the floor of this austere lime-green-painted chamber, which the
artist illumined from above with a circular fluorescent light
fixture.
</P>
<P>
   The effect is otherworldly. While speaking the formal language
of abstraction, the piece takes its cues from formal gardens, and
viewers are free to meander within it.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles artist Jennifer Steinkamp takes abstraction into
four dimensions with her red-painted, X-shaped corridor with
rounded corners. The crossing pathways culminate in two narrow
vertical video projections featuring what appear to be perforated
rollers or psychedelic conveyor belts in motion. A clanky
mechanical soundtrack reinforces the factory allusion, while the
hypnotic visuals speak to contemporary art's unapologetic embrace
of beauty.
</P>
<P>
   The 10th and final piece, if one follows the route through the
exhibit traced by the accompanying handout, is a temporary farm,
created on the museum's grounds by Atelier Van Lieshout, a
collaborative founded by Joep van Lieshout of the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Although human in scale, the farm is modest in size, consisting
of several wood and aluminum structures including a tool shed, a
minimally equipped farmhouse, a rabbit hutch, a chicken coop, a hut
with pen for sheep and a low, curving shelter for pigs. There also
is a vegetable garden at the site, which was planted by local
schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   When temperatures permit, the animals are brought up daily from
the nearby zoo. When fully stocked, the farm features chickens,
roosters, sheep and rabbits.
</P>
<P>
   Viewed through the art lens, one is struck by how alluringly
basic and no-nonsense this setup is, and by its total immersion in
questions of practical design rather than style. ON EXHIBIT THE

<HEADLINE>
FIFTY YEARS OF FANTASY:AT 80, BRADBURY'S STILL THE MASTER OF
SCIENCE FICTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 JOHN MARK EBERHART  
 c. 2000 The Kansas City Star   Ray Bradbury has lived long enough
to see the future _ and to see some of his own writings come true.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The master of science fiction, fantasy, the supernatural and
many other genres celebrated his 80th birthday Aug. 22, but dreams
and imagination have kept him young.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I'm about 12 years old,'' Bradbury said in a
recent telephone interview from his Los Angeles home. ``I'm getting
my work done, and that's the important thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, despite having penned such classics as Fahrenheit 451
and The Martian Chronicles, Bradbury is at work on two novels, a
book of essays, a poetry collection and a screenplay. The novels
include From the Dust Returned, which features a family of vampires
introduced in his short stories in the early 1940s, about the same
time Anne Rice was born.
</P>
<P>
   Rice's ``Vampire Chronicles'' are among the many modern works
derivative of Bradbury. Author Lucius Shepard's blend of science
fiction and fantasy probably couldn't exist without him. Even TV
shows such as ``The X-Files'' owe him a debt, with their focus on
what may _ or may not _ be ``out there.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Bradbury, though, life in the
once-futuristic-sounding and now-real year of 2000 has its pros and
cons. Here is a man who has made an uneasy truce with modern
society _ a society he helped create.  &LR; brk:Burning questions
</P>
<P>
   In 1951 Bradbury published Fahrenheit 451, a grim vision of a
future in which books were burned to prohibit the spread of
dangerous ideas. The novel's ``firemen'' were charged with keeping
the bland citizenry from reading things that weren't good for them
_ indeed, to prevent reading of any kind.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they immersed themselves in technology that is now
commonplace: They wore ``seashell'' ear pieces that pumped music
into their heads. Giant, interactive TV screens filled four walls
of their living rooms with insipid programming.
</P>
<P>
   Sound familiar? Now we call the seashells Walkmans. We dive into
``virtual reality'' devices, including home theater systems that
can make seeing movies in the family room seem like a religious
experience.
</P>
<P>
   Bradbury reflects on how elements of Fahrenheit 451 have come
true.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Japanese claim I invented the seashell radio you put in
your ear. They came to my office about 20 years ago and they had
one of the first of the portable earphone devices and they clapped
it on my head and they cried, `Fahrenheit four five one! Fahrenheit
four five one!'
</P>
<P>
   ``But (Walkmans) have improved life in some ways. At the beach,
for example, people would show up with their ghetto blasters and
rule the day, but now we have the earphones you put on, and life is
much quieter.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the virtual reality people call me Papa. They say they
read it in the (short story) `The Veldt' and they read it in
Fahrenheit, then they created it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradbury concedes, though, that such things can do exactly what
they did in the novel: Cut people off from one another and provide
the mind with empty diversions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends how it's used. If you use it for `Jeopardy,' you're
in trouble, because that's stupid. But there are documentaries
concerning the history of the world and its peoples that are quite
wonderful, which didn't used to be available on TV or anywhere
else, and they've all come on the market in the last 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   He sees computers as useful but views the constant marketing and
updating as suspect.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst development is the power struggle of the computer
people, the Internet people and the email people to get you to use
things you may not need.'' Sci fi or fantasy?
</P>
<P>
   ``The World's Greatest Living Science Fiction Writer'': Decades
ago, publishers of Bradbury's works began to paste this audacious
phrase across his book covers.
</P>
<P>
   And yet he concedes only one of his novels was unadulterated
science fiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, sure, I don't write science fiction; I write fantasy. I've
only written one science fiction novel, and that's Fahrenheit. The
Martian Chronicles is fantasy. My books about my childhood,
Dandelion Wine and Something Wicked This Way Comes, are pure
fantasy.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, more than the ``hard science'' fiction of
contemporaries like Isaac Asimov or Arthur C. Clarke, Bradbury's
Martian Chronicles (1950), put the romance in space flight. It
fired the imaginations of the scientists who birthed the Space Age
only a decade later.
</P>
<P>
   Bradbury's Mars stories worked because they were about people,
not machines, as noted in The Encyclopedia of Fantasy, edited by
John Clute and John Grant:
</P>
<P>
   ``The planet's habitable terrain is not scientific, and the
Earth civilization that settles it is locked into a
mid-20th-century middle-American mindset seemingly untouched by
technological advance. ... The collection succeeds marvelously as a
fantasia on the immutability of human nature, its individual
episodes being linked by recurring images of sacrifice and
loneliness.''
</P>
<P>
   Alas, 50 years after Bradbury's collection, humans still haven't
walked the face of Mars, and his disappointment is palpable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll get up there, but it's taking a long time. We should
have stayed on the moon and used it as a base and then moved on to
Mars. But most politicians in Washington have no concept of space
travel. There are very few who care about it. Now that the Cold War
is over, we don't have pressure from Russia. I wish China would
announce plans of going to Mars. That would immediately galvanize
us and we would move to beat them.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I've seen a lot of good things. Landing on the moon was
the greatest event in the history of the world, and it was
wonderful to be alive when the greatest thing that ever happened
happened.''  &LR; brk:Society's growing pains
</P>
<P>
   Bradbury may think of himself as but an overgrown boy, and as an
optimist. But he emphasizes that, if we are to flourish in the
future, we must work for change.
</P>
<P>
   His grumbles range from the pedestrian to the political.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, one of his classic short stories, ``The Pedestrian,''
seems more relevant than ever, even after half a century. In that
story, a lone walker struggled against a vehicle-obsessed society
in which walking was viewed as deranged. In our world, the
omnipresence of automobiles puts pedestrians and bicyclists at an
extreme disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get in the way. You're an obstruction. Especially if
you're on a bicycle; it's very dangerous now,'' said Bradbury, a
cyclist who now only rides ``out in the desert,'' not in L.A.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got too many cars, and the driver of a car is a samurai
warrior; he expects instant obedience from everyone else. ... The
fastest we could go until a hundred years ago was on a horse. Now
the aesthetic of speed has taken over and anything that interferes
with that is an irritation.''
</P>
<P>
   As for politics, he thinks it's absurd.
</P>
<P>
   ``The campaign has gone on for a year now, which is ridiculous.
We've been screaming and yelling and jumping up and down for 13
months. That's too long. Everyone would be delighted if Bush and
Gore came on TV and said, `We're not going to have any more
speeches or debates or anything for two solid months; we'll give
you a rest.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But if there is one thing he wants improved, it's America's
educational system, which he said is failing. Fortunately, he
opines, both political parties are talking a good game this year.
Now if they'll only back it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now ... we're bringing up a nation of morons.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradbury can't help seeing the irony: Way back in Fahrenheit
451, he wrote about the dangers of censorship, but ...
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you don't teach reading and writing, you don't have to
have censorship. You don't have to burn books because nobody will
read them.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet he keeps writing, and thus believes that someone will be
around to enjoy books. He's just finishing From the Dust Returns,
which will be published for Halloween 2001.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds like great fun: The main character is Timothy, who was
the rather ordinary boy in a family of supernatural creatures in
``The Homecoming,'' the first story in Bradbury's first book,
1947's Dark Carnival.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't wait to finish it. It's taken me 55 years.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a long time, to be sure. As Bradbury fans know, though,
he's usually worth the wait.

<P>
   Al Gore may have given the speech of his life accepting his
party's nomination last week. But he avoided mentioning the
elephant in the room: the impeachment of President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Gore seems to be running away from this fact as fast as he can.
He must think that it's nothing but a loser for him. But this is an
issue he should exploit, albeit artfully and with tact.
</P>
<P>
   For a lesson in such implied criticism, Gore should study the
Republicans. They have mastered the art of talking about
impeachment _ without talking about impeachment. At their
convention in Philadelphia, the Republicans never once mentioned
the word. But it was there in code. ``After all of the shouting and
all of the scandal,'' Gov. George W. Bush said in his acceptance
speech, ``we can begin again.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush and the other Republicans repeatedly reminded viewers of
Clinton's behavior, without once mentioning the other half of the
equation _ the House impeachment gang of Henry Hyde, Bob Barr, Asa
Hutchinson and others. These congressmen attended their party's
convention, but television viewers never saw so much as their
shadows.
</P>
<P>
   And Bush, knowing that the harshness of the impeachment drive
had turned off a vast majority of Americans, wanted it known that
he and Dick Cheney, his running mate, have had nothing to do with
the partisanship in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Gore now needs to use the issue of impeachment to his advantage.
Selecting Joseph Lieberman as his running mate helps distance him
from Clinton, since the senator strongly criticized the president
at the height of the Monica Lewinsky scandal. And Gore, in his
acceptance speech, further implied that he would never sully the
Oval Office. ``I will work for you every day,'' he said, ``and I
will never let you down.''
</P>
<P>
   But separating himself from Clinton is only half the equation.
Gore (or his surrogates) must gently remind voters about the
fierceness and the arrogance with which both Kenneth Starr, the
independent counsel, and the House Republicans pursued the
president.
</P>
<P>
   Such a reminder, made implicitly rather than openly, would in no
way violate Gore's pledge to run a positive campaign. After all, if
Bush can tar Gore with Clinton's private sins and his efforts to
conceal them, then Gore can fairly remind voters about the public
sins of the House Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   For partisan gain, they refused to heed the people's desire to
move beyond the scandal and they recklessly endangered the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment of Bill Clinton is arguably the most important
and traumatic political event of the last two decades. It is simply
a disservice to voters for Democrats to let the Republicans get
away with their not-so-veiled attacks.

<P>
   NAPA, Calif. _ Will we never learn? As the Firestone tire recall
gives rise to a national storm of fear and blame, I fall into a
funk of deja vu. I've been here before, terrified by defective
products, seeing evidence of corporate callousness, and hearing the
inevitable righteous cries for change.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, I stood huddled with three terrified children and
another mother on the shoulder of Interstate 5 in California's
Central Valley, all of us shaking as we stared at a 16-inch tear in
the wall of the Firestone tire that had blown out, almost killing
us. I felt shock and rage as I learned, at the gas station we
limped to, that this tire was notorious for failing. I found later
that the accidents were often precisely like ours: a blowout in the
rear left tire of a Ford station wagon.
</P>
<P>
   Galvanized by a mother's fury, I wrote a magazine article on the
Firestone 500 tire that spurred, in 1978, congressional hearings
and the largest tire recall in American history. Firestone, nearly
bankrupt, was saved with a buyout by the Japanese tiremaker
Bridgestone.
</P>
<P>
   Reading about the current case _ Firestone's recall of 6.5
million tires on Aug. 9, six months of growing complaints and
lawsuits, and a federal investigation _ makes me remember the
lessons of 1978. The Firestone 500 case taught me that too often it
takes needless deaths to rouse us to anger and make us demand
reform.
</P>
<P>
   It takes images like the tangled wreck of a Texas couple's Ford
Explorer in 1997 to force the class actions, federal investigations
and congressional hearings that lead to the recalls and repairs _
of regulations, as well as of manufacturing practices.
</P>
<P>
   But unless the lessons penetrate deeply into a corporation's
memory and conscience _ its DNA _ human frailty and expediency will
likely prevail again. Now, there are complaints that 62 deaths are
linked to failures of Firestone tires on Ford Explorers, and this
has again turned a simmering problem into a scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the 41 deaths attributed to the Firestone 500 by
government investigators were 14,000 complaints from disgruntled
tire owners, their trunks full of failed, ripped, blown 500's _
like me, alive by luck. Now, as in that scandal, drivers have
complained, and dangers were known but not acted on quickly enough.
</P>
<P>
   The 500 was the product of a hidebound industry adapting
antiquated equipment and mindsets to try to catch the wave of
steel-belted radials sweeping in from Italy's technologically
superior Michelin. Firestone has had 22 years to improve the
manufacture of steel-belted tires, and today's parallels alarm me.
</P>
<P>
   I see the same corporate smokescreen, made even more dense by
the symbiotic involvement of two companies. Proof does not come to
light because confidentiality is often the condition of the
settlements that grieving families choose over the prolonged pain
of a trial, though it is in the courtroom that evidence can be
exposed and the finger of guilt pointed publicly by a jury.
</P>
<P>
   I also see the same old tire-industry culture that perpetuates
low technology, the same blame-the-consumer attitude, the same
penny-pinching prorated tire replacement policies. And, above all,
the same willingness to let cascading reports of dangerous problems
pile up. Even as Ford was replacing the suspect tires on its
Explorers in overseas markets last year, the problems were kept
from the American public.
</P>
<P>
   As Ford tries to focus the heat on Firestone, as Firestone
argues that Ford and its customers trade safety for the smoother
ride of underinflated tires, the basic issue must not be obscured:
Firestone tires are failing. The results, given the tendency of
sport utility vehicles, like the Ford Explorer, to roll over in
highway blowouts, are even more lethal than those from the
Firestone 500.
</P>
<P>
   As the machines in our lives fail more rarely, consumers have
shifted their vigilance and cries of concern to issues of communal
well-being like the health of watersheds and salmon stocks. But
there are still failures in products, too, and they must not go
unpunished, unfixed or unremembered.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Does a populist appeal have resonance in prosperous
times? In his acceptance speech at the Democratic convention, Al
Gore defined the difference between Republicans and Democrats in
strict populist terms. ``They're for the powerful, we're for the
people,'' he declared.
</P>
<P>
   This appeal, if updated, can be effective, even when people are
doing well economically. One commentator compared Gore to William
Jennings Bryan, the firebrand of 1896, but the proper comparison is
with Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Bryan's populism was the politics
of an embattled minority, the last cry of Western small farmers.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1930s, Roosevelt revived populism as a majority politics
of the new urban working class. By identifying Democrats with the
common man and Republicans with the ``economic royalists,''
Roosevelt and his successors controlled Congress for 44 of the next
48 years and won eight of 12 presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   The constituency for Roosevelt's populism has not disappeared,
but it became bitterly divided after 1964, largely as a result of
civil rights struggles and the birth of the new left.
</P>
<P>
   Under Ronald Reagan, Republicans were able to create a new
conservative majority by combining their well-to-do base with
disenchanted white Democrats in the South and Midwest who blamed
Democrats for their falling incomes and for rising crime rates.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton's political achievement has been to revive the
perception that Democrats represent the people while the
Republicans represent special interests and the wealthy. Clinton
did this by forcing Democrats to abandon the post-1960s attitude on
crime and welfare that had turned off these swing voters in the
first place.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore now has an opportunity to build on what Clinton has
achieved _ to restore in full the older populist majority, but not
on exactly the same terms as Roosevelt did.
</P>
<P>
   America's ``common man'' has changed: he _ and she _ are more
likely white-collar than blue-collar and more likely to live in
suburbs than cities. And this populist majority, for the most part,
doesn't want government expansion. These voters want to preserve
existing social programs like Social Security and Medicare, and
they want new, but modest, programs to help their families thrive
in the new economy. But they are skeptical of large-scale programs
that could lead to higher taxes.
</P>
<P>
   What they fear is that government will become more responsive to
the powerful rather than to them _ a fear evidenced in the
popularity of maverick politicians like Ross Perot and John McCain
and in the continuing support for campaign finance reform. Gore
seems to understand this. His acceptance speech was long on
defending his own modest initiatives against the threat of ``big
tobacco, big oil, the big polluters, the pharmaceutical companies,
the HMOs.''
</P>
<P>
   His populism could also help where he needs it most, in
energizing the Democratic base and attracting swing voters in
battleground states of the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   As Ruy Teixeira and Joel Rogers demonstrate in their book,
``America's Forgotten Majority,'' these swing voters don't live in
Cleveland's upscale Shaker Heights, but in neighboring Lorain
County. They are middle-income whites, most of whom have not
graduated from college. Once Democrats, they backed Reagan in 1980
and 1984, but gravitated to Clinton and Perot in 1992 and 1996.
They have proved responsive to a populism directed at special
interests.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, in the Lorain County district now represented by
the Democrat Sherrod Brown, Reagan won by 19 percent in 1984. But
in 1992, Clinton won 38 percent of the vote; Bush, 35 percent; and
Perot, 27 percent. In 1996, Clinton won 46 percent; Bob Dole, 39
percent; and Perot, 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   It was because of the shift away from the GOP among these voters
that Clinton took Ohio and Michigan, as well as Missouri and
Pennsylvania, in the last two elections.
</P>
<P>
   Gore begins at a certain disadvantage with these voters, who may
be put off by his sometimes aloof manner. But a populist approach
could help him overcome his lack of personal appeal. He might not
convince these voters that he is a more relaxed guy than his
opponent, but if he can convince them that he is on their side and
that Bush is not, he may well be the next president.

 By WILLIAM E. ODOM    
 c.2000 New York Times    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Russian submarine disaster in the Barents Sea
has been more than a human tragedy. It has also been a test of the
true character of President Vladimir Putin and his senior military.
Judging just by their arrogant public handling of the crisis in its
first days, he and his commanders have again confirmed the worst.
</P>
<P>
   As the news first unfolded, the commanders issued conflicting
accounts of the sinking of the Kursk submarine, and for days Putin
issued no statement at all. Although we still don't know the
details of what caused the disaster, we do know enough about the
context to speculate about the larger implications.
</P>
<P>
   The rundown state of the Russian military is no surprise. For
years there have been revelations about suicides in the military
ranks, cruel abuses of first-year conscripts and corruption in the
senior officer corps. The Committee of Russian Soldiers' Mothers
bravely collects and publishes such information in the face of the
military's hostility.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, generals and admirals complain that Russian
youths are insufficiently patriotic and that the defense budget is
too low. As officers skim off money for personal gain, unit
training and weapons maintenance as well as procurement of new arms
are woefully neglected. Not only are most of the ships in poor
repair, but many sailors and junior officers have rarely or maybe
never been at sea.
</P>
<P>
   Why then did the admirals risk launching a large, complex naval
exercise in the Barents Sea?
</P>
<P>
   The answer may lie in the Russian navy's competition with the
land-based nuclear strategic forces for scarce resources. The power
struggle began as a result of Boris Yeltsin's half-hearted effort
to reform the military.
</P>
<P>
   Under Yeltsin, it was a two-sided fight between the strategic
nuclear forces and the conventional ground forces over who controls
all the services and over budget priorities. Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev had the advantage under Yeltsin. He created an independent
command for the land-based nuclear rockets, bought new long-range
ballistic missiles and cut the conventional forces. More recently,
the chief of the general staff, Anatoli Kvashnin, a commander in
the first war in Chechnya, seemed to be making a comeback for the
conventional forces.
</P>
<P>
   Under Putin, however, the struggle has become three-sided.
Inspired by his rhetoric about being a world-class naval power, the
admirals insist that their missile-equipped submarines, rather than
the land-based rocket forces, should be Russia's main nuclear
deterrent.
</P>
<P>
   In late July, the quarrel between Sergeyev and Kvashnin became
conspicuously public. Putin let them abuse each other in the media
for several days before a security council meeting on Aug. 11 when
he reportedly imposed a compromise between the nuclear rocket
forces and the conventional forces.
</P>
<P>
   Then word leaked out that he had given the navy an edge over the
land-based rockets, which would be reduced and eventually folded
into the air forces. The large exercise in the Barents Sea is
likely related to the infighting. Ready or not, the commanders of
submarines and ships may have been determined to demonstrate their
capabilities to reassure Putin.
</P>
<P>
   This interservice strife is largely of Putin's making. Last
November he began talking about the navy's role in reviving Russia
as a great power, and in recent remarks to naval personnel in
Kaliningrad, he repeated that line. Putin has also sought to
reassure the ground forces, beginning in the spring of 1999 with
his support of its plans for an invasion of Chechnya. As the war
boosted his popularity in the presidential race, he promised more
money to the ground forces.
</P>
<P>
   Although the costs of the war in Chechnya greatly exceeded
expectations, the president continued his rhetoric about Russia's
great-power status. Encouraging the expectations of both the
admirals and the ground-forces generals, he also signed the new
national security doctrine that appeared to give priority to the
strategic rocket forces.
</P>
<P>
   Little wonder the generals and admirals have been ebullient
about Putin. They were unable to avoid the huge cuts in the
Gorbachev and Yeltsin eras, and for nearly 15 years, they have
hoped that eventually the military would again take first place in
devouring the state budget.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether Putin can provide money as well as the
moral support. Russia's regional governors are already warning him
that he cannot use their tax money for that purpose. Alternatively,
he might purge scores of senior officers, as opposed to a token
few, and make the military live within the state's means. This
seems unlikely. How is he to assert control over the regions,
collect more taxes and break the influence of the oligarchs without
military support?
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, his popularity is now at stake. Although most Russians
want him to reduce crime and cut corruption, soldiers' mothers,
fathers and wives do not share his affection for the military and
secret police. The tragedy of the Kursk and Putin's brazen reaction
to it are bound to reinforce their dislike of the military and may
also hurt his highly favorable public opinion ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the technical causes of the sinking of the Kursk, the
event confronts Putin with a political crisis. His allies in the
military clearly helped him come to power, and this leaves the
Russian president with some very difficult choices.

 &HT;    The best laid plans . . .

<TEXT>
<P>
   SANDWICH, Mass. _ ``Come on over to the Cape,'' Gail insisted,
``and we'll have a working holiday. Mornings, I'll paint while you
write. Afternoons, we'll go to the gym. Then, it's cocktails on the
patio and evenings free to do whatever welike.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounded like a perfect plan. We should have known better.
</P>
<P>
   The first morning neither of us stirred before eight, and
breakfast beside the kitchen window took forever - birds to watch
and ideas to swap. It was after nine before we made our way to her
study.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are you doing with that canoe paddle?'' I ask across the
desk my hostess has so kindly deeded over to me for the duration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beach scene,'' she answers from the other side of her work
table. ``What areyou doing?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking for my glasses. I've searched my luggage twice but no
luck.Probably left them at home beside the hammock,'' I confess.
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted, we call a one-hour eyeglass place over in Hyannis
that assures us all will soon be well. If I'll give them the name
of my eye doctor back in Ohio, they'll ask him to fax a copy of my
prescription. I drive over, pick out frames, and before I can say
``astigmatism'' they'll have me back among the sighted and working.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sounds too good to be true,'' I mutter to Gail as wehead for
the car.
</P>
<P>
   It was. Nothing involving distance, electronics, and more than
two humans, is ever simple. ``Your doctor's office is closed on
Wednesday,'' the man with the pinstripe suit and too-long
fingernails informs me after we have fought 12 miles of tourist
traffic on Route 6 to get to his One-Hour Eyeglass place.
Hesuggests we try again the next day. I want to suggest he get a
manicure.
</P>
<P>
   Thwarted in an earnest attempt to work, Gail and I decide to
make the best of an otherwise wasted day by wheeling into Sam
Diego's for burritos, beans, and a margarita or two as we rethink
our game plan.
</P>
<P>
   Getting such a late start could be counter-productive, so rather
than risk it, we head for the local video store where 30 minutes
later we discover there's not a thing in the entire New Release
section that sounds the least bit Interesting. Gail says it's
because the generation gap has left us with an aversion to green
hair and machine guns.
</P>
<P>
   Through a process of elimination, our only hope seems to be a
Tom Cruise thing called ``Magnolia.'' We'd much prefer something
with Redford or Newman,but we've seen all of their stuff so many
times we can recite the dialogue. That explains how we came to get
stuck with one of the worst pieces of celluloid ever to click its
way out of Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   It was awful watching a bunch of uglied-up folks snorting white
powder up their runny noses and living out any sensible person's
worst nightmares. And the writers, assuming there really were any,
seemed to have been so fascinatedwith their discovery of the ``F''
word they used it twice in every sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Tom, the guy we paid the bucks to see, spends the whole film in
serious need of an attitude adjustment and a shampoo. What's worse,
the whole thing makes no sense- even before it starts raining frogs
- literally. And it runs THREE HOURS with Jason Robards taking the
entire time to die.
</P>
<P>
   So much for Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, we're pretty sure, will be a much more creative day,
but just in case the guy with the fingernails doesn't come through,
we have an alternate plan - scratch the gym and take a boat to
Nantucket.
</P>
<P>
   We'll call it research.

 &HT;    
 By SUSAN WELSH 
 (Color art is available.) 
 From W magazine 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    ``Sex-crazed homewrecker'' is not exactly the description that
comes to mind when one thinks of Joan Allen, an actress who has
brought sexual repression to a new level of artistry.
 &HT;    Yet in her new movie, ``The Contender,'' she portrays Sen. Laine
Hanson, a politician who is first seen in flagrante delicto on her
desk and is later accused of committing adultery with her best
friend's husband.
 &HT;    More damning still, she's said to have engaged in carnal
shenanigans that would make Monica Lewinsky look like Rebecca of
Sunnybrook Farm.
 &HT;    Early in the film, Hanson, an Ohio Democrat, is asked by the
president (played by Jeff Bridges) to take the office of vice
president after the death of the incumbent. But in a plot twist
laden with allusions to the Hill-Thomas hearings and the Clinton
scandal, her enemy, a powerful Republican congressman (Gary Oldman,
looking very unlike himself), dredges up some eye-popping sex
photos from her past.
 &HT;    Writer-director Rod Lurie began work on ``The Contender'' at the
height of the Lewinsky affair, and he wanted to comment on an
aspect of it that he thought was being overlooked.
 &HT;    ``I told my wife,'' he recalls, ''`Clinton is going to get away
with this, because he's a man, and because we don't have many
negative feelings about male sexuality. But female sexuality is a
totally different story.'''
 &HT;    For Allen, the role offered an opportunity to break the glass
ceiling that has hovered over her career. Over breakfast on a hazy,
sweltering New York morning, the willowy 45-year-old actress,
looking cool and self-possessed in a simple sleeveless black dress,
sums up the role's appeal: ``Instead of being married to the
senator, I am the senator.''
 &HT;    Despite being one of the most highly regarded actresses in
Hollywood, she has, until now, played mostly wives _ but wives who
are singularly good at hiding roiling passion beneath a placid,
controlled exterior.
 &HT;    She won Best Supporting Actress nominations for her turn as a
loyal but sexually frustrated Pat Nixon in Oliver Stone's epic
``Nixon,'' and the following year for playing a Puritan whose
bottled-up ardor drives Daniel Day-Lewis astray in ``The
Crucible.''
 &HT;    Allen's uncanny ability to convey raw emotion without emoting
may make her the ideal choice for a film that tests the somewhat
hazy American boundary between the public and the private. And as
it happens, Lurie dreamed up ``The Contender'' expressly as a
vehicle for her.
 &HT;    In 1998, when Allen won a best supporting actress award from the
L.A. Film Critics Association for playing a love-starved June
Cleaver clone in ``Pleasantville,'' Lurie, a former critic who
describes himself as ``an obsessed fan of Joan's,'' asked if he
could present it to her.
 &HT;    Extemporizing at the podium, he found himself saying, ``I should
write a movie for Joan Allen, because if Joan agrees to do it, then
it's going to be a good movie.''
 &HT;    During the dinner that followed, Allen expressed genuine
interest in the idea, and shortly afterward, Lurie began work on a
screenplay.
 &HT;    ``I had no clue what I was going to write _ not the vaguest
idea,'' he says. ``I knew that I had one mission, and that was to
write a character to which Joan Allen could not say no.''
 &HT;    Allen, who researched the role by watching tapes of Gerald
Ford's confirmation hearings and by spending time with Arkansas
Sen. Blanche Lincoln, says she connected with Laine Hanson's core
of integrity.
 &HT;    ``It's what you would like politics to be if it really worked,''
she says, while acknowledging that ``the character is not
completely lifelike.''
 &HT;    Indeed, Hanson is almost a fairy-tale liberal: She is pro-choice
and pro-campaign finance reform, wants the death penalty abolished,
thinks all guns should be confiscated and believes that selling
cigarettes to minors should be a federal offense. Oh, and she's an
avowed atheist.
 &HT;    But unlike some of her celebrity neighbors on New York's
famously liberal Upper West Side _ where she maintains a low
profile with her husband, actor Peter Friedman, and their
6-year-old daughter, Sadie _ Allen prefers to keep her own views
private.
 &HT;    ``Rod is the political animal, and I'm the actor,'' she says.
``He wrote the part that way, and I did it.'' She herself would
``never, ever, ever'' want to run for office. ``That's why it was
so fun to play a politician,'' she says, ``because it's so
antithetical to my nature.''
 &HT;    Early press screenings had Oscar-watchers buzzing about Allen's
strong shot at a statuette. Allen remains wary of the hype, but she
confesses that when the movie was picked up for distribution by
DreamWorks, her heart beat a little faster.
 &HT;    ``I knew how much they were going to back it,'' she says, ``and
I had a moment like, `God, this could really change me.' I sort of
panicked, quietly. I said to my husband, `I like to take the
subway. I like taking the bus. I'm kind of anonymous!' But I've
sort of calmed down about that now.''

 &HT;    CHER'S LATEST VENTURE
 &HT;    
 &HT;    She sings, she acts _ and now she makes jewelry. Cher is hard at
work on a new jewelry line that will be in stores by November.
 &HT;    The collection, called ``Cher for Loree Rodkin,'' includes long
earrings, necklaces and bracelets; platinum, gold and silver, and
lots of beads and stones.
 &HT;    As with the vanity cases that Sharon Stone's designing for Louis
Vuitton, a percentage of the profits will go to charity _ in Cher's
case, the Facial Foundation for Disfigured Children, the cause she
took up during the making of the film ``Mask.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    IMAN'S AIDS STANCE
 &HT;    
 &HT;    ``AIDS is not over. Our children remain at great risk. Every
hour of every day, two American adolescents are infected with
HIV.''
 &HT;    These words are from the model Iman, who has signed on as
celebrity spokeswoman for Mothers' Voices, a nonprofit group
focused on educating parents and teachers on AIDS issues as they
affect youth.
 &HT;    Sheryl Schwartz, wife of Calvin Klein Inc. vice chairman Barry
Schwartz, serves as chairwoman of the group, which also receives
financial and logistical support from Calvin Klein.
 &HT;    ``As parents, we all want to protect our children and given them
the skills they need to live a sexually healthy life,'' Iman added.
 &HT;    This fall, the organization plans to extend its workshop series,
which aims to teach parents how to seize ``teachable moments'' to
explain to their children the facts about the disease _ from its
New York headquarters to Atlanta, Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles,
Miami and Providence, R.I.
 &HT;    The group also plans to host a full-day workshop titled
``Parenting in the Age of AIDS'' this October in New York for the
parents of children attending public schools.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    BRITNEY'S ONLINE LATHER
 &HT;    
 &HT;    It seems that Clairol is taking its association with new
spokeswoman Britney Spears to a new level. Not only is the company
sponsoring Spears' summer concert tour, it's also garnering new
listeners for the teen queen with a promotional pack available on
CVS.com.
 &HT;    The set includes full-sized bottles of Clairol's Herbal Essences
Shampoo and Conditioner for normal/oily hair and a Spears sampler
CD for $8.99.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    POWER LUNCHERS
 &HT;    NEW YORK _ ``Men already run the world,'' said Susan Estrich,
the first woman to run a presidential campaign _ Michael Dukakis' _
and the author of an upcoming book, ``Sex and Power.'' She said
it's up to women ``to recognize the power they have,'' be proud of
it and use it.
 &HT;    Estrich, who spoke to about 60 women at Harper's Bazaar's recent
``power luncheon'' at the Alain Ducasse restaurant, pointed out
that one of the most powerful women was sitting right in the room _
Barbara Walters. She cited Walters' refusal to have O.J. Simpson on
her show, ``The View,'' which drew applause from the audience.
 &HT;    ``I do not have power,'' Walters called out, to which the crowd
exhibited some disbelief _ especially since Walters is negotiating
a reported $12 million contract with ABC.
 &HT;    Other heavy hitters who came out to celebrate Bazaar's August
``power'' issue included Tina Brown, Maria Bartiromo, Kate Spade,
Diane Von Furstenberg, Lesley Stahl, Carolina Herrera, Aerin
Lauder, Josie Natori and Dana Buchman.
 &HT;    The luncheon was hosted by Kate Betts, Bazaar's editor in chief,
and Cynthia Lewis, vice president and publisher.
 &HT;    Bartiromo, an anchor for CNBC whose staggering schedule left
some in the room breathless, said her idea of power is not having
lots of assistants and delegating.
 &HT;    ``I make my own phone calls and in many cases, I'm a one-woman
show,'' said Bartiromo, who does three live shows a day. ``For me,
power is not delegating. It's getting the story right and getting
it first and putting it on the air before it's disseminated.''

 By ROXANNE ROBINSON 
 (Three color slides are available.) 
 From WWD 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    NEW YORK _ Forget Miss Manners' hard-and-fast rules about never
wearing white before Memorial Day or after Labor Day. White denim
is fast becoming a seasonless fabric, and manufacturers are
offering it into holiday.
 &HT;    At Calvin Klein, white denim with a ``destructed'' finish was a
huge part of summer 2000, and it's returning for holiday 2000-2001.
 &HT;    Nautica Jeans is also pushing white forward for holiday, giving
it a subtle ecru tinge finished with beige stitching and western
detailing.
 &HT;    Paulette McReady, president of Nautica Enterprises, said that
while designers typically use black as a base color for holiday
collections, the switch to white was simply a way to offer the
customer something different.
 &HT;    ``It's fresh and new to see white in wintertime,'' she says.
``Having whites and creams in wintertime is one of those unexpected
things.''
 &HT;    She also noted that putting out white versions of items that
have sold well during past holiday seasons _ for example, leather
pants _ makes it possible for shoppers to pick up something they
don't already have in their closets.
 &HT;    As is the case with stonewashes, dark rinses and black denim,
white has become a basic that many jeans makers are keeping in
their collections, regardless of the season.
 &HT;    ``White is really expanding and growing in importance,'' said
Maggie Winkel, women's merchandise manager for the Levi's brand.
``We used to do it for a few short months, but now we offer it for
eight to nine months _ starting in November and December with
holiday and going all the way through July.''
 &HT;    While they aren't offering it for fall, Winkel said that they
are considering doing so in the future. She also noted that the
company reevaluated its ``white standard'' about 1 1/2 years ago
and is now offering what she describes as ``a cleaner, more optic
white.''

 By ANNMARIE DODD 
 From WWD 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Tiger Woods has already printed his name in golf's record books;
his British Open victory made him the youngest player to complete
golf's career Grand Slam.
 &HT;    His impact on fashion, however, and the aesthetic of his
namesake Nike Golf apparel line are just starting to break out from
behind his black-and-red-on-Sundays signature.
 &HT;    Not even Nike's marketing brawn could have picked a better time
than spring 2000 to relaunch a collection in the summer Tiger won
both the U.S. and British Opens.
 &HT;    For Nike, the Tiger Woods Collection is positioned as the most
upmarket component of the company's overall $1.3 billion apparel
offerings. And like the golfer, the Tiger Woods Collection has
grown up, focusing on better-quality fabrics and more sophisticated
silhouettes and colors.
 &HT;    And for most, Tiger's accomplishments and popularity signal the
promise and reign of golf's next generation.
 &HT;    ``Tiger's impact on society and culture is phenomenal,'' said
Stuart Scott, an anchor for ESPN'S SportsCenter. ``People who don't
know about golf, and those who don't care about golf, they care and
they watch Tiger.
 &HT;    ``His attention to fashion goes with his respect for the game,''
Scott said. ``He is one of the most impeccably dressed golfers on
the tour. Even his Sunday thing, the black and loud red, has become
muted. To me, this is a sign of his maturity.''
 &HT;    Golf retailers, too, have taken careful notice. According to
Mark Sanchez, vice-president of merchandise for American Golf
Corporation, which operates 325 private and public golf facilities,
the Tiger Woods Collection will vault to one of the top three
apparel resources in AGC-operated shops by year's end.
 &HT;    Stuart Lucas, CEO of the 24-unit mall-based Golf America, is
bullish on the line.
 &HT;    ''(The Tiger Woods Collection) is so much better than it was two
years ago; Tiger is so much better than he was two years ago,''
Lucas said. ``Both things are happening at the same time and it's
super for business. He's such a dynamic personality, and he looks
fabulous in clothes.''
 &HT;    Asked how the Tiger Collection was checking, Lucas said, ``Our
stores average 1,700 square feet, so how we allocate our square
footage is very important. If you're not performing, we may take a
pass on you next season. We're not taking a pass on Nike Golf.''
 &HT;    And Woods' line from Nike isn't only for the democratic
demographic. The Tiger Woods Collection will debut next month at
the venerable Congressional Country Club in Bethesda, Md.
 &HT;    ``Our members can't stop talking about him,'' said Darcy Ryan,
Congressional's lead merchandiser. ``I believe the line is a
classic look, but it's still youthful enough to appeal to our
younger members. Before this current season, it just didn't seem
classic and traditional enough. And those are the big buzz words
around here.''
 &HT;    David Hagler, Nike Golf's director of apparel, confirmed that
one major department store group is considering adding the Tiger
Woods Collection to its golf and sportswear floor for spring 2001 _
the first sign that the department store channel may again be ready
to embrace the lifestyle sport. Also among the 500 green-grass
accounts for the collection are Pebble Beach in Monterey, Calif.,
and Doral Golf Resort and Spa in Miami.
 &HT;    So dominant is Woods that during the final round of the British
Open, he was on screen an amazing 35 percent (one hour, 22 minutes)
of the three hour, 54 minute broadcast.
 &HT;    The Nike swoosh on Tiger's hat was visible 22 percent of the
time, according to Sponsorship Research International. That kind of
television exposure, which keeps other apparel-backed PGA Tour
stars off the screen, is causing some competitive companies to
re-think sponsoring golfers.
 &HT;    Said one executive: ``It makes me wonder what our company is
getting for the money.''
 &HT;    Still, the success of Nike Golf's Tiger apparel was not a slam
dunk.
 &HT;    Originally launched as an ill-fated Nike Golf Sport line in
1997, it did not achieve widespread acceptance with either
green-grass accounts or traditional retailers. The styling was
aggressively young, an obvious effort to attract younger, hipper
golfers instead of the game's core audience.
 &HT;    Said Hagler: ``Nike has been seen as an outsider in golf; that
wasn't the best strategy for us.''
 &HT;    While golf retailers have reported a spike in sales in the Nike
golf ball that Tiger uses, measuring Tiger's impact on Nike Golf
apparel, even now, is more difficult.
 &HT;    Said American Golf's Sanchez: ``We cannot get the (Nike) Tour
Accuracy Ball in our shops quick enough. Most of that is strictly
because Tiger switched to the Nike ball. People want to try it.''
 &HT;    ``Whether or not Nike Golf is selling lots of shirts because of
Tiger is debatable,'' said Adam Barr, business reporter for the
Golf Channel, based in Orlando. ``The problem with any endorsement
is that you cannot tell how many people actually watch and then go
buy. Nike wouldn't keep going with the collection if it was
tanking. Tiger is probably having a bigger effect than we know
right now.''
 &HT;    Said Sanchez, ``Tiger has lift on the apparel side.''
 &HT;    Instead of marketing to trend-hopping teens, Nike is courting
core golfers and the game's establishment. ``My opinion is that
that makes the apparel more saleable to the average consumer,''
Sanchez said.
 &HT;    Nike Golf's Tiger Woods Collection centers around shades of
chianti, black, charcoal, azure blue, sage green and white for
spring 2001. Silhouettes include a button-front jacquard knit with
engineered stripes and an aggressive hemming detail on the shirt's
bottom and sleeves, $72 suggested retail price.
 &HT;    There's also a short-sleeved viscose/mercerized nylon V-neck
knit with contrast tipping at neck, hem and sleeves, $100 suggested
retail. Knits in Nike Golf's sportier and khaki-based Tour
Collection start at $50 suggested retail.
 &HT;    ``We are not abandoning the young customer,'' Hagler said. ``We
can appeal to them with specific pieces in the line. But the
sport's core 30-to-50-year-old players, where the bulk of the
market's money is spent, are not influenced by hero worship like
teens. We're always looking to change as much as we can, but we
want to operate from inside the game, rather than be outside.''
 &HT;    Woods meets with the design staff four times a year to review
seasonal deliveries. Hagler and design staff are scheduled to meet
with him this week to review the spring 2001 line and preview fall
2001 between rounds at the Buick Open at Warwick Hills Golf &AMP;
Country Club, Grand Blanc, Mich.
 &HT;    ``Bright red doesn't merchandise well. We learned that and
switched Tiger to a more muted tone of chianti,'' said Hagler.
``When redoing product, we went into a classics range, but at the
same time we wanted to push Tiger's line as the more
fashion-forward offering. We will look to trends going on in men's
sportswear to pick up cues where to take Tiger.''

 By SUSAN WELSH 
 (Color art is available.) 
 From W magazine 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    ``Sex-crazed homewrecker'' is not exactly the description that
comes to mind when one thinks of Joan Allen, an actress who has
brought sexual repression to a new level of artistry.
 &HT;    Yet in her new movie, ``The Contender,'' she portrays Sen. Laine
Hanson, a politician who is first seen in flagrante delicto on her
desk and is later accused of committing adultery with her best
friend's husband.
 &HT;    More damning still, she's said to have engaged in carnal
shenanigans that would make Monica Lewinsky look like Rebecca of
Sunnybrook Farm.
 &HT;    Early in the film, Hanson, an Ohio Democrat, is asked by the
president (played by Jeff Bridges) to take the office of vice
president after the death of the incumbent. But in a plot twist
laden with allusions to the Hill-Thomas hearings and the Clinton
scandal, her enemy, a powerful Republican congressman (Gary Oldman,
looking very unlike himself), dredges up some eye-popping sex
photos from her past.
 &HT;    Writer-director Rod Lurie began work on ``The Contender'' at the
height of the Lewinsky affair, and he wanted to comment on an
aspect of it that he thought was being overlooked.
 &HT;    ``I told my wife,'' he recalls, ''`Clinton is going to get away
with this, because he's a man, and because we don't have many
negative feelings about male sexuality. But female sexuality is a
totally different story.'''
 &HT;    For Allen, the role offered an opportunity to break the glass
ceiling that has hovered over her career. Over breakfast on a hazy,
sweltering New York morning, the willowy 45-year-old actress,
looking cool and self-possessed in a simple sleeveless black dress,
sums up the role's appeal: ``Instead of being married to the
senator, I am the senator.''
 &HT;    Despite being one of the most highly regarded actresses in
Hollywood, she has, until now, played mostly wives _ but wives who
are singularly good at hiding roiling passion beneath a placid,
controlled exterior.
 &HT;    She won Best Supporting Actress nominations for her turn as a
loyal but sexually frustrated Pat Nixon in Oliver Stone's epic
``Nixon,'' and the following year for playing a Puritan whose
bottled-up ardor drives Daniel Day-Lewis astray in ``The
Crucible.''
 &HT;    Allen's uncanny ability to convey raw emotion without emoting
may make her the ideal choice for a film that tests the somewhat
hazy American boundary between the public and the private. And as
it happens, Lurie dreamed up ``The Contender'' expressly as a
vehicle for her.
 &HT;    In 1998, when Allen won a best supporting actress award from the
L.A. Film Critics Association for playing a love-starved June
Cleaver clone in ``Pleasantville,'' Lurie, a former critic who
describes himself as ``an obsessed fan of Joan's,'' asked if he
could present it to her.
 &HT;    Extemporizing at the podium, he found himself saying, ``I should
write a movie for Joan Allen, because if Joan agrees to do it, then
it's going to be a good movie.''
 &HT;    During the dinner that followed, Allen expressed genuine
interest in the idea, and shortly afterward, Lurie began work on a
screenplay.
 &HT;    ``I had no clue what I was going to write _ not the vaguest
idea,'' he says. ``I knew that I had one mission, and that was to
write a character to which Joan Allen could not say no.''
 &HT;    Allen, who researched the role by watching tapes of Gerald
Ford's confirmation hearings and by spending time with Arkansas
Sen. Blanche Lincoln, says she connected with Laine Hanson's core
of integrity.
 &HT;    ``It's what you would like politics to be if it really worked,''
she says, while acknowledging that ``the character is not
completely lifelike.''
 &HT;    Indeed, Hanson is almost a fairy-tale liberal: She is pro-choice
and pro-campaign finance reform, wants the death penalty abolished,
thinks all guns should be confiscated and believes that selling
cigarettes to minors should be a federal offense. Oh, and she's an
avowed atheist.
 &HT;    But unlike some of her celebrity neighbors on New York's
famously liberal Upper West Side _ where she maintains a low
profile with her husband, actor Peter Friedman, and their
6-year-old daughter, Sadie _ Allen prefers to keep her own views
private.
 &HT;    ``Rod is the political animal, and I'm the actor,'' she says.
``He wrote the part that way, and I did it.'' She herself would
``never, ever, ever'' want to run for office. ``That's why it was
so fun to play a politician,'' she says, ``because it's so
antithetical to my nature.''
 &HT;    Early press screenings had Oscar-watchers buzzing about Allen's
strong shot at a statuette. Allen remains wary of the hype, but she
confesses that when the movie was picked up for distribution by
DreamWorks, her heart beat a little faster.
 &HT;    ``I knew how much they were going to back it,'' she says, ``and
I had a moment like, `God, this could really change me.' I sort of
panicked, quietly. I said to my husband, `I like to take the
subway. I like taking the bus. I'm kind of anonymous!' But I've
sort of calmed down about that now.''

 &HT;    CHER'S LATEST VENTURE
 &HT;    
 &HT;    She sings, she acts _ and now she makes jewelry. Cher is hard at
work on a new jewelry line that will be in stores by November.
 &HT;    The collection, called ``Cher for Loree Rodkin,'' includes long
earrings, necklaces and bracelets; platinum, gold and silver, and
lots of beads and stones.
 &HT;    As with the vanity cases that Sharon Stone's designing for Louis
Vuitton, a percentage of the profits will go to charity _ in Cher's
case, the Facial Foundation for Disfigured Children, the cause she
took up during the making of the film ``Mask.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    IMAN'S AIDS STANCE
 &HT;    
 &HT;    ``AIDS is not over. Our children remain at great risk. Every
hour of every day, two American adolescents are infected with
HIV.''
 &HT;    These words are from the model Iman, who has signed on as
celebrity spokeswoman for Mothers' Voices, a nonprofit group
focused on educating parents and teachers on AIDS issues as they
affect youth.
 &HT;    Sheryl Schwartz, wife of Calvin Klein Inc. vice chairman Barry
Schwartz, serves as chairwoman of the group, which also receives
financial and logistical support from Calvin Klein.
 &HT;    ``As parents, we all want to protect our children and given them
the skills they need to live a sexually healthy life,'' Iman added.
 &HT;    This fall, the organization plans to extend its workshop series,
which aims to teach parents how to seize ``teachable moments'' to
explain to their children the facts about the disease _ from its
New York headquarters to Atlanta, Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles,
Miami and Providence, R.I.
 &HT;    The group also plans to host a full-day workshop titled
``Parenting in the Age of AIDS'' this October in New York for the
parents of children attending public schools.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    BRITNEY'S ONLINE LATHER
 &HT;    
 &HT;    It seems that Clairol is taking its association with new
spokeswoman Britney Spears to a new level. Not only is the company
sponsoring Spears' summer concert tour, it's also garnering new
listeners for the teen queen with a promotional pack available on
CVS.com.
 &HT;    The set includes full-sized bottles of Clairol's Herbal Essences
Shampoo and Conditioner for normal/oily hair and a Spears sampler
CD for $8.99.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    POWER LUNCHERS
 &HT;    NEW YORK _ ``Men already run the world,'' said Susan Estrich,
the first woman to run a presidential campaign _ Michael Dukakis' _
and the author of an upcoming book, ``Sex and Power.'' She said
it's up to women ``to recognize the power they have,'' be proud of
it and use it.
 &HT;    Estrich, who spoke to about 60 women at Harper's Bazaar's recent
``power luncheon'' at the Alain Ducasse restaurant, pointed out
that one of the most powerful women was sitting right in the room _
Barbara Walters. She cited Walters' refusal to have O.J. Simpson on
her show, ``The View,'' which drew applause from the audience.
 &HT;    ``I do not have power,'' Walters called out, to which the crowd
exhibited some disbelief _ especially since Walters is negotiating
a reported $12 million contract with ABC.
 &HT;    Other heavy hitters who came out to celebrate Bazaar's August
``power'' issue included Tina Brown, Maria Bartiromo, Kate Spade,
Diane Von Furstenberg, Lesley Stahl, Carolina Herrera, Aerin
Lauder, Josie Natori and Dana Buchman.
 &HT;    The luncheon was hosted by Kate Betts, Bazaar's editor in chief,
and Cynthia Lewis, vice president and publisher.
 &HT;    Bartiromo, an anchor for CNBC whose staggering schedule left
some in the room breathless, said her idea of power is not having
lots of assistants and delegating.
 &HT;    ``I make my own phone calls and in many cases, I'm a one-woman
show,'' said Bartiromo, who does three live shows a day. ``For me,
power is not delegating. It's getting the story right and getting
it first and putting it on the air before it's disseminated.''

CONGRESS TAKES SMALL STEP TO RESTORE FREEDOM OF WORSHIP

<TEXT>
<P>
   The battle between Congress and the U.S. Supreme Court continues
_ over the significance of religious liberty and the right to
worship without government intrusion. Congress supports a much
broader interpretation of the constitutional protections afforded
to the freedom to worship than does the court.
</P>
<P>
   The high court's stingy interpretation of the U.S. Constitution
in Employment Division v. Smith (1990) involving the legitimate
religious use of peyote by Oregon members of the Native American
Church severely truncated traditional protections for religious
worship.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon outlawed the use of peyote in all circumstances, despite
the fact that Congress had made it legal for NAC members to use it
in religious worship. In its 6-3 decision, the high court held that
any generally applicable law could burden or even prohibit a
specific mode of religious worship. Oregon's law was a considered a
generally applicable law.
</P>
<P>
   Until that decision, the Free Exercise Clause provided
heightened protection for those involved in legitimate religious
worship or religious ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the 1990 decision, Congress passed the Religious
Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, only to have it struck down by the
high court in 1997. The court, in its decision, said that Congress
had exceeded it authority.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of July, before Congress took its August recess, both
the Senate and the House quietly passed a new religious liberty
bill _ by unanimous consent. The legislation is narrowly focused to
use the acknowledged power of Congress to regulate under the
Commerce Clause, the Spending Clause and the Fourteenth Amendment.
The bill intends to widen the protections given to religious
worship in areas where Congress has the unquestioned authority to
do so.
</P>
<P>
   Although the bill didn't receive much attention in the press, it
now awaits President Clinton's signature. Clinton has already
expressed support for the bill, so there is little doubt he will
sign it into law soon.
</P>
<P>
   When Senate Bill 2869 (Religious Land Use and Institutionalized
Persons Act of 2000) becomes law, it will prohibit all levels of
government from implementing land use regulations ``in a manner
that impose a substantial burden on the religious exercise of a
person, including a religious assembly or institution, unless the
government demonstrates'' that such a burden furthers a compelling
governmental interest and that it is the least restrictive means of
achieving that compelling interest.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult for a governmental agency to prove it has a
compelling interest and that the method of regulation used to
further that compelling interest is the least restrictive means of
achieving it. This strict test reinstates the traditional test for
whether a law unconstitutionally burdens religious worship _ the
test that the Supreme Court did away with in the 1990 peyote case.
</P>
<P>
   This law will apply to all programs or activities that receive
federal funds _ regardless of whether the land use regulations are
generally applicable and do not specifically target religious
exercise.
</P>
<P>
   The first section of the mini-religious liberty bill is meant to
thwart zoning regulations that often harm churches and interfere
with religious ceremonies. In numbers of cities and towns, city
officials have sought to limit the number of worshippers at
churches and pressured houses of worship to shut down soup
kitchens. This bill would force city officials to have a compelling
reason to inflict a burden on religious worship.
</P>
<P>
   In a show of bipartisanship, Sens. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and
Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., issued a joint statement to prove the need
for such a bill: ``Sometimes, zoning board members or neighborhood
residents explicitly offer race or religion as the reason to
exclude a proposed church, especially in cases of black churches
and Jewish shuls and synagogues. More often, discrimination lurks
behind such vague and universally applicable reasons as traffic,
aesthetics, or `not consistent with the city's land use plan.' ...
This discrimination against religious uses is a nationwide
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Understated but as important, the bill also gives some leverage
to American Indians who find their religious worship at sacred
sites restricted or outlawed altogether because of tourism, mining
or road building.
</P>
<P>
   The second part of S. 2869 deals with persons residing in or
confined to government institutions. The bill states: ''No
government shall impose a substantial burden on the religious
exercise of a person residing in or confined to an institution ...
unless the government demonstrates the imposition of the burden on
that person is 1) in furtherance of a compelling governmental
interest; and 2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that
compelling governmental interest.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill will provide protection for the religious beliefs and
worship of all those persons confined in state residential
facilities, homes for the disabled and correctional institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Institutionalized persons are often subject to the authority of
a very few local officials who don't want to go out of their way to
allow them to practice their faith. In a joint statement about this
part of the bill, Hatch and Kennedy pointed out: ``Whether from
indifference, ignorance, bigotry, or lack of resources, some
institutions restrict religious liberty in egregious and
unnecessary ways.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Committee on the Judiciary even learned of a case in
which prison authorities recorded the sacrament of confession
between a prisoner and the Roman Catholic chaplain. In another
prison, an inmate was allowed to attend Episcopal worship but
forbidden to take communion.
</P>
<P>
   A Wisconsin prison would not allow Christian inmates to wear
even tiny crosses. And, in the West, we are well acquainted with
prison officials who arbitrarily forbid American Indians from using
sweat lodges for their worship _ although there is sufficient room
for them to be built on prison grounds.
</P>
<P>
   As a safeguard, this bill does not amend or repeal the Prison
Litigation Reform Act which protects prisons and prison officials
from frivolous lawsuits filed by prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   A very broad coalition of religious and civil liberties groups
and conservative organizations like the Family Research Council
supported the passage of this bill. Melissa Rogers, general counsel
of the Baptist Joint Committee, successfully led the coalition in
urging for its passage.
</P>
<P>
   Until the U.S. Supreme Court can be convinced to revisit its
decision in Employment Division v. Smith and come around to an
interpretation of the Constitution that is consistent with our
nation's vision of the great significance of religious worship, we
must rely upon Congress to hack away at the court's mingy
understanding of one of America's great freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   This bill is a small step toward restoring the meaning of the
Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment, but one which will be
more difficult for the high court to gut.

   All of us experience absentmindedness. Indeed, remembering which
chore needs your attention or where you put the car keys can often
be a hit-or-miss proposition. So why do we vividly recall the
details surrounding an assassination, marriage proposal or the
birth of a child? And what goes on in the brain to imprint memories
in the first place? Here, a report on the process of remembering.

 By THE EDITORS OF DISCOVER MAGAZINE 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    FEARS FOR EARS
 &HT;    
 &HT;    American farmers have planted 20 million acres of genetically
modified corn, engineered to repel predatory insects without using
noxious chemicals.
 &HT;    If farmers are not careful, a new report warns, the scheme could
backfire and breed even more troublesome strains of pests.
 &HT;    The modified crops pump out Bt toxin, a natural insecticide
created by bacteria. Some insects, in turn, carry genes that
protect them from the toxin.
 &HT;    To check the spread of those genes, the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency requires that farmers intersperse fields of
genetically modified crops with islands of non-modified plants. The
idea is that insects in the refuges would remain vulnerable to Bt
toxin, and the bugs would interbreed to keep the whole population
susceptible.
 &HT;    For the first time, scientists have proof the tactic works.
Entomologist Anthony Shelton of Cornell University and his
colleagues sowed fields of altered broccoli and then unleashed
broccoli-eating diamondback moths. In fields containing refuges of
non-modified plants, resistance genes were less likely to be spread
through the moth population.
 &HT;    But there is a big caveat. Spraying the refuges with pesticides
_ a common practice among farmers, and one permitted by EPA
regulations _ sped the appearance of toxin-resistant moths.
 &HT;    ``Any time you spray insects on a plant, you are never going to
get 100 percent mortality,'' Shelton says. ``You end up putting a
mosaic of doses on the plants _ some high and some low. Where the
doses are low, you won't kill all the insects, and those that
survive will be more likely to develop resistance.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    LONELY PLANETS
 &HT;    
 &HT;    The planets beyond our solar system keep getting weirder and
weirder. First came word of Jupiter-sized worlds that roast
improbably close to their parent stars. Now astronomers Phil Lucas
of the University of Hertfordshire and Patrick Roche of Oxford
University say they have spotted planets that travel alone through
the dark coldness of space.
 &HT;    The researchers found these solo travelers by training the
United Kingdom Infrared Telescope's Fast Track Imager on a group of
very young stars in the Orion nebula, 1,500 light-years from Earth.
Among this crowd, the camera picked out the feeble infrared glow of
150 objects too small and cool to be stars. Thirteen of them appear
to be planets, Lucas says.
 &HT;    He estimates they have masses roughly eight times that of
Jupiter, which implies that they are huge bodies with deep
atmospheres.
 &HT;    Lucas and Roche suspect these planets grew directly out of a
cloud of cold gas and dust _ not from a disk surrounding an infant
star, the way normal planets do.
 &HT;    ``We can't rule out the possibility that some might have been
flung out of a solar system, but it looks like they have always
been free-floating,'' Lucas says.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    LIKE WATERLOO FOR CHOCOLATE
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Could the day come when the only chocolate bars are in museums?
 &HT;    South America's cacao growers are warily watching the spread of
witches'-broom fungus, which infects seed pods and sends out
evil-looking orange shoots. It has slashed Brazil's cocoa
production by more than 25 percent in the past five years.
 &HT;    Crowded cacao plantations encourage the rapid spread of the
witches'-broom fungus, and fungicides don't work well amid the
heavy rains of the tropics.
 &HT;    Robert Lumsden of the U.S. Agricultural Research Service in
Beltsville, Md., is leading an effort to fight fungus with fungus _
Trichoderma, which attacks witches'-broom and other cacao pests.
 &HT;    Field trials in Peru and Brazil show that Trichoderma fungi are
effective and harmless to the trees. But the genetic uniformity of
commercial cacao groves still leaves them vulnerable to future
attacks.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    MR. SANDMAN
 &HT;    
 &HT;    William C. Dement knows that failing to get enough sleep is more
than a minor nuisance. It causes malaise, poor concentration,
moodiness, ill health and accidental deaths.
 &HT;    During more than four decades of pioneering research, Dement
codiscovered REM sleep, founded Stanford University's Sleep
Disorders Clinic and Research Center and witnessed countless
examples of the ways the body malfunctions when deprived of proper
rest.
 &HT;    Here, Dement talks about his research and his personal crusade
against sleep deprivation.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: How bad is the problem of sleep deprivation in the United
States?
 &HT;    A: Very bad. Everybody is sleepy.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Doesn't the brain compensate for lack of sleep?
 &HT;    A: I don't think it does. Think of going to sleep as a balance.
There is so much weight on the sleep side and so much on the awake
side. Caffeine, pain, excitement, activity _ these things push the
balance in the awake direction, but the sleep-deprivation side may
keep getting heavier until nothing can oppose it.
 &HT;    There is new MRI research that suggests some areas of the brain
get more active, maybe in an effort to take up the slack. But that
may also just be an effect of sleep deprivation.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Will we ever have a cure for people who can't sleep?
 &HT;    A: Insomnia is quite a few different things. The insomnia that
arises out of stress or tragedy, things like that, we'll certainly
be able to treat. To cure all insomnia would be like being able to
have healthy sleep whenever you wanted. We can't do that yet.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: What do you think about using melatonin to control sleep?
 &HT;    A: If you take the recommended dose of melatonin and it helps
you, fine. There are worse things people do _ drinking yourself to
sleep, or trying to get alert with cocaine.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Will there ever be a pill that delivers alertness on demand?
 &HT;    A: Not one you could absolutely depend upon, no matter how sleep
deprived you were.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Will we ever understand why we need to sleep?
 &HT;    A: I'm confident of that. The biggest breakthrough was the
isolation of the narcolepsy gene in dogs. One abnormal gene causes
the quintessential sleep disorder. It suggests we're almost there.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Why do we dream?
 &HT;    A: The brain is so active during REM sleep, it's almost as if it
has to do something. While you're awake you could ask, ``Why am I
conscious?'' Well, you are awake, so why are you dreaming when
you're asleep? Because the brain created the dream world, and we
have no choice but to live in it.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Would you want to be able to live without sleeping?
 &HT;    A: We're so accustomed to a beginning and an end, that to have
consciousness going on forever would be hard. Maybe we could be
really happy with one hour of sleep, to end the day and begin the
next one.

 By ERIC HASELTINE 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    I was hovering outside the lab last week, desperately trying to
recall why I happened to be there at that moment, when I remembered
I'd come to retrieve the book ``Memory: From Mind to Molecules,''
by Larry Squire and Eric Kandel.
 &HT;    All of us experience such moments of absentmindedness on
occasion. Indeed, remembering which chore needs your attention or
where you put the car keys can often be a hit-or-miss proposition.
 &HT;    So why do we recall so precisely the details surrounding an
assassination, marriage proposal or the birth of a child? And what
goes on in the brain to imprint memories in the first place?
 &HT;    Neuroscientists haven't fully answered these questions, but
they've had tantalizing glimpses of how the process of remembering
something works.
 &HT;    One thing they've learned is that information gets stashed in
two very distinct types of memory on its way to permanently lodging
in yet a third kind of memory.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    EXPERIMENT 1
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Stare at the concentric circles, then shut your eyes, paying
close attention to the afterimage.
 &HT;    The faithful shapes and colors you see for an instant are the
first stage of memory _ sensory storage _ which gets its name from
its nearly perfect reproduction of sensory information flowing into
the brain.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    EXPERIMENT 2
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Scan these icons from left to right, glancing at each one once.
Turn away and list as many as you can.
 &HT;    You probably remember icons on the right best because the second
stage of memory, working storage, has so little capacity that
images viewed early in a sequence can get pushed out to make room
for those arriving later. Psychologists call this retroactive
interference.
 &HT;    You might have also noticed that icons at the beginning of the
list stayed with you better than those in the middle. That's
because proactive interference causes data already in working
memory to hinder the storage of information coming in later.
Because the first images in working memory suffer only retroactive
interference, they're retrieved better than the unfortunate icons
in the middle, which get hammered both proactively and
retroactively.
 &HT;    With this constant war between proactive and retroactive
interference, how does working information ever find its way into
the third kind of memory, long-term storage?
 &HT;    Neuroscientists believe that working memories are stored as
sustained electrical discharges in nerve cells that respond to
sensory information. These electric echoes keep sensations around
for several seconds after the events producing them have gone away.
 &HT;    If the neural reverberations are strong enough, they can
actually alter the physical structure of nerve cells and in the
process create permanent memories.
 &HT;    Neurons change in this way either through repetition _ for
example, writing down someone's phone number over and over again _
or by association with strong emotions that crank up the brain's
electrical volume and produce vivid recollections of major life
events.
 &HT;    The process is analogous to etching a groove in a piece of
hardwood either by scratching many times with a dull knife or
taking one good whack with a meat cleaver.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    EXPERIMENT 3
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Take a break for a few minutes. When you come back, we'll learn
something about long-term memory.
 &HT;    Welcome back. Now, see how many of these icons you recognize
from Experiment 2.
 &HT;    You probably got most of the repeated icons even though they
were all from the middle of the list in Experiment 2 and therefore
buffeted by both proactive and retroactive interference.
 &HT;    The reason is that there are two ways of measuring long-term
memory: recall and recognition. Recall memory actively dredges up
specific information, whereas recognition memory only passively
acknowledges whether a thing has been seen before.
 &HT;    Brain researchers aren't certain why, but information makes the
perilous transition from working memory into long-term recognition
far easier than it does to long-term recall.
 &HT;    If you try this experiment again a few days from now, you'll
still be able to recognize icons from the original group, which
means they've lodged in long-term memory and have changed the very
structure of your brain. In a literal sense, you are what you read.

really happy with one hour of sleep, to end the day and begin the
next one.

 By ERIC HASELTINE 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    I was hovering outside the lab last week, desperately trying to
recall why I happened to be there at that moment, when I remembered
I'd come to retrieve the book ``Memory: From Mind to Molecules,''
by Larry Squire and Eric Kandel.
 &HT;    All of us experience such moments of absentmindedness on
occasion. Indeed, remembering which chore needs your attention or
where you put the car keys can often be a hit-or-miss proposition.
 &HT;    So why do we recall so precisely the details surrounding an
assassination, marriage proposal or the birth of a child? And what
goes on in the brain to imprint memories in the first place?
 &HT;    Neuroscientists haven't fully answered these questions, but
they've had tantalizing glimpses of how the process of remembering
something works.
 &HT;    One thing they've learned is that information gets stashed in
two very distinct types of memory on its way to permanently lodging
in yet a third kind of memory.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    EXPERIMENT 1
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Stare at the concentric circles, then shut your eyes, paying
close attention to the afterimage.
 &HT;    The faithful shapes and colors you see for an instant are the
first stage of memory _ sensory storage _ which gets its name from
its nearly perfect reproduction of sensory information flowing into
the brain.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    EXPERIMENT 2
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Scan these icons from left to right, glancing at each one once.
Turn away and list as many as you can.
 &HT;    You probably remember icons on the right best because the second
stage of memory, working storage, has so little capacity that
images viewed early in a sequence can get pushed out to make room
for those arriving later. Psychologists call this retroactive
interference.
 &HT;    You might have also noticed that icons at the beginning of the
list stayed with you better than those in the middle. That's
because proactive interference causes data already in working
memory to hinder the storage of information coming in later.
Because the first images in working memory suffer only retroactive
interference, they're retrieved better than the unfortunate icons
in the middle, which get hammered both proactively and
retroactively.
 &HT;    With this constant war between proactive and retroactive
interference, how does working information ever find its way into
the third kind of memory, long-term storage?
 &HT;    Neuroscientists believe that working memories are stored as
sustained electrical discharges in nerve cells that respond to
sensory information. These electric echoes keep sensations around
for several seconds after the events producing them have gone away.
 &HT;    If the neural reverberations are strong enough, they can
actually alter the physical structure of nerve cells and in the
process create permanent memories.
 &HT;    Neurons change in this way either through repetition _ for
example, writing down someone's phone number over and over again _
or by association with strong emotions that crank up the brain's
electrical volume and produce vivid recollections of major life
events.
 &HT;    The process is analogous to etching a groove in a piece of
hardwood either by scratching many times with a dull knife or
taking one good whack with a meat cleaver.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    EXPERIMENT 3
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Take a break for a few minutes. When you come back, we'll learn
something about long-term memory.
 &HT;    Welcome back. Now, see how many of these icons you recognize
from Experiment 2.
 &HT;    You probably got most of the repeated icons even though they
were all from the middle of the list in Experiment 2 and therefore
buffeted by both proactive and retroactive interference.
 &HT;    The reason is that there are two ways of measuring long-term
memory: recall and recognition. Recall memory actively dredges up
specific information, whereas recognition memory only passively
acknowledges whether a thing has been seen before.
 &HT;    Brain researchers aren't certain why, but information makes the
perilous transition from working memory into long-term recognition
far easier than it does to long-term recall.
 &HT;    If you try this experiment again a few days from now, you'll
still be able to recognize icons from the original group, which
means they've lodged in long-term memory and have changed the very
structure of your brain. In a literal sense, you are what you read.

CONCERNS ABOUT PIPELINES GROW AS MAJOR ACCIDENTS INCREASE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By NEIL STRASSMAN 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joe Miller's 15-year dream of carving a piece of paradise out of
East Texas bottomland near Greenville was lost last March to
500,000 gallons of gasoline that poured across fields and down a
creek bed beside his land.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole place smelled like a refinery,'' he said. ``You
could have tossed a match in the creek, and it would have caught
fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the gasoline that spilled from the ruptured, underground
Explorer pipeline can be cleaned up, Miller says, the land is no
longer the rural sanctuary that his family treasured.
</P>
<P>
   Pipelines are safer than trucks, barges and tankers for shipping
oil and gas, but concerns about the aging, infrequently inspected
lines are mounting as the number of major accidents increases.
</P>
<P>
   Urban neighborhoods, ranchers and farmers have organized to
block proposed lines from passing through their land. Congress,
federal regulators and watchdog groups are moving to protect
heavily populated regions and the environment. The federal Office
of Pipeline Safety, an arm of the Transportation Department, has
been sharply criticized as ineffective and vulnerable to pipeline
industry influence.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Hall, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board,
which investigates pipeline accidents, put it bluntly in a speech
last December to the Association of Oil Pipe Lines, a Washington
pipeline trade organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``The products in your lines _ if they escape _ pollute and
kill,'' Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   Ten people, including five children under the age of six,
suffered a fiery death Saturday when a natural gas pipeline
exploded at the Pecos River near Carlsbad, N.M. They had been
camping and fishing on the river. The fire was so intense that sand
melted into glass and some concrete on a nearby bridge turned to
powder. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Three people were killed in a Jan. 14 Garland, Texas, house
explosion when natural gas leaked from a cracked 4-inch gas main in
an alley behind the house. The line had been scheduled for repair.
</P>
<P>
   No one was killed or injured in the Greenville accident, but the
outcome was deadly a year ago when 250,000 gallons of gasoline
spilled from a broken pipeline in Bellingham, Wash. After a flicked
cigarette lighter sparked a fire in a gasoline-saturated creek, a
huge fireball swept downstream, killing two 10-year-old boys and a
fisherman and injuring eight others.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   ALWAYS A DANGER
</P>
<P>
   Texas, with 250,000 miles of pipelines, has had more accidents
in the past 15 years than any other state. State officials say that
75 percent of the accidents are a result of contractors
accidentally digging into pipelines. But when Texas adopted a
call-before-you-dig program in 1998, it was the last state in the
continental United States to do so. The program has reduced the
number of pipeline accidents nationally.
</P>
<P>
   The Explorer pipeline is well-marked in the Dallas/Fort Worth
Metroplex, but at least three times in the past 15 years it has
been damaged in construction accidents. The line runs through
Grapevine's business district, following the Cotton Belt rail line
north of Dallas Street to a tank farm in Southlake, across from the
new Grapevine High School stadium on Texas 26. The tank farm has
been a relatively safe facility with few problems.
</P>
<P>
   A branch of the pipeline then heads east, carrying jet fuel to
D/FW Airport, and another branch continues to a tank farm just
north of downtown Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always have to be concerned about the line, but the city
doesn't regulate it,'' Grapevine Mayor William D. Tate said. ``When
you are moving fuel under pressure, there is always a danger.''
</P>
<P>
   Rod Sands, Explorer vice president of operations, says the
company has a good safety record.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a philosophy to maintain the highest levels of safety
and integrity: If in doubt, shut down,'' he said. ``We have had
some third-party damage.''
</P>
<P>
   In Addison north of Dallas on June 19, 1985, a backhoe punctured
the line, sending a geyser of flames 100 feet into the air. Flames
seared the top of an adjacent 12-story office building, and the
fire spread underground. Neighboring shopping malls were evacuated.
One person mowing grass nearby was burned.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 16, 1997, a half-mile north of Grapevine High School on
the Southlake side of Texas 26, a contractor struck the line with a
tree-planting machine. No one was injured and no fire broke out,
but 2,500 gallons of gasoline was spilled.
</P>
<P>
   On July 15, 1999, a contractor working along William D. Tate
Avenue in Grapevine, near a half-dozen fast-food restaurants,
punctured the airport fuel line. About 4,250 gallons of jet fuel
spilled, but without causing injuries or fire.
</P>
<P>
   And in one of the largest environmental disasters to hit North
Texas in decades, the high-pressure 28-inch Explorer pipeline split
open March 9, releasing a half-million gallons of gasoline and
50,000 gallons of the toxic additive MTBE, methyl tertiary-butyl
ether. Pushed by heavy rains, the fuel washed 25 miles to Lake
Tawakoni, which supplies Dallas with as much as 220 million gallons
of drinking water a day during the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned about the MTBE contamination of Tawakoni, Dallas water
officials waited until last week to begin using the lake again.

</P>
<P>
   THE GAO THROWS A PUNCH
</P>
<P>
   Explorer's line is just one of at least a dozen underground
pipelines that crisscross the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex, carrying
natural gas and refined petroleum products such as gasoline, diesel
and jet fuel.
</P>
<P>
   In the Metroplex, fuel is stored in tank farms, groupings of a
dozen or more large steel tanks, often painted white. The pipelines
mostly follow railroad rights of way and often pass near schools,
hospitals, businesses and homes.
</P>
<P>
   Many pipelines in the Metroplex have had breaks, most often when
construction crews dig into a line. But corrosion, operator errors
and faulty valves and gaskets are also common factors in accidents,
safety officials say. Similar problems affect nearly all U.S.
pipelines, many of which are decades old and infrequently
inspected, the officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, more than two-thirds of all pipeline accidents
resulting in fatalities and injuries are caused by breaks in
natural gas lines, according to a General Accounting Office report
released in May. The report, requested by Congress, censured the
Office of Pipeline Safety, calling it weak, inefficient and slow to
adopt reforms.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO investigation also found that hazardous-liquid pipelines
_ which make up about 11 percent of the nation's 2.2 million miles
of pipeline _ have eight times as many major accidents per mile as
natural gas lines and account for half the property and
environmental damage caused by pipeline breaks.
</P>
<P>
   Eight bills to renew the nation's pipeline safety program have
been moving through Congress. One of those, the King and Tsiorvas
Pipeline Safety Improvement Act, sponsored by Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz., is named after the two boys who were killed in the
Bellingham accident.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, the bills seek additional enforcement authority for
the federal pipeline safety office. They seek tougher inspections
and better operator training and call for more investment in
accident-prevention research.
</P>
<P>
   The bills include additional measures to protect heavily
populated regions and areas especially sensitive to environmental
damage. Pipeline operators would be required to release accident
data to the public under strong community right-to-know provisions;
states could get more authority over interstate pipelines.
</P>

<P>
   SPILL DROWNED DREAM
</P>
<P>
   Miller, a robust man with close-cropped graying hair, has spent
15 years preserving his 370-acre spread 20 miles downstream from
the Explorer spill. His land is home to deer, game birds and other
wildlife. He dredged a lake, stocked it with bass and catfish and
lives with his wife and two sons above his workshop.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a lifelong dream to raise my children in a natural,
unspoiled environment,'' he said, walking through a dense stand of
hardwoods along East Caddo Creek. ``We have done our best to create
an oasis in the farmland. This spill has made me sick in the
heart.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, Miller distilled his own drinking water, filtering
the brown creek water until it was pure.
</P>
<P>
   Tests since the accident have found varying amounts of MTBE in
samples of the water. ``Everything we worked for is ruined,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Miller wants Explorer to clean the soil along the narrow,
flood-prone creek bed. After the spill, the creek overflowed and
the MTBE-laced gasoline poured across about 70 acres of his land.
</P>
<P>
   MTBE is used in a third of the country's gasoline to cut smog
and reduce toxic tailpipe emissions. The water-soluble compound has
been found to ruin lakes and groundwater and is considered a
possible carcinogen. The federal government is phasing out its use.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said it is unclear what, if anything, Explorer will do to
remove the MTBE.
</P>
<P>
   ``It stinks, actually,'' he said of Explorer's response.
</P>
<P>
   Explorer is monitoring the creek for contamination and has
removed some sediment, said Jim Sieck, the company's environmental
manager. ``He (Miller) needs to let us know what his concerns are,
and we will address them.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   MORE PIPE, MORE PROBLEMS
</P>
<P>
   The number of major pipeline accidents _ those involving a
fatality, an injury or more than $50,000 in property damage _
jumped from 191 in 1989 to 276 a decade later, according to the GAO
report.
</P>
<P>
   In 2,241 major accidents during those 10 years, 226 people died
and 1,030 were injured, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The additional accidents are related to a 10 percent increase in
pipeline miles, more people living near pipelines, and larger
shipments of oil and gas, pipeline safety officials told the GAO.
But from 1990 to 1998, the pipeline safety office decreased its use
of fines for pipeline companies' violations of safety regulations
from 49 percent of enforcement actions to 4 percent, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
   MORE nn
</P>
<P>
   Hall, the transportation safety board chairman, has sternly
criticized the pipeline office's record.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nowhere today the sense that the Office of Pipeline
Safety is in charge, or that its regulations, inspections, its
assets, its staffing and its spirit are adequate to the task,''
Hall said in the December speech to the pipeline association.
</P>
<P>
   The pipeline safety office ``does not have a good record'' of
responding to the safety board's recommendations, he said, ``and
industry influence has a great deal to do with this.''
</P>
<P>
   The perception that industry influences the pipeline safety
office, which sets construction standards and oversees maintenance
for interstate pipelines, may be traceable to the pipeline industry
user fees that fund the agency, said Patricia Klinger, an agency
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pipeline operators pay into a fund, and people tend to
view our relationship a certain way,'' she said. ``We do have to
work with industry to inspect their pipelines and facilities, and
we have to do a cost-benefit analysis.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency needs a larger staff, resources and enforcement
authority, Klinger said, but is responding quicker to safety board
recommendations, issuing written replies to the board within 90
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want communities and the states more involved because they
understand local concerns better,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   A CALL FOR ACTION
</P>
<P>
   But Texas Railroad Commissioner Tony Garza isn't eager for the
state to have more pipeline responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got all we can say grace over,'' Garza said. ``We have
to be as aggressive as possible in our oversight.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas has 150,000 miles of intrastate pipelines, 80,000 miles of
interstate lines and about 20,000 miles of production lines, far
more pipeline miles than any other state, said Mary McDaniel, the
Railroad Commission's assistant director of pipeline safety.
</P>
<P>
   Texas' 1,654 pipeline accidents since 1985 are more than three
times higher than the state with the next highest number,
California with 495 accidents. The amount of hazardous liquid
spilled in Texas is slightly more than three times the 10.5 million
gallons lost over that same period in Oklahoma, the state with the
second highest amount of spillage.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at Texas, the numbers can look bad, but we're
under the national average for accidents per mile,'' McDaniel said.
</P>
<P>
   In urban areas, most pipelines are well-marked, especially at
intersections and along rail lines. Usually, a post or piece of
colored tubing bearing the company name and a warning against
digging is planted in the ground. The warnings are important
because accidental damage is the leading cause of pipeline
accidents in the state, McDaniel said.
</P>
<P>
   But members of the National Pipeline Reform Coalition, a new
watchdog group, say that across the nation, pipelines must become
safer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want adequate regulation, safer pipelines and fewer
fatalities and injuries. We want to stop polluting the
environment,'' said the coalition's president, Bob Rackleff, a
county commissioner in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Rules do not require replacement of aging pipelines, and except
for interstate natural gas pipelines, no federal rules govern land
use and pipeline routing decisions, Rackleff said. ``The rules are
terribly weak.''
</P>
<P>
   The Office of Pipeline Safety protects the interests of the
pipeline industry ``as a matter of policy,'' Rackleff said. The
agency inflates the role of damage from weather and geological
forces and ``third-party damage'' from unauthorized digging,
underplaying corrosion, bad valves and gaskets, material failures
and insufficient maintenance, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Virginia, the Colonial Pipeline, one of the nation's largest,
has twice contaminated the Rappahanock River in the past 20 years,
each time fouling the drinking water of Fredericksburg, Va., for a
week, said City Attorney Jim Pates, a coalition member.
</P>
<P>
   ``It failed 30 miles away, and we lost the entire public water
supply for a city of 22,000 and had to haul water in,'' Pates said.
``The Office of Pipeline Safety had no interest in us, and we saw
that we were on our own.''
</P>
<P>
   The 36-inch line failed in 1980, spilling 97,000 gallons of
heating oil, and in 1989, spilling 220,000 gallons of kerosene,
Pates said.
</P>
<P>
   The pipeline flaw that caused both spills still exists: The pipe
was stressed by its own weight while it was transported on
railcars, Pates said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The line is still defective and a threat to the city,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The pipeline industry is working hard to get an improved federal
safety program, said Ben Cooper, executive director of the
Association of Oil Pipe Lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want the issues resolved,'' Cooper said. ``Our main goal is
the operation of a safe pipeline system.''

   FIGHTING THE LONGHORN
</P>
<P>
   In south Austin and across a wide swath of Texas, residents and
ranchers are fighting a proposal to ship gasoline from Houston to
El Paso in the dormant 50-year-old Longhorn Pipeline that once
carried crude oil from West Texas oilfields to Houston. The line
crosses the Edwards Aquifer and the Colorado River, two vital water
sources, said Brigid Shea, an environmental consultant and a former
Austin City Council member.
</P>
<P>
   Ranchers worry about their land and animals, Austin residents
are concerned about schools and neighborhoods, and environmental
advocates want to protect endangered species habitat, Shea said.
They are trying to force the federal government to require an
environmental impact statement, an assessment of potential damage,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The line is old, and there are few safeguards,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But the nearly 30-year-old Explorer line, even with more modern
safeguards, such as a coating and cathodic protection (an electric
charge put in the ground to reduce corrosion) still broke apart on
its own.
</P>
<P>
   The transportation safety board, which is investigating the
Explorer accident, has completed some metallurgical analysis on the
carbon steel pipe whose wall is slightly thicker than a
quarter-inch, said Jack Fox, the lead investigator.
</P>
<P>
   The Explorer line was last inspected in 1997, Fox said. Explorer
has inspected a 212-mile portion of the line between Greenville and
Tulsa since the March break.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Chipkevich, the safety board's pipeline investigations
director, said the agency is getting company records.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very early into this. We have six more months of
gathering information and testing,'' he said. ``In the past, we've
had problems associated with corrosion that are time-dependent, and
without adequate testing, some lines have failed.''
</P>
<P>
   Explorer, which has cleaned 50,000 tons of soil northwest of
Greenville and is sampling water, expects the cleanup to last
several more months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to make it right, as best we can,'' said
Explorer's Sieck. ``We're going to remove every bit of soil that is
suspect. I really don't know how long it will take.''
</P>
<P>
   MTBE levels in Lake Tawakoni have dropped significantly since
the spill, well below the state MTBE taste and odor standard of 15
parts per billion. Tawakoni-area cities have been using the lake's
water for nearly two months, but Dallas only agreed to resume using
the water last week.
</P>
<P>
   The cleanup has cost Explorer $6 million, plus $4.5 million to
inspect the line. Dallas has sent Explorer an initial bill for $8.3
million to cover some of the cost of a new water pipeline from Ray
Hubbard.
</P>
<P>
   The repaired Explorer pipeline resumed operation March 15, six
days after the spill, carrying MTBE-laden gasoline to Chicago. As a
precautionary measure, the line is operating at 80 percent of its
normal pressure, Sieck said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bellingham pipeline has not reopened since last year's fatal
fire; it's the longest pipeline closure in U.S. history, said Carl
Weimer, executive director of Safe Bellingham, a group of area
residents concerned about pipeline safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no regulation or citizen oversight that guarantees
this pipeline will be safe in the future,'' Weimer said. ``It's
more than a Bellingham issue, it's a national issue. Regulations
need to be changed to make everyone safer.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Sen. Joseph Lieberman doesn't drive a car _ or
even ride in one _ on Saturdays, the Jewish Sabbath. That would be
unnecessary work.
</P>
<P>
   But if public safety or a human life is at stake, he will work.
</P>
<P>
   During the impeachment case against President Clinton last year,
the Connecticut Democrat attended Saturday sessions of the Senate
by walking the five-mile round trip from his Georgetown house to
the U.S. Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   But even with a national election at stake, Lieberman, the
Democratic nominee for vice president, won't be campaigning on
Saturdays. He once skipped a state nominating convention when it
occurred on the Sabbath.
</P>
<P>
   He is careful to eat kosher foods. He wears a yarmulke _ a
skullcap _ whenever he prays, but only when he prays.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore's choice of Lieberman as his running mate has drawn
intense nationwide interest to his religious faith and practice.
Lieberman, the first Jewish candidate on a national party ticket,
is a devout Orthodox Jew.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge of living a political life within the confines of
Orthodox Judaism, with its strict adherence to the 613 laws in the
Book of Leviticus, may seem rigorous to non-Jews, but Jewish
leaders say the compromises Lieberman will face won't be overly
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Should he become vice president _ or president _ Lieberman won't
be confronted with stark choices between his faith and the national
interest, these Jewish leaders said.
</P>
<P>
   And should such a conflict emerge, none of these observers
suggested that he might be guided by the state of Israel or a
rabbi. Nor does the American public seem worried about it _ in
sharp contrast to the suspicions of many Protestants in 1928 and
1960 that Catholic presidential candidates Alfred E. Smith and John
F. Kennedy might take orders from the reigning pope. Kennedy
finessed those concerns and became president; Smith didn't and
lost.
</P>
<P>
   But many Americans do have a newfound curiosity about Orthodox
Judaism. What is it? Why does it impose so many restrictions on its
members? And what relevance does this ancient religion have in the
modern world?
</P>
<P>
   It is the most traditional, observant segment of Judaism, said
Rabbi A. James Rudin, senior interreligious affairs adviser for the
American Jewish Committee.
</P>
<P>
   It's also by far the oldest, dating about 4,000 years to
Biblical times. Judaism's other major branches, the Reform and
Conservative movements, were born in the 19th century and have
become the major strains of American Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty years ago, most Orthodox Jews were either elderly or
were immigrants from Europe,'' Rudin said. ``It was so closely
associated with Europe, and people thought, `That's what your
grandparents are.' People thought that American culture would make
it almost impossible to survive and Orthodox Judaism was going to
die with that generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it didn't die. It's alive, and it's growing.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, Jews joined the movement from the inner cities to
suburbia, which meant they began to live far from their synagogues
for the first time. Many began to drive to Sabbath services,
believing it was better than not attending worship at all.
</P>
<P>
   It was during this transition that Rabbi Aryeh Scheinberg moved
from Brooklyn, N.Y., to San Antonio to become the leader of
Congregation Rodfei Sholom. Its story of survival was similar to
the national trend: moving to rejoin a congregation that was
beginning to scatter, it solidified its membership and preserved a
community of faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came here, if I were going to worship with Orthodox
Jews, I could have worshiped in a telephone booth,'' Scheinberg
said. ``Now we have about 150 people coming every Sabbath.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to build a step at a time. In the Southwest, where
there weren't any large Jewish population centers, there were great
gaps in observance, knowledge and practice. We had to reach out
with education and be very patient. We accepted Jews of all
backgrounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Scheinberg's San Antonio synagogue was deteriorating badly, and
most members already had moved well beyond walking distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't see a reason to dismiss a commandment given to us by
God. We had a decision to make: Move to the suburbs where the
members live, or face having to drive to shul (the synagogue) on
the Sabbath,'' Scheinberg said.
</P>
<P>
   They moved, although it took several years. In 1991, the
congregation built a new synagogue in a quiet suburban enclave, and
today about 60 percent of its members live within walking distance.
Their closeness has given them a vitality that wasn't there 30
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walking to shul has a tremendous salutary effect. Everyone
else is riding and we're not only walking as families but talking
with each other. It's a wonderful time out,'' Scheinberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're dependent on machines all week; we're beeped, called on
the phone and drive around in cars all week, but one day of the
week we become independent of all those machines.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Samuel Stahl of Temple Beth-El, a Reform congregation in
San Antonio, said Orthodoxy has gotten a bad rap in some quarters
as being ``too rigid and inflexible,'' an image that's belied by
Lieberman's career.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's shown that it's possible to be faithfully Orthodox yet
open to change. Most rigidly observant Orthodox Jews don't really
understand the law,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stahl said lifelong Orthodox Jews such as Lieberman ``represent
the best of Orthodoxy.'' They're open to working with the other
movements of Judaism, while many of those who have converted to
Orthodoxy tend to shun Reform and Conservative Jews, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The growth of Orthodoxy is showing up in the increasing number
of Jewish schools, because they offer a sense of certainty and
transcendent truth in a chaotic, mobile, changing world, Rudin
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty or 40 years ago, most American Jews wanted to be fully
American. Now we are fully American, and we don't have to give up
anything in our religious heritage to be that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stahl said many Jews feel the need for an authoritative
expression of values, which the Torah provides, or want the strict
discipline which relieves them of the burden of having to wrestle
with too many moral decisions.
</P>
<P>
   At its most visible level, being an observant Orthodox Jew in
modern America means patronizing only kosher restaurants, asking
for kosher foods on airplanes, not playing sports or even turning
on lights or electrical appliances on the Sabbath.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means your religious convictions really shape your life,''
Rudin said.
</P>
<P>
   But first and foremost, an observant Orthodox Jew believes the
Torah _ the first five biblical books (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus,
Numbers and Deuteronomy) _ literally are the word of God, given to
the ancient Israelites through Moses.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's the case, it's immutable; it cannot be reformed or
changed, although it can be reapplied according to new realities.
For example, you don't use a cell phone on the Sabbath for purely
personal reasons, but if it's necessary to save a life, you have to
use it,'' Scheinberg said.
</P>
<P>
   The commandment to protect and preserve human life is primary,
so breaking the Sabbath is not only allowed but required if a life
is at stake.
</P>
<P>
   ``A physician who is on call may drive his car, and a person
who's injured may ride in an ambulance on the Sabbath,'' Stahl
noted.
</P>
<P>
   Jews in the armed forces have no conflict with military duties
on the Sabbath because they're serving their country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're meant to live by the laws, not to die by them,''
Scheinberg said, adding: ``Jewish religious life is practical and
workable. It's both timeless and timely. If the Torah is the word
of God, it's workable in every generation.''

&HT;     SOCIAL SECURITY `REFORM' WOULD HURT WOMEN 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAVID STEINBERG  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ At 65, Social Security is old enough to be
retired, or at least privatized. That's what critics of the system
_ who don't need the benefits _ would insist.
</P>
<P>
   For Republicans and Democrats in this presidential year,
altering or modifying Social Security poses political risks. Pols
know that older Americans vote. Younger citizens protest or
demonstrate rather than vote.
</P>
<P>
   Political wonks say Social Security is ``the third rail of
American politics. Don't touch it.'' When reporters asked Ronald
Reagan about Social Security in the first press conference after
his re-election, Reagan vowed he would never tamper with it.
</P>
<P>
   When Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed the Social Security Act on
Aug. 14, 1935, during the Great Depression, he said, in part:
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, a hope of many years standing is in part fulfilled. We
can never insure 100 percent of the population against 100 percent
of the hazards and vicissitudes of life, but we have tried to frame
a law which will give some measure of protection to the average
citizen and his family . . . against poverty-ridden old age.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, during our continuing prosperity, Republicans and some
Democrats propose ``privatizing'' Social Security. Privatization
would allow participants to invest in the stock market on their
own, or invest in Social Security trust funds. Who will make
investments for the Social Security Administration? How would the
government select stocks? How will gains or losses affect benefits?
</P>
<P>
   In a lecture at the Institute for Health and Aging at the
University of California at San Francisco three years ago, adjunct
professor Shirley Chater, who was commissioner of Social Security
from 1993 to 1997, said that ``trust fund interest will be
sufficient to pay all benefits through 2020.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of Social Security privatization cite the system in
Chile, where workers pay 10 percent of their salary into an
individual retirement account. If they want to retire at an earlier
age, they contribute more. Coverage for survivors adds 3.5 percent
more. Health coverage costs an added 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In her lecture, Chater reported that most Chilean workers ``hire
financial consultants who charge fees of 3 percent to 5 percent to
explain the confusing options.''
</P>
<P>
   The administrative costs of Chile's privatized Social Security
system add up to around 15 percent of revenues, Chater said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our government program,'' Chater noted, ``costs less than 1
percent. To put that in real numbers, the Social Security
Administration spends little more than $3 billion annually to run
the largest social insurance program in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Privatizing Social Security will increase the inequities and
risks,'' said Pat Ox, professor and co-director of the Institute
for Health and Aging. He cites what has happened in the United
Kingdom, where older investors were victimized by unscrupulous
brokers.
</P>
<P>
   The Gerontological Society of America warns that ``older women
are as liable to be poor in 2020 as today's older women unless
Social Security reformers focus more attention on protecting
women's interests.''
</P>
<P>
   ``More than any other constituency, women rely on Social
Security for the lion's share of their retirement income,'' said
Syracuse University economist Timothy M. Smeeding. ``And as a
result, women have the most to lose or gain from impending reform.
Older women living alone are at greatest risk.''
</P>
<P>
   A report by the Gerontological Society urges policymakers and
reformers to be cautious about trading the system's basic insurance
protections for a risky, insecure privatized system, adding, ``the
rewards of privatization are questionable and probably not a good
deal for most women.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gerontological Society acknowledges that Social Security
reform may be necessary, but at the same time, is concerned how
proposed reforms will affect older women.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll Estes, director of the Institute for Health and Aging,
who is on sabbatical to write a book about entitlements,
participated in the Gerontological Society study. ``The challenge
and opportunity facing policymakers,'' Estes said, ``is to explore
ways to strengthen, not weaken, the national retirement system.''

<P>
   EDINBURGH, Scotland _ Rick Miller is, by his own admission,
nuts.
</P>
<P>
   Who in their right mind, after all, would adapt ``Macbeth,'' one
of Shakespeare's greatest plays, by casting Homer Simpson as the
ambitious, tortured Scot?
</P>
<P>
   That Miller's wildly imaginative one-man show ``MacHomer'' is
one of the hits of this year's Edinburgh Fringe Festival is
testimony to the rarefied place that the dysfunctional American
cartoon family the Simpsons occupies in British society.
</P>
<P>
   Next month marks the 10th anniversary of the first episode of
``The Simpsons'' on British television, where it became an
institution and one of the highest-rated programs for a decade. It
is shown every night on the Sky network owned by Rupert Murdoch,
whose Fox network gave birth to ``The Simpsons'' in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   It proved so successful that even the BBC swallowed its distaste
for anything remotely connected to Murdoch and bought the rights to
run weekly repeats. The Friday night repeats have been the
highest-rated program on one BBC channel for years, making ``The
Simpsons'' the only show shown both on a commercial station and the
publicly funded BBC.
</P>
<P>
   In a society that remains stratified by class, the appeal of
``The Simpsons'' cuts across all boundaries. Stephen Hawking, the
British scientist who wrote ``A Brief History of Time,'' calls
``The Simpsons'' the cleverest show on American TV _ before noting
that there isn't much competition.
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago, the Rev. Rowan Williams, the Anglican
archbishop of Wales, told a gathering of bishops that he considers
``The Simpsons'' one of the most moral shows on the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very moral because the good people always win in the
end,'' he said. ``It is a lighthearted look at life and is surreal,
but there are good, strong Christian morals there, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Jones, the Welsh crooner, says he was flattered to be a
``guest'' on one episode. His cartoon character serenades Homer and
Homer's wife, Marge. A Scottish university offers a course called
``Having the Donut and Eating It: Self-Reflexivity and `The
Simpsons.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Miller's stage show, which has drawn rave reviews, exploits the
show's popularity in Britain. The play, which stays faithful to
Shakespeare's plot but fills the roles with the entire cast of
``The Simpsons,'' has been playing to sellout audiences for two
weeks and has another week to go. Miller, a gifted mimic who
premiered the show in his native Montreal and wants to bring it to
the United States, including Boston, does the voices for about 80
characters in the show.
</P>
<P>
   In ``MacHomer,'' Miller has taken poetic license with some of
Shakespeare's most memorable lines. At one point, as he is about to
murder the king, Homer muses: ``Is this a dagger I see before me or
a pizza? Mmmmmm . . . pizza.''
</P>
<P>
   Barney Grumble, the beer-swilling barfly at Moe's, takes the
Macduff role to places Sir Laurence Olivier never did, belching all
the way. Marge's skyscraper blue hair makes Lady Macbeth seem more
sinister. Mr. Burns, the unctuous owner of the nuclear power plant
where Homer works, plays King Duncan, which the audience loves
because the king is murdered.
</P>
<P>
   But after MacHomer stabs the king to death, he immediately
realizes it will be his downfall, shouting, along with many in the
audience, ``Doh!''
</P>
<P>
   Miller, 30, said he knew that revising a Shakespearean classic
with ``The Simpsons'' cast would go over well in Britain. He
believes he could ``Simpsonize'' any great tragedy: Homer as Willy
Loman; Homer as King Lear; Homer as any male lead in any play by
Eugene O'Neill.
</P>
<P>
   ``People here love the Simpsons because everyone in Britain
loves to laugh at Americans,'' he said. ``On another level, the
Simpsons have mythic qualities, they're iconoclasts. The British
are very self-deprecating, so they really get the irony and the
humor. Australians are the same way.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Simpsons are popular all over the world, but it's in the
English-speaking countries where everyone gets all the jokes, all
the nuances.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Britons are alternately attracted to and repelled by
American pop culture, which is so prevalent in British society, so
their infatuation with America's most dysfunctional family, even if
they're just cartoons, is not surprising.
</P>
<P>
   As popular as Miller's play is, the arrival this week of
Simpsons creator Matt Groening and most of those who provide the
voices for the characters led to scenes of hysteria usually
reserved for pop stars. It also caused a rush on tickets at the
Fringe Festival, one of six arts festivals that dominate the
Scottish capital every August. Late in the week, the show moved to
London, and more packed houses at the National Film Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   James Christopher of The Times of London, like other high-brow
British critics, has no problem voicing unreserved enthusiasm for
``The Simpsons'' TV show. He said the Simpsons became icons in
Britain in 1992, when George Bush infamously urged Americans to be
more like the Waltons and less like the Simpsons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sod the Waltons and their sterile virtues,'' said Christopher.
``In Simpsons cartoons, life is not only unfair, it's a ghastly
mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller said British audiences are the most enthusiastic he has
ever seen for ``MacHomer.'' In fact, Miller says anyone who even
has to ask why the Simpsons are so popular in Britain is a moron.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, wait a minute. That means . . .
</P>
<P>
   Doh!

&HT;     EQUALITY BEGINS WITH SOUND EDUCATION 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By HARRY ROSENFELD

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ It is no surprise that affirmative action was
actively discussed at the recent Democratic National Convention.
The issue has had its ups and downs over the years, but it has not
gone away because it has become a shibboleth with multiple
definitions. Today, in some quarters, it has taken on iconic
stature.
</P>
<P>
   To many black Americans it has come to stand for the minimum
infusion of fairness required to redress grievous past wrongs and
to enable minorities to partake fairly in the benefits society has
to offer, whether in jobs or education, or other aspects. This can
best be facilitated by some forms of preferential considerations
for the offended classes, providing goals for integration and
timetables for their attainment.
</P>
<P>
   Critics saw in the practical implementation of some affirmative
action programs the establishment of quotas. Quotas led to the
perception that unqualified people attained positions on the basis
of race or gender rather than ability. There was a white men's
backlash, and the call of reverse discrimination was heard
throughout the land.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, some points in the dispute have been refined,
and adjustments have been made here and there in the implementation
of governmental policies, which stirred up a strong reaction among
those supporting affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, Sen. Joseph Lieberman _ criticized last week for
his stated reservations about racial preference programs _ spoke
out on behalf of affirmative action, proclaiming in his speech to
the convention ``mend it, don't end it,'' without specifying what
he would alter. Vice President Al Gore evinced no reservations in
his own speech, forthrightly supporting affirmative action without
saying more about what he meant.
</P>
<P>
   The courts have disdained rigid quotas and by far the larger
national consensus opposes their imposition, as well as those of
preferences and set-asides. Quotas have come to stand in the wider
public's perception as the institutionalization of an unfairness
today to make up for historic wrongs.
</P>
<P>
   When Mario M. Cuomo was governor of New York, he issued an
executive order for affirmative action in the state work force. He
offered an eloquent rationale for the necessity for affirmative
action to level the playing field for minorities.
</P>
<P>
   But he was once asked: How will we be able to tell when
affirmative action programs have worked and would no longer be
required as a remedy? As best I remember, he responded to the
question but did not answer it.
</P>
<P>
   Absent explicit or implicit quotas, how could Cuomo possibly
have answered the question put to him? Unless the races and the
genders are represented according to their numbers in all desirable
occupations and activities, how can you know that the war has been
won? And that's the abiding problem with some of the affirmative
action programs.
</P>
<P>
   To the contrary and for argument's sake, why shouldn't there be
more African-American teachers than proportionality would provide?
If there were too many black teachers, that would mean that there
would be too few white. The absurdity of racial quota symmetry is
self-evident.
</P>
<P>
   My support for affirmative action is focused on making sure that
every one in America has an equal chance to compete for society's
prizes.
</P>
<P>
   My policy comprises outreach programs to recruit minorities into
occupations in which they are underrepresented because entry has
been denied them or they did not possess requisite qualifications.
Training programs have to be established to help qualify people for
the good jobs and positions _ programs that would be open to
everyone.
</P>
<P>
   In that our school systems are notoriously unequal, contributing
mightily to handicapping minorities, massive efforts have to be
made, and extra funds made available, to bring those schools up to
standard levels.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the affirmative action that I support puts its efforts
into preparing those who are disadvantaged to be able to compete
with those who are not. That is elemental fairness, the basis of
the great American ideal of equal opportunity for all. Without it,
we cannot have a just society. Anything that goes beyond that to
slot Americans on the basis of race or gender is inimical to that
ideal.

IT'S THE FRINGE: 17,000 SHOWS IN 23 DAYS

<P>
   EDINBURGH _ It's New Year's Eve squared, and lasting almost a
month.
</P>
<P>
   Every August, the Scottish capital puts on no fewer than five
international festivals celebrating jazz, opera, theater, film, and
dance. But those festivals are dwarfed by the sixth: It's the
Fringe, which began as a small iconoclastic alternative to the more
formal affairs but over the last 53 years has evolved into the
world's biggest arts festival.
</P>
<P>
   In 23 days, the Fringe stages 17,000 performances of 1,350
different shows of theater, comedy, dance, and music.
</P>
<P>
   Along the Royal Mile, the city's most famous thoroughfare,
jugglers perform, a Dixieland band plays, mime artists stand
perfectly still for hours, African drummers pound out intoxicating
rhythms, unicyclists dart in and out of the crowds. It's almost
dizzying.
</P>
<P>
   There is a symphony, some would say a cacophony, of different
languages, as the Fringe attracts performers and audiences from all
over the world.
</P>
<P>
   The other day, a young Australian walked down the Royal Mile
with a huge inflatable Godzilla on his back _ piggyback gone
monsterback. No one paid him any attention. At the Fringe, he was
more the rule, not the exception.
</P>
<P>
   Like William Wallace, the Scottish revolutionary rebel of
``Braveheart,'' the Fringe organizers are rebels who revel in their
sometimes subversive approach to art. The Fringe began in 1947 as a
protest against the staid traditional theater being staged by the
older festival.
</P>
<P>
   George Wyllie, a sculptor and performance artist, remembers
doing a show called ``Rabbie's Rocket,'' which he described as ``an
existential experiment in sending shortbread into space.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom McGrath, a playwright, said he remembers ``standing on my
head chanting `Hello Edinburgh!' then being shaved with an egg and
a rusty nail'' during one production.
</P>
<P>
   Genres come and go. In 1978, there were 39 mime shows in the
theaters and clubs. Today, the only mimes are performing on the
street for free.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Revell, a comedian, said one night he took in a Garrison
Keillor concert, then was attacked by three thugs outside a fish
and chips shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sort of the sublime height of Garrison Keillor followed by the
extras from Trainspotting,'' said Revell. ``The full gamut of the
Edinburgh experience.''
</P>
<P>
   For performers, Revell said, ``you can have a lot of fun or it
can be hell.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For me the valuable thing is being able to go somewhere for
three weeks with something where you've got a potential audience,''
he said. ``It gives you an opportunity to stretch where you are and
take a chance. If people go up there convinced of fame and fortune,
they're making a big mistake. Obviously it's nice if you get lots
of critical acclaim, but you have to have another reason for going
other than using it as your invite to the party. The opportunity
for experimentation is very important to me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can succeed at the Fringe, you can succeed anywhere,''
said Alistair Moffat, who was the Fringe's administrator between
1976 and 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Actress Emma Thompson got her start here, as did the comics who
would later form the Monty Python comedy troupe. Billy Connolly,
the Scottish comedian, became a star here. Robin Williams appeared
here in 1971 with a California college troupe in ``The Taming of
the Shrew.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, a similar group from Fitchburg State College put on
their version of ``The Tempest,'' and high school students from
across Maine are due to put on Shakespeare works next week.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Gudgin, the Fringe's director, said this year's festival
has ``artists from Hollywood to Hong Kong and everywhere in
between.'' In the various theaters, clubs and bars are 60
children's shows, 264 comedy shows and revues, 72 dance shows, 340
musical gigs, 51 operas and musicals, 39 panel discussions, 479
stage shows, and 45 visual art exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
   Some are good, some are awful, some are weird and painful to
watch.
</P>
<P>
   The Fringe is famous for launching or reviving the careers of
comedians. Rich Hall, an alumnus of American television's
``Saturday Night Live,'' has found new fame here with his alter
ego, Otis Lee Crenshaw, a singing Tennessee jailbird. Hall's shows
are sellouts, and he is widely expected to win this year's award
for best comedy show.
</P>
<P>
   Otis Lee, who wears a Confederate flag bandanna and puts down
his Budweiser only when he plays the piano, says his family was so
poor that ``blues artists used to come to our house when they had
writer's block.''
</P>
<P>
   As Otis Lee put it, ``To call my family white trash would be an
insult to Styrofoam.''
</P>
<P>
   After his show Wednesday night, Hall signed copies of his CD,
which includes a love song about prison rape called ``He Almost
Looks Like You,'' and explained why he likes playing the Fringe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The audiences are great, real smart. They want you to push the
envelope. They expect you to,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, not everybody loves the Fringe. In Rutherford's, a
working-man's pub sandwiched between several of the artsy venues,
the bartender said he and his customers hate it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a nightmare for a month,'' he complained.
</P>
<P>
   But most people here seem to thrive on the buzz generated by the
Fringe and the other festivals.
</P>
<P>
   Ian Walker, a feisty monarchist who argues with his
independence-minded customers behind the Waverly Bar he has run for
as long as the Fringe has been held, said August is magical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where else in the world does a city have a party for a
month?'' asked Walker. ``You're not going to get me in one of those
weird plays, and certainly not that show where those two
Australians expose themselves. But, for the buzz, there's no place
like Edinburgh in August.''

DVD GIVES `SHANE' A NEW SHINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL BLOWEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ON DVD: ``Shane'' _ If you've watched this classic Western
recently on VHS, be aware that it's not an accurate version of
director George Stevens's magnificent parable. The VHS edition,
patched together with bits and pieces of old 35mm footage, is a
disgrace. Fortunately, the situation has been remedied with a
sparkling new DVD edition that looks as crisp as the movie did when
it was released in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Ladd, in the title role, stars as a gunfighter trying to
put his past behind him in the new American West of families and
homesteads. While Ladd gives a gritty, internalized performance, on
the DVD commentary track the director's son, George Stevens Jr.,
reveals that his father's first choice to play Shane was Montgomery
Clift. But Clift decided to do ``From Here to Eternity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Shane'' is a story that obviously appealed to the undeservedly
underrated Stevens, who was a master of personalizing the big
picture. Shane symbolized America during a time when the country
was struggling to evolve from a nation of rugged individualism into
a country of community and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately, I had a good 35mm print of `Shane,' '' said
Stevens Jr. from his office in Los Angeles earlier this week. ``We
also had a disc of Victor Young's music and some of the technicolor
negative. And we managed to pull together a beautiful DVD.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens Jr., who was on the set of ``Shane,'' was the first
director of the American Film Institute and has always been at the
forefront of film preservation.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father always believed that a well-made film would have a
life of its own,'' he said. ``And people would say that he took a
long time to make a picture. One time I wondered why we didn't just
finish the picture and go home. He said to me to remember the
man-hours that go into watching the film _ `Isn't it a good
investment for the people for us to give them the best we can?' ''
</P>
<P>
   He also recalls the night ``A Place in the Sun,'' his father's
adaptation of Theodore Dreiser's ``An American Tragedy,'' won six
1951 Oscars, including best director.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember sitting in the front seat of the car with my father
driving _ that says something _ and the Oscar between us,'' he
said. ``I was very excited, but my father said something very
important. `You know, we'll have a better idea of how good this
picture is 25 years from now.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, Jr. is finishing up a DVD for ``The Greatest Story Ever
Told'' and moving on plans to do the same for ``A Place in the
Sun.'' When he's done restoring the films, he will have also gone a
long way toward establishing his father's reputation among the
front ranks of the nation's finest filmmakers.

CUTTING LOOSE WITH SEUSS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN ANDERMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's 10 o'clock on a warm summer morning, and the haphazard
flurries of activity in a certain light-filled rehearsal studio in
lower Manhattan are like something out of a surrealist novel.
</P>
<P>
   At least six things are happening simultaneously. A pair of
young men are singing scales as they promenade across the floor, a
small group of dancers twists their bodies into pretzels, several
serious-looking people are hurriedly scribbling notes, a pianist
and drummer play in the corner, two children are enthusiastically
ripping foam rubber into chunks (later to become a field of
clover), and a small army is trouble-shooting the persistent
problem of General Ghengis Khan Schmidt's drooping crop.
</P>
<P>
   This cacophony of movement and sound is, in fact, something out
of a book _ or rather a pile of books that are stacked on a long
wooden table bisecting a corner of the studio. Bound in apple
greens and cherry reds, each is filled with impossible creatures,
incredible adventures, and several hundred rhyming vocabulary
words. It is perhaps the unlikeliest source material for a
multimillion dollar theatrical production since T. S. Eliot's
feline-inspired poetry gave us the ubiquitous musical ``Cats.'' But
it soon becomes clear that these slim, well-thumbed volumes also
supply the indomitable spirit and surprising soul of the monumental
undertaking called ``Seussical.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years in the making, ``Seussical'' _ which comes to the
Colonial Theatre in Boston Aug. 27 for three weeks of previews
before opening on Broadway at the Richard Rogers Theatre in
November _ is a musical reweaving of some of Dr. Seuss's most
famous stories and characters. Written by Lynn Ahrens and Stephen
Flaherty, the Tony Award-winning team behind ``Ragtime,'' the
play's central character is Horton the Elephant, played by Kevin
Chamberlin. Although the honorable pachyderm may not be as deeply
ingrained in the cultural conscience as the wily Cat in the Hat, or
the irrepressible culinary curator Sam-I-Am of ``Green Eggs and
Ham'' fame, Horton emerged early on as the logical star of the
show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both `Horton Hears a Who' and `Horton Hatches the Egg' are
stories with dramatic structure, with beginnings, middles, and
ends,'' says Ahrens, chatting in an airy annex adjacent to the
rehearsal studio. ``There's a conflict, there's a hero, there are
bad guys. It just seemed like the perfect framework.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporting characters and cameos abound. Mere mention of the
names _ Mayzie, Gertrude McFuzz, Yertle the Turtle, the Lorax, JoJo
(the tiniest Who in Whoville, who co-stars with Horton in
``Seussical''), and the iconic Cat, a roving master of ceremonies
played by theatrical clown and Dorchester native David Shiner _
bring a smile to the face of anyone _ and that includes most of the
Western world _ who's read Seuss.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Ahrens, Flaherty, and Monty Python alumnus Eric Idle,
who conceived the show together, shut themselves up in a room for a
week batting around ideas and reading the books out loud to one
another. ``Just hearing the words, the language, the rhymes, the
rhythms . . . there's something about the pure pleasure of the
sound,'' says Flaherty. ``All of a sudden the language came alive
with the sense of what the show could be.''
</P>
<P>
   But full of mirth and whimsy as this production is, by
definition, its creative team is bound by a proportional sense of
reverence for the material and its creator.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that people are beguiled by the playfulness of the
images and the nonsense of the language,'' says director Frank
Galati, whose Tony Award-winning adaptation of ``The Grapes of
Wrath'' and many opera stagings seem a world away from
``Seussical.'' But Galati can hardly manage to finish a sandwich
between heartfelt proclamations about the depth of meaning in
Springfield native Theodore Geisel's deceptively simple tales.
``People are not as conscious of the fact that almost all of his
stories have a moral center. They have an emotional current, and
are about the most profound human values. (``Seussical'') is about
the steadfastness of the human heart. It's about keeping a
promise.''
</P>
<P>
   After lunch, the cast gathers around a television to watch
Esther Williams videos. They ooh and aah over the synchronized
swimmers, alternately giggling at the kitsch and concentrating on
the fluid motion they'll be asked to incorporate into their dancing
during the McElligot's Pool scene, a ballet for fish that
choreographer Kathleen Marshall is staging. Marshall wants it
soupy, she says. Hands open. Palms up. She is hoping to inspire her
dancers to move in a way that looks more like skimming water than
passing through air.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything's a little off, a little odd, slightly from another
planet,'' says Marshall. `` We're not locked to a specific time of
place or style. It's not New York City in the 1940s. So this is not
necessarily movement that you would see in a traditional musical.''
Indeed, the fish ballet is intricately off-kilter, and crooked as
it is graceful. It's purposely nonsensical and oddly purposeful all
at once.
</P>
<P>
   The characters may have flippers for hands and speak in
nursery-school verse, but the topics covered in Seuss books span
prejudice, environmental havoc, and escalation of arms. And
everyone involved with this musical, it seems, is honoring the
extraordinary blend of childlike wonder and adult consciousness
that Geisel crafted with a handful of words and as many primary
colors. &QL; 
 &QL; 
The whole of the parts &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Maintaining the integrity of what is perhaps the world's most
familiar and beloved children's literature, while at the same time
creating a fresh, original piece of theater, is as great a
challenge, all agree, as it is a privilege.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think first we had to recognize as a team that we had to
satisfy certain expectations, that we couldn't turn our backs on
the millions of fans who know what the characters look like, how
the Cat in the Hat behaves, that he has a big red bow tie and a
striped hat.'' says Galati. ``If you know that the Jungle of Nool
is red and green, why go elsewhere?'' Galati refers to a model of
the Jungle of Nool perched on a table in the corner. In fact, four
red leaves and one enormous green leaf hang down into black space.
</P>
<P>
   But that's where the transliteration stops. Surrounding the set
model, the studio walls are plastered with sketches of costume
designs that fall somewhere between the pages of Seuss, the pages
of Vogue, and a shopping mall on Mars. Flounced, fringed, feathered
frocks come in candy pinks and inky blues. Skirts fall up. Shirts
hang sideways. Headpieces jut into the air like confused
appendages. Four-fingered gloves, or fins, or silky claws, cover
hands. Horton, however _ a working-class guy, Galati points out, a
beast of burden _ will be wearing gray sweats and work boots. Rhyme
and reason have been skewered with a distinctly Seussian sense of
nonsense, and the collision makes perfect sense to Galati.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing that's fundamental, to me, in Dr. Seuss is that
there's a clean edge of page around every composition of images.
There's never a frame, there's never a border. The world that's
evoked on the page goes off beyond the page, so that the
characters, if they leaped any further, are going to be off in the
void. In a very subtle way, it invites the reader into a world
that's way bigger than what can be contained on the page.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Jumping off &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By Flaherty's calculation, more than 95 percent of the play _
both book and music _ is written in rhyme. ``Dr. Seuss has such a
strong literary style that if you were to hear a naturalistic
scene, all of a sudden it wouldn't be Seuss anymore,'' he explains.
``So the challenge is trying to do something in the spirit of the
books, to not write the same thing but to use the books as a
jumping-off point.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Flaherty composed music that's painted in the same
wildly bright colors as the sets and costumes. ``Basically, there
are no rules in Seuss, so you can make any musical choice and it
would be valid,'' says Flaherty, who says that ``Seussical'' is
``the most pop thing I've ever done. The jungle world is a whole
variety of funk sounds, for example, sort of an Isaac Hayes thing.
In the world of the Whos, those drawings are a lot like little
wheels that talk, they have these gizmos and this sort of
free-associating, and Spike Jones crossed my mind _ the idea that
he would have these very idiosyncratic musical sound effects.
Gertrude McFuzz, she's more of a . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   ``Joan Baez!'' Ahrens interjects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Exactly. I have this vision of her strumming a guitar in a
coffeehouse.''
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Ahrens biggest apprehension was how she was going
to match the work of a master. ``He's one of the world's greatest
lyricists,'' Ahrens says, ``and I took such liberties.'' Her fears
were quelled, however, when Geisel's widow, Audrey, attended a
workshop for ``Seussical'' last summer in Toronto. ``She told me
that she couldn't tell where his voice left off and where mine
began,'' Ahrens recalls.
</P>
<P>
   The actors, as well, profess an inordinate identification with
their roles _ never mind the fact that they're playing animals.
``I'm simple like Horton,'' says Kevin Chamberlin, a Tony nominee
this year for ``Dirty Blonde.'' ``I'm very outgoing and honest and
open emotionally. I've always been Mr. Nice Guy, and I've been
taken advantage of, too.''
</P>
<P>
   While Ahrens marvels at David Shiner's uncanny Cat smile, and
Flaherty can't believe how his eyes are always moving _ Shiner
himself (a veteran of Cirque du Soleil and a creator, with Bill
Irwin, of the Broadway show ``Fool Moon'') says the connection with
the Cat in the Hat is more than skin-deep. ``The Cat is a
trickster, sort of mysterious and sort of Zen,'' he expains. ``He
comes in and freaks the kids out and then fixes it in the end. He
causes anarchy and makes you think. You never know what he's up to.
He's very, very clown.''
</P>
<P>
   By early afternoon, things are quieting down in the rehearsal
studio. The dancers are swimming like fish. The orchestrator, Doug
Besterman, has figured out how to combine foghorns, cuckoo clocks,
crickets, and trumpets into a soundscape that suggests a tiny
planet on a speck of dust. Marshall has taped General Ghengis Khan
Schmidt's drooping crop to his wrist, so that when he leads the
troops in a rousing chant of ``I do not like green eggs and ham! /
I do not like them Sam-I-Am!'' it pierces the air rather than
falling to his side.
</P>
<P>
   Galati is beaming. ``You can never plan it and you can never
really create it,'' he says of a show that works. ``Sometimes you
walk into a room and there is just a sense of order, purpose,
tremendous joy, friendliness, and warmth. It's like the story of
the Lorax. It's about taking a seed and planting it. Give it fresh
water and clean air. Plant it in your heart and let it grow there,
because if you do then you'll become a person who is rewarded
because he or she lives in gratitude for this brief adventure we've
been granted.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ Gathered in a city park, re-creating a fire ceremony
they called the oldest ritual known to humans, a group of
Aboriginal activists gave voice last week to their smoldering
grievances.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have waged an undeclared war against our people,'' said
Isabell Coe, a veteran Aboriginal leader. ``We want to end this
war. This is about peace and justice. This is what we want, and
this is what our fire represents.''
</P>
<P>
   She then led 30 people, an equal number of Aborigines and white
supporters, in placing green eucalyptus branches on the fire.
Fragrant plumes of smoke framed her as she hugged each participant.
</P>
<P>
   Coe is the woman behind an Aboriginal ``tent embassy,'' which
has occupied Victoria Park near central town Sydney since July. The
encampment is a ragtag reminder of the plight of Australia's first
people, a tiny, downtrodden minority on a continent they once had
to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   As the world turns to Sydney for next month's Olympic Games, Coe
and other Aboriginal activists hope to use the attention to win
global support for their cause and, in turn, shame the government
into making concessions ranging from limited sovereignty and cash
reparations to a full apology for what Aborigines call the
genocidal policies of the past.
</P>
<P>
   It is no accident, therefore, that the tent embassy, a
collection of 30-odd tents around a light pole where Coe has hung
the red, yellow, and black Aboriginal flag, went up in a prime
location on the route from downtown to Homebush Bay, the Olympic
site. Nor is it coincidence that another Aboriginal protest, a
human chain, is planned at the airport around the time the Games
begin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world will be on our doorstep for the first time in the
history of white Australia, and probably black Australia, too. All
we want to do is educate the world about the truth,'' said Jenny
Munro, chairwoman of Sydney's Metropolitan Local Aboriginal Land
Council, a leading organizer of the planned Olympic protests.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating matters on both sides is the fact that Australia's
favorite Olympian and best chance for a gold medal, world 400-meter
track champion Cathy Freeman, is an Aborigine.
</P>
<P>
   Aboriginal leaders have been torn between wanting to stage
dramatic protests for the two-week Olympiad, from Sept. 15 to Oct.
1, and fearing they might diminish ``Cathy's Games.'' Several
months ago, a leader promised violent uprisings and ``Burn baby,
burn'' at the Olympics, only to soften his stand under pressure
from his constituents.
</P>
<P>
   For white Australians, Freeman's enormous popularity in this
sports-crazed nation has forced a reexamination of attitudes toward
a people often stereotyped as drunken layabouts or pathetic
primitives. Those attitudes are directly challenged by bus shelter
ads throughout Sydney for Qantas Airways. They show Freeman's face
and the words, ``The Spirit of Australia.''
</P>
<P>
   The story of Australia's Aborigines has echoes of both the
Native American and the African-American experiences. But in many
ways their struggle is as distinct as the flora and fauna that
flourish here and nowhere else.
</P>
<P>
   By most accounts, Aborigines arrived here, probably from
Southeast Asia, 50,000 years ago. Then over time they spread out
into perhaps 600 tribes, with different dialects and languages.
They roamed the land for 50 millennia, hunting, gathering, etching
art into rocks, and telling stories of the Dreamtime, when
``creation ancestors'' formed the physical and spiritual worlds.
</P>
<P>
   That all changed in 1778, 18 years after Captain James Cook, the
explorer, claimed Australia for Britain. Eleven ships arrived in
Sydney bearing 1,500 people, half of them convicts from overcrowded
British jails and the rest soldiers and free settlers. Clashes
began almost immediately, and British guns trumped tribal spears;
most encounters ended disastrously for the Aborigines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to understand that, unlike the Native
Americans, Aborigines didn't have anything the white settlers
wanted,'' said Andrew Markus, an authority on aboriginal history
and associate professor at Monash University in Melbourne.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Europeans had the convicts, so they didn't need labor. The
Aborigines didn't cultivate food or have commodities, so they
didn't have that to offer either. Almost from day one, Europeans
saw Aborigines as excess to requirements, and that has affected all
dealings and attitudes since.''
</P>
<P>
   Killings and other crimes against Aborigines often went
unpunished. It was not until 1962 that Aborigines won the right to
vote, and they have been counted in the census only since 1967. It
was not until 1992 that courts recognized that Aborigines owned
Australia before whites arrived.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Today &LR;  there are 500,000 Aborigines in Australia, about the
same number as when the Europeans landed, while the overall
population has topped 19 million.
</P>
<P>
   By almost every measure, Aborigines are at the bottom of
economic and social scales of one of the world's richest nations.
Life expectancy is 20 years below the rest of the population,
infant mortality is five times higher, and Aborigines are 20 times
more likely to be imprisoned at some point in their lives. National
unemployment fell to 6.3 percent last month, the lowest level in a
decade, but the official Aboriginal jobless rate was four times as
high. Aboriginal leaders say the true rate is 51 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Most Aborigines live in remote settlements. But in the Sydney
neighborhood of Redfern, an Aborigine slum of several hundred
families, a 10-minute drive from downtown, the center is ``The
Block,'' an urban war zone of decrepit two-story homes awash in
angry graffiti. A burned-out car rusts on a sidewalk, and abandoned
houses are bricked up lest drug addicts use them as shooting
galleries.
</P>
<P>
   One  &UR; afternoon &LR;  last week, a young Aborigine woman in a Reebok
sweatshirt walked to a white van, where she exchanged a used needle
for a clean one. Then, in the middle of the sidewalk, she paused
and rolled up her sleeve. With a stony nonchalance, she injected
herself with heroin she had purchased from a nearby open-air drug
market. A crowd of young men huddled in an alley. Across the
street, three older Aborigines sat drinking beer and watching the
rain.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the part of Sydney that doesn't exist,'' said Doug
Dixon, 43, an activist who grew up in Redfern. ``They want visitors
to take the ride from the airport to the Olympics, and maybe
downtown. They don't want you to see any of this.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Olympics approach, an issue that has generated much of
the passion is the suffering of Aborigines from what is known as
the ``stolen generation.'' From the early 1900s to as late as 1970,
the government encouraged young indigenous people, particularly
those with lighter skin, to be taken from their families and raised
in orphanages or by white families. Estimates of the number of
children affected range from 30,000 to 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   One of those was Cecil Bowden, 60, who was taken to a children's
home with an older sister and younger brother when their mother
died in childbirth.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was taken,'' Bowden said, ``my father was fighting for
Australia in the Second World War. I had a lot of family who could
have taken us until he returned, but we didn't have rights even to
our own children.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden remembered terrible beatings at the hands of white
caretakers for small or imagined infractions. He remembered seeing
his father turned away, empty-handed, when he came home from war
and tried to claim Bowden from a boys' home.
</P>
<P>
   The policy has become a rallying cry for Aborigines seeking an
apology, and perhaps cash reparations, from the government of Prime
Minister John Howard. For many, the unrequited desire to hear
Howard say the word ``sorry'' has taken on almost mythic
importance. The issue got a boost last month when Freeman, who had
been relatively silent on political issues as she gained athletic
fame, criticized the Howard government for its refusal to apologize
and revealed that her grandmother was a member of the stolen
generation.
</P>
<P>
   Howard, though, has been steadfast in refusing to apologize,
offering only ``regrets,'' interpreted here as modest sympathy, not
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not willing to apologize for things my government and my
generation of Australians didn't do,'' he said earlier this year.
Observers said the government also is concerned that a formal
apology might open the way for billions of dollars in financial
claims. Howard also has rejected calls to negotiate a treaty with
Aborigines, saying such agreements are only appropriate between
nations.
</P>
<P>
   Howard's minister for Aboriginal affairs, John Herron, inflamed
the debate when he challenged use of the term ``stolen
generation,'' saying that by some estimates the policy affected
only 10 percent of Aborigine children.
</P>
<P>
   Aborigines reacted angrily to what they called an insult of
semantics, particularly since Herron ostensibly represents their
interests. Senator Aden Ridgeway, the only Aborigine in Australia's
Parliament, said in an interview that Herron's comments were ``like
denying the Holocaust.''
</P>
<P>
   Herron did not respond to requests for an interview, but
government officials staunchly defend their treatment of
Aborigines. About $1.5 billion is being spent this year on
programs, mostly involving health, education, housing, and economic
development, for Aborigines.
</P>
<P>
   They also say Aborigines have been given title to more than 15
percent of the continent, although most of the land is in the
remote and inhospitable Northern Territory. The government also has
set up a nearly $1 billion land fund for urban Aborigines.
</P>
<P>
   Howard, a conservative who came to power in 1996, apparently has
not suffered for his stands. Polls have shown a majority of
Australians agree with him, with one survey finding that 62 percent
reject the idea of an apology for past wrongs.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are signs that white Australians have been moved by
the stolen generation reports. Some 200,000 joined a march for
racial healing in June across the Sydney Harbor Bridge, the largest
demonstration here since the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   The bridge march came after it was widely acknowledged that a
decade-long effort called Reconciliation had not achieved its goal
of a racially united Australia. The hope, perhaps naive in
retrospect, had been that black-white relations could be fully
mended in time for next year's 100th anniversary of Australian
independence.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond apologies, the Aborigines' bid for compensation dimmed
this month when a federal court ruled against two members of the
stolen generation seeking compensation in a test case. The judge
said they had failed to show the government had not acted in their
best interests.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Olympic organizers have tried desperately to avoid
the controversy and to appease aboriginal interests. They are
flying the Aboriginal flag at the Olympic site, cosponsoring an
indigenous culture pavilion, giving Aborigines a major role in an
Olympics Arts Festival, and incorporating the boomerang, an
Aboriginal hunting tool, in the official Olympic logo. The first
Aborigine gold medalist, women's hockey player Nova Peris-Kneebone,
was chosen as the first runner to carry the torch on Australian
soil.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, most Aborigines say the Olympic spotlight on
Sydney is too good an opportunity to miss.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been some good will and good intentions,'' said
Ridgeway, an Aborigine who is a member of Parliament. ``But it's
one thing to embrace the icons of aboriginality and it's quite
another to embrace the people and the rights to which they are
entitled. Some people may resent it, but we are going beyond good
will gestures and demanding more.''

MUCH AT STAKE FOR BARAK, ARAFAT, CLINTON IN JERUSALEM ACCORD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ This place has always been more than just a city. It
is a path to redemption, a spiritual ideal, a quest.
</P>
<P>
   Its Herodian stones were remembered in songs of exile for 2,000
years while the Jewish people prayed to return, a yearning captured
every year at the Passover seder with the affirmation: ``Next year
in Jerusalem!''
</P>
<P>
   Its ramparts were stormed in the Crusaders' military quest to
reclaim the land from Islam, a bloody and barbaric campaign that
certainly missed the point of Jesus' message of a ``New
Jerusalem,'' not a place but an idea of a new covenant between God
and the world's people.
</P>
<P>
   It was a shining example of tolerance for Muslims when the
legendary military leader Saladin finally defeated the Crusaders
and yet treated them mercifully in the city that in Arabic is
simply called Al Quds, ``The Holy,'' and where tradition holds the
prophet Mohammed ascended to heaven.
</P>
<P>
   So when Israeli and Palestinian leaders gathered at Camp David
at the invitation of President Clinton last month they entered a
continuum of history, a timeless search in Judaism, Christianity,
and Islam for the idea of Jerusalem _ both earthly and celestial.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat are expected before the end of the summer to try again to
resume negotiations and to persevere in their efforts to find a
solution on Jerusalem that could open the door to ending 52 years
of conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The dynamic that seems to keep Barak, Arafat, and Clinton at the
table is that all three _ each in his own way _ sees in an
agreement on Jerusalem a form of national redemption, and, perhaps
equally important, a way to personal political survival.
</P>
<P>
   For Barak, Israel's most highly decorated soldier, it is
carrying out the ultimate military order directly handed to him by
the people who elected him _ to achieve a lasting peace. He wants
to bring a close to the conflict over East Jerusalem and the Old
City, which Israel captured from Jordan in the 1967 Six Day War.
</P>
<P>
   For Arafat, it is the final quest of his dream to declare an
independent state of Palestine with East Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
   His personal motivation is as much about the religious
significance of Jerusalem to Muslims and Christians (about 2
percent of Palestinians are Christian) as it is about the yearning
of a vanquished people to return home, and for international
justice to prevail.
</P>
<P>
   How the two sides are going to get there and whether they'll
survive the domestic political gantlet along the way, remains
uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   But getting them there is Bill Clinton's quest, his shot at
redemption. In the end of the days of his presidency, Clinton has
worked tirelessly to achieve this. On some level, it seems
Clinton's yearning for peace in Jerusalem is an effort to find a
path that might also redeem his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   A Southern Baptist who has sought refuge in faith in the most
trying moments of his presidency, Clinton denies that his
motivations are personal. But he does express a messianic streak in
trying to find a solution to a conflict over ``the holiest place in
the world,'' as he put it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if anybody else will ever put the time in on this
that I have, or have the kind of personal, almost religious
conviction I have about it,'' Clinton said in an interview with
Israeli Television on July 27.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey Cox, a professor of theology at Harvard University's
Divinity School attending a conference in Jerusalem, said, ``It
comes from all the stuff you learn from Sunday school as a Baptist.
The focus is on the life of Jesus, on his Sermon on the Mount where
he said, `Blessed are the peacemakers.' The fascination with the
living example of Jesus is utterly central to a Baptist, and Bill
Clinton, I suspect, has that.''
</P>
<P>
   The spirit of religion certainly seemed present in Clinton's
Israeli Television interview, a unique forum in which Clinton spoke
directly to the Israeli people for a half hour, saying, ``There has
to be a way to identify the legitimate interests _ and there are
legitimate interests on both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   To find the way, all three leaders will have to confront a
historic and almost mystical truth about Jerusalem. That is,
Jerusalem is a singular place in the world where no one has the
ultimate claim, and that those who rule over it do not do so
comfortably or confidently.
</P>
<P>
   The Romans, the Byzantines, the Crusaders, the Ottomans, the
British, and now the Israelis have all been consumed with revolts
against their rule.
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II, who has spent a good deal of the last year
seeking forgiveness for the Roman Catholic Church's sponsorship of
the Crusades that killed untold thousands of Muslims and Jews, has
urged Israelis and Palestinians to recognize that jealous struggles
for Jerusalem have caused violence in history _ and could in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   He has reiterated the Vatican position held since 1967 that
Israel's annexation of East Jerusalem violates international law
and that both sides should create a special status for the holy
sites with international guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do not overlook the importance of the spiritual dimension of
the city of Jerusalem,'' the pope said in an address to the leaders
last month. ``The Holy See continues to maintain that only a
special statute, internationally guaranteed, can effectively
preserve the most sacred areas of the Holy City.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of international control dates to at least 1947, when
rival claims were so intense that the United Nations partition plan
that gave birth to modern Israel called for Jerusalem to fall under
international control.
</P>
<P>
   But after the Arab-Israeli war of 1948, the city was divided by
a corridor of barbed wire and sand bags known as the ``green line''
that separated the west, under Israeli control, from the east,
under Jordanian rule. Under the Jordanians, Jews were not permitted
to cross the green line to enter the Old City.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians see the Vatican position as bolstering their
argument that Israel's capture of East Jerusalem and the Old City
violates United Nations Security Council Resolution 242 and that
Israel must fully withdraw to be in compliance with international
law.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it is the position of most countries of the world,
including Israel's strongest ally, the United States, not to
recognize Israel's annexation of East Jerusalem. This is why the
United States and almost all foreign embassies are in Tel Aviv, not
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis reject the proposal for international control of
the city outright and insist that ``since Israel has controlled the
holy sites, freedom of access and worship has never been greater,''
as a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry put it in a press release.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians challenge this oft-stated Israeli position,
saying that when Israeli border police close the West Bank for
``security reasons'' or when they deny Palestinians travel permits
from Gaza, they are inhibiting freedom of worship.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the late King Hussein of Jordan had it right in his
proposal at the time when he signed a peace agreement with Israel
in 1994, that Jerusalem should not be under the full sovereignty of
any government, only of ``God.'' Everyone else, Hussein argued,
would have administrative responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   It was not a proposal taken seriously at Camp David, and when
reporters ask the secular political leadership on both sides they
smirk and assume the question is a joke. But if you ask religious
leadership on either side, you get a nod in agreement and it seems
like possible ground to cultivate a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Hannan Ashrawi, a Palestinian legislator who is devoutly secular
and nominally Christian, said, ``This issue of sovereignty
belonging to God is very hard to define, I mean, who will issue
visas? We really need to be more worldly and terrestrial.''
</P>
<P>
   Ariel Sharon, Israel's legendary hawk and leader of the
conservative Likud Party, has seized on the issue of Jerusalem in
an effort to topple Barak's government, and it may well work.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Sharon says he is ``not at all religious,'' has
not stopped him from organizing the ``Jerusalem Coalition,'' made
up largely of religious parties and Likud to prevent Barak from
granting any form of sovereignty _ even shared sovereignty _ over
any part of Jerusalem to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   In her book ``Jerusalem: One City, Three Faiths,'' Karen
Armstrong, a Pulitzer Prize winning author, offers a history lesson
for the leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we look back on the long history of Jerusalem, the
societies that have lasted the longest there have, generally, been
the ones that were prepared for some kind of tolerance and
coexistence in the holy city,'' Armstrong writes. ``That, rather
than a sterile and deadly struggle for sovereignty and total
victory, must be the way to celebrate Jerusalem's sanctity today.''

ON ONE MAIN STREET, A FRESH LOOK AT GORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By YVONNE ABRAHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEBSTER GROVES, Mo. _ For Jim Russell, the kiss sealed the deal.
</P>
<P>
   That long kiss Vice President Al Gore gave to his wife, Tipper,
as he came to the stage Thursday night, that silent declaration of
difference from President Clinton, said ``I'm my own man'' for
Russell more than any words Gore spoke, though Russell was
impressed by those as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't fake that kiss,'' said Russell, a mental health
counselor. ``You would have been able to see through it if
President and Hillary Clinton had done it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Gore seems like he really loves his wife and she loves
him. That long kiss, against the backdrop of the hideous things
Clinton did, for me, it's important that the president set that
tone, as a family man.''
</P>
<P>
   So, as much as it pained him to turn his back on his hero,
former president George Bush, and his son, George W. Bush, Russell
was putting himself in Gore's column. Not just for this
post-convention week, but all the way to November.
</P>
<P>
   Pundits say the conventions don't count for much any more. But
residents of Webster Groves have been watching, and with less
cynicism than one might expect.
</P>
<P>
   Some saw hours of both conventions, though storms cut power to
some streets during Gore's speech. Others dropped in now and then.
And in interviews with 15 residents after the Democratic event,
even those who professed not to care a jot about the conventions
had read about them, or had seen highlights on television, and knew
as much as those who had seen them live.
</P>
<P>
   Seven weeks ago, when a reporter visited Webster Groves before
the GOP convention, residents seemed inspired by neither candidate.
Most of the voters interviewed were leaning toward Bush, mostly
because of their dislike for Clinton, and to a lesser extent, Gore,
or because of their fondness for Bush's father.
</P>
<P>
   While the conventions changed no minds among fierce party
loyalists, they persuaded several undecided voters to take a new
look at Gore, whose acceptance speech was still fresh in their
minds.
</P>
<P>
   That mirrors the results of new polls showing Gore is catching
up with, or passing, Bush.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, no one knows how long that effect will last as the
campaign continues through the next 11 weeks. But while some
residents of Webster Groves say anything can happen between now and
November, they know what most appeals to them now. And what they
liked best in both conventions, they said, was sincerity, big-tent
talk, and Caroline Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Voters in this pretty, tree-filled town 15 miles southeast of
St. Louis are just the kind of people each party had hoped to reach
during the conventions. Webster Groves is in the middle of the
country geographically, economically, and racially _ exactly the
kind of town each candidate must win if he is to prevail in
November.
</P>
<P>
   According to past elections, voters in this swing town are
divided evenly between Democrats and Republicans. As Webster Groves
goes, so goes St. Louis County, and as St. Louis County goes, so
goes Missouri, a bellwether state that both parties agree is
crucial to victory this year.
</P>
<P>
   Among some of these voters, Gore succeeded in turning what might
be his greatest liability into a strength on Thursday. By recasting
a perceived charisma deficit as proof of his sincere commitment,
Gore removed a strong objection from one Cedar Groves resident,
Bill Reyland.
</P>
<P>
   Reyland, a musician, was undecided seven weeks ago. Back then,
all he knew of the candidates was their personalities, and he
preferred Bush's toughness to Gore's blankness. After the speech on
Thursday, however, Reyland was inclined toward Gore, mostly because
of his policies, but also because of Gore's disarming admission
that he is ``not the most exciting'' politician.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore doesn't speak with a lot of fire, but the things he was
saying was what I wanted to hear,'' Reyland said. He liked Gore's
policies on the environment, the economy, and education.
</P>
<P>
   Russell agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``So he's not the greatest speaker in the world,'' he said.
``Clinton is, and I'm not pleased with what he's done.''
</P>
<P>
   From the convention, the 44-year-old Russell learned a lot about
Gore that he admired: that the vice president had not only worn a
uniform but had actually served in Vietnam, for example. And that
he had worked hard all his life, which ``means a lot to a guy in
Missouri.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell has said that either man would make a good president,
and the conventions didn't change his mind. But he went for Gore
``just listening to him,'' because of his commitment, and because
of his stances on social issues and mental health.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Russell said he couldn't remember anything he might
have learned from Bush's speech, and little from the Republican
Convention in general. ``Cognitive dissonance is kicking in,'' he
said with a laugh. ``I'm erasing it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Casanova, 55, who usually votes Republican and said he had
seen about a half-hour of the conventions, also had to allow that
Gore ``seems to be finding a way to loosen up,'' but added: ``He's
still a stiff.''
</P>
<P>
   But he's a sincere stiff, wife Judy added.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican Convention seemed so much more packaged than
the Democratic,'' said Judy Casanova, also 55. ``The Republicans
were saying, `This is what you want to hear.' I don't think any of
us believe anything any of them say, but it's who lies the best.
Bush's speech was packaged. He still smirks.''
</P>
<P>
   Undecided in July, she said she is now leaning toward Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of the delegates at the Democratic Convention,
Casanova was looking for emotion, and she got it when Gore brought
real people into his speech, pointing out families in the audience
who would be helped by his policies. With those families, Casanova
said, Gore gave her an emotional tug toward his policies.
</P>
<P>
   For others, Caroline Kennedy, the sole surviving member of John
F. Kennedy's family, provided an emotional moment, even though
Kennedy herself shunned emotion. Even John Streeter, 71, a Bush
devotee and a Republican to his bones, had to admit she was a good
selection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that Caroline tried to dissociate Gore with Clinton
and associate him with Jack Kennedy, who is extremely popular
regardless of party,'' he said. ``She sounded very sincere and she
probably did more for Gore's image than anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about what they had seen as highlights of both
conventions, almost all of the voters interviewed began with the
Democratic event, and could remember little from the Republican
one.
</P>
<P>
   They did remember, however, that both conventions were saturated
with appeals to a wide variety of voters, including minorities, a
fact noted with some satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made tremendous strides,'' Russell said. ``We're at a
time when we need to include everybody. But I wonder if the party
really will accept different folks in the long run.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to impugn Bush's integrity, but he needs to speak
to the issues of America,'' said Otha Lee Davis, 55, an
African-American who owns Lee's BBQ Plus. ``They stand against
everything that would help minorities. Colin Powell alone addressed
that issue.''
</P>
<P>
   At the OT Hodge Chile Parlor, the mostly retired wags who
breakfast there most mornings were a little more cynical than their
neighbors. They all watch politics carefully, they said, and
they're wise to strategy. They were nostalgic for the thrust and
parry of the old days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked it when the bosses ran everything in the back rooms,''
said Joe Kelly, 73, the devout Democrat of the group. ``It was more
democratic then, and there was less money involved.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, well the primaries ruined that,'' said Joe Bante, 73.
``And I think it's pitiful that who you vote for comes down to who
gives the best speech.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was watching `Adam 12' last night,'' said Lee Keefer, 67,
the swing voter of the group. ``It was a heck of a show.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Wright, 79, agreed that Thursday night's rerun had been
particularly fine.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Schaefer, a firefighter, liked the Republicans'
convention more than the Democrats' (better organized, more
enthusiasm). But he wasn't putting much stock in either one. The
debates are the thing, he said: ``It'll be interesting to see how
Bush and Gore handle each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of their loyalties, all of the men at Hodges agreed
that the conventions' low point was Clinton's dramatic,
long-walk-down-the-hallway entrance on Monday night. Tacky, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They patterned that after the wrestlers,'' Bante said. ``They
oughta drop him in on a pulley!''

GORE'S RISKY POPULISM

<TEXT>
<P>
   On the second Monday in August, Bill Clinton set the standard Al
Gore must meet by the first Tuesday in November.
</P>
<P>
   No, not the quotient of charisma or the measure of magnetism. If
the presidential race is decided on personality or charm, it's
curtains for Al2D2.
</P>
<P>
   One can see that in this campaign's persistent default drift
back toward Bush; each time the contest isn't joined, the Texas
governor bobs back up to a lead of eight to 10 points.
</P>
<P>
   And yet that doesn't mean Gore can't win. Plugging his plodding
political protege on Monday, Clinton showed the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than anybody else in American life, Al Gore understands
the future,'' Clinton claimed. ``We need somebody in the White
House at the dawn of the 21st century who really understands the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   Proving the first premise of Clinton's proposition could be the
route to victory for Gore. The bad news for Democrats is that so
far Gore hasn't even demonstrated that he understands the lessons
of the political past.
</P>
<P>
   To win, Gore must persuade the nation that he's the best choice
to sustain, safeguard, and spread the current prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   As government-reinvention guru David Osborne puts it, he needs
to talk about ``expanding the winner's circle: what we need to do
to bring more Americans into the new economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Combined, that's a message with across-the-board appeal.
</P>
<P>
   But for months now, Gore has been offering a dated class
politics, claiming to be ``on the side of working families''
against the wealthy or playing the populist by railing against
pharmaceutical firms, oil companies, and other ``powerful
interests.''
</P>
<P>
   With the eyes of the nation upon him Thursday, Gore chose the
same course, repeatedly declaring himself on the side of ``working
families'' in their battle against the ``powerful forces and
powerful interests'' he sees arrayed against them.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the difference in this election,'' Gore declared.
``They're for the powerful and we're for the people.''
</P>
<P>
   That simplistic approach holds several very real perils.
</P>
<P>
   First, it opens a yawning chasm of implausibility between Gore's
pedigreed persona and his politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't seem likely that someone who is the son of a
senator who has been VP for eight years in a pro-business
administration would suddenly turn into an 1890s style populist,''
notes Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia's Center
for Governmental Studies.
</P>
<P>
   Second, as intoxicating as that old-time ideological elixir is
to the party faithful, it is ultimately a campaign cul-de-sac, a
path, perhaps, to the mid-40s, but not to a winning mark.
</P>
<P>
   With Gore trailing Bush by 19 points among the crucial
independent bloc in a Gallup Poll last week, the vice president
needs a pitch with broader appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The populist message hasn't worked since Harry Truman,'' says
Osborne, a former Gore adviser whose latest book is ``The
Reinventor's Fieldbook: Tools for Transforming Your Government.''
``As much as I wish it would work, it isn't a majority message.''
Just ask Dick Gephardt or Jesse Jackson or Tom Harkin, each of whom
tried and failed that way in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's populism might rally the base and bring him somewhere
near the 46 percent Michael Dukakis won against Vice President Bush
in 1988. But it's unlikely to carry him over the top because, in a
nation where as many as three-fourths of the people consider
themselves middle class, it defines America in a way most Americans
decline to define themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Former US Senator Paul Tsongas warned his party about that tack
back in 1992, and he was right.
</P>
<P>
   Although a retro message of populism and class interests may
work in a lower-turnout congressional campaign, Americans want a
president who appreciates the importance of a strong economy and
the crucial job-creating role of business, not an old-style class
warrior. Two elections later, in the best of times, it's not clear
Gore grasps the point.
</P>
<P>
   Further, in a time when technology has put a premium on
flexibility and individual choice, Gore too often seems stuck in a
government-monopoly mode when it comes to government services.
</P>
<P>
   Examples abound, but two suffice to make the point.
</P>
<P>
   Although the popularity of Bush's Social Security plan forced
Gore to come up with his own retirement-saving plan, he still
remains opposed to letting individuals invest any of their Social
Security payroll tax payment in the market.
</P>
<P>
   Schools offer a second example. There, Gore has sided with the
teachers unions in an absolute rejection of vouchers in any
circumstance, even in those troubling situations where the public
schools are not just mediocre, but are repeatedly and demonstrably
failing.
</P>
<P>
   That stance has won him the support of the NEA and the American
Federation of Teachers, but has put him on the opposite side of an
issue increasingly popular with minority voters, a core Democratic
Party constituency, whose children are too often stuck in
under-performing urban schools.
</P>
<P>
   Odder still, Gore seems to realize the disconnect.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was the parent of a child who went to an inner-city
school that was failing . . . I might be for vouchers, too,'' Gore
said on Aug. 9. And yet it's an idea that Gore habitually denounces
as a risky scheme. That's been his response for so long, and so
many issues, that it has become caricature.
</P>
<P>
   Which underscores another problem Gore must overcome: His
rhetorical rifle is a rusty political blunderbuss.
</P>
<P>
   In an era when more than half of American families own stock or
mutual funds, when more and more Americans are economically
literate, and when government commands a comparatively smaller and
weaker hold on the American imagination, it's simply not enough to
denounce an opponent's each and every idea as a reckless or risky
or irresponsible plan. Or to argue, as he did Thursday, that ``our
whole future is at stake'' in November.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, that sort of rhetorical overkill helped Gore torpedo
Democratic rival Bill Bradley in New Hampshire last fall. But
looking back at the critique Gore made of Bradley, what's most
notable is not how effective his campaign was, but how fast and
loose Gore played with the truth in his broadside attacks on
Bradley's proposal for near-universal health care, which Gore
portrayed as an unaffordable boondoggle that would hurt minorities
and send the economy into a tailspin.
</P>
<P>
   If ever anyone had a doubt, a detailed study of Gore's debate
history by James Fallows in the July Atlantic Monthly makes it
crystal clear how little reverence the vice president holds for the
truth when he's in campaign mode. Gore, says Fallows, ``is
manifestly willing to lie for political convenience.''
</P>
<P>
   But both the press and the public are catching up with Gore's
bombast and broadsides. And in one of the best rifts in his own
acceptance speech in Philadelphia, Bush started to inoculate
himself against those accusations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If my opponent had been there at the moon launch, it would
have been a `risky rocket scheme,' '' said Bush. ``If he'd been
there when Edison was testing the light bulb, it would have been a
`risky anti-candle scheme.' If he'd been there when the Internet
was invented, well . . . .''
</P>
<P>
   It was a moment both funny and memorable, one that will make it
harder for Gore to portray his rival's plans as precursors to
economic or social disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Good economic times may also demand another approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``After years of prosperity, average Americans are not really
interested in heavy-duty negativity,'' says Stephen Hess, a senior
fellow in governmental studies at the Brookings Institution. ``If
you are going to go after your opponent this year, you are better
off doing it with an epee rather than a broadsword.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Gore's current approach doesn't faze the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Risky' and `extreme'' just hasn't worked,'' says Republican
pollster Neil Newhouse. ``I think it falls on deaf ears. People
realize that if Bush is a governor and his state is doing all
right, he is not going to do something that is outrageous or
extreme.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's best defense is Gore's own number two, Joseph
Lieberman, who has voiced support for both vouchers and market
investment of some of Social Security _ as well as a number of
other nostrums Bush supports.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, once an iconoclastic thinker, has had to undergo the
sort of brain transplant that is a vice presidential nominee's sad
lot in life. Still, there's no better defense against a Gore
accusation of recklessness than the simple reminder that Gore's own
running mate _ back when he was of independent mind and judgment _
supported ideas like those Bush has proposed.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Hess puts it: ``It is going to be harder to make some of
the arguments about risky business when Lieberman was with the
riskers.''
</P>
<P>
   Which means Gore needs to adopt a mode of argumentation that
relies on something smarter and more intellectually engaging than
apocalyptic predictions.
</P>
<P>
   That's where he needs to take his cue from Clinton _ but not the
self-congratulatory president of Monday, defending his record and
gilding the lily of his legacy. Rather, the earnest, determined
Clinton of the 1992 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   That year, Clinton, a little-known governor, burst to the front
of the Democratic field with an attractive package of proposals
that analyzed America's problems and offered some appealing ideas
about how to jump-start the economy, help small business, improve
education, better train the work force, reduce the deficit, help
the working poor, and ease the strain on American families.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's intention, which he stated again and again, was to
move beyond the weary, polarized politics of left and right to
offer realistic solutions.
</P>
<P>
   However much Clinton may have parsed his language and offered
dissembling denials about his personal life, when it came to public
ideas he treated the American people as intelligent, thoughtful
voters who could make smart choices.
</P>
<P>
   Compare that with Gore's approach. He too knows policy, but his
remedial-school style of slow-cadenced admonitions, his dire
warnings of disaster, and his simplistic sloganeering all bespeak a
certain mistrust of the very electorate Gore hopes to enlist.
</P>
<P>
   To put it in the practiced parlance of ritual convention
rhetoric, Al Gore can do better, Al Gore must do better _ and Al
Gore will have to do better if he's to be elected president of
these United States.

BILL DALEY STILL WORKING IT OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CURTIS WILKIE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In 1976, when the national Democrats were moving
to mend decade-old divisions, Jim Wall, a soft-spoken editor of
Christian Century and the Illinois chairman for Jimmy Carter,
approached the omnipotent mayor of Chicago, Richard J. Daley, about
arranging an alliance with the candidate from Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Work it out with Willie,'' the mayor told Wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know who `Willie' was,'' Wall said the other day,
recalling the 24-year-old conversation. ``But when I found out,
`Willie' was a very shrewd organizer and a pragmatist.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Willie'' was Bill Daley, the mayor's son, and young ``Willie''
helped forge an unlikely relationship between the Chicago machine
and the Carter campaign that endured for several years.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Daley, now 52, is working things out as Vice
President Al Gore's campaign manager.
</P>
<P>
   From the time he was handing out political leaflets for the
machine in Chicago's 11th Ward and traveling with his family to the
1960 national convention here, life seemed to be preparing Daley
for the task. After his father's death at the end of 1976, he
labored for a dozen years in the venomous politics of Chicago to
ensure that his brother, Richard M. Daley, eventually became mayor.
Though he submerged his own personal ambitions, Bill Daley's work
on his brother's behalf attracted national attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the best strategic manager I've ever seen,'' said David
Wilhelm, one of Bill Clinton's top aides in 1992. ``He has
tremendous political instincts. He's able to look at data and
impose structure on a campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Daley laughs at some of the praise. For his first campaign, he
handled his brother's race for a minor party post in their
Bridgeport neighborhood in 1969. ``It was not a very difficult
race,'' he said. ``Rich was the only candidate.'' When he helped
manage Walter F. Mondale's effort in the 1984 Florida primary,
Daley remembered, he watched his candidate sink almost overnight
from a 20-point lead in the polls to a double-digit loss.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Irish-Catholic Daleys were once closely associated
with the Kennedys, Bill Daley led the family organization into
conflict with Senator Edward M. Kennedy during a bitter feud in
1980. After Mayor Jane Byrne, regarded by the Daleys as a pretender
to their throne, threw her support to Kennedy in the presidential
campaign, the Daleys again sided with Carter. The move helped send
Kennedy to a critical defeat in the Illinois primary.
</P>
<P>
   His toughest defeat as a manager, Daley said, was his brother's
third-place finish in a race to reclaim the mayor's office for the
family in 1983. ``The campaign turned on race, and it got pretty
ugly,'' he said. Though Daley helped drive Byrne from office, a
black Democrat, Harold Washington, prevailed that year. But by the
time of Washington's death in 1987, Bill Daley had built the blocks
for a Daley restoration, and Rich Daley has presided over the city
without major challenge since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Defeat never deterred Bill Daley. He was deeply involved in
Senator Joseph Biden's star-crossed campaign for the 1988
Democratic nomination. Despite the embarrassing outcome, Biden of
Delaware has nothing but good memories of Daley. ``He's got an
inner gyroscope,'' Biden said. ``He always asks the right
questions, and nothing stupid ever happens on his watch.''
</P>
<P>
   After Biden dropped out of the race, a young senator from
Tennessee named Al Gore asked Daley ``to play a big role'' in his
own unsuccessful campaign for the '88 nomination. ``I just wasn't
ready to do it,'' Daley said in an interview last week. Daley never
developed a cozy relationship with either Bill Clinton or Gore in
1992, but he was a loyal party soldier in Illinois. As a result,
Daley was interviewed for a Cabinet post in the first Clinton
administration. But the job of housing secretary went to Henry
Cisneros instead of Daley, and a new term entered the lexicon at
the Clinton White House. If a white male were passed over in favor
of a woman or a black or a Latino, he was ``Daleyed.''
</P>
<P>
   Daley swallowed his disappointment, and after Clinton asked him
to come to Washington and manage his effort to win passage of the
North American Free Trade Agreement in 1993, he helped steer the
treaty through the shoals of organized labor's opposition. He won
the president's gratitude and solidified his standing by running a
successful 1996 convention in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   With his brother safely ensconced as mayor, Daley became
commerce secretary in Clinton's second term, presiding this year
over the passage of a controversial China trade bill over union
protest.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his relationship with labor unions, a key element in
the Democratic coalition, Daley said, ``I think it's real good.''
Referring to the head of the AFL-CIO, he continued: ``If you talk
to John Sweeney and those guys, I think you'd see it's all right. I
ran the only bank in Chicago that was unionized.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked to take over Gore's operation earlier this summer,
Daley characteristically agreed to give up his Cabinet seat and
move to Nashville for the duration of the campaign. But once it is
over, he said, he will have no thirst to go back into governent.
``I'd like to go into some form of business,'' he said. ``Probably
in Chicago.''

AMERICA'S STATUS AS NO. 1 IS NOT ALWAYS POPULAR ABROAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The United States is the largest exporter in the
world. It is the largest importer. It has the lowest unemployment
rate among developed nations. It is expected to have the highest
rate of economic growth in the world this year.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not all. The US defense budget is billions bigger
than the next six largest defense spenders combined. The nation can
put a half-million men and women in the field in days to fight
halfway around the world; as a comparison, the Western Europeans
are trying to cobble together a force of 60,000 to intervene
locally for three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   And American movies, soft drinks, fast food, dance fads,
fashions, and even language have gone worldwide, providing the
staples of the first truly global culture.
</P>
<P>
   It's enough to make America's adversaries and even some of its
allies say . . . Enough!!
</P>
<P>
   For years, as the United States has reigned as the only
superpower and has enjoyed an economic expansion that now has
lasted 115 months, that ``Enough!!'' has been a whisper, uttered
privately, politely, even sheepishly. But now a Canadian writer is
issuing a full-throated scream that will be startling to American
ears _ but familiar to foreign observers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The notion of an American century extends far beyond material
production,'' writes James Laxer, professor at York University's
Atkinson College in Toronto. ``At its core is the idea that the
United States is the potent source of values and culture that have
been taken up by much of the world and that those who resist the
norms of American civilisation will do so in vain.''
</P>
<P>
   Laxer's book, ``Stalking the Elephant: My Discovery of
America,'' a Viking Book distributed by Penguin Books Canada, is to
be published early next month. At its heart is Laxer's view that
``there has never been a global power like America, armed not only
with weapons that can destroy every person on the planet, but also
with a culture that has penetrated the hearts and minds of
foreigners more deeply than any culture ever has.''
</P>
<P>
   That notion, expressed somewhat more gently, is a staple of
American domestic political rhetoric at the beginning of the 21st
century. Republicans and Democrats alike cite American political,
military, and economic superiority, and last week's Democratic
National Convention here was replete with talk of the opportunities
that American power presents.
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans believe, moreover, that American power is at
worst a benign, and at best a beneficial, influence around the
globe, presenting the world with a compelling example of prosperity
amid diversity, standing as a symbol of the virtues of popular rule
and remaining an obstacle to tyranny.
</P>
<P>
   But American power isn't always as popular abroad _ and many
American foreign-policy thinkers are growing worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the dominant theme we hear from every foreign leader
who has been here for the last several years,'' says Leslie H.
Gelb, who as the president of the Council on Foreign Relations
often plays host to visiting presidents and prime ministers. ``Most
of these conversations are off the record, and so they are frank.
But I cannot think of a foreign minister or prime minister who
hasn't made this kind of point.''
</P>
<P>
   This resentment has been building for several years as American
productivity, job creation, and personal income have soared. ``This
is a serious foreign-policy challenge,'' says Lee M. Hamilton, the
former chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the
director of the Washington-based Woodrow Wilson Center. ``But it's
something most Americans aren't aware of. Those who are aware of it
don't like to talk about it. And the solutions aren't easy for a
country that wants to assert its own interests.''
</P>
<P>
   The concern is gradually penetrating the walls of Capitol Hill.
``This is a very dangerous situation,'' says Senator John F. Kerry,
a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. ``We need to
bend over backward to find new ways to reach out to the world that
counter this remarkable abundance we have. We need to be more open
and overreaching.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry believes the United States should consider providing more
technical assistance abroad, taking a more aggressive approach
toward alleviating the debts held by developing nations and dealing
with what he calls ``the huge agenda that is inviting a tremendous
backlash even among our best allies.''
</P>
<P>
   This comes at a time when the nation is contemplating the
deployment of a missile-defense system and when Americans are
increasingly skeptical that the United States should be playing a
prominent role internationally.
</P>
<P>
   In 1964, in the middle of the Cold War, in the heydey of foreign
aid and at the beginning of the Vietnam buildup, only 18 percent of
Americans said they believed the United States should mind its own
business internationally and let other countries get along the best
they can on their own, according to the Gallup Organization. When
the Pew Research Center asked the same question in its own survey
last year, the figure had nearly doubled, to 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Democrats who gathered here last week for their
quadrennial political convention expressed worries that the new
American determination to deploy a national missile defense would
only reinforce the resentment of other leaders and other nations.
</P>
<P>
   A US intelligence report leaked to The New York Times this month
said that if the nation does move forward with a missile defense,
China and Russia would respond. But it isn't only the nation's
rivals that are wary. American allies are also unsettled by the
notion of a missile defense. And experts on both sides of the
missile-defense question are troubled by efforts to deploy
so-called Star Wars technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a dramatic example of the United States not caring
about what others think _ or even about treaties we don't want to
keep anymore,'' says Representative Martin F. Meehan, a Lowell
Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Resenting American power and prosperity is not a new phenomenon,
of course. Simon Bolivar, who liberated much of Latin America from
Spanish rule, once complained that ``the United States seems
destined by providence to plague Latin America with misery in the
name of liberty.'' Nearly two centuries later, Canadian Prime
Minister Pierre Elliot Trudeau, in a remark that would provide
Laxer with the title of his book, would say: ``Living next door to
you is in some ways like sleeping with an elephant. No matter how
friendly or even-tempered is the beast, if I can call it that, one
is affected by every twitch and grunt.''
</P>
<P>
   But unlike other periods of world history dominated by one
nation with overwhelming power, other countries are not forming
alliances to offer a balance.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of the 16th century, at the height of the Golden
Age of Spain, the French, Turks, and some of the German
principalities formed an unlikely alliance to oppose the emperor
Charles V. In the 17th century, when the Dutch were strong, the
English and French moved together to blunt the Dutch influence. The
19th century brought several shifting alliances, one of the most
colorful being the Dreikaiserbund, the loose alliance between
Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Russia to counter the power of
France.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing like that is occurring now.
</P>
<P>
   Two factors reinforce the power of American influence in the
21st century. The first is the nature of the economic prosperity
that the nation has enjoyed in recent years; it was fueled by high
technology, a form of industrial (or, some analysts say,
post-industrial) power that does not respect national boundaries.
The second is the collapse of the Soviet Union and of the communist
bloc; now no political adversaries block the advance of American
culture or corporate influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without ideological adversaries _ those who actually threaten
its way of life _ American capitalism has lost all its
defensiveness,'' Laxer writes. ``It is fully itself again, as it
has not been since the 1920s. There is an unselfconsciousness today
in the American insistence that the unabashed individual pursuit of
great wealth is the engine that drives humanity forward to an ever
more materially prosperous future.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agrees that the American influence is bad. ``There
is an acceptance of American power now, but more: a reliance on
American power,'' says Lawrence Goldman, an Oxford University
historian and a longtime student of American culture and politics.
``We depend on the American guarantee. There is almost a sense of
satisfaction that we can count on the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   But being on top places the United States in the awkward place
of being in the middle _ between those who would like less American
engagement and those who would like more.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of what we have to offer is actually quite welcome and
attractive,'' says Richard N. Haass, who was special assistant for
foreign affairs to President George H.W. Bush. ``And this is
impossible to get just right. Some people might resent American
unilateralism. But they would be the same people to speak up if the
United States suddenly didn't show strong leadership.''

REMEMBERING WHEN IT WAS ROCK FOR CAUSES 
</HEADLINE>

 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This year is the 15th anniversary of Live Aid and the 10th
anniversary of Amnesty International's ``Human Rights Now!'' tour.
These events have largely gone unnoticed by a media obsessed with
Christina Aguilera's navel and 'N Sync's dance moves, but they form
the backbone of an ambitious four-hour documentary about musical
activists and their causes.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Stand and Be Counted'' documentary, produced by rocker
David Crosby and adapted from his book of the same name, debuts on
the Learning Channel Monday night and Tuesday from 9 to 11.
</P>
<P>
   It's a gripping journey from the civil rights movement
(featuring comments by Joan Baez) through George Harrison's concert
for Bangladesh (1971), the No Nukes benefits (1979), the first
Amnesty International Secret Policeman's Ball (1980), then Live Aid
and Farm Aid, and on to the Beastie Boys' Tibetan Freedom Concerts
in the late '90s and the recent Jubilee 2000 movement (spearheaded
by U2's Bono) to cancel Third World debt.
</P>
<P>
   The performance footage is powerful, the artist interviews are
often poignant, and the consistently selfless tone makes this an
essential unsensationalized viewing experience for people who still
feel that music can matter and not be a prefabricated MTV product.
</P>
<P>
   As Crosby says, introducing the program, ``Nothing blows up, no
one takes their clothes off, and there are no car crashes. But it
shows courage, a depth of character, and a generosity of spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   The editing is a bit choppy (too much jump-cutting from one
concert to another), but there's a laudable attempt at covering a
wide variety of issues. Crosby, who spent four years gathering film
footage and interviews, covers topics ranging from Native American
persecution (Buffy Sainte-Marie is shown singing ``Bury My Heart at
Wounded Knee'') to Don Henley's fund-raising for the preservation
of Walden Woods.
</P>
<P>
   The documentary goes to great length to establish historical
links among Henry David Thoreau and the social leaders who read his
work (including Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr.) and the
artists who were also energized by his writings about nature and
passive resistance.

   The 1960s generation is given ample air time, but so are younger
activists such as Adam Yauch of the Beasties and Michael Stipe of
R.E.M. As comedian Robin Williams says in the show: ``There was a
time when people were very worried that (the younger generation)
was not going to kick in. But these people are doing as much work,
if not more.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, that's debatable in the new Me Generation of music
celebrities, but some of the more established artists are here to
remind them that music, ultimately, should serve a higher purpose
than fame and riches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is selling records the end of all existence? I don't think
so,'' says Bonnie Raitt. ``Not to mention that we get
overcompensated. . . . We owe it to give the money back and spread
it around.''
</P>
<P>
   As Carlos Santana adds, ``It doesn't matter how many zeroes you
got on your check. You still don't have the `one,' you know. That
`one' is when you know in your heart you're doing something that
benefits life and people on the planet.''
</P>
<P>
   Santana goes on to challenge the cynicism that set in after the
Bangladesh concert when it was revealed that most of the money
never made it to the starving people for which it was intended.
``It doesn't mean we should be cynical,'' he says. ``It means we
should do more.''
</P>
<P>
   Such idealism is a reminder of the music industry's most noble
sentiments. Many of the artists also get extremely emotional when
talking about their causes. Harry Belafonte recalls how he ``didn't
understand black indifference to what was going on in Africa''
during the Ethiopian famine that led to Live Aid. ``So I took the
question to artists on a moral basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Sting gets choked up when remembering his show in Santiago,
Chile to support mothers whose sons had ``disappeared'' due to the
military junta's death squads. On the song ``They Dance Alone,''
Sting is shown dancing with some of the mothers. He describes it as
``probably the greatest, most powerful moment of my career.''
</P>
<P>
   Attention is also paid to lesser-known activists such as Victor
Jara (the Chilean folk singer whose fingers and tongue were cut off
by the military to silence him) and Sarajevan cellist Vedran
Smailovic who, in the spring of 1992, played for 22 straight days
outside a bakery where 22 civilians _ including his brother and
neighbors _ had been killed by mortar fire. More shells fell around
him as he performed _ and a camera captured it for posterity.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the musical footage is superb _ Eric Clapton performing
``Layla'' at Live Aid in Philadelphia, Peter Gabriel singing ``In
Your Eyes'' at an Amnesty benefit in Buenos Aires, George Harrison
doing ``Bangladesh'' in New York, Rage Against the Machine ripping
through ``Bulls on Parade'' at the Tibetan Freedom Concert in
Washington, D.C., Radiohead playing an Amnesty show in Paris, and
Bono and Daniel Lanois doing U2's ``One'' at the Lincoln Memorial
to support Jubilee 2000 (with President Clinton in attendance).
</P>
<P>
   Sting offers an acoustic ``Message in a Bottle'' at the Secret
Policemen's Ball in London in 1980; and Bruce Springteen, Sting,
Gabriel, Tracy Chapman, and Youssou N'Dour join for Bob Dylan's
``The Times They Are A-Changin'' during Amnesty's Human Rights Now!
tour.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier protest songwriters such as Woody Guthrie and Phil Ochs
are also covered in this documentary. As Jackson Browne says in
summary, ``There are a lot of people who don't want to know about
political things _ and that's fine. They have a right to feel that
way. But I would never let that stop me from talking about what is
happening.''

FILMS RECENTLY REVIEWED IN THE BOSTON GLOBE

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
!! 1/2 ``The Cell'' It spends most of its time trying to live up to
its dazzling visuals, including a series of brilliantly surreal
landscapes of the imagination. Jennifer Lopez (who revels in more
costume changes than any therapist in film history) is a psychic
researcher who rides a mind-control device into the dark recesses
of serial killer Vincent D'Onofrio's brain to rescue one of his
victims. There isn't enough story to go with the striking decor,
but the film does cover its hallucinatory bases. (R) 
 
!!! ``Girl on the Bridge'' For a while, it connects us magically to
the tradition of European film at its most intoxicatingly romantic.
A washed-up carnival knife-thrower (Daniel Auteuil) finds new life
for his act after talking a would-be suicide (Vanessa Paradis) into
becoming the target for his sexually symbolic daggers, and the two
click. The film's inspiration level vanishes like a gambler's
charmed streak about two-thirds of the way through. Still, when
it's on, it's really on. (R) 
 
(FR) !!! ``Godzilla 2000'' This latest saga about the big
radioactive lizard proves that you can take the boy out of Tokyo,
but you can't take Tokyo out of the boy. He's back in all his
cheesy glory, complete with badly dubbed dialogue, dragon breath,
the all-important guy-in-the-rubber-suit look, and the
indispensable stomp-out-a-scale-model-of-Tokyo finale. (PG)
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
!! ``I'm the One That I Want'' Stand-up comic Maggie Cho was
traumatized when TV execs cast her in what was to have been the
first network sitcom about an Asian-American, then canceled the
show for (in their words) not being ethnic enough. Fully recovered,
she comments on this and other absurdities with rude, freeing,
wickedly honed yet ultimately big-hearted wit in this triumphant
capturing of her one-woman stage hit. (Unrated)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
!!!! ``The Original Kings of Comedy'' The laughs just keep coming
in Spike Lee's concert film of comedy's biggest touring act. Not
since the glory days of Richard Pryor and Eddie Murphy have we had
such a screenful of raucous, sharp-eyed, liberating comedy. Steve
Harvey, D. L. Hughley, Cedric the Entertainer, and Bernie Mac put
the black back in black comedy _ and Lee's unobtrusively brilliant
camerawork captures the audience chemistry, too. (R)

CONNECTIONS BETWEEN ECONOMICS, CULTURE GET A WORKING OVER

CULTURE MATTERS 
How Values Shape Human Progress 
Edited by Lawrence E. Harrison and Samuel P. Huntington. Basic
Books. 348 pp. $35. 
 
THE TWILIGHT OF AMERICAN CULTURE 
By Morris Berman. Norton. 205 pp. $23.95. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Know why in a certain cannibalistic foreign country economists'
brains go for $2.39 a pound but anthropologists' cost $15? The
answer is the only punchline in ``Culture Matters: How Values Shape
Human Progress,'' because that's the only joke in this serious,
challenging, and ultimately enlightening book exploring why there
are haves and have-nots in the world.
</P>
<P>
   In 22 chapters, various scholars and authors debate whether the
cultural aspects of a people make a difference in their level of
economic development. But chapters with titles like ``Cultures
Count'' and ``Why Culture Matters,'' as well as the book's title
itself, give away the overwhelming conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Though there are a few dissenters _ Jeffrey Sachs with an ``it's
inconclusive'' view, and a couple of anthropologists who still
cavil at drawing any conclusions based on a population's values,
for fear of an odor of racism _ the vast majority of contributors
agree cultural values shape futures. They're just now sure how much
_ in relation to political or geographic factors, for example _ or
how at all to determine cause and effect.
</P>
<P>
   As co-editor Lawrence E. Harrison, of Harvard University's
Academy for International and Area Studies, notes up front,
increasing numbers of those who study the jaggedly uneven
development patterns worldwide are following paths forged by Alexis
de Tocqueville, who saw American culture as particularly friendly
to democracy; Max Weber, who put religion at the root of
capitalism; and Edward Banfield, who studied poverty and
authoritarianism in southern Italy and contrasted that region with
the more prosperous north.
</P>
<P>
   ``Culture Matters'' could be a valuable textbook, though its
individual chapters are for the most part easily digestible and
even entertaining, only occasionally dense. In an apparent gesture
to political correctness, a couple of chapters on women were
included, one not by an academic but by a journalist, and they seem
a bit off the topic. A section on anthropology _ apparently there
for diversity's sake, because anthropologists are the skeptics on
this topic _ is also uneven. One scholar argues weakly that
parenting practices are not to blame for low achievement. Yet the
University of Chicago's Richard A. Shweder offers a lively and
inviting rebuttal to others' arguments (it's his joke, above;
punchline found in Chapter 12) and provocatively notes that
developed countries where abortion is prevalent should be placed in
the most child-unfriendly group on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   The other co-editor, Harvard professor Samuel P. Huntington,
notes that this book and a 1999 symposium called the Cultural
Values and Human Progress project were largely the work of
Harrison. Harrison's overview sets the world stage, as it were:
Only 1 billion of our 6 billion fellow men and women live in
advanced democracies, and 4 billion live in what are classified as
lower-middle-income countries or worse.
</P>
<P>
   George Mason University professor Francis Fukuyama, while
emphasizing the importance of virtues like truth-telling and
meeting one's obligations in building a successful society,
acknowledges that really understanding the relationship between
values and progress, ``providing an empirical map of the sources of
actual cultural rules, is a project for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   No solutions are contained herein. Nevertheless, a lot is agreed
on.
</P>
<P>
   Mariano Grondona, a Buenos Aires journalist-professor-author,
identifies 20 ``cultural factors'' that determine where a nation
will rank. They include religion, ``lesser virtues'' like tidiness
and respect, how people view time and dissenting opinions, their
level of general optimism, and competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Other authors prefer six or 10 identifying cultural measures,
but the point is the same: Traditional values and habits determine,
at least heavily influence, outcomes.
</P>
<P>
   Generalities abound, though there are enough exceptions that
scholars still have plenty to fight about. Almost all advanced
democracies are in temperate zones, most poor ones in the tropics.
But Singapore and Hong Kong are in tropical zones, so perhaps
Confucian influence does have a positive effect. What explains the
differences between Guatemala and, say, Costa Rica, or between
Haiti and Barbados? Why do Chinese and Japanese minorities excel in
otherwise poor communities? Why do Islamic countries lag behind in
North Africa and the Mideast?
</P>
<P>
   David S. Landes, an economic historian at Harvard, says the
values that pay off ``may sound like a collection of cliches _ the
sort of lessons one used to learn at home and in school when
parents and teachers thought they had a mission to rear and elevate
their children. Today, we condescend to such verities, dismiss them
as platitudes. But why should wisdom be obsolete?''
</P>
<P>
   He strikes on a point that could have been made even more
forcefully: If economics were not so shoddily taught, little
respected, and widely misunderstood, there probably would not be as
much of a debate about culture, and about politics for that matter.
As Landes puts it, a ``zero-sum worldview is central to the theory
of a universal peasant culture.''
</P>
<P>
   A wickedly refreshing, slashingly honest assessment of Latin
America and its elite groups is offered by Carlos Alberto Montaner,
identified in the book as ``the most widely read columnist in the
Spanish language.'' He may want to hide out for a while, after
identifying ``politicians, the military, businessmen, clergy,
intellectuals, and leftist groups'' as being overwhelmingly
responsible for poverty and injustice on the continent.
</P>
<P>
   And Daniel Etounga-Manguelle, Cameroon-born head of a
development institute, does sort of the same thing for Africa,
suggesting that, rather than another economic adjustment plan, the
continent may need a cultural adjustment program.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, Orlando Patterson has a clear and sensible critique of
some of the current, foggy thinking on the subject. ``The liberal
mantra, still frequently chanted, that cultural explanations amount
to blaming the victim,'' he says, ``is sheer nonsense.'' In fact,
Patterson proposes that cultural factors, affecting children from
the instant of birth, can even explain the controversial findings
of Herrnstein and Murray's ``The Bell Curve,'' which found that
intelligence varies among races.
</P>
<P>
   Nathan Glazer, professor emeritus of education and sociology at
Harvard, reviews the ups and downs that cultural explanations have
had as useful measures of people's ability to prosper, but he's
cautious. As is Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Lucian W.
Pye, who says: ``We are dealing with clouds, not clocks, with
general approximations, not precise cause-and-effect
relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Morris Berman's ``The Twilight of American Culture'' has
something in common with ``Culture Matters'': They both use that
seven-letter word in the title. Similarities end there.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to know whether Berman, who teaches part time at Johns
Hopkins University, is serious in this brief screed on how stupid
he thinks Americans have become (alas, people riding buses aren't
reading books). My grandfather, back in the 1950s, used to say,
``The country's going to hell in a handbasket,'' and that just
about sums up Berman's view.
</P>
<P>
   Except that, utopian at heart, he blames commercialism and
corporate culture for ruining a great country. And he proposes what
at first appears to be a bizarre remedy: We all become monks and
ignore the poisonous influences around us.
</P>
<P>
   Only toward the end do we find out that Berman is really just
talking about thinking independently, being true to your own
beliefs, and the kinds of things that he suggests only he and a
handful of others do _ but that in fact more millions of Americans
practice daily than he knows.
</P>
<P>
   This grumpy baby boomer lives in Washington, D.C., and he
listens to a lot of National Public Radio. His heroes are Lewis
Lapham of Harper's magazine, perhaps the nation's premier cynic;
author Don DeLillo; and lefty filmmaker Michael Moore _ though at
least he eschews political correctness and has no use for France's
Jacques Derrida. Excerpt: ``The whole statist configuration of
hierarchy, specialization, and bureaucracy emerged fairly recently
_ about six thousand years ago _ and has to be constantly
reinforced and legitimized.''
</P>
<P>
   There are a couple of amusing thoughts on science fiction and
the history of technology amid the gloomy predictions. But just
when it seems Berman might want to literally blow it all up, you
find him saying, ``Before I start to sound like the Unabomber, . .
. .''
</P>
<P>
   Oops, too late.

PLAYING POLITICS WITH THE ARTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Intent on stressing substantive differences with George W. Bush,
Bill Clinton told cheering Democratic convention delegates last
week that this was a ``big election'' because the chasm between
candidates is ``so profound.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet on one hot-button issue, many observers say the two sides
are in virtual lockstep. With three major combatants in the
nation's culture wars closely tied to the race, the assault on sex,
violence, and sensationalism in the entertainment industry is now
very much a bipartisan venture.
</P>
<P>
   First Lady hopeful Tipper Gore gained fame _ and infamy in
certain quarters _ for leading the battle for warning labels on
music. Lynne Cheney, wife of the GOP vice-presidential nominee, is
a former head of the National Endowment for the Humanities who
waged ideological combat against what she viewed as pervasive
political correctness in the arts and culture.
</P>
<P>
   It was, however, Al Gore's selection of running mate Joseph
Lieberman _ a tireless cultural warrior who has teamed with social
conservatives like William Bennett in targeting everyone from shock
jock Howard Stern to ``gangsta'' rappers _ that is the clearest
signal yet that Hollywood is an awfully inviting target.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great achievement or great failure of the Democratic
Leadership Council . . . is that they're trying very hard to
co-opt, in part, the Republicans on the culture war,'' says Wendy
Kaminer, a fellow at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study.
``I think for many people who are running for office, declaring
their disdain for sex and violence in the media . . . is like
saluting the flag.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert O`Neil, the former University of Virginia president who
heads the Thomas Jefferson Center for the Protection of Free
Expression, thinks the political zeitgeist is ripe for targeting
movies, video games, TV, and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have expected that these would have been major issues
regardless of who the nominees of the major parties were,'' he
says. ``This is a time to blame national ills of various sorts on
media and entertainment, partly because there are no other easy
scapegoats and (because of) high anxiety these days about new
media.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Political punching bag &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although there is broad consensus that parents need to monitor
their children's exposure to Internet porn, misogynistic music, and
big-screen bloodlettings, some First Amendment advocates are very
uneasy about entertainment's emerging role as a political punching
bag.
</P>
<P>
   ``These censorship crusades are quite cyclical,'' says Marjorie
Heins, who heads the Free Expression Policy Project for the
National Coalition Against Censorship. ``There may be some
differences ideologically in terms of what Lynne Cheney would want
to censor and what Al and Tipper Gore want to censor. But I'm not
aware of any significant differences.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, who spent time as the combative conservative on CNN's
``Crossfire,'' was once called ``the leading policy assassin for
the right-wing culture warriors,'' by the liberal The American
Prospect magazine. At the National Endowment for the Humanities,
she got into flaps over several projects that she felt gave short
shrift to the virtues of Western civilization, earning a reputation
among critics for politicizing the agency and the arts.
</P>
<P>
   In a piece that appeared in The Wall Street Journal in 1995,
Cheney called for withdrawing government funding for the NEH and
the National Endowment for the Arts, writing that ``the American
people deserve to understand . . . why their money supports artists
who submerge a crucifix in urine and hang out in morgues.'' She was
also one of many signers of a highly publicized ``Appeal to
Hollywood'' asking that entertainment producers ``establish certain
minimum standards for violent, sexual, and degrading material for
each medium, below which producers can be expected not to go.''
</P>
<P>
   According to news accounts, Tipper Gore joined the fight over
entertainment standards in the mid-'80s after being outraged by
some blatantly sexual lyrics in a Prince song. The founder of the
Parents Music Resource Center, Gore is best known for parental
advisories that warn of music not intended for tender ears.
</P>
<P>
   The author of ``Raising PG Kids in an X-Rated Society,'' Gore's
crusade made her a lightning rod and in one oft-publicized remark,
Frank Zappa called her a ``cultural terrorist.'' Today, some of her
critics think more kindly of Tipper's labeling campaign, but she
remains a powerful symbol of a bruising cultural skirmish.
</P>
<P>
   But it is Lieberman who has compiled the most extensive record
and rhetoric on the subject, pushing for the V-chip TV filtering
device and rating systems for violent video games and asking the
FCC to examine broadcast television's ``increasingly salacious
content.'' With the Media Research Center, a conservative watchdog
group that has targeted TV shows from ``WWF Smackdown'' to
``Dawson's Creek'' for excessive violence and sex, he has lobbied
the networks to restablish ``the family hour.''
</P>
<P>
   Also a signatory to the ``Appeal to Hollywood,'' Lieberman has
joined Bennett to dispense ``Silver Sewer'' awards to ostracize
such cultural polluters as Howard Stern, Marilyn Manson, and Jerry
Springer. In a 1999 column for The New York Times he coauthored
with Senator John McCain, Lieberman railed against ``the
entertainment media's romanticized and sanitized version of
violence'' that is part of ``the toxic mix that's turning too many
of our kids into killers'' and asked the industry to develop
``comprehensive codes of conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the traditional coziness between Democrats and Hollywood
_ as evidenced by the parade of such stars as Barbara Streisand and
Warren Beatty at last week's convention _ some observers are not
surprised that their ticket would so eagerly embrace the
traditionally Republican family values platform.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Al Gore had really invented the Internet, there would have
been a V-chip,'' says Kaminer. ``I don't see Al Gore as a friend of
the First Amendment, especially when it comes to sex and violence
in the media.''
</P>
<P>
   CNN senior analyst William Schneider singles out baby boomers as
a crucial bloc in the campaign. Hoping that their own sex, drugs,
and rock 'n' roll days will not be visited on their children, they
are nervous parents and swing voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This campaign's been all about values and religion,'' says
Nina Crowley, executive director of Mass M.I.C., an organization
dedicated to free expression in music. ``I think it's a real vote
getter. I think there are so many parents out there who are afraid
their kids are going to get shot at school.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every election is about the incumbent,'' says Schneider,
offering another theory. ``Bill Clinton's distinction is that he is
the first president to come out of the culture of the '60s _ the
Elvis-loving, womanizing, non-inhaling president,'' he says. ``For
the Democrats at least,'' beating up on the dregs of pop culture is
``an effort to evade the Clinton problem. It's de-Clintonization.''
</P>
<P>
   Some free speech experts say it's also a way to encourage debate
about a legitimate issue: the entertainment industry's eagerness to
churn out smut and slime because of the simple fact that they
sell. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Noise ``oils democracy'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The First Amendment does not immunize the media from
criticism,'' says Fred Schauer, the Frank Stanton Professor of the
First Amendment at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. ``Given
the enormous pervasiveness of the mass media in all forms, I cringe
even more when this huge segment of the world we occupy is not
subject to public discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is effective to make noise,'' adds Peggy Charren, the
founder of Action For Children's Television. ``Noise is what oils
the democracy. The important thing is . . . just make sure the
government isn't there with a stick.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the relatively short leap from what Schauer calls the
``critics'' to the ``policymakers'' that worries the entertainment
world. Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Association of
America, calls Lieberman ``a very good friend'' and ``a wonderful
man,'' but warns that if he ``is suggesting that the government be
involved'' in regulating movies, ``he is on a very dangerous
path.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, The Thomas Jefferson Center gave Lieberman a ``Muzzle''
award for abridging free speech because he threatened legislative
action to get some networks to broadcast rating codes. It's the
mixing of persuasion and muscle that Heins views as both dangerous
and disingenous on the part of public officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not just jawboning,'' but using ``this bully pulpit to
try and impose coercion,'' she warns. ``The legislation keeps
coming. Real censorship does happen.''

<P>
   Craddock was so moved both by Presley's hip-shaking performance
and by the audience's raucous reaction that, writes music
journalist Susan VanHecke in this biography, he ``knew what he had
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   And he did it. The poor kid from Norfolk became Gene Vincent,
one of the first rock 'n' rollers, a major influence on dozens of
future stars, and a sad example of where the fast lane can
sometimes take you.
</P>
<P>
   He owed it all, the good and the bad, to ``Be-Bop-A-Lula,'' a
nonsensical song about a girl in red blue jeans who is queen of all
the teens, a girl who is his baby _ and ``I don't mean maybe.'' But
there was something about the way he sang those sappy lyrics in his
high, striking voice: a little bit sweet, a little bit sensual, and
a little bit Elvis. Capitol Records signed him up as the company's
answer to RCA's Presley.
</P>
<P>
   That song took Gene from the record studio to the concert stage,
where he and his first band, the Blue Caps (so named because they
wore those flat golf caps), delighted the crowds with their manic
performances. And if VanHecke's prose is sometimes overheated in
describing Gene on stage (``he tore into `Be-Bop-A Lula' like a
ravenous beast ripping the life from its helpless prey''), well,
his performances were overheated, too. Often dressed in black, he
bucked and cavorted, occasionally raising his left leg _
permanently in a brace and forever painful as a result of a
motorcycle accident _ over the top of the microphone stand. As he
sang, his face twisted into an approximation of agony, and he
punctuated his words with gasps, all of this causing the audience
to become similarly overheated _ especially the young girls, whom
VanHecke describes as ``sweaty and moist'' no less than four times.
</P>
<P>
   This was rock 'n' roll, melded from rhythm and blues, country,
and gospel, an ``unholy union of white folks' music and black
folks' music.'' And Gene Vincent was part of the first glorious
wave, along with Elvis, Little Richard, Jerry Lee Lewis, Chuck
Berry, Buddy Holly, Carl Perkins and others, most of whom Gene
would become friends with or perform with. Never mind that after
``Be-Bop-A-Lula'' he would have only a few mild hits such as ``Race
with the Devil'' _ he had the mystique. So he'd drive across the
country to perform, fueled by pills and booze and cigarettes and
the screams of his fans.
</P>
<P>
   It couldn't last, of course. Parental protests and cagy business
decisions brought about a sanitized, safer, and duller brand of
rock, featuring the likes of Frankie Avalon and Fabian. Yet if Gene
Vincent's popularity was waning in America, it wasn't in Europe;
there he was a cult figure, especially in England. But it was also
in England where he was injured in a car crash that killed his good
friend and fellow performer Eddie Cochran and added to the torment
that seemed to stalk him.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent is described dropping and adding wives and band members.
Some of the latter are more interesting than others, especially
Dickie Harrell, the wild-man drummer whose unrehearsed but joyous
scream can be heard on ``Be-Bop-A-Lula,'' and backing vocalist
Tommy ``Bubba'' Facenda (who one day would have a small success of
his own with the record ``High School U.S.A''). An ocean of
sometimes less-than-fascinating detail is reported about the
changing of band members and the making of records.
</P>
<P>
   With his lifestyle, too familiar among rock stars then and now,
the death of Gene Vincent _ in 1971, at 36, with chronic alcoholism
a key contributing factor _ has a ring of inevitability. Just how
much the singer, who had become paunchy and balding, had
deteriorated is made plain by the publishing of a rambling and
pathetic radio interview he did shortly before his death.
</P>
<P>
   VanHecke has done a lot of research into Vincent's life, but
mistakes about the era have crept in. President Kennedy's
assassination is misdated; a Beatles' hit is attributed to the
Rolling Stones; there is a badly reported account of the 1958
Boston Arena concert that led to a charge of inciting to riot
against disc jockey Alan Freed. (I was there: There were no
injuries or fights during the concert. The trouble came afterward
on the streets, and may have had little to do with the show.)
</P>
<P>
   One other quibble: Three pivotal events _ the motorcyle accident
that mangled Vincent's leg, the car crash with Eddie Cochran, and
Vincent's death _ aren't merely described. They're turned into
fantasies in which Gene is racing with the devil, whose
``smoldering orbs'' burn behind the windshield. Oh, please.
</P>
<P>
   But there's no quibbling over the impact of Gene Vincent on
rockers from the Beatles to Adam Ant to Jeff Beck. At Vincent's
1998 induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, John Fogerty
sang a bit of ``Be-Bop-A-Lula'' and then said: ``It doesn't get
much better than that. I do believe that this record is probably
one of the greatest records ever made.''
</P>
<P>
   Me too. And I don't mean maybe.

LINING UP FOR `ROADSHOW' RICHES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hummels are a joke among the experts on ``Chubb's Antiques
Roadshow.'' The cute collectible figurines may be lovable, but
they're not worth much. And there are so many of them. ``Roadshow''
appraisers get tired of being asked to examine them.
</P>
<P>
   But there are exceptional Hummels, and appraiser Gary Sohmers
knew he was looking at one Saturday, during the ``Roadshow's''
daylong appraisal marathon in Boston. This was not your average
Hummel, he said, but a ``very, very limited edition'' figure of an
F-84 jet airplane, all the more unusual for being ``very male.''
</P>
<P>
   Sohmers, of WexRex Collectibles in Framingham, Mass., estimated
the macho Hummel's worth at between $2,000 and $3,000. He and its
owner, an Air Force veteran, were taped chatting about the item in
a segment that may air in one of two Boston episodes of
``Roadshow'' scheduled for January.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Roadshow'' is PBS's highest-rated prime-time program.
Saturday's event drew 7,000 people who came carrying all sorts of
treasures (and trash) by hand, as well as by baby carriage, grocery
cart, dolly, pet carrier, luggage, Radio Flyer, and wheelbarrow.
Tickets, distributed free early last month, were marked with
appointed times. Every 90 minutes volunteers herded a fresh group
into line to wait their turn. The lines moved quickly. The waiting
area was air-conditioned. There was a place to buy drinks and
snacks. The room was full of optimism.
</P>
<P>
   Generalist appraisers took a quick look at people's items and
handed out tickets marked `furniture'' or ``jewelry'' or one of two
dozen other categories. Volunteers then escorted people into the
appraisal area and directed them to one of the specialty appraisal
tables set up around the perimeter. In the middle of the room, crew
members moved about taping interviews with those who'd brought
items deemed ``Roadshow''-worthy, while volunteers attempted to
keep everybody else out of camera range.
</P>
<P>
   ``His name is Fred,'' said Troy (reporters covering ``Roadshow''
events are asked not to use participants' last names or hometowns),
who was carting a nearly life-size bronze casting of Pheidippides _
the first, but not the last, person to collapse after running a
marathon. ``Fred'' was appraised at $20,000 to $30,000. However,
Troy was taped for the show because of a box of toys he'd brought
along, plastic figures from the 1940s, of the Lone Ranger, Tonto,
General Custer, Wyatt Earp, and others. Appraiser Leila Dunbar of
Sotheby's said the toy company reissued the figures just last year,
which meant that the value of originals such as Troy's dropped from
$250 each to $150. Dunbar said it was a good example of how
reissues can affect the collectibles market.
</P>
<P>
   In one corner of the appraisal area Leigh and Leslie Keno looked
at furniture and held court for admirers, including Anthony, 15,
who shyly asked each twin brother for his autograph. He said he had
been eager to attend the event to learn more about antiques. He was
clearly thrilled to be in the presence of so many well-known
appraisers, especially the charismatic Kenos, ``Roadshow's''
fair-haired stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love to see them on the show,'' said Pamela, a 40-ish woman
who was waiting for one of the Kenos to appraise a chair.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're so enthusiastic,'' her sister, Evelyn, added.
</P>
<P>
   It was the sisters' turn to be enthusiastic when Leslie Keno
said their cherrywood chair was made in Rhode Island around 1780,
and that the set of six chairs might fetch $15,000.
</P>
<P>
   As the day wore on there were more than enough valuable items
and stories to keep the appraisers interested and the
``Roadshow's'' producers happy. Most participants seemed pleased
too, if only to be part of the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, there were many who were disappointed, but some
managed to laugh about it. Book appraiser Ken Gloss of the Brattle
Book Shop in Boston examined a small leather-bound book and broke
the bad news to its owner. ``These are very common,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, don't tell me that,'' she said. ``I told my friends we
were going home in a limo.''

TEAMSTER HEAD'S TIE TO GOP RUNS DEEP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHEN KURKJIAN AND SHELLEY MURPHY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Teamsters official under fire for his local's
hard-nosed tactics became the dominant figure in negotiating labor
contracts with Hollywood studios in part through an alliance he
forged with the Weld-Cellucci administration.
</P>
<P>
   Recent interviews and documents released by the administration
of Governor Paul Cellucci on Friday show that the state in mid-1993
acquiesced in giving George W. Cashman's Local 25 sole authority to
negotiate with the studios and filmmakers who were planning to
shoot movies in Massachusetts and needed drivers for their sets.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Weld-Cellucci administration was moving to
back Cashman's effort to have a Hollywood-style sound studio built
with state funds on the campus of Bunker Hill Community College,
less than a mile away from Local 25's headquarters in Charlestown.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, the administration appropriated $150,000 to a private
firm headed by Cashman to pay for a study of the feasibility of
establishing a sound studio in Massachusetts. Although the study by
Arthur D. Little Inc., a Cambridge consulting firm, raised
questions about the economic viability of the facility, the
administration went ahead the next year and approved a $13.5
million bond issue to finance the construction.
</P>
<P>
   The sound studio still has not been built, but the backing of
Cashman's request _ while it was killing a proposal for a similar
facility to be built with private funds _ indicates that the
administration was building an alliance with Cashman.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Cashman was appointed by then-governor William
F. Weld to a seat on the Massachusetts Port Authority's board of
directors. According to sources, the administration had previously
offered the job to another Teamsters official. However, that
official turned it down when he was told he would be expected to
vote for Stephen Tocco _ then head of the state Office of Economic
Affairs, and widely regarded as having an anti-labor record _ as
executive director of Massport.
</P>
<P>
   Within days of being named to the Massport board in July 1993,
Cashman was voting with other Weld board members to appoint Tocco
to the job and to fire five appointees of then-governor Michael
Dukakis from their positions at the agency.
</P>
<P>
   Those political ties, which resulted in Cellucci gaining Local
25's endorsement for governor in 1998, have made Massachusetts
unusual among states with unionized labor seeking to attract
filmmakers. Here, the governor has been involved in mediating
disputes between the controlling local and the movie studios, even
while advisers were urging Cellucci to follow an example set by New
York politicians in the 1980s. At the time, officials suggested
studios avoid filming there until the Teamsters were more
compromising.
</P>
<P>
   In recent interviews, officials who were part of the
Weld-Cellucci administration said they believed that Cashman, who
was elected head of Local 25 in late 1991 on a reform ticket, was
intent on making changes inside the union and establishing a new,
positive image. Cashman accompanied Weld on a trade mission to
Hollywood in late March and early April 1993 during which he
impressed studio executives, as well as state officials, with his
pledge that the Teamsters wanted to cooperate in the effort to
persuade more filmmakers to work in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't take much to see the handwriting on the wall, that
the (Weld-Cellucci) administration believed there was much to be
gained by aligning itself with Cashman,'' said one now-retired
labor official who was on the trade mission. ``The question is now
whether George has lived up to all the promises he made about
having the Teamsters turn over a new leaf.''
</P>
<P>
   John Birtwell, Cellucci's spokesman, says the governor continues
to support the decision to back Cashman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a mixed blessing,'' Birtwell said of the ties
between Cashman and Weld and Cellucci. ``Certainly, dealing with
the Teamsters is better now than it was before 1990. But it's also
not the optimum that everyone would hope . . . To us, the needle
points to a qualified success.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, several moviemakers have complained to the
Massachusetts Film Office and the Department of Economic
Development about high fees that must be paid to Teamsters drivers
and crew chiefs, and about the heavyhanded tactics that Teamsters
officials periodically use when studios seek to reduce the costs. A
federal grand jury, investigating allegations of extortion of movie
executives by Local 25 officials, has in recent months subpoenaed
records from several Hollywood studios, Local 25, and the
Massachusetts Film Office.
</P>
<P>
   Birtwell defended the governor's dealings with Cashman and Local
25, pointing to the success Cellucci has had in mediating disputes
between the union and the producers of ``The Perfect Storm'' in
1999 and ``The Love Letter'' in 1998. However, Birtwell suggested
that Cashman and Local 25 might have to do more to combat the image
that emerges from the film office's records that were released
Friday. Those documents indicate that the union is not interested
in compromising on its benefits-laden contract in order to
encourage studios to film in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Among the documents were several letters between Lou
DiGiampaolo, Local 25's chief movie negotiator, and the producers
of the film ``Summer Catch,'' which was filmed in North Carolina in
recent months even though it revolves around collegians playing
baseball in the Cape Cod League in Massachusetts. DiGiampaolo
refused to compromise on contract-provided benefits for Teamsters
crew members _ a guaranteed 75-hour work week with guaranteed
overtime after each eight-hour workday for all drivers, a minimum
$2,500 a week for a Teamsters crew chief, James P. Flynn, and meal
and living allowance for all drivers if the film was shot outside
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't have films like that, that are so part of our lives
here, deciding to film outside the state,'' Birtwell said.
</P>
<P>
   Cashman's Local 25 has been authorized by the Teamsters
International in Washington since late 1993 to negotiate the
union's contracts with moviemakers who are seeking to shoot films
in Massachusetts _ as well as the three northern New England
states.
</P>
<P>
   However, for at least a year before, Joint Council 10, which
represents Teamsters locals throughout New England, had been
competing with Local 25 for the right to be involved in the
negotiations as well, according to documents released Friday by the
Cellucci administration.
</P>
<P>
   Robert G. DeRusha, principal officer for Council 10, argued that
drivers from other Teamsters locals should be used on film
productions that were being shot in their areas, and not solely
members of Local 25. In addition, DeRusha said since DiGiampaolo
and Flynn, Cashman's two top lieutenants with the movie industry,
both had arrest records, there was reason to question Cashman's
claim that he represented a break from past Teamsters tradition.
</P>
<P>
   DeRusha's request in June 1993 to Linda Peterson Warren, then
head of the state Film Office, to intervene and allow Joint Council
10 to make its case with the Weld-Cellucci administration, was
turned aside.
</P>
<P>
   According to a memo she sent to Tocco on July 13, she had been
informed by the union's international in Washington that Teamsters
president Ron Carey, whom Cashman had supported in the 1991
election, had ruled that Local 25 had the authority to negotiate
contracts for all movies filmed in Massachusetts and the northern
New England states. Pending written notification, which came weeks
later, Warren wrote that only Local 25 would negotiate with
filmmakers seeking Teamsters contracts to shoot movies in
Massachusetts.

Landler.

   LATIN-AMERICA-INTERNET (Undated) _ The Internet revolution has
definitely come to Latin America. But whether the businesses and

   GORE _ HANNIBAL, Mo. - Al Gore's campaign riverboat steamed into
Mark Twain's boyhood home Monday night with a message drawn from
the legenday humorist: news of the death of Gore's presidential bid
has been greatly exaggerated. Gore's trip along 400 miles of the
Mississippi River ended with the vice president having erased the
commanding lead Republican rival has held in public opinion polls.
But Gore still has a long way to go. (Shepard, Atlanta

   RUSSIA-SUB _ MOSCOW _ The latest developments on the 118-member
crew of the Russian navy sub Kursk, which is sitting at the bottom
of the Barents Sea about 350 feet below the surface. A Norwegian
dive team managed to open two of the escape hatches to find that
they were both flooded, confirming the grim reality that the entire
crew is dead _ and likely has been since the accident happened more
than a week ago. Developing. (Coker, Cox News Service). 30.

   RUSSIA-SIDE _ ATLANTA _ Russian President Vladimir Putin's
handling of the submarine crisis _ including his failure to
interrupt his vacation and his reluctance to quickly accept

   HURRICANE-PREPARE _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ South Florida is
entering the teeth of the hurricane season. You can expect at least
the threat of a hurricane, with everything that triggers that, at
least once in the next three to four weeks. Perhaps you'll be
looking at a hurricane warning as early as Thursday, if Debby aims
our way. Perhaps not. Now is not the time to panic. But it is time
for this: all those things you were supposed to do in May, but
didn't? Do them now. If Debby, or any other storm, comes our way in
the coming weeks, and you wait until a watch or warning has been
issued, you can expect to be fighting for plywood, batteairlines to
discuss problems with air travel. (Malone, Cox News Service). 22.

   PIPELINE _ WASHINGTON - The company that owns a 30-inch pipeline

not been trained to accurately determine whether the pipeline was

   SCHOOLS-ECHO _ WASHINGTON _ Education Secretary Richard Riley
releases his fifth annual Baby Boom Echo report on national and
state trends Monday in Henderson, Nev. It will say that rising
enrollments (53 million this year in K-12) set a record, and Riley
will claim that this shows that educating the children of baby
boomers requires federal subsidies for school modernization,
renovation and repair and for the reduction of the number of
portable classrooms parked on school grounds. This launches a
week-long drive by the administration to build support for
``building better schools'' before the Republican Congress returns
for the final weeks of nose-to-nose negotations with the Democratic
president over the budget for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1.

   SCHUETT-COLUMN_ SANDWICH, Mass. _ Getting such a late start

the local video store where 30 minutes later we discover there's
not a thing in the entire New Release section that sounds the least
bit Interesting. Through a process of elimination, our only hope
seems to be a Tom Cruise thing called ``Magnolia.'' (Schuett, Cox

   LANE-COLUMN _ DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Why is it considered
natural, laudable and an affirmation of family tradition when kids
go to their parents' old colleges, yet if they end up at the same
high school, everyone gets uncomfortable? Case in point: look at
George W. Bush. He went to Yale like his father and grandfather and
it's considered part of a heritage. But because he also went to the
same prep school as his father, people snicker about how WASP and
preppy and weird that seems. (Lane, Daytona Beach News-Journal)

 &HT;    KURSK CREW DECLARED DEAD, WHILE PLANS FOR SALVAGE COMMENCE
 &HT;    By MARGARET COKER 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW - Russian and Norwegian officials broke off rescue
operations and declared the 118 crewmembers of a wrecked Russian
submarine dead after confirmation came Monday that the vessel was
entirely flooded.
</P>
<P>
   Russian Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov said he would ask for
international help to raise the 500-foot Kursk submarine from the
frigid depths of the Barents Sea, and recover its two nuclear
reactors, a process that is expected to take months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our worst expectations are confirmed. All sections of the sub
are totally flooded and not a single member of the crew remains
alive,'' Russia's naval chief of staff Mikhail Motsak said in a
televised statement.
</P>
<P>
   The news devastated family members of the Kursk crew especially
hard. Many had traveled for days to Murmansk, the northwestern port
city where the sub was based, only to be met with waves of
contradictory information given by the government and tides of
rumor about the cause of the Aug. 12 accident _ which is still
unknown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our prayers have gone unanswered,'' cried Vera Polivaeva,
whose nephew Alexei was one of those aboard the sub.
</P>
<P>
   Norwegian divers invited to participate in the rescue attempt
after one week of failed Russian forays succeeded Monday in opening
the rear escape hatch of the vessel. This was the only portion of
the Oscar-class submarine that officials thought might not be
flooded.
</P>
<P>
   However, divers reported that the compartment underneath the air
hatch was completely filled with water, eliminating the final hope
that a human could still be alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no hope for survivors. It has been determined it is
time to terminate the rescue operation,'' said Lt. Col. John Espen
Lien, a spokesman for the Norwegian armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   A British rescue mini-submarine was not used because the divers
determined there was no point, officials said. The Norwegian divers
found no sign of radiation leaks Monday.
</P>
<P>
   While Moscow initially refused to accept Western aid to rescue
the crew, Russian officials made clear that the salvage operation
needed to retrieve the nuclear reactors and the crew members'
bodies could not happen without outside help and financing.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Wednesday, the first meeting to discuss the salvage
operation will be held,'' said Klebanov, the Russian official in
charge of the situation. ``It will be an international project. We
shall have to ask for help. No country on its own would be able to
perform it.''
</P>
<P>
   Norway said its diving team would send a remote-controlled
camera down to film the interior of the submarine and help the
Russians decide how to plan the salvage operation, and perhaps lend
clues to how the fatal accident occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Russian military officers have said the most likely sequence of
events for the disaster was that there was a first explosion,
either from inside the vessel or caused by a collision. This
wrecked the front of the sub, sending it straight into the sea bed.
The impact led to a detonation of the Kursk's torpedoes ripping
large parts of the hull apart. The crew, Russian military officials
believe, died immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Water almost instantly flooded the submarine's hull up to the
fifth or sixth compartments. The crew in those sections died almost
instantaneously and the submarine became uncontrollable,'' Klebanov
said.
</P>
<P>
   Family members have stepped up already strong criticism to what
they say has been an inefficient and callous response by Russian
authorities to their tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first news we heard was from you,'' Vladimir Blazhkin, the
father of one of the crew members, told Russia's private NTV
television station, his voice coarse and breaking as he struggled
to hold back tears. ``We did not even know if our son was on the
sub until you published the list. His commanders did not tell us
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   He was joined in his strong criticism by the Russian media on
Monday. ``To what depths of cynicism you must sink to lie so
blatantly,'' the daily Moskovsky Komsomolets said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Kremlin has been shattered by its own cynicism,'' said the
newspaper Novaya Gazeta.
</P>
<P>
   However, an opinion poll released Monday morning suggested that
Putin has not yet suffered major fallout due to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   In a poll of 500 Muscovites conducted over the weekend by the
Romir research agency, 50 percent of respondents blamed Russia's
Navy command and Defense Ministry for the loss of the submarine.
Only 17 percent said Putin was to blame.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, 59 percent of those polled said their attitude to
Putin had not changed because of the crisis. Before the accident,
polls showed Putin's popularity above 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The polling agency did not establish a margin of error for the
survey.
</P>
<P>
   Norwegian officials, who have contradicted official Russian
statements about the state of the wreckage and criticized the red
tape surrounding the operation, said it was unclear whether
international expertise, if called on earlier, could have saved any
lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say. It's something you just can't speculate on. We
had different weather, different conditions,'' said Lt. Col. Espen
Lien.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to turn public opinion, Prime Minister Mikhail
Kasyanov announced Monday that relatives of the crew members would
receive larger-than-average compensation packages for the dead
servicemen, some of whom were as young as 20 years of age.
</P>
<P>
   Civic response to the families' suffering has been tremendous.
Individuals from around the country have sent financial donations
to newly organized humanitarian groups determined to help the
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some remained inconsolable.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can anything help when our son is underwater, underground
for good,'' Blazhkin said.

<P>
   SCI-RACE-GENES (Undated) _ Scientists have long suspected that
the racial categories recognized by society are not reflected on
the genetic level. But the more closely that researchers examine
the human genome, the more most of them are convinced that the
standard labels used to distinguish people by ``race'' have little
or no biological meaning. Are differences between humans only skin
deep? By Natalie Angier. (2350 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-GSUIT (Undated) _ Many of today's military aircraft
accelerate so quickly and turn so rapidly that they meet or exceed
the physical limits of their pilots. And a new generation of
higher-performance jets soon to join air forces around the world
promises to worsen the problem, making it even harder for the human
component of these weapon systems to keep up with the mechanical.
By Warren E. Leary. (1875 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-CHINA-RICE (Undated) _ In a stunning new result from what
has become one of the largest agricultural experiments ever,
thousands of rice farmers in China have doubled the yields of their
most valuable crop and nearly eliminated its most devastating
disease _ without using chemical treatments or spending a single
extra penny. Led by a team of scientists, the farmers were able to
abandon chemical fungicides previously widely used to fight rice
blast _ the most important disease of the most important staple in
the world. By Carol Kaesuk Yoon. (1400 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BUTTERFLIES-CORN (Undated) _ Ever since last year when
scientists reported that pollen from genetically engineered corn
could kill monarch butterfly caterpillars in the laboratory,
scientists have been battling over one central question: Are these
beloved butterflies being harmed by the millions of acres of
biotech corn being planted across the country? A new study suggests
the answer is yes. By Carol Kaesuk Yoon. (675 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ A science question answered: Are there
really caterpillars that scream to protect themselves? If so what
types? Can we hear the sound they make? By C. Caliborne Ray. (270
words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-PADIAN-AIDS (Undated) _ A conversation with Dr. Nancy
Padian, 48, an epidemiologist who is director of research for the
AIDS Research Institute of the University of California at San
Francisco. Padian is one of the world's foremost experts on the
heterosexual transmission of AIDS. By Claudia Dreifus.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-MEXICO-MEDICINE (Undated) _ A medical doctor with a
scholarly interest in pre-Columbian art appears to have pushed back
the date of the earliest scientific medical illustration by several
centuries with his study of bizarre two faced ancient Mexican
figurines known to art historians as the `pretty ladies of
Tlatilco.'' By William H. Honan. (800 words)
</P>

   SCI-GROWING-TEETH (Undated) _ In a test of the accumulating new
knowledge about how organs are generated in developing organs, a
team of researchers at the Harvard Medical School and elsewhere has
succeeded in making chick embryos grow tooth buds. By Nicholas
Wade. (675 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-WATCH (Undated) _ News and notes on science: Left on a hot
summer day, a tray of ice cubes turns to liquid water. Put back in
the freezer, the liquid water turns back to ice. But the number of
water molecules in the tray remains more or less constant. This
basic fact is the key to understanding how icy the earth got in the
last ice age 200 centuries ago. By Henry Fountain. (700 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-COMPASSION (Undated) _ Compassion has become medically and
politically correct. Re-emerging with a vengeance among educators,
medical associations and hospital administrators, it is as though
caregivers and thier chargers have suddenly discovered humility,
mortality and goodness. By John Lagone. (1280 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-WRITING-PHYSICIANS (Undated) _ Each year it seems that more
and more physicians are putting aside their stethoscopes for word
processors. Indeed, the most casual look at publishers' book lists
or major magazines and newspapers demonstrates that an increasing
cadre of doctors is writing best-selling works of nonfiction,
novels, plays, motion pictures and essays. Even professional
conferences are being held to encourage physicians with literary
aspirations. By Howard Markel, M.D. (1425 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-PERSONAL-TRAINERS (Undated) _ Although more than 4 million
Americans use personal trainers, there are few standards governing
the more than 66,000 people who make a living buffing biceps and
toning pecs. The term is not legally defined and states do not
require certification, a minimum training or licensing. Anyone who
can hoist a dumbbell and print a business card on a home computer
can call him or herself a personal trainer. By Liz Neporent. (835
words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-PSYCHE-TRAITS (Undated) _ One of the many odd experiences of
being a psychiatrist is discovering that seemingly benign traits
can have a dark and even pathological side to them. A
characteristic that we would typically dismiss lightly in everyday
life _ a tendency to procrastinate, a hot temper or a
fastidiousness about details _ sends up a red flag for a
psychiatrist. At times what appears to be a minor eccentricity can
afford a glimpse into a large and unsuspected landscape of
symptoms. By Anna Fels, M.D. (800 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ The Personal Health column: Each
year, several hundred people succumb to anaphylactic attacks, the
American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology says, because
they fail to use epinephrine as a first-aid measure or fail to use
it soon enough. Further deaths result when victims fail to seek
professional medical help after using epinephrine, which suppresses
the attack, for only about 20 minutes. By Jane E. Brody. (1525
words)
</P>
<P>
   VITAL-SIGNS (Undated) _ News and notes on health and fitness:
</P>
<P>
   _ Women who have had hysterectomies have a 60 percent greater
risk of being incontinent by the time they are 60, according to a
new report in The Lancet. This means the onset can be well after
the date of surgery, since most women who have hysterectomies do so
in their 40s or 50s. The operation is the second most common major
surgical procedure for women. (225 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ A new study suggests that when it comes to one of the
conditions for which antibiotics are often dispensed _ children's
earaches _ the treatment may be of little value. The study,
sponsored by the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and
Quality, found that almost two-thirds of children with acute otitis
media, or middle ear infection, recover from pain and fever within
24 hours of diagnosis _ without antibiotics. (300 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ As it stands now, millions of diabetics need to take blood
samples several times a day by piercing their fingers _ a
time-consuming and somewhat painful practice. But a recent study
suggests that things may become easier. Writing in the Diabetes
Technology and Therapeutics, researchers said diabetics may one day
be able to monitor glucose levels by just passing a beam of
infrared light through the skin.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cochlear implants have been used for almost a decade to help
thousands of profoundly deaf children, but some two-thirds of
insurance companies are often unwilling to pay, citing a lack of
evidence that the devices are cost-effective. A new study, however,
reports that over the course of a deaf person's life, the implants
can save more than $50,000 in costs associated with the disability.

APPROVAL OF VIETNAM TRADE DEAL NOT LIKELY THIS YEAR, U.S. OFFICIAL
SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ A senior Clinton administration official said Monday
that Congress was not likely to approve a landmark trade agreement
between the United States and Vietnam this year. The official,
Robert Mallett, said the administration was sending him to Hanoi to
reassure Vietnamese officials and to ``keep the drumbeat going for
economic reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Mallett, the deputy secretary of commerce, predicted that the
deal, signed in Washington on July 13, would be approved by
Congress regardless of how many seats each party gains or loses or
who wins the presidency in November. Neither Republicans nor
Democrats, he said, will seek to kill an agreement that has great
potential benefits for both countries.
</P>
<P>
   But Mallett also said that carrying out the deal would be as
arduous as the four years it took to hammer it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been some talk about foot-dragging in Vietnam,''
Mallett said in an interview here during a stopover on his way to
Hanoi. ``If you're going to have foot-dragging, then their economy
is not going to improve. Economic reform must be a front-burner
issue for Vietnam.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the issues Mallett said he would raise with Vietnamese
officials is the protection of intellectual property. Although
Hanoi has passed laws protecting copyrights, he said it was not
enforcing them adequately. He also plans to discuss labor
conditions, which were not addressed in the trade deal but have
been an issue because of Vietnam's reputation for sweat-shop
factories.
</P>
<P>
   ``They cannot expect to be a member of the group of trading
nations and pretend that labor doesn't matter,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Mallett was sanguine about the prospects for trade
between the United States and Vietnam. He said U.S. exports to
Vietnam could grow to between $800 million and $1 billion a year
within two years of the ratification of the deal. That compares
with $291 million last year, and only $4 million in 1993, the year
before President Clinton lifted the trade embargo.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, Vietnamese products would gain improved
access to U.S. markets, with the average tariff on Vietnamese goods
falling to 3 percent from nearly 40 percent. In return, it would
open itself to U.S. banks, insurers and retailers, though on a
somewhat slower timetable than in the recent trade agreement
between China and the United States.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The long road the China trade bill is taking through Congress is
one reason the Clinton administration is unlikely to push the
Vietnam pact before the end of the year. With Congress facing a
crowded calendar and an impending election, administration
officials said the White House was pouring its resources into
winning Senate approval of permanent normal trading relations with
China.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the delay, the Vietnamese government is already
starting to carry out provisions of the agreement. Hanoi, for
example, recently issued a license to American International Group,
a U.S. insurer, to sell life insurance. Under the terms of the
deal, the government does not have to allow wholly foreign-owned
insurance companies to operate in the country for five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Implementation is a legitimate concern, but in some ways, the
Vietnamese have been going much faster than the agreement
requires,'' said Frederick Burke, a lawyer with Baker &AMP; McKenzie in
Ho Chi Minh City.
</P>
<P>
   Burke said his fear was that Vietnam would try to set up
non-tariff barriers, similar to those erected by Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Vietnamese just introduced a law that requires people on
motorcycles to wear helmets,'' he said. ``But some people here are
saying that only Vietnamese-made helmets are appropriate for
Vietnamese heads.''

&HT;     PASSENGERS SUE AMERICAN AIRLINES OVER DRY ICE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (Eds: Stands for AIRLINE-TRAINING)  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By PETER HARTLAUB  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Two passengers have sued American Airlines,
claiming flight attendants on two separate flights gave them dry
ice to treat aches. Both plaintiffs said they suffered burns from
the ice packs.
</P>
<P>
   Safi Nairobi, a San Francisco-based commercial photographer,
said her burns were so severe that the pilot of her San
Francisco-bound airplane was diverted to Denver, where she was
hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   A nearly identical incident happened on another American flight
last August, according to a separate lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Raising questions about the training flight attendants get at
American, the nation's third-largest carrier, Nairobi's lawyer,
Charles A. Bonner, said: ``In the most positive light, someone is
grossly negligent. In the worst light, they're just outright
stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   An American Airlines spokesman said the airline does not comment
on pending litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Nairobi's said she was injured Aug. 4, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Armin Khalili, who also lives in the San Francisco area, said he
suffered injuries from dry ice on an Aug. 17, 1999, flight after
requesting ice for a sprained ankle.
</P>
<P>
   After being seated on a flight from Chicago, Nairobi claims she
was handed an ice pack wrapped in cloth, which she placed on her
sore back before falling asleep. When she woke up an hour later,
her back felt warm. She got up and it was wrinkled and numb to the
touch.
</P>
<P>
   Nairobi showed her injury to a flight attendant, who said, ``Oh,
my God, you've been burned,'' according to the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   After a doctor on board looked at the injuries, the captain
decided to land in Denver, where Nairobi was treated at several
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   More than a year later, Bonner said Nairobi still has a scar on
her lower back the size of a pancake, and may have damage to her
nervous system.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears like she's permanently branded by this dry ice,''
Conner said. ``She has a scar that she will probably go to her
grave with.''
</P>
<P>
   The degree of Khalili's injuries are not specified in the
lawsuit, and his lawyer did not return calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint asserts that Khalili ``continues to suffer
residual injuries.''
</P>
<P>
   Ed Perkins, consumer advocate for the American Society of Travel
Agents, said the alleged injuries were unusual.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never, ever heard of this particular situation,'' Perkins
said.
</P>
<P>
   Perkins said when it comes to safety, American has ``a
better-than-average reputation'' among major airlines.

&HT;     CHRYSLER SPIFFS UP ITS STAPLE MINIVAN 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When DaimlerChrysler set out to redesign its best-selling
minivans for 2001, creating the fourth generation of a vehicle line
that began with the 1983 introduction of the Plymouth Voyager and
Dodge Caravan, an old adage came to the minds of everyone involved
with the project:
</P>
<P>
   ``If it ain't broke, don't fix it.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite hot new competition from Ford Motor Co. and the
Japanese, the DaimlerChrysler minivans remain the company's
bread-and-butter vehicles, selling at a rate of more than 500,000
annually in North America and 600,000 worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, for instance, the company sold 504,000 of them in
North America, more than twice the sales of the nearest competitor,
the Ford Windstar. Since their 1983 introduction, more than 8.3
million have been sold.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the competition had been making inroads, and
DaimlerChrysler had seen its share of the minivan market fall from
well over 80 percent to just 40 percent last year _ and only 33
percent in the biggest segment of the market, vans priced from
$20,000 to $30,000.
</P>
<P>
   And as any business school graduate knows, every product has a
life cycle. That's one of the first lessons taught in Business 101,
with, invariably, the buggy whip used as an example.
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler last redesigned its minivan lineup in the mid-'90s, so
the end of the current life cycle was nearing. Since then, Toyota
has introduced its new Sienna, Honda its all-new Odyssey, Mazda the
new MPV and Ford an updated Windstar, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, DaimlerChrysler found itself with the oldest minivan
design on the market, which isn't where the company thought it
should be if it wanted to maintain dominance in the segment it had
discovered, defined and ruled for 17 years.
</P>
<P>
   So how do you change a product that is still the favorite among
consumers, and which, by most observers' standards, really wasn't
broken?
</P>
<P>
   Very carefully, DaimlerChrysler said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spent 32 months and $2.8 billion to change everything about
the vehicle,'' said Ken Nelson, a DaimlerChrysler minivan platform
engineer, who helped introduce the newest vans to the automotive
news media during a national media rollout last week in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Customers count on us to be the leader in this segment, so we
came up with a new list of firsts,'' he said. ``Over the first
three generations, we had created 38 firsts in the segment, so here
we go again.''
</P>
<P>
   Styling, understandably, wasn't drastically changed. There are
new angles and creases in the exterior, new headlights, taillights
and grilles, but overall, the new vans look much like those of the
previous generation.
</P>
<P>
   But there are changes through and through, including some of
those new firsts _ such as the industry's first power rear
liftgate.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors introduced the first sliding passenger doors for
minivans in the early '90s, something that took Chrysler a while to
catch up with. But the new minivans, due out this fall as 2001
models, will be offered with the power liftgate, which allows mom
or dad or even the kids to open and close the tailgate with the
mere push of a button.
</P>
<P>
   And just like the power sliding doors on each side of the new
minivans, the liftgate will automatically stop in its tracks if it
detects an obstacle. A DaimlerChrysler engineer demonstrated his
faith in this technology by standing under one of the liftgates as
a colleague pushed the button on the remote control to close it. It
worked.
</P>
<P>
   This feature will be available only on long-wheelbase versions
of the new minivans. It is a standalone $250 option, except on the
Town &AMP; Country Limited, where it is a standard item, the company
said.
</P>
<P>
   It can't be offered on the short-wheelbase models because of
space limitations in the cargo area. But two-thirds of all
DaimlerChrysler minivans sold are the long-wheelbase versions.
</P>
<P>
   Other firsts include such convenience items as a pull-up cargo
organizer in the rear floor, with compartments that can hold six
filled paper grocery bags; cup holders attached to the outboard
middle-row seats with a special mechanism that holds the drink
level even when the seat is tilted forward to allow access to the
third row; and recessed hooks on the backs of all the seats to
suspend plastic grocery bags so the groceries don't spill out and
roll all over the floor.
</P>
<P>
   As for the third row of seats, DaimlerChrysler decided against a
seat that folds completely into the floor like the ones in the new
Mazda MPV and Honda Odyssey.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the new Dodge and Chrysler minivans will be available
with an optional 50-50 split rear bench seat that can be removed a
half at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the 110-pound weight of the full bench seat in last
year's vans, each half of this seat weights just 55 pounds and can
be removed or reinstalled by almost anyone strong enough to lift
it, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the engineers on hand for the media presentations said
his 12-year-old daughter can do it. With just one-half of the third
seat removed, two bicycles can be fitted into the cargo area,
standing up.
</P>
<P>
   More firsts include electric motors mounted inside the sliding
doors to allow for easier manual operation if necessary, and
automatic latching devices that finish closing the liftgate or
sliding doors if they don't fully latch on the first try. Mom
doesn't have to get out of the driver's seat and walk around the
vehicle to finish closing the door.
</P>
<P>
   The dashboard has a new, heavier padding, but it's still flat
and large enough to hold two Happy Meals, DaimlerChrysler said.
</P>
<P>
   An optional three-zone temperature control setup allows the
driver, front passenger and rear passengers to set their own
climate comfort levels in some uplevel Town &AMP; Country models,
another first.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, the hood has been raised one inch for better visibility
of it from the driver's seat, creases have been added in the side
sheet metal to give the design a ``pulled tighter'' look and add
definition, and the Dodge Caravan models have a distinctive large
new grille that ``makes the vehicle recognizable as a Dodge from a
full football field away,'' a company spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Headlights are 50 percent larger and 80 percent brighter, and
the center high-mounted stop lamp has been moved from the middle of
the liftgate to the top, above the rear window.
</P>
<P>
   Four-wheel disc brakes will be standard on all-wheel-drive
models _ another exclusive for the class _ and the nose of the vans
has been extended an inch and made 47 pounds heavier for better
energy absorption in the event of a collision.
</P>
<P>
   Head-injury protection has been added in the roof, and new
child-seat tethers and anchors are standard. Chrysler's optional
integrated child-safety seats continue to be offered with the new
models.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the changes are cosmetic or safety related; performance
also has been enhanced.
</P>
<P>
   The base 3.3-liter V-6 engine has been increased to 180
horsepower from last year's 158; the 3.8-liter V-6 now turns out
215 horsepower, up from 180; and on the uplevel Town &AMP; Country, a
3.5-liter, 230-horsepower engine borrowed from the Chrysler 300M
sedan will be added to the lineup next spring.
</P>
<P>
   All the engines are designed to run on regular fuel, too.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen models will be sold for 2001 _ nine with front-wheel
drive and five with all-wheel drive.
</P>
<P>
   They include four trim levels in Dodge Caravan badging, and five
under the Chrysler name _ two short-wheelbase models called Voyager
and three long-wheelbase versions with the Town &AMP; Country
designation. (For 2001, the Plymouth Voyager becomes a Chrysler as
DaimlerChrysler continues its phaseout of the Plymouth brand name.)
</P>
<P>
   As before, the minivans will be priced from the upper teens to
the mid-$30,000s. This will allow DaimlerChrysler to continue its
dominance of the lower end of the minivan price scale, where it
holds a 67 percent market share of vans under $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   At the upper end of the scale, minivans priced over $30,000,
DaimlerChrysler hopes to hold onto _ or even improve _ its current
50 percent market share. All-wheel-drive versions of the Town &AMP;
Country are expected to be influential in this effort, because most
of the competitors don't offer all-wheel drive.
</P>
<P>
   The company says that, adjusted for additional content, the
pricing of the new minivans remains the same as the 2000 models
they replace.
</P>
<P>
   That means that where new and better stuff has been added,
consumers will have to pay for that; but there are no price
increases on the base vehicles when compared with similarly
equipped 2000 models.
</P>
<P>
   The absolute top-of-the-line model is the all-wheel-drive Town &AMP;
Country Limited. It costs $37,790, including transportation.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler minivans are made in Windsor, Ontario; St.
Louis; and Graz, Austria.

&HT;     CHRYSLER GIVES ITS SEDANS A NEW BOOST 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler wants you to forget the Ford Taurus, Honda
Accord and Toyota Camry, and instead buy one of its two all-new
midsize sedans: the 2001 Dodge Stratus and Chrysler Sebring.
</P>
<P>
   During a national media introduction for the cars in Seattle
recently, DaimlerChrysler officials suggested these sedans will hit
the mark with consumers where the previous-generation Dodge and
Chrysler midsize sedans failed miserably.
</P>
<P>
   The company needs to become a player in this market, because
even with money rolling in from DaimlerChrysler's popular minivans,
trucks and sport-utility vehicles (including the Jeep products),
financial success in today's auto industry requires that a company
have significant sales of traditional cars, too. They still make up
50 percent of all new-vehicle purchases.
</P>
<P>
   And if coupes rather than sedans are your forte, then
DaimlerChrysler has two other brand-new models for you to choose
from: the Dodge Stratus and Chrysler Sebring coupes. Unlike the
practice of most other automakers, which generally use the same
basic car to create sedan and coupe versions of a particular model,
DaimlerChrysler has coupes that are different from sedans of the
same name.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the sedans are designed and built by DaimlerChrysler,
with domestic engines, while the coupes are designed and built by
Mitsubishi, DaimlerChrysler's Japanese partner, with Mitsubishi
engines.
</P>
<P>
   The sedans certainly look a lot better than their predecessors,
whose bulk of sales primarily was to rental-car and corporate
fleets. Although the new sedans are built on the same basic chassis
platform as before, DaimlerChrysler says the components are all
new, from the larger, standard 15-inch tires to the sleek new
rooflines.
</P>
<P>
   And even though the Stratus and Sebring sedans are essentially
the same car, there are enough styling differences to make each one
appear to be a different vehicle. The biggest differences are in
the grilles, and the Chrysler model, as is to be expected, looks
more elegant, while the Dodge version is sportier-looking.
</P>
<P>
   The styling is impressive on both, clearly an improvement over
the sedans they replace _ the 2000 Dodge Stratus and Chrysler
Cirrus. The Cirrus nameplate is gone for 2001, as Chrysler tries to
create a new image for its midsize sedan, renaming it to carry the
same designation as last year's similar-sized Sebring convertible
and coupe models.
</P>
<P>
   That's probably a good move, since the Cirrus never caught on
with consumers. And perhaps the company should have come up with a
new name for the Stratus, since it isn't all that popular with
consumers, either.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer perceptions of blase styling, mediocre performance and
questionable quality have kept the Stratus and Cirrus off most
people's shopping lists. But after seeing _ and driving _ both of
the new sedans and coupes, I have to say that perhaps they are
worth at least a look if you are in the market for a car in this
size and price class.
</P>
<P>
   The sedans come with an enhanced safety cage body that
DaimlerChrysler says will protect the vehicles' occupants much more
than before; it includes improved impact absorption, particularly
in the vehicles' front end. There is an available side-curtain air
bag ($350, offered on all models as a stand-alone option), designed
to help protect front and rear outboard occupants in the event of a
side impact. And in the trunk, there is a glow-in-the-dark safety
release to allow anyone trapped inside to get out without help.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond those changes, there are many more improvements and
upgrades that enhance safety as well as styling, road handling,
ride, and comfort.
</P>
<P>
   Two engines are offered, including the four-cylinder from last
year and a new V-6 that has increased horsepower. Both have
double-overhead-cam arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   The base engine is a 2.4-liter four-cylinder rated at 150
horsepower and 167 foot-pounds of torque.
</P>
<P>
   But the star of the line is the 2.7-liter V-6, which cranks out
200 horsepower and 192 foot-pounds of torque _ a substantial
increase over last year's 2.5-liter V-6 with 168 horsepower and 170
foot-pounds of torque. Even with the extra power, the engine gets
10 percent better fuel economy than last year's, DaimlerChrysler
engineers say.
</P>
<P>
   All Stratus and Sebring sedans come with a four-speed automatic
transmission. EPA estimated fuel economy for the V-6 is 20 miles
per gallon in the city and 28 on the highway. For the
four-cylinder, the ratings are just slightly better: 21 city/29
highway.
</P>
<P>
   The Stratus, particularly, is value-priced. A well-equipped
four-cylinder model _ with just about everything the average buyer
would want, including power windows and door locks _ is just under
$18,000, while a V-6 model with the same amenities would be under
$19,000. There are no stripped-down models available; power windows
and door locks are standard throughout the line.
</P>
<P>
   The sedans are built at DaimlerChrysler's Sterling Heights,
Mich., plant.
</P>
<P>
   As for the coupes, they are built by Mitsubishi at the Diamond
Star Motors plant in Normal, Ill., and come with a choice of either
a 147-horsepower, 2.4-liter four-cylinder or a 3.0-liter,
200-horsepower V-6. Last year's coupe models carried 2.0-liter
four-cylinder or 2.5-liter V-6 engines.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, a five-speed manual transmission is
available with either engine. In the past, only a four-speed
automatic was offered with the coupes' optional V-6. The manual
with the V-6 offers the best performance for people who want to
really drive these cars.
</P>
<P>
   For those who want an automatic, there is even an optional
four-speed auto-stick transmission that allows the driver to shift
gears manually, or to let the car do it automatically, without
having to use a clutch.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler said it chose to develop and introduce these new
coupes because the market for such cars has remained steady at
about a million sales annually for the past several years, and that
figure is expected to hold for several more years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 75 million baby boomers who have had minivans and
SUVs, but many of them now want something different, such as a
sporty coupe,'' said Gary Kanarek, a marketing executive for
DaimlerChrysler's coupes.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, there are many buyers in the 25-35 age group who
are looking for ``cutting-edge vehicles with better image and
styling,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The sportiest model is the Stratus R/T version, which even has a
throaty exhaust note.
</P>
<P>
   Prices will run from the low- to mid-$20,000s for well-equipped
coupe models.
</P>
<P>
   The new Stratus and Sebring coupes and sedans go on sale late
this month; an all-new Sebring convertible will arrive late this
year.

&HT;     NEW CORVETTE WILL PUT A SMILE ON YOUR FACE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Chevrolet Corvette has always been a smile maker, but the
new model they call the Z06 is so much fun that it will put the
biggest, goofiest smile in the world on the face of almost anyone
who drives it.
</P>
<P>
   I test drove the car for just a week and I'm still smiling. But
there were times as I cruised around in this 'Vette of 'Vettes that
my devious little mind was trying to figure out a way that I could
keep it.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, all the practical arguments against such a car were there,
and reason prevailed. I might want a Z06, I might think I need one,
but I know I don't really need it and, worst of all, can't really
afford it.
</P>
<P>
   One of my friends firmly believes that the biggest market for
cars such as the Z06 are bored, middle-age professionals. He is a
self-admitted bored, middle-age professional, so I suppose he knows
what he's talking about. He had a Corvette _ not a Z06 or even one
of the other, lower-priced C5 (fifth-generation) models but an
earlier one _ and he finally gave it up for a more practical
vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   But I could tell he was lusting after the Z06 when I showed it
to him, and I might have created a monster just letting him see it.
</P>
<P>
   If he shows up at home with a Z06 anytime soon, his wife
probably will hunt me down and blame it on me. But, hey, don't look
at me. The Z06 has that effect on people.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is sure: It's a real car, designed for serious
driving. I don't advocate speeding or any such illegal behavior,
but it is definitely difficult to behave in a Z06, because it likes
to run. Its acceleration is so brisk that it is downright
exhilarating, almost breathtaking.
</P>
<P>
   So if you do buy one, make sure you have a safe place lined up
to take it for some serious driving _ like a race track or other
closed course that is off the public highways.
</P>
<P>
   Just what is a Z06, you might ask? It's the latest and greatest
Corvette ever, a high-performance edition of the C5, which is just
now reaching the market as a 2001 model.
</P>
<P>
   Equipped with the special, racing-inspired LS6 5.7-liter V-8
engine, rated at 385 horsepower and 385 foot-pounds of torque, and
a six-speed manual gearbox, the Z06 goes from zero to 60 mph in 4
seconds flat. That's what the manufacturer says, but I've talked to
people who say the car will beat that by a 10th of a second or
more, depending on who is driving it.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some say that the Dodge Viper R/T, whose published
zero-to-60 performance is 3.8 seconds, is hard pressed to beat a
Z06 at the hands (and feet) of a good driver.
</P>
<P>
   Just like other C5 models _ the latest generation of Corvettes,
which debuted in 1997 _ the Z06 is vastly improved over previous
'Vettes, including the popular, limited-edition ZR1 models of the
'90s. It's easier to get into and out of, for one thing. It doesn't
rattle when you hit bumps in the road like most older 'Vettes do.
</P>
<P>
   But best of all is the road handling, which is greatly improved
over the previous generations because of the 50-50 front-to-rear
weight distribution created by the front engine/rear transaxle
arrangement of the C5. Half of the weight of the drivetrain is up
front, where the engine is mounted, and the other half is at the
rear axle, where the transmission is.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few laps around the racetrack, first in a C4 and then in
a regular production C5, quickly showed me the difference when I
had an opportunity to drive the new Corvettes for the first time in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   I had the C5 over 150 mph on the back straightaway, but I
couldn't get the C4 going that fast _ at least, not comfortably.
And the C5's awesome brakes were another factor in getting the car
going fast on that track; you have to brake hard to take the next
turns at the end of that straightaway, or you'll run off into the
grass. The C5 was up to the task.
</P>
<P>
   I haven't had the opportunity to drive the Z06 on a racetrack
yet, but I did find out that the Z06's brakes are every bit as good
as Chevrolet bills them to be. Some nut changed lanes and stopped
right in front of me one day, forcing me to jam my foot hard on the
Z06's brakes and hold it there to keep from hitting his Ford
Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   A companion riding with me was impressed. ``I don't think any
other car's brakes would have stopped us in time,'' she said as we
sat there shaking from the near-death experience. Thank you,
Chevrolet, for great engineering.
</P>
<P>
   Driving the Z06 is like driving a race car, and that makes sense
because the vehicle is racing-inspired. Chevy's literature on the
Z06 says it is a ``production vehicle that's ready for the
racetrack.''
</P>
<P>
   List price is $47,500, including transportation; but with
limited availability and expected high demand, these cars probably
will be hard to get. That means you probably can expect some steep
dealer markups, although not all dealers will do that.
</P>
<P>
   The Z06 designation was chosen to honor the efforts of the
``father of the Corvette,'' the late Zora Arkus-Duntov _ Corvette's
first chief engineer _ who in 1963 created the original Z06
package, Chevy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The original Z06 package was intended to make the then-new
Sting Ray race-ready right out of the showroom, and today's Z06 has
been developed with the same concept in mind,'' the company said.
</P>
<P>
   The new Z06 is the only Corvette to get the new LS6 engine, but
even that name is a blast from the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``The LS6 designation is another expression of appreciation for
the accomplishments of earlier Corvette engineers,'' Chevrolet
said. ``In 1971, Zora Duntov's team created a special 425-hp
big-block V-8 for the Corvette _ again with racing in mind. It was
second only to the legendary full-blown L88 racing engine that was
available from 1967 to 1969. Despite the fact that only 188
Corvettes were sold with the LS6 engine, it occupies a special
niche in Corvette legend.''
</P>
<P>
   The new LS6 is based on the 5.7-liter LS1. But Chevy said that
its aluminum block has been modified for better management of
crankcase pressures and speedier return of oil from the upper part
of the engine during high-speed operation, and the engine also has
a more-aggressive camshaft profile to take full advantage of the
additional air that the new intake manifold provides.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the improvements that led to the LS6 engine have also
been incorporated into the LS1 for the other two Corvette models
for 2001, allowing it to have five more horsepower _ now up to 350
hp.
</P>
<P>
   At least part of the extra cost of the Z06 comes from its
special exhaust system, which is made of titanium, a precious
metal.
</P>
<P>
   The system is 50 percent lighter than the stainless steel
exhaust on other C5s.
</P>
<P>
   Other differences between the standard C5 and the Z06 include
improvements in the suspension, and the car carries larger tires.
The Z06 comes with a larger front stabilizer bar, stiffer rear leaf
spring and revised camber settings.
</P>
<P>
   And there are Z06-specific forged-aluminum wheels, which are an
inch wider than those used on the coupes and convertibles.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the regular C5, the Z06 does not have the Goodyear
run-flat tires that allow the Corvette to drive up to 50 miles
after a tire loses its air. Because of those tires, Chevy doesn't
even put a spare tire and jack into the Corvette.
</P>
<P>
   There is no spare in the Z06, either, so Chevy puts an emergency
tire-inflator kit in the back in case you get a flat.
</P>
<P>
   Some special styling touches also help to differentiate the Z06.
They include the twin mesh front grilles, as well as side scoops
with mesh inserts just in front of the rear wheels. Even the seats
have a special fabric, with the Z06 logo on the top front of the
bucket seats.
</P>
<P>
   The Z06 comes only in a hardtop model; no convertible is
planned. And for 2001, the Z06 is the only hardtop model offered.
Gone is the regular hardtop model from 2000, which carried a base
price of $39,350, the lowest among last year's 'Vettes.
</P>
<P>
   Other Corvette models offered for 2001 are the coupe, at $40,475
(including transportation), and the convertible, at $47,000.

   There's a funny thing about comedy. Riffs on race, on the
difference between the sexes, between blacks and whites, styles of
music, young generation and old _ all of that, if delivered with
just the right balance of irony and insight, can be hilarious.
Riffs on child abuse cannot.
</P>
<P>
   That about sums up the problem with ``The Original Kings of
Comedy,'' a half-hilarious, half-tiresome film showcasing four
piping-hot African-American comics. Directed by Spike Lee in a
straight-up documentarian style, the film is a blow-by-blow rehash
of a Charlotte, N.C., arena gig in which the quartet offers caustic
observations on black life and white cluelessness.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing wrong or innately offensive in such humor: Much
of it will pop your gut, regardless of your skin color. Steve
Harvey's astute racial analysis of ``Titanic,'' for instance, would
make a fine doctoral dissertation on the impoverished
self-preservation instinct among white haute bourgeoisie. (``What
black band do you know woulda kept playing while the ship went
down?'' he asks. ``Can you see Kool and the Gang ... ?'')
</P>
<P>
   But while the sleek, sharp Harvey hits his marks with precision,
the film's humor is far from consistent, often repetitive and
sometimes so laden with profanity that any verbal nuances get lost
in the crush.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey is funny. Cedric the Entertainer, an effusive pillow of a
man dressed in a sleeveless mobster suit, is funny. His tributes to
reggae music (``I had peanut but-tah/No jahm!/No jahm!'') and
doddering church ladies are among the film's highlights. Less
amusing are D.L. Hughley and Bernie Mac, who mistake foul language
for lacerating wit (what George Carlin might have done with Mac's
pointless spin on a four-syllable word) and graphic sex talk for
gender insight.
</P>
<P>
   Hughley does have his moments, including a few stinging
observations on the African-American experience. Eating disorders
get a workout: ``White folk get anorexia. ... Black folk, when we
get anorexia, it's an accident.''
</P>
<P>
   But when Mac goes off in one of his mumbling, whack-the-brats
tirades against children, there's little to do but wait it out.
Here's his motto for a Bernie Mac day-care center: ``I will (mess)
your kids up'' (a kid misbehaves, he'll clock him in the head with
a hammer). Here's his word for an effeminate 6-year-old:
``faggot.'' And here's his assessment of whites and blacks: ``We're
the same. Only we do s--- different.''
</P>
<P>
   All four comedians boast resumes packed with TV gigs, Harvey and
Cedric with ``The Steve Harvey Show,'' Hughley with ``The
Hughleys,'' Mac in scattered shows, cable specials and films. So
none of them qualifies as a scrappy upstart. They're not exactly
unknowns.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Lee shows us little of their offstage lives, preferring to
record the group's Charlotte gig with few interruptions and scant
cuts. An off-hour poker game and a few hi-jinks on the basketball
court are as close as the film gets to personal revelation.
</P>
<P>
   But ``The Original Kings of Comedy'' isn't about revelation.
It's about grabbing a bat and swinging, hard, at a pinata stuffed
with race and sex. ``Fun is fun. Jokes is jokes,'' says Bernie Mac.
``It ain't nothin' to be ashamed of.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe sometimes it is.

 OR ABORIGINES, OLYMPICS A REMINDER OF WHITE OPPRESSSION  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ Gathered in a city park, re-creating a fire ceremony
they called the oldest ritual known to humans, a group of
Aboriginal activists gave voice last week to their smoldering
grievances.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have waged an undeclared war against our people,'' said
Isabell Coe, a veteran Aboriginal leader. ``We want to end this
war. This is about peace and justice. This is what we want, and
this is what our fire represents.''
</P>
<P>
   She then led 30 people, an equal number of Aborigines and white
supporters, in placing green eucalyptus branches on the fire.
Fragrant plumes of smoke framed her as she hugged each participant.
</P>
<P>
   Coe is the woman behind an Aboriginal ``tent embassy,'' which
has occupied Victoria Park near central town Sydney since July. The
encampment is a ragtag reminder of the plight of Australia's first
people, a tiny, downtrodden minority on a continent they once had
to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   As the world turns to Sydney for next month's Olympic Games, Coe
and other Aboriginal activists hope to use the attention to win
global support for their cause and, in turn, shame the government
into making concessions ranging from limited sovereignty and cash
reparations to a full apology for what Aborigines call the
genocidal policies of the past.
</P>
<P>
   It is no accident, therefore, that the tent embassy, a
collection of 30-odd tents around a light pole where Coe has hung
the red, yellow, and black Aboriginal flag, went up in a prime
location on the route from downtown to Homebush Bay, the Olympic
site. Nor is it coincidence that another Aboriginal protest, a
human chain, is planned at the airport around the time the Games
begin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world will be on our doorstep for the first time in the
history of white Australia, and probably black Australia, too. All
we want to do is educate the world about the truth,'' said Jenny
Munro, chairwoman of Sydney's Metropolitan Local Aboriginal Land
Council, a leading organizer of the planned Olympic protests.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating matters on both sides is the fact that Australia's
favorite Olympian and best chance for a gold medal, world 400-meter
track champion Cathy Freeman, is an Aborigine.
</P>
<P>
   Aboriginal leaders have been torn between wanting to stage
dramatic protests for the two-week Olympiad, from Sept. 15 to Oct.
1, and fearing they might diminish ``Cathy's Games.'' Several
months ago, a leader promised violent uprisings and ``Burn baby,
burn'' at the Olympics, only to soften his stand under pressure
from his constituents.
</P>
<P>
   For white Australians, Freeman's enormous popularity in this
sports-crazed nation has forced a reexamination of attitudes toward
a people often stereotyped as drunken layabouts or pathetic
primitives. Those attitudes are directly challenged by bus shelter
ads throughout Sydney for Qantas Airways. They show Freeman's face
and the words, ``The Spirit of Australia.''
</P>
<P>
   The story of Australia's Aborigines has echoes of both the
Native American and the African-American experiences. But in many
ways their struggle is as distinct as the flora and fauna that
flourish here and nowhere else.
</P>
<P>
   By most accounts, Aborigines arrived here, probably from
Southeast Asia, 50,000 years ago. Then over time they spread out
into perhaps 600 tribes, with different dialects and languages.
They roamed the land for 50 millennia, hunting, gathering, etching
art into rocks, and telling stories of the Dreamtime, when
``creation ancestors'' formed the physical and spiritual worlds.
</P>
<P>
   That all changed in 1778, 18 years after Captain James Cook, the
explorer, claimed Australia for Britain. Eleven ships arrived in
Sydney bearing 1,500 people, half of them convicts from overcrowded
British jails and the rest soldiers and free settlers. Clashes
began almost immediately, and British guns trumped tribal spears;
most encounters ended disastrously for the Aborigines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to understand that, unlike the Native
Americans, Aborigines didn't have anything the white settlers
wanted,'' said Andrew Markus, an authority on aboriginal history
and associate professor at Monash University in Melbourne.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Europeans had the convicts, so they didn't need labor. The
Aborigines didn't cultivate food or have commodities, so they
didn't have that to offer either. Almost from day one, Europeans
saw Aborigines as excess to requirements, and that has affected all
dealings and attitudes since.''
</P>
<P>
   Killings and other crimes against Aborigines often went
unpunished. It was not until 1962 that Aborigines won the right to
vote, and they have been counted in the census only since 1967. It
was not until 1992 that courts recognized that Aborigines owned
Australia before whites arrived.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Today &LR;  there are 500,000 Aborigines in Australia, about the
same number as when the Europeans landed, while the overall
population has topped 19 million.
</P>
<P>
   By almost every measure, Aborigines are at the bottom of
economic and social scales of one of the world's richest nations.
Life expectancy is 20 years below the rest of the population,
infant mortality is five times higher, and Aborigines are 20 times
more likely to be imprisoned at some point in their lives. National
unemployment fell to 6.3 percent last month, the lowest level in a
decade, but the official Aboriginal jobless rate was four times as
high. Aboriginal leaders say the true rate is 51 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Most Aborigines live in remote settlements. But in the Sydney
neighborhood of Redfern, an Aborigine slum of several hundred
families, a 10-minute drive from downtown, the center is ``The
Block,'' an urban war zone of decrepit two-story homes awash in
angry graffiti. A burned-out car rusts on a sidewalk, and abandoned
houses are bricked up lest drug addicts use them as shooting
galleries.
</P>
<P>
   One  &UR; afternoon &LR;  last week, a young Aborigine woman in a Reebok
sweatshirt walked to a white van, where she exchanged a used needle
for a clean one. Then, in the middle of the sidewalk, she paused
and rolled up her sleeve. With a stony nonchalance, she injected
herself with heroin she had purchased from a nearby open-air drug
market. A crowd of young men huddled in an alley. Across the
street, three older Aborigines sat drinking beer and watching the
rain.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the part of Sydney that doesn't exist,'' said Doug
Dixon, 43, an activist who grew up in Redfern. ``They want visitors
to take the ride from the airport to the Olympics, and maybe
downtown. They don't want you to see any of this.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Olympics approach, an issue that has generated much of
the passion is the suffering of Aborigines from what is known as
the ``stolen generation.'' From the early 1900s to as late as 1970,
the government encouraged young indigenous people, particularly
those with lighter skin, to be taken from their families and raised
in orphanages or by white families. Estimates of the number of
children affected range from 30,000 to 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   One of those was Cecil Bowden, 60, who was taken to a children's
home with an older sister and younger brother when their mother
died in childbirth.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was taken,'' Bowden said, ``my father was fighting for
Australia in the Second World War. I had a lot of family who could
have taken us until he returned, but we didn't have rights even to
our own children.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden remembered terrible beatings at the hands of white
caretakers for small or imagined infractions. He remembered seeing
his father turned away, empty-handed, when he came home from war
and tried to claim Bowden from a boys' home.
</P>
<P>
   The policy has become a rallying cry for Aborigines seeking an
apology, and perhaps cash reparations, from the government of Prime
Minister John Howard. For many, the unrequited desire to hear
Howard say the word ``sorry'' has taken on almost mythic
importance. The issue got a boost last month when Freeman, who had
been relatively silent on political issues as she gained athletic
fame, criticized the Howard government for its refusal to apologize
and revealed that her grandmother was a member of the stolen
generation.
</P>
<P>
   Howard, though, has been steadfast in refusing to apologize,
offering only ``regrets,'' interpreted here as modest sympathy, not
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not willing to apologize for things my government and my
generation of Australians didn't do,'' he said earlier this year.
Observers said the government also is concerned that a formal
apology might open the way for billions of dollars in financial
claims. Howard also has rejected calls to negotiate a treaty with
Aborigines, saying such agreements are only appropriate between
nations.
</P>
<P>
   Howard's minister for Aboriginal affairs, John Herron, inflamed
the debate when he challenged use of the term ``stolen
generation,'' saying that by some estimates the policy affected
only 10 percent of Aborigine children.
</P>
<P>
   Aborigines reacted angrily to what they called an insult of
semantics, particularly since Herron ostensibly represents their
interests. Senator Aden Ridgeway, the only Aborigine in Australia's
Parliament, said in an interview that Herron's comments were ``like
denying the Holocaust.''
</P>
<P>
   Herron did not respond to requests for an interview, but
government officials staunchly defend their treatment of
Aborigines. About $1.5 billion is being spent this year on
programs, mostly involving health, education, housing, and economic
development, for Aborigines.
</P>
<P>
   They also say Aborigines have been given title to more than 15
percent of the continent, although most of the land is in the
remote and inhospitable Northern Territory. The government also has
set up a nearly $1 billion land fund for urban Aborigines.
</P>
<P>
   Howard, a conservative who came to power in 1996, apparently has
not suffered for his stands. Polls have shown a majority of
Australians agree with him, with one survey finding that 62 percent
reject the idea of an apology for past wrongs.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are signs that white Australians have been moved by
the stolen generation reports. Some 200,000 joined a march for
racial healing in June across the Sydney Harbor Bridge, the largest
demonstration here since the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   The bridge march came after it was widely acknowledged that a
decade-long effort called Reconciliation had not achieved its goal
of a racially united Australia. The hope, perhaps naive in
retrospect, had been that black-white relations could be fully
mended in time for next year's 100th anniversary of Australian
independence.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond apologies, the Aborigines' bid for compensation dimmed
this month when a federal court ruled against two members of the
stolen generation seeking compensation in a test case. The judge
said they had failed to show the government had not acted in their
best interests.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Olympic organizers have tried desperately to avoid
the controversy and to appease aboriginal interests. They are
flying the Aboriginal flag at the Olympic site, cosponsoring an
indigenous culture pavilion, giving Aborigines a major role in an
Olympics Arts Festival, and incorporating the boomerang, an
Aboriginal hunting tool, in the official Olympic logo. The first
Aborigine gold medalist, women's hockey player Nova Peris-Kneebone,
was chosen as the first runner to carry the torch on Australian
soil.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, most Aborigines say the Olympic spotlight on
Sydney is too good an opportunity to miss.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been some good will and good intentions,'' said
Ridgeway, an Aborigine who is a member of Parliament. ``But it's
one thing to embrace the icons of aboriginality and it's quite
another to embrace the people and the rights to which they are
entitled. Some people may resent it, but we are going beyond good
will gestures and demanding more.''

 &HT;    A troubling look at the world's most famous Passion Play
 &HT;    OBERAMMERGAU: The Troubling Story of the World's Most Famous
Passion Play, by James Shapiro. Pantheon; 238 pages; $24.
 &HT;    By Scott Eyman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. - The legend states that the Oberammergau
Passion Play has been staged every 10 years since 1634, the town's
way of showing their gratitude for being spared the ravages of a
plague.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the 19th century, the Oberammergau event, a religious
spectacle that lasts more than seven hours per performance, with as
many as 700 of the villagers of Oberammergau in the cast, was part
and parcel of the Grand Tour of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   But since World War II, there have been increasing problems with
the production, more or less because the Passion Play has always
proclaimed that the Jews killed Jesus, thereby reflecting the
traditional anti-Semitism of the Bavarian Alps. (It hasn't hurt
attendance; this year, more than a half million visitors will see
the Passion Play in Oberammergau.)
</P>
<P>
   The idea of generational guilt is one of many that Columbia
University Professor James Shapiro examines in maladroit fashion in
his new book about the past and present of Oberammergau.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the book, Shapiro circles wonderingly around the
startling discovery that rural Germany has always been to Jews what
the American South was to blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oberammergau ``is narrated in a cool, formal voice, rather as
if it's a transcription of an academic paper. What one misses more
than anything else is a feel for the place; Shapiro's book would
have been immensely improved if he'd just taken Travel Writing 101.
</P>
<P>
   He never tells us what Oberammergau looks like, where the town
is in relation to the mountains, etc. The book proceeds in a sort
of semi-intellectual vacuum.
</P>
<P>
   He does tell us, with a vague air of ``gotcha'' that the
supposedly pious villagers have had _ gasp! _ children out of
wedlock and that, at one time in the mid-19th century, about one
out of every six villagers was illegitimate.
</P>
<P>
   All that said, Shapiro's book is still of some interest, if only
for its portrait of the town's tortured attempts to find some road
back from its Medieval anti-Semitic past and recent anti-Semitic
past _ Hitler praised the Passion Play for its portrayal of ``the
whole muck and mire of Jewry'' _ by attempting to ameliorate
protests by people they undoubtedly regard as tiresome professional
Jews who have had them on the defensive for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Oberammergau, of course, isn't about to cop to their
enthusiastic embrace of Nazism. The official guidebook says only
that ``in 1939 war broke out, and the village was completely cut
off from its friends abroad and had to play its part in the total
war.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the modern tension derives from the inevitable conflict
between the essentially Catholic villagers and the essentially
Jewish disputees. As Shapiro says: ``For all the ecumenical
attention to a shared spiritual heritage, the play forces Jews and
Christians to face the painful fact that they read differently, and
that a single version of the founding story of Christianity cannot
be comfortably shared. Matters now have been scraped down to bare
bone, to irreconcilable differences.''
</P>
<P>
   This is one of those areas where live-and-let-live has to come
into play, or everyone ends up at the barricades. Shapiro
acknowledges that the script now in use at Oberammergau conforms to
the doctrine advanced 35 years ago by Vatican II.
</P>
<P>
   And that should be the end of that, but, because of the play's _
and the town's _ undoubted anti-Semitic history, they and it are
held to a standard very few religious pageants could withstand.
</P>
<P>
   All the village has to sell is itself and its tradition. There
is almost no local industry except for the Passion Play once every
10 years, and the woodcarving that is sold to the tourists.
</P>
<P>
   But Shapiro neglects basic reportorial duties in favor of a
discursive sweep over four centuries of anti-Semitism that could
not be that surprising to anyone who's been there, or has read some
books. Since we are given to understand that the play is the
financial engine that supports the town, would it have been so
difficult to find out exactly what kind of stipends are paid to the
villagers?
</P>
<P>
   In spite of the fact that the book seems to have been written by
a man who doesn't get out much, and it begs nearly as many
questions as it answers, ``Oberammergau `` provides some revealing
glimpses of a town trying, in what seems to be good faith, to
straddle 400 years of tradition without giving further offense to
the Jewish faith or betraying what they regard as their
forefathers' blood oath.

   SCI-RACE-GENES (Undated) _ Scientists have long suspected that
the racial categories recognized by society are not reflected on
the genetic level. But the more closely that researchers examine
the human genome, the more most of them are convinced that the

   SCI-CHINA-RICE (Undated) _ In a stunning new result from what
has become one of the largest agricultural experiments ever,
thousands of rice farmers in China have doubled the yields of their
most valuable crop and nearly eliminated its most devastating
disease _ without using chemical treatments or spending a single
extra penny. Led by a team of scientists, the farmers were able to
abandon chemical fungicides previously widely used to fight rice
blast _ the most important disease of the most important staple in
the world. By Carol Kaesuk Yoon. (1400 words)

   SCI-BUTTERFLIES-CORN (Undated) _ Ever since last year when
scientists reported that pollen from genetically engineered corn
could kill monarch butterfly caterpillars in the laboratory,
scientists have been battling over one central question: Are these
beloved butterflies being harmed by the millions of acres of
biotech corn being planted across the country? A new study suggests
the answer is yes. By Carol Kaesuk Yoon. (675 words)

<P>
   SCI-WRITING-PHYSICIANS (Undated) _ Each year it seems that more
and more physicians are putting aside their stethoscopes for word
processors. Indeed, the most casual look at publishers' book lists
or major magazines and newspapers demonstrates that an increasing

   SCI-PSYCHE-TRAITS (Undated) _ One of the many odd experiences of
being a psychiatrist is discovering that seemingly benign traits
can have a dark and even pathological side to them. A
characteristic that we would typically dismiss lightly in everyday
life _ a tendency to procrastinate, a hot temper or a
fastidiousness about details _ sends up a red flag for a
psychiatrist. At times what appears to be a minor eccentricity can
afford a glimpse into a large and unsuspected landscape of

   SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ The Personal Health column: Each
year, several hundred people succumb to anaphylactic attacks, the
American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology says, because

   _ Women who have had hysterectomies have a 60 percent greater
risk of being incontinent by the time they are 60, according to a
new report in The Lancet. This means the onset can be well after
the date of surgery, since most women who have hysterectomies do so
in their 40s or 50s. The operation is the second most common major
surgical procedure for women. (225 words)

<P>
   _ A new study suggests that when it comes to one of the
conditions for which antibiotics are often dispensed _ children's
earaches _ the treatment may be of little value. The study,
sponsored by the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and
Quality, found that almost two-thirds of children with acute otitis
media, or middle ear infection, recover from pain and fever within
24 hours of diagnosis _ without antibiotics. (300 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ As it stands now, millions of diabetics need to take blood
samples several times a day by piercing their fingers _ a
time-consuming and somewhat painful practice. But a recent study
suggests that things may become easier. Writing in the Diabetes
Technology and Therapeutics, researchers said diabetics may one day
be able to monitor glucose levels by just passing a beam of
infrared light through the skin.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cochlear implants have been used for almost a decade to help
thousands of profoundly deaf children, but some two-thirds of
insurance companies are often unwilling to pay, citing a lack of
evidence that the devices are cost-effective. A new study, however,
reports that over the course of a deaf person's life, the implants
can save more than $50,000 in costs associated with the disability.

 &HT;    `Lynching' reopens old scars for some Mariettans
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARIETTA, Ga. - The story of Leo Frank has come home to the town
where the Jewish factory superintendent was lynched 85 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Marietta's Theatre in the Square is producing ``The Lynching of
Leo Frank'' less than two miles from the spot where a mob,
organized and egged on by many of the city's leading citizens,
strung up Frank. The play, a dramatic retelling by Atlantan Robert
Myers, ran in Chicago two years ago to rave reviews and earlier
this year in an off-off-Broadway theater, where it did poorly.
</P>
<P>
   Some Mariettans would rather not see the town's most notorious
incident depicted yet again. Despite their protests, however, the
play is more than an irrelevant rehash, because its exploration of
violent prejudice comes at a time when overt anti-Semitism has
resurfaced in Marietta, again directed at a local Jewish business
figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lynching'' will play in Marietta through Sept. 24, a date that
won't come too soon for some Mariettans, who would rather not have
the world reminded that the only lynching of a Jew in U.S. history
took place in their town. No one was ever charged with Frank's
murder, but the ancestors of some ``OMs'' _ Old Mariettans _ are
found on lists of suspects that have been circulating secretly for
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to see it just go away,'' Charles Brown, an OM who
acknowledges that his grandfather's name appears on some of the
lists, says of the play. ``I'm not going to worry about it, as long
as I don't have to look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a subject I talk about,'' says Tom Browning, a lawyer
and chairman of the city's Historic Board of Review. ``This was the
past. Is this blood on the hands of people in Marietta today? No,
and it shouldn't be. It's history.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Watson Brown, another Marietta lawyer, is angry that the
Frank case won't die. He blames the press, Hollywood and
``careless'' playwrights for keeping the story alive.
</P>
<P>
   In brief, that story goes like this: Frank, a Northern Jew, was
convicted on questionable evidence of murdering Mary Phagan, a
13-year-old Mariettan who worked in the pencil factory he
supervised. He was condemned to die, but Georgia's governor, swayed
by protesters who said Frank had been railroaded, commuted the
sentence to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Watson Brown's great-grandfather, Tom Watson, who later
became a U.S. senator, is blamed in many accounts for whipping up
anti-Semitism that helped lead to the lynching. Brown, counter to
most historians' account, maintains that Frank was killed not
because of his ``religious persuasion,'' but because Jews bribed
the sitting governor to commute Frank's death sentence, an act that
outraged the citizenry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The playwright has apparently put out a largely non-factual
presentation of the case,'' he says of ``Lynching,'' not having
seen the play.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear how many residents share those feelings, but
obviously not everyone in Marietta or surrounding Cobb County,
which today has a large Jewish community, is put off by the play.
``Lynching'' opened Wednesday to a house packed with Theatre
subscribers, most of whom live in the immediate area. ``Lynching''
hasn't generated the overt controversy seen in the early '90s when
the Theatre mounted ``M. Butterfly,'' a play with gay themes, and
``Lips Together, Teeth Apart,'' which deals with AIDS. Those
productions prompted the Cobb County Commission to adopt a
resolution condemning homosexuality. That resolution, never
rescinded, led the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games to pull
planned events of the 1996 Games out of Cobb County.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lynching,'' though, does come at a time when prejudice has
become an issue again in Marietta.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Cox, a former city councilman and current diree family owns
much of the real estate around the square, wouldn't comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most buildings in the square are owned by Jews, especially the
Goldsteins,'' Cox says. ``That family came to town basically
selling rags. They have lived the American dream by hard work. But
there's always been a certain amount of resentment.''
</P>
<P>
   Psychologist Jim Stark is one of Goldstein's fiercest foes on
the high-rise proposal. But, like Cox, he worries that recent
developments are feeding prejudices.
</P>
<P>
   ``This play and the controversy over Mr. Goldstein are bringing
it all out again, the anti-Semitism,'' Stark says. ``It still
exists. It's like a genetic code of silence. That's why these
people haven't talk

 &HT;    Despite cancer, writer realizes how lucky he is
 &HT;    Jim Morris is the outdoor writer for the Dayton Daily News.
Morris, 55, spent the past three years battling non-Hodgkin's
lymphoma. In a two-part series, he recounts his struggle and shares
his insights about this fight for his life. Last week, he wrote
about his diagnosis and first round of treatment. In today's final
part, Morris writes about the stem cell transplant he underwent to
kill the cancer.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Jim Morris
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio - I sought the advice and experiences of others who
had gone through the stem-cell transplant procedure to battle
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. But as helpful as those chats were, I still
had to consider just what would and could happen to me.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, this is what did happen:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  In August 1999, the doctors put a catheter in my chest. No
more IVs in the arms or backs of my hands. All drugs went in and
blood went out through this twin-tubed port. I walked around with
these tubes hanging out of my upper left chest. And they had to be
kept sterile all the time.
</P>
<P>
   (At first, we had a nurse visit our house every day to change
the dressing and give me injections of a drug to help rebuild my
blood cells. Later, my wife handled the caregiver chores.)
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  I went to the James Cancer Hospital in Columbus in
mid-September for apheresis, the process that extracted the healthy
``baby'' cells from my blood. These were frozen and reintroduced to
my body later. They ran my blood through a centrifuge and then put
it back in my body.
</P>
<P>
   The process took only a couple of hours for me, but it can take
a day or so. I remember as I was lying there, hooked up to the
machine, there was a teen-age girl in the bed next to me who was
absolutely terrified of the process and of having needles stuck
into her arms. I hope she is OK now.
</P>
<P>
   The general idea (and this explanation is with a journalism
degree, not a medical diploma) was to knock my immune system
totally down with high-dose chemo, get rid of any possible cancer
cells lurking about, and then build my system back up with my own
healthy blood cells. Even I know that practically eliminates the
chance of rejection, as it might from a donor transplant.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  I received a 24-hour drip of the high-dose chemo to kill the
cancer. Beforehand, I wondered: Could my body stand that? The other
chemos I'd had were supposed to be mild in comparison. There was my
heart condition and diabetes to think of. Was I up to it?
</P>
<P>
   I did face a few rocky days during the high-dose chemo phase
because of my reaction to a certain drug. I once mentioned chest
pain and there were more doctors at my bedside than I had bedside.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  I developed a rash over most of my body that at times would
itch so badly it was probably the single greatest discomfort I had
in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  I stayed in the hospital for about five weeks after the Oct. 8
cell transplant, followed by a short outpatient stay in a nearby
apartment.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  I had no view at all. My hospital-room window looked out on a
solid brick wall.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there was boredom. But, you know, the hospital staff
doesn't really give you time to get bored. And, frankly, I didn't
get as much sleep as you'd think.
</P>
<P>
   Nurses and techs were always taking my temperature, blood
pressure, blood sugar and pulse. The middle of the night meant
nothing to them. And there was this very dedicated medical student
who felt she just had to give me the once-over every day at about 5
a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The James is a teaching hospital, so I saw a variety of doctors
and students every day, or, rather, they saw me. There was an
attending physician in charge of my case and I saw her every day.
There was also a resident who made rounds early in the morning,
accompanied by a group of doctors on fellowship or whatever.
Usually there were five or six _ I called them ``the glee club.''
</P>
<P>
   They came in for their daily look, and every once in a while
there would be something new, some new ailment to discuss.
</P>
<P>
   Between the doctors and nurses, the staff was top-notch.
</P>
<P>
   I was in a 12-bed transplant unit, each of us with our own
rooms. Conditions were kept sterile as possible. Visitors had to
wash their hands and leave any open food containers outside the
room. But there were no gowns, masks or sterile tents. I guess all
that has changed.
</P>
<P>
   I wasn't allowed to touch the floor. If I got out of bed, which
I was encouraged to do, I had to wear slippers. I was expected to
take a shower and walk daily, even when I was hooked up to an IV
(which was most of the time).
</P>
<P>
   As that doctor at my first interview put it, ``I want my
patients up and around. I'd rather have them sitting on the side of
the bed puking their guts out than lying in bed all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   There wasn't much of that, fortunately. All patients are
different, but with the anti-nausea medicines they put in the
chemo, I had very little nausea.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the mystery rash, my biggest problem was with the food.
I'll tell you right now I don't intend to bash all hospital food,
but for me it was not a good experience. But you also have to
consider, I had just gone through high-dose chemo for a week and
was on a low-fat diabetic diet. So you'll just have to excuse me
when I tell you nothing looked, tasted or smelled even the least
bit appetizing.
</P>
<P>
   It's really a wonder they let me leave the hospital. They
closely monitor your intake and output. My digestive track was a
balance between laxatives and medicine to accomplish the opposite.
Meanwhile, I got by on a fruit, Jell-O, yogurt and a little milk
and cereal.
</P>
<P>
   My tastebuds still have not returned, even months later, but
then that has also helped me drop a considerable amount of weight.
There are a few silver linings.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, the five weeks seemed to go by quickly. I probably
didn't think that at the time (especially that first week), but as
I look back now, it wasn't all that long. Once I left the hospital
and the short outpatient stint in early November, the process was
over. There were no followup visits. Everything is being handled by
my local oncologist.
</P>
<P>
   As I have had no bad scans or checkups, I have to believe in the
system. I'm not so foolish as to say I am cured, but I am coming
back. Aside from the condition discussed in the accompanying
article, my strength is returning. I'm casting my lures just as far
as ever, but my nature walks aren't quite as long or uphill.
</P>
<P>
   The thought of a person going through a transplant can be a
frightening thing. As long as you realize every person's case and
reactions are different, it helps to talk to someone who has been
through it. I found a couple of successful stem cell transplant
patients who helped me along the way.
</P>
<P>
   There is one other factor you should consider when going through
the process of a transplant. That is the effect your condition is
bound to have on your family and friends.
</P>
<P>
   My wife, Pat, has been with me every step. She went on my doctor
visits and spent as much time with me in the hospital as possible.
My son, who lives in Indiana, took a week off of work to help me
through the hardest parts. My daughter, who lives in Virginia, and
brother, who lives in Florida, called every day. My cousins were on
the phone or in the chairs in my room. My friends visited, called
and sent cards (no live flowers were allowed in the room). That
support is something no medicine, hospital or doctor can do for
you. It's called love. There is no substitute.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of years ago my friend Mickey Davis died of cancer. A
few months ago my friend Wally Nelson died of cancer. Those two
deaths and all of the others I hear about now really bother me. I
don't get over them like I might have in the past. I think of them
and This area quickly would become saturated, and water pressure
would build up outside your basement walls and under the floor. Any
cracks or air pockets in the concrete or the seams between concrete
blocks would allow a path for the water to seep into the basement.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest key to a dry basement is keeping rainwater away from
the foundation. If you've had problems with basement moisture after
a rain, go outside and see what's happening on your roof and in the
yard around the house the next time a downpour occurs.
</P>
<P>
   I did that this spring and found a pool forming between my west
wall and the slope alongside my neighbor's driveway. It's going to
take some excavation to give the water a path away from the
foundation.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, though, working with the gutters and downspouts
will be enough.
</P>
<P>
   Look for leaks in gutters and downspouts and pay particular
attention to seams and connections. Look for sagging spots or areas
where so much water hits the gutters that they overflow. Sagging
spots in gutters are often the sites of overflows.
</P>
<P>
   You usually can fix minor leaks around seams with caulk designed
for gutters. Adding a strategic support strap or nail will correct
a minor sag.
</P>
<P>
   At the bottom of each downspout, attach some kind of extension
or splash guard that directs water leaving the downspout at least
three feet away from the house. If your basement is chronically
damp, releasing the water even farther away might help.
</P>
<P>
   If the gutter and downspout system is sound, periodically clean
the gutters to keep leaves and other debris from interfering with
efficient water flow.
</P>
<P>
   Check that water that enters the gutters flows smoothly through
the downspouts. Clogged downspouts often can be cleared by
directing a powerful stream from a garden hose through the top
opening.
</P>
<P>
   The soil adjacent to your foundation should slope away from the
house at a rate of at least an inch of drop per foot. Concrete
patios, porches, walks and other solid surfaces also should slope
away from the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   If you do any landscaping or gardening, make sure you don't
create raised areas that cause water to flow back toward the house.
Grass or ground covers with thick root systems planted next to the
foundation also help control water.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Check for more serious problems. Once you've dealt with
surface rainwater runoff, dampness problems should be greatly
reduced. But they might not be eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   To correct persistent seepage problems, start by sealing all
visible cracks with concrete patching compound or hydraulic cement.
Hydraulic cement is a putty-like material that can be used to plug
a leak.
</P>
<P>
   After following manufacturers' directions for patching compound
or hydraulic cement to seal cracks, cover walls and floors with a
waterproofing paint. Make sure the paint you select is a
waterproofer, not just a sealer, and that it is rated for use below
grade _ that is, below the ground level. And follow all application
instructions, especially wall-preparation instructions.
</P>
<P>
   If all these steps fail, you might have a problem that needs a
professional.
</P>
<P>
   Waterproofing contractors can install a sump pump to pump
underground water away from the foundation. Or they can excavate
around the foundation to add water barriers to the outside of the
basement wall or add underground pipes called drainage tiles to
help direct water away from the house.

  Rhino leads the charge in creating definitive compilations 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It always begins like this. The guys at Rhino Records who make
and compile those box sets, those perfect little distillations of
popular culture, will be sitting around arguing over who was better
_ the Sugarhill Gang or Grandmaster Flash &AMP; the Furious Five _ when
one of them, ignoring the conversation completely, will interrupt
and ask, ``Gee, why haven't we done a box set about ...''
</P>
<P>
   ... about, say, surf music or doo wop songs, Alice Cooper or Roy
Rogers, Beat poetry or Shakespeare's soliloquies.
</P>
<P>
   And typically, a few years after the question is posed,
following hundreds of hours of creative brainstorming and many
trips down licensing blind alleys, such a box set will appear in
stores with the hope that music lovers will see it, and, in the
words of Rhino special projects guru James Austin, say ``Wow.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to think they we go out and make things that we would
want to buy,'' says Austin, a Chatsworth resident who spearheaded
such box sets as ``Hot Rods and Custom Classics: Cruisin' Songs and
Highway Hits'' and ``The Jack Kerouac Collection.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I always imagine myself standing in line at the record store
and buying this thing, shelling out 100 bucks or whatever it is and
wondering, `Am I satisfied?' If someone opens one of my boxes and
doesn't say, 'Wow,' then I've failed.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Rhino, the West Los Angeles record company that
began its life in the back of a Westwood record store, has wowed
music lovers and pop culture aficionados with little touches like
sculpted shag carpet on the cover of its massive seven-CD set,
``Have a Nice Decade: The '70s Pop Culture Box'' (the carpet was
avocado green and harvest gold, adorned with imprints of smiley
faces) and a pair of fuzzy dice inside the ``Hot Rods'' box. Rhino
has also housed collections in old 45-RPM carrying cases (``Beg,
Scream &AMP; Shout: The Big Ol' Box of '60s Soul'') and the
velvet-wrapped journal ``R-E-S-P-E-C-T: A Century of Women in
Music''.
</P>
<P>
   The company's most elaborate set will arrive in stores the first
week of November. Titled ``Brain in a Box: The Science Fiction
Collection,'' the five-disc set stands as a glowing example (and we
mean that literally) of how Rhino stands apart from other record
labels in its archival efforts. These guys _ and this is
predominately a guy thing _ are dedicated to unearthing the
unexpected, finding never-before-heard (and familiar) nuggets of
music and culture and brightly packaging them in a way that would
have made Roy Lichtenstein proud.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these sets could stand as art objects,'' says the a&AMP;r
director of the reissue division of a rival company. ``I don't even
like the music on some of Rhino's boxes, but I buy them because
they're cool to look at.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Brain in a Box'' might well be Rhino's ultimate piece of pop
art, a 7-inch square silver box held together by rivets and
dominated by a trio of 3-D lenticular photographs of a floating
brain. Move the box and the luminescent brain moves too, as if it's
floating in water. Inside is a 200-page hardbound book modeled
after the 1950s Big Little Book series that baby boomers will
remember fondly for chronicling the sci-fi adventures of such
heroes as Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   Creative director Hugh Brown's stunning design work almost
relegates the music to incidental status. Almost. The five discs
are divided according to focus: movie themes, TV themes, sci-fi pop
songs, novelty songs and incidental/lounge music. There are 113
tracks ranging from the familiar (themes from ``Close Encounters of
the Third Kind'' and ``The Twilight Zone,'' Sheb Wooley's ``The
Purple People Eater'') to the surprising (Ella Fitzgerald singing
``Two Little Men in a Flying Saucer'') to the truly bizarre (Sun
Ra's ``Space Is the Place'').
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if you're a science-fiction geek who thinks he has
everything, I can guarantee at least a third of this you've never
seen,'' says Brown, who in addition to designing the project,
helped cull the set's contents.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Brain'' box, like the majority of Rhino's most interesting
packages, celebrates more than music; it also salutes a niche
lifestyle and the genre's die-hard devotees. The company first
tried this in 1993 with ``Songs of the West,'' a four-disc box
dedicated to cowboy singers like Gene Autry and Roy Rogers and
Western television and movie themes. ``Cowabunga! The Surf Box,''
another set supervised by Austin, followed shortly afterward, and
its sales success proved that genre boxes could work if the
category has enough well-heeled fanatics.
</P>
<P>
   A sci-fi box, then, is a natural.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you have to do is go to a science-fiction convention and
look at the people in the 'Star Trek' uniforms carrying phasers and
you know there are people out there waiting for this box,'' Brown
says without a trace of condescension. He qualifies as a sci-fi
geek himself with a massive collection of robots, monster models
and flying saucers.
</P>
<P>
   If fans have been waiting, you couldn't blame them for being a
little impatient _ since Rhino has been planning its sci-fi box
since March 1994. The idea sprang from the classic question _
``Gee, why haven't we done this?'' _ asked when Austin and
licensing specialist David McLees (a California State University,
Northridge grad) were attending the South By Southwest Music
convention in Austin, Texas, six years ago. During a spooky,
late-night drive through the middle of nowhere, the conversation
turned to UFOs and eventually to why Rhino had never attempted a
science-fiction collection.
</P>
<P>
   Austin, 53, a child of the 1950s who counts space mutants, old
Westerns, hot rods and his wife (not necessarily in that order) as
his life's passions, loved the idea and immediately began
brainstorming with McLees and his friends about what such a
collection should include. When he arrived home, Austin and his
Rhino compatriots lugged CDs, cassettes and albums full of their
favorite sci-fi songs to the office and sent out the word that they
were looking for ``cool, freaky stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of 1994, Austin delivered a tentative track list to
the licensing department. Two years later, the results came back,
and they weren't good. Many key songs remained elusive, and Austin
decided to let the project sit a bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was too special for us to rush,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Brown had joined the company in 1996 and, along with
designing the shag carpet for the '70s box, enthusiastically began
to generate ideas for the sci-fi box.
</P>
<P>
   ``Originally we were going to do it as a flying saucer, where
you'd unscrew the body of the saucer to get to the CDs and the
book,'' Brown says. ``But practically, that just didn't work. Then
I thought of the disembodied brain, which is just the cheesiest and
coolest concept in the old science-fiction movies. Plus it makes
for a cool title: 'Brain in a Box.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Brown's idea of the three-sided, 3-D lenticular of a brain
dazzled Rhino's a&AMP;r guys, but the business side was skeptical,
wondering if it was financially feasible.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said, 'You're not going to be able to do that for the
price,' '' Brown remembers. ``And I said, 'Well then, raise the
price. It's worth it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   And raise the price they did. What began as a five-disc set that
would retail for around $69 will now hit stores with a $99.98 price
tag. It's all part of the tightrope Rhino must walk as it mines the
past for gold. The company wants to put out unique compilations _
the ``Brain'' box will cost Rhino more in materials than any set it
has ever produced _ but it has to be careful not to overshoot in
estimating consumer demand. Failure can be expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Rhino released a six-CD collection called ``Be Thou
Persuaded _ Living in a Shakespearean World.'' The set featured
four discs of actors performing the Bard's most famous scenes and a
two-disc rendering of ``Romeo and Juliet'' in its entirety. Few
were persuaded to buy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought we were onto something, what with the popularity of
'Shakespeare in Love' and Kenneth Branagh's films,'' says Rhino
marketing executive Garson Foos. ``It just didn't fly. I guess CDs
are just not the medium people want their Shakespeare in.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's the exception. Nine out of 10 Rhino boxes make money,
some with sales figures as low as 15,000. The sci-fi collection
will come off the assembly line with an initial printing of about
20,000. It won't have to sell that many (although it probably will)
for the company to turn a profit. The original seven-disc '70s
shag-carpet set has already sold out. (The current set features a
photo of the carpet on the cover.)
</P>
<P>
   Austin says everything _ the licensing, putting the songs in the
best order, tracking down people to write essays for the liner
notes (``Brain'' features a host of sci-fi greats talking about
their favorite moments) _ looks easy, and it should.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want people to think, `They threw that out. Isn't that
great?' '' he says. ``But it can be a nightmare. You never stop
asking yourself: 'Is it good enough?'''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed Brown, at this moment, is writing a huge disclaimer,
anticipating the complaints of the obsessive fans wondering why a
particular track isn't on the compilation. In some cases, Brown
says, Rhino couldn't secure the licensing. (George Lucas wouldn't
let the ``Star Wars'' theme go.) Legal battles between various
rights-holders waylaid others, and in rare cases, Rhino just
couldn't find out who owned the track.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, too, a song had worn out its welcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll probably hear from some people wondering why we don't
have Elton John's 'Rocket Man' or David Bowie's 'Space Oddity,'''
Brown says. ``But please. Does anyone ever need to hear those songs
again? We want to turn people on to the unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   And while Brown waits for Gary Larson's last-second approval for
a ``Far Side'' mad scientist cartoon he wants to include in the
book, Austin has already cleared his desk of sci-fi materials and
commenced the brainstorming sessions for his next project _ a '60s
pop culture box.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all starts over again,'' Austin says wearily, but with a
wide grin on his face. ``You just change the title.'' &QL;

RUSSIAN OFFICIALS ABANDON HOPE OF FINDING SURVIVORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By PATRICK E. TYLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russian navy officials on Monday publicly abandoned
hope of finding any men alive inside the sunken nuclear-powered
submarine Kursk, and began discussions about the dangerous task of
inspecting the craft's interior with a camera before removing the
bodies or salvaging the submarine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our worst fears are confirmed,'' said Vice Adm. Mikhail
Motsak, chief of staff of the Northern Fleet. ``All the
compartments of the submarine are flooded with water. None of the
crew are still alive,'' he said, according to the RIA-Novosti news
agency.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials said 118 people were aboard the Kursk when
explosions sent the 490-foot vessel plunging to the floor of the
Barents Sea while on maneuvers on Aug. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Norwegian divers who broke through a hatch to get inside found
no signs of life and said they believed there were no survivors.
``The divers have determined that the submarine is full of water,''
said Norwegian Capt. Rune Fredheim. ``That is sad.''
</P>
<P>
   When a camera was lowered through the partially opened hatch for
a preliminary look, it registered images of what appeared to be a
sailor in the ninth compartment, where normally five to six sailors
are stationed.
</P>
<P>
   With the fate of the crew now clear, Russian officials are
turning their efforts to removing the submarine's nuclear reactors,
which the officials have said were shut down immediately after the
accident. The cause of the crash remains a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   In a surprise development Monday, military officials speaking
not for attribution told Russian news agencies that a chunk of rail
from a British submarine had been found on the seabed about 1,000
feet from the wreck of the Kursk.
</P>
<P>
   Although some reports have indicated that a collision might have
caused the accident, both the British and U.S. governments have
emphatically denied that any of their submarines were involved.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the mystery over the accident, on Monday there were
again reports from military sources that distress signal buoys not
of Russian origin were spotted by one or more of the first Russian
ships that arrived on the scene on Sunday. The buoys were not
recovered.
</P>
<P>
   A previous report about the buoys, which had been denied, said
they were green and white _ not the colors of the Russian navy _
but officials on Monday did not describe them.

&HT;     THE BEAR TRUTH: THE CRITTERS LOVE PEOPLE FOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By TOM STIENSTRA  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Given a choice, some bears would rather rip your
car apart in search of a cookie than munch on unlimited numbers of
berries nearby.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, bears broke into eight more cars in parking at
the Yosemite National Park, all in the search for people food. That
brings the total to 35 cars broken into this summer at Yosemite,
with the total number of bear incidents in the park up to 406 and
counting.
</P>
<P>
   How would you like to return to your car and find a bear sitting
in the back seat, eating your cookies? The bears often just bash a
window and climbs in, searching for goodies.
</P>
<P>
   These episodes are occurring even with ripening black berries
and fallen apples now available in Yosemite Valley and all across
the alpine zone of California's mountain country. It turns out that
once a bear has tasted people food, they will ignore the natural
stuff in order to satisfy an addiction to butter, ice cream,
chocolate cookies, Swiss Miss and Tang, and other goodies, wherever
they can get them.
</P>
<P>
   They can feed this obsession even if it means breaking into
homes. On the outskirts of McCloud on the flank of Mount Shasta, a
bear invited itself into the home of Pam Cornett last week and
proceeded to search for food.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was rather hot so just before I went to bed I left the
dining room window open,'' Cornett told Gene Eagle of the Mount
Shasta Herald. ``Just before six this morning, I got up to go to
work and I heard this noise. I opened my bedroom door and there was
a big bear standing in front of the microwave.''
</P>
<P>
   As Cornett hid in the bathroom, the bear took its time rummaging
about, pulling the microwave on to the floor. It then left through
the open window.
</P>
<P>
   In thousands of encounters in California this summer, bears have
been interested solely in people food, and not people. According to
the state Department of Fish and Game, there have been no
documented bear-caused injuries in the past two years. Yet the
bears make the rounds at Yosemite campgrounds and many other camps
like post office drivers making their daily pick-ups. It's easy for
the bears since new, innocent arrivals show up every few days who
are easy to pick clean and are often shocked at seeing a Volkswagen
With Hair.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers at Yosemite and elsewhere have attempted to break the
food-raiding cycle by requiring food storage in bear-proof food
lockers at drive-in campgrounds and in food canisters for
wilderness hikers. It hasn't worked at the park because visitors
keep stashing food in their cars and don't keep their camps clean.
Some even bait bears in with food, because for many, seeing a bear
can validate a summer vacation.
</P>
<P>
   In bear country near Tahoe, along the west flank of the Sierra
Nevada and in the Cascade and Shasta-Siskiyou ranges, food-raiding
bears also make the rounds at rural cabins and mountain homes. As
long as bears can find garbage, dog food, bird seed or outside
freezers to raid, the cycle will continue.
</P>
<P>
   The only way to stop the episodes is to bear-proof homes and
campgrounds, and this can only be accomplished by keeping anything
a bear might desire secured and out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   With no people food available to steal, they will go back to
what nature intended _ eating grass, leaves, insects, berries,
apples and acorns from spring to fall.
</P>
<P>
   The problem isn't with bears. It's with careless people. Given
an opportunity for a cookie, bears just can't resist the
temptation.

&HT;     BICYCLIST RIDES FOR ANOTHER RECORD IN X GAMES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MICHELLE SMITH  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Bicyclist Dave Mirra will be riding for his 12th
medal Tuesday in the final event of the X Games.
</P>
<P>
   Mirra, 26, is the only X Games athlete to win a medal in every
event he has entered. Saturday's win in the bicycle park
competition _ in which he pulled an unprecedented double back-flip
_ was his ninth consecutive gold-medal effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's consistent,'' said Mat Hoffman, who has been competing
against Mirra for more than 13 years. ``There are a lot of great
riders out there. But there are only a few who can go out and turn
it on every time they compete. Dave is one of those guys, and he
proves it every time.''
</P>
<P>
   It is indeed Mirra's steady, high-quality riding that keeps him
on top of the standings. In the 1999 vert event, he did not end up
with the top score of the competition _ Jay Miron's second run was
the high score by a full point _ but Mirra won anyway, based on two
strong runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the total package,'' said Ryan Nyquist, a friend who
rides with Mirra. ``He's got flair, he's got tricks and he's got
style. He's probably the best rider out here right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention the most decorated, all tattoos aside.
</P>
<P>
   Mirra _ known as the ``Miracle Man'' _ and skateboarder Tony
Hawk are the most medal-adorned of all X Games competitors, each
winning their 11th medals Saturday, Hawk in the vert doubles, Mirra
in the bicycle stunt park competition. Mirra has the chance to take
over the lead Tuesday in the finals of the bicycle stunt vert
competition.
</P>
<P>
   The run of success leaves even Mirra shaking his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's crazy,'' said Mirra, of Greenville, N.C.. ``I think I've
been riding really strong and I feel like I've got the crowd
support behind me.''
</P>
<P>
   He is riding with something of a bulls-eye on his back
considering he is both the guy everyone wants to be like and the
one they all want to beat. At least at this event.
</P>
<P>
   ``The competition is getting pretty fierce out there,'' Nyquist
said. ``People have what it takes to be that good. They just have
to go out there and do it.''

   SAN FRANCISCO _ Richard Quick didn't appear to be setting up a
punch line as he answered questions about the nutritional
supplements taken by many of the swimmers he coaches at Stanford
University. He was talking quite seriously, describing how he'd
found a man with a doctorate to advise the athletes, how he hoped
to get this expert to Sydney next month to help the whole Olympic
team.
</P>
<P>
   Just as soberly, a reporter asked whether large quantities of
supplements, even taken under supervision, might pose long-term
health risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny,'' Quick said, ``but no one asks questions about an
athlete walking across the street to buy something from McDonald's
that might kill them later.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he realized that he had trod on the mother of all corporate
sponsors. With a wry grin, Quick corrected himself: ``I probably
shouldn't have said McDonald's.''
</P>
<P>
   The keepers of the Olympic flame take certain allegiances very
seriously. Their commitment to keeping politics out of the Games
never really stuck. Their promises to ferret out
performance-enhancing drugs have been all bluster. But their
devotion to their commercial partners _ that is sacred. It stands
like a rock.
</P>
<P>
   The myth of the apolitical Games was crushed in 1980 with the
American-led boycott. Or was it in 1936, when Jesse Owens'
abilities were used as a rebuke to Hitler? Or was it during the
years when South Africa was excluded for apartheid?
</P>
<P>
   All of those political intrusions began with good causes. But in
1968, Tommie Smith and John Carlos thought they had a good one, and
they were asked to leave Mexico City for raising black-gloved fists
during the awards ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   The latest political tussle involves former Cuban athletes
barred from the Games because their old country will not release
them from their ties to the island. A kayaker in the States and a
track star in Spain want their freedom. Cuban officials argue that
their country supported these athletes, nurtured their skills, then
saw them lured off by richer lands as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The International Olympic Committee laments these developments
but does not take responsibility for creating them. If the Olympics
really stood for boundary-free competition, then why not allow
athletes to compete for any country that grants them citizenship,
instead of requiring a three-year wait after that for ``sports
citizenship'' to change?
</P>
<P>
   Like the NCAA, the IOC is protecting its teams (nations) rather
than the athletes. Certainly, the fears about rampant free agency
among Olympic athletes are legitimate, but only to people who care
which country won which medals.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC does nothing to discourage the national pride attached
to individual accomplishment. Opening Ceremonies, with countries
marching behind their flags. Awards ceremonies, set to national
anthems. They are all part of the Olympic show, which looks so
great on TV.
</P>
<P>
   But in places like Sierra Leone, which lost native Eunice
Barber, a world-champion decathlete, to France, how well does this
stuff play? The networks covering the Games probably don't care;
Sierra Leone isn't much of a target audience. And if the networks
don't care, why should the IOC?
</P>
<P>
   The IOC does pretend to care about doping, just enough to
varnish the Games. Before every Olympics, officials brag about a
new testing mechanism. Then the Games end with very few cheaters in
the bag, giving the illusion of a clean event. Afterward, the truth
comes out.
</P>
<P>
   The latest gimmick is an alleged test for EPO, a drug purported
to enhance endurance. But the combination urine and blood tests
will not be able to detect, beyond reasonable doubt, anyone who
used the substance more than three days before competition.
Cheaters will slip through.
</P>
<P>
   Far less porous are the contracts for broadcast rights. The IOC
does not let an inch of video beam its way out of the host city
unless it was properly bought. The Internet, that rogue of the
media, will not be allowed to carry footage from Sydney. Only NBC's
Web site has permission to show the slightest bit of tape.
</P>
<P>
   Given the wiles of Internet entrepreneurs, I'd be willing to bet
they could break down any barrier. But not this one. The IOC brings
all of its power to protecting these rights, and when the IOC
applies all of its power, nobody gets away with any nonsense.
</P>
<P>
   That's why, in an ostensibly apolitical event, athletes wrap
themselves in flags. Prosperous American viewers, tuning into NBC,
eat that stuff up. And if, during the festivities, they're
subliminally motivated to eat some properly accredited burgers,
too, so much the better. Those are the ideals, the allegiances
promoted by the Olympics: Sing the Star-Spangled Banner and
foreswear Burger King.

ALIEN SPECIES HAVE ECOSCIENTISTS IN A QUANDARY

<P>
   MONTREAL _ Giant American bullfrogs are marauding through the
mud ponds of British Columbia, while a scheme that critics claim
amounts to ``ethnic cleansing of fish'' may soon eradicate
countless trout from a Rocky Mountain lake that is one of Canada's
most famous landmarks.
</P>
<P>
   It's adding up to a rough summer for aquatic species in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Although not directly connected, the devastation wrought by
aggressive ``alien'' bullfrogs and the controversial plan to
restore the bull-trout to its original habitats in Alberta _ after
first annihilating the ``introduced'' breeds that have taken over _
represent two sides of a dilemma that is plaguing even relatively
pristine Canada: What to do when outside species upset nature's
balance?
</P>
<P>
   For now, little is being done to combat the surge of bullfrogs
in British Columbia. But at Banff National Park in Alberta,
scientists are preparing to take an ambitious, activist approach,
seeking to turn back the ecological clock by large scale slaughter
of fish brought there by humans _ perhaps using massive
electroshocks or poison _ to allow the return of the bull-trout.
</P>
<P>
   But first the frogs.
</P>
<P>
   There are few things more Canadian than agonizing over the
prospect of being swallowed by the big neighbor to the south. But a
researcher at the University of Victoria has gathered evidence that
the threat is only too literal for indigenous Canadian frog species
inhabiting the ponds and small lakes of British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   American bullfrogs, brought to the region over the years as
stock for frogleg farms or as living ornaments for garden ponds,
have lately started wreaking havoc on native species. They are
devouring smaller Canadian tree frogs and red-legged frogs at
alarming rates, says frog researcher Purnima Govindarajulu, who has
charted the invasion in a study that started in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bullfrog is a handsome frog, but such a predator,''
Govindarajulu said of the bug-eyed, banjo-voiced critter that has
become amphibian enemy No. 1 on Vancouver Island. ``When their
population expands, it expands very quickly _ about five kilometers
a year in the Victoria area.''
</P>
<P>
   Local frogs, having no experience of the big bullying American,
become easy prey for the invader, which has taken over scores of
lakes and ponds in southwestern regions of the province.
</P>
<P>
   Govindarajulu said the first American bullfrogs were brought to
the region in the 1930s by aspiring frogleg farmers or pond owners
seeking an exotic addition to the cattails and lily pads. Over the
past few years, for reasons not yet understood, the newcomers have
started gorging on their fellow frogs at a rate that could wipe out
the two most common local species.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not sure if there's been a new introduction of
bullfrogs, or if something else changed,'' said Govindarajulu _
who, in keeping with an activist trend among some ecoscientists, is
monitoring the bullfrog populations in three of the lakes in her
six-lake study, while systematically killing off the bullfrogs in
the others to see what happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at how effectively we can control them,''
Govindarajulu told the Canadian Press news agency. ``Or if we can
control them.''
</P>
<P>
   High in the Rocky Mountains, meanwhile, a plan to save one
species of fish by destroying others is winning praise from
environmentalists but drawing flak from anglers, animal lovers, and
taxpapyer groups.
</P>
<P>
   With its turqoise waters ringed by spectacular snowcapped peaks,
Moraine Lake in Banff National Park is one of Canada's great
natural treasures.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the kind of fish living beneath that beautiful, clear
water are not representative of the original ecosystem,'' said
Charles Zinkan, director of mountain national parks for Parks
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Ideas of how to manage national parks in both Canada and the
United States have changed drastically in recent years. Until a
decade or so ago, there was nothing unusual about Banff's practice
of stocking lakes with outside species more pleasing to anglers. As
a result, native bull-trout populations have been all but destroyed
by brook trout and rainbow-cutthroat trout hybrids. Not a single
bull-trout presently survives in Moraine Lake.
</P>
<P>
   But under a new mandate, Parks Canada is seeking to restore
Banff and other national parks to their original state as much as
possible. For Moraine Lake, that means bringing home the
bull-trout. But park officials believe the more vulnerable species
will survive only if competing trout are ``removed from the natural
equation,'' as Zinkan delicately put it.
</P>
<P>
   That's where the poisons, electrical jolts, and giant drag nets
come in. Those are some of the methods being weighed by Parks
Canada to eradicate the introduced species. But a plan to blast the
brook and rainbow trout to oblivion with dynamite was recently
withdrawn after a huge public outcry.
</P>
<P>
   Many scientists applaud the concept of bringing back the
bull-trout. ``It would be nice to keep a few lakes in their natural
state for long-term reference,'' said David Schindler, a University
of Alberta ecologist and one of Canada's foremost wildlife experts.
</P>
<P>
   But some critics call the government scheme preposterous, even
cruel.
</P>
<P>
   Real Fishing magazine blasted the plan as ``trout genocide,''
animal rights groups maintain it will cause suffering for the
targeted trout, while the Canadian Taxpayers Federation called it
an appalling waste of public money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tax dollars for the ethnic cleansing of fish,'' fumed
federation director Walter Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   Nontheless, the eradication program may begin this fall. Once
all the other trout are killed, there will be a wait of four years
_ basically, to ensure they stay killed _ before the bull-trout are
reintroduced from the handful of mountain lakes in which they still
survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are removing trout and putting in trout,'' said Craig
Ritchie, editor of Real Fishing. ``You end up with the same thing _
trout in a lake.''
</P>
<P>
   But the government believes the project serves an ecologically
noble end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to restore an indigenous population, to bring a
lake back more closely to what it was,'' Zinkan said. ``There seems
some public misunderstanding of that concept.''

&HT;     MELANOMA VICTIMS REQUIRE FREQUENT CHECKUPS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ In December 1996, Don Pawliczak noticed a mole
that had been on his left arm for about a year was growing and
becoming flaky. He went to the doctor, who removed the mole and
told Pawliczak it was melanoma. Pawliczak didn't panic. He wasn't
even sure what melanoma was.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor told him to keep an eye out for more
suspicious-looking moles. About a year later, Pawliczak was shocked
to discover a lump the size of a baseball under his left armpit.
Malignant melanoma.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never dreamed it would spread internally,'' said Pawliczak,
a 38-year-old software designer who lives in Goshen, N.Y. ``I had
no clue how deadly it could be.''
</P>
<P>
   Skin cancer is the most common of all cancers. Melanoma, the
most serious form, accounts for 4 percent of skin cancer cases but
causes 79 percent of skin-cancer deaths, according to the American
Cancer Society. The organization predicts that 47,700 new cases of
melanoma will be diagnosed in the United States this year. Close to
8,000 people will die from it.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who had a melanoma removed from his
shoulder in 1993, had two more removed on Saturday as well as lymph
nodes in his head and neck. McCain has stressed the importance of
having frequent checkups and detecting such cancers early.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, the chances of recurrence are small after
melanoma has been removed, said Dr. Gary Lyman, director of the
cancer center at Albany Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   But as the news about McCain illustrates, ``these assurances are
not always well-founded, and no one has a crystal ball. Melanoma
isn't the most common cancer, but it is the most deadly skin cancer
and one where early diagnosis is extremely important,'' said Lyman,
who outlined several high risk factors.
</P>
<P>
   ``A major factor has to do with skin composition,'' he said.
People with fair skin and blond or red hair are more likely to
develop this type of cancer because they have less of the pigment
melanin in their skin to provide a natural protection from the sun.
People with dark skin, however, are not immune to the disease.
</P>
<P>
   A second risk factor is having been exposed to the sun for long
periods of time, particularly early in life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eighty percent of the sun damage you get you get before the
age of 20,'' said Dr. Mitchell Singer, a dermatologist in
Schenectady. ``It just takes 40 years to show up.''
</P>
<P>
   People who work outdoors or who spend a lot of time at the beach
or participating in outdoor sports are also at higher risk of
developing skin cancer.
</P>
<P>
   A family history of melanoma and the presence of certain types
of moles also raise the risk. Most people have moles, and almost
all moles are harmless. But there are some warning signs that
melanoma could be developing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any mole that appears or changes in size, shape or appearance
should be immediately brought to a doctor's attention,'' said
Lyman, adding that people should watch for moles that have ragged
edges or uneven coloring and shapes.
</P>
<P>
   About half of all melanomas occur in people over 50. However,
younger people are being diagnosed with the disease more often. In
fact, melanoma is one of the most common cancers in people under
30.
</P>
<P>
   The American Cancer Society recommends a skin examination every
three years for people between ages 20 and 40 and every year for
anyone 40 and older.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to regular checkups by dermatologists, Lyman also
stresses the importance of self-examination, particularly for
people with high risk factors. ``Know your skin,'' he said. ``Know
what moles you have.''
</P>
<P>
   Melanoma often appears on the lower legs of fair-skinned women
and on the trunk of fair-skinned men but it can occur other places
as well. People with darker skin can develop this cancer on the
palms of the hands, soles of the feet and under the nails,
according to the American Cancer Society.
</P>
<P>
   While wearing sunscreen offers a measure of protection from the
sun's burning rays, some doctors are concerned that it also gives
people a false sense of security that leads them to spend more time
in the sun, said Lyman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a fully resolved issue but most dermatologists would
recommend limiting the amount of time you're in the sun,
particularly during the hottest part of the day,'' he said. ``Use
sunscreen but don't let it fool you into thinking you're fully
protected because you're not.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can see the sun, the sun can see you,'' said Singer.
``Most of the sun you get is inadvertent. It's not from a day at
the beach. It's from walking to the car from the mall or mowing the
lawn for a half hour without sunscreen.''
</P>
<P>
   Pawliczak, who underwent 12 months of chemotherapy and has been
cancer-free since March 1999, said he spent most of 1998 indoors.
Now he works in his garden outdoors _ wearing plenty of sunscreen.
``I've gotten over the fear and now I'm just more cautious,'' he
said.

 &HT;    A JOURNEY TO CAMP ARROWHEAD
 &HT;    For Sunday, August 27
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUXEDO, N.C. _ It's 583 miles from our house in the Washington
suburbs to the Blackfoot Lodge, the small clapboard cabin that my
son Robby and seven other boys called home for two weeks in August.
</P>
<P>
   Nestled against the verdant bosom of the Blue Ridge Mountains,
Camp Arrowhead is in that part of western North Carolina where
blacktop roads wind like a frightened copperhead through dark misty
hollows of folklore and dreams, a place where buckwheat is a
staple, not a health food, and chainsaw sculpture is a recognized
art form.
</P>
<P>
   Deep in a scented forest of hickory, oak and loblolly pines,
Camp Arrowhead is a rustic resort for energetic young patrons with
a passion for racing barefoot across fields of grass, plunging into
a bracing lake or sliding down a muddy slope.
</P>
<P>
   There is no television.
</P>
<P>
   Water guns and CD players are not allowed. Video games are
verboten.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise the rules are simple and few: start each day with a
fresh pair of socks; end with a soap and water shower; and in
between have as much fun as you possibly can.
</P>
<P>
   What better elixir for the weary soul of a young boy bristling
at the straight-jacket strictures of suburban life?
</P>
<P>
   Boyhood, Mark Twain once said, is a state of undeclared war on
civilization.
</P>
<P>
   Who could have imagined how fiercely civilization would fight
back?
</P>
<P>
   And yet, ever onward it advances, pressing its relentless march
against the joys of boyhood with its restraints and restrictions,
test scores and standards, and the general muddle of contradictions
inherent in a society that wants its sons to be strong, though
sensitive, enthusiastic, but not exuberant, always competitive but
never combative.
</P>
<P>
   Our journey from that world to Camp Arrowhead took Robby and me
along high mountain ridges where wild hawks soared above the tree
line and into damp shaded valleys of cold water streams.
</P>
<P>
   I held the screen door as he walked out of a small roadside
store, carrying a brown paper bag of peanuts, crackers and a
freshly cut wedge of soft yellow cheese, the perfect banquet for
our twilight travels through rolling corn fields and lush leafy
patches of pumpkins, cabbage and summer squash.
</P>
<P>
   We passed long hours in the car playing ``Who Wants To Be A Five
Dollar Millionaire,'' our own low-stakes version of the more
popular TV game, with Robby earning four dollars _ ten cents at a
time _ by scoring in age-appropriate categories like motor
vehicles, current events and the history of rock and roll.
</P>
<P>
   There may be no greater faith, no greater inclination toward
forgiveness, than that of a 9-year-old boy riding in the back seat
of his father's car.
</P>
<P>
   ``When will be get there?'' He believes I know.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you know the way?'' He thinks it must be hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dad, are we lost?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, son,'' I reply in my most consoling voice, pulling the car
to a halt on the dust and gravel shoulder while I take my bearings.
``We're just...off the map.''
</P>
<P>
   It must strike him as an odd distinction. But he shrugs and
accepts it, never doubting that we'll eventually reach Camp
Arrowhead, as, eventually, we do.
</P>
<P>
   Check-in goes smoothly enough.
</P>
<P>
   Robby stakes out a bunk and gets his briefing at the camp
clinic.
</P>
<P>
   There, a little guy who resists sitting still with every bone in
his body when the math tutor drops in, listens with rapt attention
as the camp nurse instructs him to check his sleeping bag for
spiders _ and his body for ticks _ each night at bedtime.
</P>
<P>
   There's a quick father-son handshake, an even quicker hug, and
Robby turns and ambles off across the broad sloping lawn toward
Blackfoot Lodge.
</P>
<P>
   I brush the peanut shells off the back seat of the car, then
slip behind the wheel for the long drive home.
</P>
<P>
   As I wind my way up the dirt road leading from Camp Arrowhead, a
cool breeze blows across my face, a goodbye, of sorts, from the
Blue Ridge Mountains, and a gentle reminder that no season lasts
forever. Not summer, certainly. Not even boyhood.

   Delegates and protesters of the Democratic National Convention
might've found tonight's offerings on the Travel Channel handy a
couple of weeks ago. Tonight, they'll just be able to watch what
they've missed.
</P>
<P>
   Presented under the umbrella title of ``Travel Channel
Secrets,'' ``L.A. Scandals'' and ``Los Angeles _ Life on the Edge''
purport to present less prominent sides of our city. ``Life on the
Edge'' could use more edge, but offers some intriguing glimpses
into the city, while the only thing scandalous about ``Scandals''
is how lame it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life on the Edge'' offers the Bizarro-World tour of L.A.,
eschewing Hollywood Boulevard and Rodeo Drive in favor of
Necromance, a shop where you can buy real human skeletons, and
Skeletons in the Closet, the L.A. Coroner's now-popular gift shop.
It stops at the beaches only long enough to take in an
early-morning workout, called Optimum Boot Camp, run by a drill
instructor, and to watch schools of tiny fish called grunion mate
in the sand.
</P>
<P>
   Visits to CalTrans and ATSAC, which try to keep the city's
traffic in motion, are more enlightening than you might imagine.
It's hard to imagine, though, that it takes such a high-tech system
simply to get our cars moving in the beleaguered spurts that they
do (ATSAC, it's revealed, will trick up the city's stop lights and
slow us all down in order to help buses behind schedule catch up).
Hard to imagine, however, anyone outside the city would find these
segments as fascinating as Angelenos will.
</P>
<P>
   Not everything on ``Life on the Edge'' is particularly obscure _
The Magic Castle is a fairly legendary monument, and Wacko is just
one of the novelty shops in the Los Feliz/Silver Lake area _ but
chances are good that no matter how long you've lived in L.A.,
there'll be something here you didn't know about.
</P>
<P>
   No such luck with ``L.A. Scandals,'' however, a cut-and-paste
job that retreads stories so embedded and rehashed in the area's
history that most Angelenos could've knocked off this special, just
working off the tops of our heads. Bugsy Siegel, William
Mulholland's aqueduct, the Black Dahlia, Marilyn Monroe _ they're
all given cursory once-overs so bland it's hard to imagine any of
these stories once seized our interest (the biggest shock: no
O.J.). ``Chinatown'' is invoked (apparently, the documentarians are
unaware that the story is fiction) as is former police chief
William Parker, as we're given a tour of Parker Center that's
fairly irrelevant to the subject at hand (second-biggest shock: no
Rodney King).
</P>
<P>
   Making matters worse is the purplish prose emanating from the
vaguely hard-boiled narrator's mouth: L.A., he tells us, is ``where
a chrome-plated typewriter's chrome-plated tales become a writer's
bread and butter.'' Monroe's crypt, we're told, holds more than her
body: ``Sealed inside are the secrets of her death.'' Maybe they
should stick this documentary in there, too, where no one can get
hold of it. &QL;

What: Self-explanatory documentary. &QL; 
Where: Travel Channel. &QL; 
When: 9 tonight. &QL; 
Our rating: 1 1/2 stars &QL;

&HT;     MELANOMA VICTIMS REQUIRE FREQUENT CHECKUPS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (Eds: ADDS details about McCain's melanomas in 5th graf)  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ In December 1996, Don Pawliczak noticed a mole
that had been on his left arm for about a year was growing and
becoming flaky. He went to the doctor, who removed the mole and
told Pawliczak it was melanoma. Pawliczak didn't panic. He wasn't
even sure what melanoma was.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor told him to keep an eye out for more
suspicious-looking moles. About a year later, Pawliczak was shocked
to discover a lump the size of a baseball under his left armpit.
Malignant melanoma.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never dreamed it would spread internally,'' said Pawliczak,
a 38-year-old software designer who lives in Goshen, N.Y. ``I had
no clue how deadly it could be.''
</P>
<P>
   Skin cancer is the most common of all cancers. Melanoma, the
most serious form, accounts for 4 percent of skin cancer cases but
causes 79 percent of skin-cancer deaths, according to the American
Cancer Society. The organization predicts that 47,700 new cases of
melanoma will be diagnosed in the United States this year. Close to
8,000 people will die from it.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who had a melanoma removed from his
left shoulder in 1993, had two more _ one on his left temple and
one on his left arm _ excised on Saturday as well as lymph nodes in
his head and neck. McCain has stressed the importance of having
frequent checkups and detecting such cancers early.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, the chances of recurrence are small after
melanoma has been removed, said Dr. Gary Lyman, director of the
cancer center at Albany Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   But as the news about McCain illustrates, ``these assurances are
not always well-founded, and no one has a crystal ball. Melanoma
isn't the most common cancer, but it is the most deadly skin cancer
and one where early diagnosis is extremely important,'' said Lyman,
who outlined several high risk factors.
</P>
<P>
   ``A major factor has to do with skin composition,'' he said.
People with fair skin and blond or red hair are more likely to
develop this type of cancer because they have less of the pigment
melanin in their skin to provide a natural protection from the sun.
People with dark skin, however, are not immune to the disease.
</P>
<P>
   A second risk factor is having been exposed to the sun for long
periods of time, particularly early in life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eighty percent of the sun damage you get you get before the
age of 20,'' said Dr. Mitchell Singer, a dermatologist in
Schenectady. ``It just takes 40 years to show up.''
</P>
<P>
   People who work outdoors or who spend a lot of time at the beach
or participating in outdoor sports are also at higher risk of
developing skin cancer.
</P>
<P>
   A family history of melanoma and the presence of certain types
of moles also raise the risk. Most people have moles, and almost
all moles are harmless. But there are some warning signs that
melanoma could be developing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any mole that appears or changes in size, shape or appearance
should be immediately brought to a doctor's attention,'' said
Lyman, adding that people should watch for moles that have ragged
edges or uneven coloring and shapes.
</P>
<P>
   About half of all melanomas occur in people over 50. However,
younger people are being diagnosed with the disease more often. In
fact, melanoma is one of the most common cancers in people under
30.
</P>
<P>
   The American Cancer Society recommends a skin examination every
three years for people between ages 20 and 40 and every year for
anyone 40 and older.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to regular checkups by dermatologists, Lyman also
stresses the importance of self-examination, particularly for
people with high risk factors. ``Know your skin,'' he said. ``Know
what moles you have.''
</P>
<P>
   Melanoma often appears on the lower legs of fair-skinned women
and on the trunk of fair-skinned men but it can occur other places
as well. People with darker skin can develop this cancer on the
palms of the hands, soles of the feet and under the nails,
according to the American Cancer Society.
</P>
<P>
   While wearing sunscreen offers a measure of protection from the
sun's burning rays, some doctors are concerned that it also gives
people a false sense of security that leads them to spend more time
in the sun, said Lyman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a fully resolved issue but most dermatologists would
recommend limiting the amount of time you're in the sun,
particularly during the hottest part of the day,'' he said. ``Use
sunscreen but don't let it fool you into thinking you're fully
protected because you're not.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can see the sun, the sun can see you,'' said Singer.
``Most of the sun you get is inadvertent. It's not from a day at
the beach. It's from walking to the car from the mall or mowing the
lawn for a half hour without sunscreen.''
</P>
<P>
   Pawliczak, who underwent 12 months of chemotherapy and has been
cancer-free since March 1999, said he spent most of 1998 indoors.
Now he works in his garden outdoors _ wearing plenty of sunscreen.
``I've gotten over the fear and now I'm just more cautious,'' he
said.

<P>
   MOUNT WASHINGTON STATE PARK, N.H. _ In the stoic, steep White
Mountains of New Hampshire, a soot-belching, coal-fired steam
locomotive has been plying Mount Washington cog by cog since 1869.
The world's first railroad to a mountaintop, the Cog Railway begins
at a remote spot five miles off curvy and steep Route 302.
</P>
<P>
   We had made reservations in advance so we knew what to expect:
Tickets cost $44 for an adult and $30 for a child for the
three-hour round-rip. A newly renovated wooden car with huge glass
windows, pushed by an old-fashioned coal-fired steam locomotive,
was warming up. About 10 passengers walked up the stairs to the
single car.
</P>
<P>
   Steven, our brakeman, in a two-piece blue uniform and a ponytail
hanging on his back, greeted us and described the three-mile route.
The train started at an elevation of 2,700 feet and then climbed up
to the summit of Mount Washington at 6,288 feet, traveling at only
3 mph.
</P>
<P>
   On the way up, the real work in the locomotive was in the hands
of the engineer and the fireman who keeps shoveling coal. Each
locomotive consumes a ton of coal and a thousand gallons of water
on the trip.
</P>
<P>
   Steven's job is pretty simple on the way up. He sits and enjoys
the view. On the way down, he works hard, using the brakes and
keeping the engine and car together.
</P>
<P>
   It was cloudy, but we managed to enjoy the view. The trees got
smaller and smaller, seeming to grow sideways, slowly disappearing
above the level of neighboring mountains. My 11-year-old daughter
Michelle described them as ``shrinking like aging people.'' My
husband, Don, and I took turns going to the front of the car,
shooting pictures and gasping at the increasing elevation.
</P>
<P>
   On the steepest part, called Jacob's Ladder, the train travels
at a 37.4-degree angle. One side of the car is 14 feet higher than
the other. We were encouraged to stand up at this point, but my
family gingerly sat in the secure seats.
</P>
<P>
   Near the summit, the lodge appeared as a ghostly vision among
the clouds. Had it been sunny, we were told, we could have seen a
stupendous view of not only New Hampshire but surrounding states.
</P>
<P>
   When we reached the top, we could barely see out the door. The
temperature was 56, with wind chill it felt like 27. After bundling
up, we went out to discover the lodge had a cafeteria, a museum, an
observatory and even a gift shop. We had 20 minutes before the trip
down.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle insisted on buying a stuffed moose wearing a black
T-shirt saying, ``Mount Washington State Park, elevation 6,288
feet.'' I paid $13 for the memento. My husband was sitting
patiently, observing all the tired hikers and visitors in the
lodge.
</P>
<P>
   On the descent, Steven the brakeman was busy making sure our car
didn't detach from, and ram into, the locomotive. There were two
wheels that he took turns steering, in between using a foot brake.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it was a smooth ride down. We happened to catch sight
of a few hikers, who were waving, as we took a turn.
</P>
<P>
   Approaching the lodge, where the trip had begun, the engineer
pulled the shrill train whistle, alerting everyone of our approach.
The clouds began getting darker and rain started to trickle.
</P>
<P>
   The New Hampshire slogan ``The road less traveled'' should
encourage others to add this region to their list of destinations.
It is less traveled.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   THE RESORT
</P>
<P>
   Driving slowly along the woodsy road, our eyes lit up as we
approached the beautiful White Mountain Hotel and Resort, set
beneath Whitehorse and Cathedral Ledges in the White Mountain
Forest, down the road from Echo Lake State Park.
</P>
<P>
   Secluded, yet just minutes away from North Conway, a quaint New
England town with more than 120 shopping outlets, restaurants and
other bustling attractions, the three-story resort offered 80 guest
rooms, including 11 suites.
</P>
<P>
   We took the elevator to the third floor and headed to our lovely
L-shaped suite, elegantly furnished with a king-size bed with a
large modern bathroom on one end, and a couch that opened to a
queen-size bed on the other. The suite included other amenities,
such as a big-screen color television and a small refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   The best part was the huge picture window. We had our own
private view of Cathedral Ledge, a very steep, sheer rock cliff
whose mountain ledges attract hikers. We were told that
occasionally a wedding ceremony takes place on top.
</P>
<P>
   There were two parking lots at the resort, one specifically for
hikers only, and the other for hotel guests.
</P>
<P>
   The mini-suite would be our home for the week. We paid $139,
without tax, a night. We freshened up and headed down to the Ledges
Dining Room, the main dining room, furnished with Queen Anne-style
tables and chairs, white linen tablecloths and fresh flowers, known
for superb cuisine and spectacular panoramic views.
</P>
<P>
   The dining room was surrounded by glass windows facing the
mountains and even a view of the outdoor pool. A musician was
playing old Broadway tunes on a baby grand. My family relished the
moment. We toasted to our vacation.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   AMUSEMENTS
</P>
<P>
   At Story Land in Glen, we stepped down into the individual swan
boat ride on the pond. The theme park, geared to young children,
primarily those under 48 inches. The cost for each person was $18.
</P>
<P>
   Even though our legs were a little long for this ride, powered
by my feet pushing the swan-boat's pedal like a bicycle, my
daughter and I smiled from ear to ear and sang a chorus of ``It's A
Small, Small World.'' Enjoying the cool breeze, and light splashes
of water, we sat back and watched visitors sitting in Cinderella's
Pumpkin Coach on their way up to Cinderella's Castle on top of the
hill.
</P>
<P>
   My daughter, a diehard fan of The Great Escape in Lake George,
N.Y., and Disney World in Orlando, Fla., fell in love with Story
Land.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Story Land, which opened its doors in 1954, there
were all types of houses and buildings reflecting various fairy
tales. Everything from Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall to the Three
Little Pigs.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   ALONG THE GORGE
</P>
<P>
   We decided to take a short hike through the Flume, a natural
gorge extending 800 feet at the base of Mount Liberty in Franconia
Notch State Park.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a short bus ride from the Gilman Visitor Center, we then
began the ascent on the trail.
</P>
<P>
   Cost for the flume was $7 for adults; $4 for children 6-12; and
free for children younger than 6.
</P>
<P>
   There were huge rust-colored rocks with water splashing down. We
passed all types of flowers, ferns and mosses surrounding the
trail, which got steeper, turning into narrow steps along the
rushing waters of the flume.
</P>
<P>
   Outstanding waterfalls were a constant thrill along the way. One
in particular, Avalanche Falls, is the climax of the walk. The
45-foot waterfall created a crescendo of sound as Flume Brook
entered the gorge.
</P>
<P>
   There are intermittent benches, places to take out the bottled
water, shoot a few pictures and contemplate the natural beauty.

   MUSEUM STOREROOMS ARE LIKE ATTICS, FULL OF TREASURES AND JUNK
</P>
<P>
   MUSEUMS-STOREROOMS-LIFEBEAT _ Beneath the great galleries of
paintings, sculptures and objects on display in any major American
art museum exists another world the general public never sees. It's
a locked-up, dust-free, climate-controlled world where paintings
are hung close together on floor-to-ceiling sliding metal frames,
where Old Master drawings, rare prints and centuries-old textiles
are stored in long, flat boxes lined with acid-free material, and
where the temperature is kept at a constant 70 degrees, with 50
percent humidity. This is the museum's storeroom _ its basement,

   DEPRESSION IN PREGNANCY, SERIOUS BUT TREATABLE

   PREGNANCY-DEPRESSION-LIFEBEAT _ Gina Tretter, a 35-year-old St.
Louis dietitian, became so profoundly depressed after the Caesarean
birth of her long-desired daughter, Katie, that she swore to her
husband, ``We're never doing this again.'' Although antidepressants
finally brought her out of it, she wouldn't take the risk of having
another baby for four more years. What changed her mind was her
doctor's promise that if she became depressed again _ even during
her pregnancy _ she could go back on the medication. By Lois B.

   For some, the first sign is a ``wavy'' telephone pole, or a
venetian blind with ``blank'' spots where a few slats should be. Or
you may notice a loss of central vision. Such troubles can signal a
sight-robbing disease called macular degeneration, affecting some
13 million people over the age of 50.
</P>
<P>
   Age-related macular degeneration, or AMD, affects the retina,
causing progressive vision loss. Typically, it starts with loss of
sight at the center of the visual field, so sufferers immediately
lose the ability to read. AMD rarely leaves its victims completely
blind; in most cases peripheral vision remains. There are two kinds
of AMD: 90 percent of sufferers have the ``dry'' form, which is
slow-progressing; the remaining 10 percent suffer from the ``wet''
form of AMD, in which sight loss tends to be severe and rapid. It's
caused by the growth of abnormal, leaking blood vessels beneath the
retina.
</P>
<P>
   There's no cure or treatment for dry AMD, and the only treatment
for wet AMD until last April was laser therapy to cauterize the
bleeding vessels _ an imperfect method that leaves blank or black
spots in the vision. Now some wet-AMD patients are candidates for
Visudyne, a new light-sensitive injectable drug used with cool
laser treatment to destroy the problematic blood vessels and avoid
damaging the retina.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tremendous advantage,'' says Dr. Lylas G. Mogk,
director of the Visual Rehabilitation and Research Center at the
Henry Ford Health System in Grosse Pointe, Mich., and coauthor
(with her daughter) of ``Macular Degeneration: The Complete Guide
to Saving and Maximizing Your Sight'' (Ballantine; $14.95). ``But
it doesn't stop new vessels from growing, so in most cases you'll
need to keep doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   A growing body of research points to the importance of adopting
some simple, healthful habits to help prevent AMD:
</P>
<P>
   WEAR YOUR SUNGLASSES
</P>
<P>
   The latest word in protection is melanin. In powdered form, it's
used by some sunglass manufacturers, including Code Melanin-XP and
Chanel, to coat lenses and block not only UV rays but also blue
light (aka High Energy Visible, or HEV, light). ``Research seems to
point to blue light as one of the culprits (in AMD),'' says Mogk.
``You always hear that UV is the bad guy _ it does promote
cataracts _ but UV light doesn't get to the retina.'' Blue light
does.
</P>
<P>
   SEE YOUR DOCTOR
</P>
<P>
   Factors that affect your risk for AMD include sun exposure, a
family history, fair skin and/or light eyes, smoking and a diet low
in antioxidants. Hypertension and a high-fat diet may increase risk
as well. Everyone over the age of 40 should visit an
ophthalmologist every two years. If you're 50 or older, annual
visits are advised.
</P>
<P>
   EAT YOUR GREENS
</P>
<P>
   Kale, collard greens and spinach contain lots of lutein, a
carotenoid antioxidant that seems to have a protective effect on
the macula in people at high risk for AMD. Taking lutein _ in food
or supplements _ may help, says Dr. Alfred Kulik, an
ophthalmologist in private practice in New York and New Jersey.
``We're not talking about reversing loss, just potentially slowing
it down.''
</P>
<P>
   TAKE YOUR MULTIVITAMIN
</P>
<P>
   Vitamins A, C and E have also been anecdotally linked to a
reduced incidence of AMD. Stores today carry special multivitamins
and ``eye supplements'' containing antioxidants and lutein
(Ocuvite, ICaps, Centrum), but, cautions Dr. Nathan Congdon,
assistant professor of ophthalmology at the Wilmer Eye Institute at
Johns Hopkins, ``There's not much evidence that an eye vitamin is
more beneficial than a standard multivitamin.''

 DEPRESSION IN PREGNANCY, SERIOUS BUT TREATABLE

<P>
   Gina Tretter, a 35-year-old St. Louis dietitian, became so
profoundly depressed after the birth of her long-desired daughter,
Katie, that she swore to her husband, ``We're never doing this
again.'' Although antidepressants finally brought her out of it,
she wouldn't take the risk of having another baby for four more
years. What changed her mind was her doctor's promise that if she
became depressed again _ even during her pregnancy _ she could go
back on the medication.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, on Zoloft, she gave birth to Brian. ``I was in love
with him from the first minute,'' said Tretter, who still regrets
that Katie was deprived of that bond for nearly five months, until
Tretter was stabilized on Zoloft and could take her first child to
her heart.
</P>
<P>
   Few experts deny that antidepressants can alleviate the sadness,
confusion, anger, insomnia, self-recrimination, dread and loss of
interest in virtually everything _ including the baby _ of
postpartum depression. Nor do they deny that antidepressants can
lift a depression during pregnancy. Yet many mental health
professionals and women's health advocates worry that these drugs
are being overprescribed, especially to pregnant and breast-feeding
women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many psychiatrists are aggressively treating pregnant women
with psychotropic medications when brief, nonpharmacological
interventions may be equally effective,'' said Michael O'Hara, a
psychology professor at the University of Iowa in Iowa City.
</P>
<P>
   Some widely respected psychiatrists hold similar views. Many are
old enough to remember the limbless babies born to mothers who took
thalidomide in the 1950s and early '60s to control morning
sickness, and the vaginal and testicular cancers that eventually
developed in children of mothers who took DES (diethylstilbestrol)
from the '40s through the '60s to prevent miscarriage.
</P>
<P>
   The most commonly prescribed antidepressants, including the
tricyclic class and the newer selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors, or SSRIs (Prozac, on the market for more than a decade,
has been the most studied), reveal no major birth defects.
``Minor'' anomalies, including oddly shaped earlobes and differing
width of the eyes, have occurred, however. Some premature and
low-birthweight babies have also been reported.
</P>
<P>
   Katherine L. Wisner, a psychiatrist at Case Western Reserve
University School of Medicine in Cleveland, recently reported on
four studies comparing the birth outcomes of women who had taken
various antidepressants to those of women who had not. They found
no adverse effects on the behavior, temperament, learning abilities
or intelligence of the children, some of whom were followed to
their early school years. But beyond that age, no one knows, and
many of the antidepressants in use are new, with little or no
available data to guide decisions.
</P>
<P>
   For Tretter, the decision to take a potentially risky drug was
easy: She would do anything to prevent the hell she and her family
went through with her first pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   Although the mood swings and teariness of the so-called baby
blues affect up to 80 percent of mothers within the first days of
giving birth, this reactive state usually disappears within a week.
</P>
<P>
   Any time in that first year, however, 10 percent to 15 percent
of women develop a postpartum depression that meets clinical
criteria; another 5 percent or 10 percent experience an extended
period of bothersome symptoms. One or two in 1,000 develop
postpartum psychosis, the state in which infanticide and suicide
are most common.
</P>
<P>
   Although women are most prone to depression throughout their
reproductive years, in the first six months after the birth of a
child ``the vulnerability is higher than any other half-year period
of a woman's life,'' said Dr. Nada L. Stotland, a professor of
psychiatry at Rush Medical College in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Like most depressions that a woman endures, this too shall pass
_ eventually. Without intervention, postpartum depression can last
from eight months to more than a year, or it may never resolve
completely. Any depression that is untreated means another is more
likely in the future. Among women who have had one postpartum
depression, the chances increase sevenfold that it will happen in a
succeeding pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most alarming consequence is the depressed new
mother's inability to bond with and nurture her child. Studies show
that infants of depressed mothers are slower to interact with
people and objects. They may have poor motor skills and trouble
regulating their emotions. By age 1, they perform comparatively
poorly on tests of cognitive abilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Babies whose mothers were depressed are also at increased risk
of depression throughout life,'' Stotland said. ``How much is
genetic and how much is because these babies spend their early
months looking at tears on a human face, we don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   For these reasons, mental health practitioners are eager to
treat pregnant women, even to prescribe antidepressants throughout
all three trimesters of pregnancy as well as during breast-feeding.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as if untreated psychiatric disorder is a benign
phenomenon,'' said Dr. Lee S. Cohen, a Harvard psychiatrist who is
the director of the Perinatal and Reproductive Psychiatry Clinical
Research Program at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.
``Severe untreated depression and anxiety during pregnancy are
associated with bad fetal outcome, including high rates of
obstetrical complications and preterm labor.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent study by Dr. Tapio Kurki, a Finnish
obstetrician-gynecologist, of 623 healthy women pregnant for the
first time found 2.5 times as much risk in developing
pre-eclampsia, a sometimes fatal rise in blood pressure, among
women who were anxious or depressed early in pregnancy. And, as
experts uniformly point out, depressed and anxious pregnant women
do not eat or sleep well, exercise or otherwise take care of
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are worse things than taking medication during
pregnancy,'' said Dell of Duke, noting that it may be less harmful
for the fetus to be exposed to medication than to be awash for nine
months in the mother's stress hormones. According to the latest
thinking among medical experts, some women are especially sensitive
to normal hormonal cycling. Estrogen and progesterone and other
reproductive hormones are known to affect brain neurotransmitters,
including serotonin, which regulate mood.
</P>
<P>
   Sudden shifts in these hormones _ occurring most drastically
within 24 hours of the placenta's breaking free after childbirth _
are believed to touch off postpartum depression among women who are
sensitive to changes in serotonin. Thus antidepressants, which
affect neurotransmitter systems, are currently the drugs of choice.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, no treatment protocols list medication as the first
choice, unless the mother has severe mental illness and she or her
fetus, or both, are at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Because symptoms of postpartum depression are not uncommon in
mothers of newly adopted children (and in fathers as well), the
biological argument for medication does not hold up fully.
</P>
<P>
   Psychological and social factors, including relationship
discord, history of child abuse, lack of preparation for motherhood
and changes in a woman's role once she becomes a mother are risk
factors for depression. The absence of support from friends and
family contributes as well.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Sanford, president of the Women's Healthcare Partnership,
a behavioral health practice in St. Louis, and the psychologist
whom Tretter consulted during her first postpartum depression and
again during her second pregnancy, contends that doctors are too
quick to medicate women. ``That's true of women's health care in
general,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Sanford supported Tretter's decision to take
antidepressants, given her history. Sanford, a coauthor with Anne
Dunnewold of ``Postpartum Survival Guide,'' said that these
medications are among the options, including psychotherapy, from
which women should be entitled to choose.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, the choice might be made by default. ``Most women
don't get psychotherapy, because nobody pays for it anymore,'' said
Dr. Charles H. Kellner, a professor of psychiatry at the Medical
University of South Carolina in Charleston.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Tretter consulted Sanford only once during the torments
that followed Katie's birth because her health plan, which covered
medication, would not pay for psychotherapy. Her plan changed by
the time she became pregnant again, so she was able to visit
Sanford six times during the first trimester, when she was taken
off the medication. (As commonly happens, the depression returned
with renewed strength; Tretter quickly went back on Zoloft.)
</P>
<P>
   But the most likely alternative for women facing mood and
anxiety disorders during pregnancy and afterward may turn out to be
no help at all. It is remarkably common for them to feel ashamed of
being ``bad'' mothers, and to keep their feelings to themselves _
and for their doctors not to ask.

 MUSEUM STOREROOMS ARE LIKE ATTICS, FULL OF TREASURES AND JUNK

<P>
   Beneath the great galleries of paintings, sculptures and objects
on display in any major American art museum exists another world
the general public never sees. It's a locked-up, dust-free,
climate-controlled world where paintings are hung close together on
floor-to-ceiling sliding metal frames, where Old Master drawings,
rare prints and centuries-old textiles are stored in long, flat
boxes lined with acid-free material, and where the temperature is
kept at a constant 70 degrees, with 50 percent humidity. This is
the museum's storeroom _ its basement, although these days it's not
always located underground.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an endless fascination with things in storage as
opposed to things on view,'' observes Anne d'Harnoncourt, director
of the Philadelphia Museum of Art. ``People somehow believe that
the museums are hiding wonderful paintings and objects.'' While no
one seriously disputes that museums put their best works on view,
some wonderful paintings and objects do end up hidden away in
storage _ and not always by accident.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's National Gallery of Art stores about 20 French
Impressionist works that deputy director and urator Alan
Sheftack rates as ``good to excellent.'' So why are they not on
view? The ones on view are judged to be even better, and with 18
rooms of French paintings, Sheftack says, ``We don't want to
over-weight any particular period.''
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles County Museum of Art has a famous 16th-century
Persian rug known as the ``Ardabil'' carpet, but it is rarely
shown, and then only for short periods. The intricately patterned
silk-and-wool carpet is so delicate that it is only taken out of
storage every 10 years or so.
</P>
<P>
   Drawings, prints and textiles are the items most often stored,
because (1) the collections are usually large and (2) museums have
yet to devise a safe method of displaying these light-sensitive
works for any length of time without danger of fading and other
damage.
</P>
<P>
   The National Gallery of Art's famous page from Renaissance
architect Giorgio Vasari's folio, perhaps the finest Old Master
drawing in America, makes rare but brief appearances in the
gallery's rotating exhibitions chosen from its thousands of
drawings and prints. The Metropolitan Museum of Art's Web site
boasts that the Met possesses 11,000 drawings and 1.5 million
prints.
</P>
<P>
   Fleeting appearances by rarely seen treasures, tight security
and the usually sketchy information about what's actually being
held in storage have combined to create a mystique about museum
storerooms _ especially since many museums store a great deal more
than they put on public display.
</P>
<P>
   The National Gallery, for example, has 102,309 objects in its
collection, but only about 1 percent are on permanent view at any
given time.
</P>
<P>
   At the Metropolitan Museum of Art, it's about 5 percent. The
Philadelphia Museum of Art also shows some 5 percent of its
objects, and the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in Richmond displays
about 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The typical storeroom of a major museum is a record of the
museum's growth, its curatorial mistakes, changing tastes and the
shifting sands of scholarly opinion _ in other words, a combination
of treasure-trove and junk room. Paintings that have been removed
to make way for others of better quality hang beside works whose
attributions are questionable; they are waiting for new scholarship
to rehabilitate them, sometimes in vain. Downright fakes share
space with the dross that often accompanies the few sought-after
masterpieces in donated collections. Huge sculptures that once
captured headlines lie dismantled and forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   The Cleveland Museum of Art stores a collection of 15th-century
Italian primitive paintings acquired in its early years. Once the
pride of the museum, they don't measure up to the museum's higher
standards of today. But chief curator Diane De Grazia says she will
not deaccession the paintings. They are ``an important part of the
history of the Cleveland Museum,'' she explains. Recently, she was
on the verge of deaccessioning another early acquisition, a
portrait she felt was not good enough to ever go on view. Then she
discovered that it depicted one of the museum's founders. That
stayed, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any museum has a number of paintings that move out of the
shadow into the light, and out of the light into the shadow,'' says
d'Harnoncourt. Her museum is one of several in the country to have
in storage works originally attributed to Rembrandt but discredited
a decade ago by a group of scholars whose scorched-earth survey
nearly halved the existing number of authentic works by the Dutch
master.
</P>
<P>
   Then, a few years ago, museum storerooms began making room for
casualties of a similar scrutiny from the works of Goya. Worst hit
was the Metropolitan Museum, which was told that only seven of the
sixteen works in its collection were indeed by the 18th-century
Spaniard.
</P>
<P>
   New scholarship can mean good news, too. Among the works to have
gone on permanent view in Philadelphia recently is a Fra Angelico
painting that's been in and out of the storeroom several times as
scholars debated its authenticity. Now the work seems to have been
absolutely confirmed as a Fra Angelico.
</P>
<P>
   At the Virginia Museum of Fine Art, a painting by Watteau called
``The Ogler'' had been in and out of favor with scholars for years,
``until subsequent scholarship triumphantly restored it to the
gallery,'' says associate director for collections management,
Kathleen Schrader.
</P>
<P>
   The most embarrassing section in any museum storeroom is the one
that houses the out-and-out fakes _ works that no amount of
scholarship will ever rehabilitate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every museum department has 10 or so fakes,'' says Thomas
Hoving, former director of the Met and now a regular columnist for
an art Web site. ``If you have a strong case, you can usually get
your money back from the dealer who sold you the fake, but you keep
it _ to prevent it being sold to someone else, but mostly to remind
you not to make the same mistake twice.''
</P>
<P>
   While the National Gallery of Art's board of trustees adopted a
policy many years ago to not deaccession works in its collection
(except for duplicate prints), other museums are free to lighten
the load in their storerooms by selling off works at auction. But
museums are both acquisitive and conservationist by nature, says De
Grazia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike what my mother taught me about food _ when in doubt
throw it out _ with museums it's usually, when in doubt, keep it,''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   So as long as today's dubious attribution continues to be
tomorrow's potential Rubens, deaccessioning will remain a museum's
last resort. Besides, museum officials argue, a reserve of
high-quality objects is useful for filling in gaps when works from
the permanent collection are put on exhibition or lent to other
museums. Still other works of art are kept as ``study material'' _
available to scholars, though unlikely to ever be exhibited.
</P>
<P>
   As Hoving puts is, ``Too much Wedgwood on view is a cure for
insomnia.'' National Gallery of Art director Earl ``Rusty'' Powell
III, who says ``the issue of actually looking and seeing'' is not
necessarily linked to available space, recalls a remark by Henry
Adams: ``The eye sees a profusion of details, which it regrets.''
And regret is the last thing museums want their public to feel.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Two minutes after I'm shown into my panelled room at the luxe
Lanesborough Hotel in London, where even the bathtub and toilet
have mahogany accents and the rugs are set flush into the parquet
floor, the doorbell rings and I meet my butler. Dark suit, pearl
gray striped tie, warm smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``My name is Christopher,'' he says pleasantly. ``May I unpack
for you?''
</P>
<P>
   Uh-oh. I blush to think of anyone looking in my suitcase, not
least a butler who, I suppose, has unpacked at some of Britain's
stateliest homes. Inside are no ball gowns, no black satin teddies.
Instead images of my faded blue jeans, turtlenecks and sensible
walking shoes pass before my eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mmm, thanks,'' I mumble. ``I think I can manage myself.'' I'm
already having trouble dealing with this butler concept.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher is obviously used to diffident Americans who aren't
up to being buttled. ``Here is your stationery,'' he moves on
pleasantly, pointing to some sheets of letterhead on the desk
printed: In residence, Joan Scobey. They sit next to business cards
with my private Lanesborough telephone and fax numbers. The fax
machine is hidden in a desk drawer, and Christopher shows me how it
works, along with an entertainment system tucked into a period
armoire.
</P>
<P>
   Last in my butler tutorial is the intricate panel of bedside
buttons that are control central for lights, temperature and a
variety of other earthly desires, including Privacy _ aka ``Do Not
Disturb.'' The most important button _ Butler _ seems to be
everywhere. There is hardly a corner of my bedroom or bathroom from
which I can't summon Christopher.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher is small and French. He was just promoted from room
service, and already knows discretion.
</P>
<P>
   ``So who's at the hotel now?'' I ask.
</P>
<P>
   ``Businessmen,'' he answers smoothly. ``Entertainment people
love it. A gentleman from the Middle East is in the Royal Suite.''
That's as far as Christopher goes. But the staff still talks about
the time Madonna stayed in the Royal Suite and had the dining room
lined with mirrors and packed with fitness equipment. From her
balcony overlooking Buckingham Palace she even bestowed royal waves
on her fans below.
</P>
<P>
   After I had booked my room, I received the hotel's Guest Profile
form. It requested my choice of drinks for the bar, morning
newspapers and preferred mode of transportation (Did I want to be
picked up at the airport in the Jaguar or the Bentley?), as well as
my favorite music. I checked Jazz/Blues. Christopher was waiting
with ``Still Got the Blues,'' ``Hooked on Big Bands,'' ``Duke
Ellington'' and a long list of CDs from which I added ``The
Complete Beatles'' and Handel's ``Water Music.''
</P>
<P>
   The bar comes complete with a bucket of ice, tongs at the ready,
crystal decanters holding Scotch, gin and vodka, and six
Bordeaux-shaped bottles of Sparkling Blenheim mineral water. I'm
ready to settle into the leather sofa with a drink, kick back with
``Abbey Road,'' delve into the bowl of dates and strawberries _ and
contemplate life with a butler.
</P>
<P>
   Let's face it. I feel woefully inadequate for this
upstairs/downstairs scene. There's not only the matter of
butler-worthy clothes, but I'm not even up to speed on the business
amenities. Sure, I've stayed in hotel rooms with faxes before, but
never with anyone taking such a correct interest in my well-being.
</P>
<P>
   At the touch of the Butler button, Christopher appears in less
than a minute. Lanesborough butlers are trained to respond to their
discreet beepers within two minutes; if they don't, the call is
forwarded to another station and the butler team goes into code
blue alert.
</P>
<P>
   ``Christopher, I'd like to ask a friend to stop by for drinks
later.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, Mrs. Scobey. I'll organize it.'' Christopher comes
from Epernay, so he knows a thing or two about champagne. I leave
everything to him.
</P>
<P>
   Lanesborough butlers are chosen for their aplomb and cool, I
later learn from Robert, the head butler. Calm, quick thinking and
a congenial personality are far more important than training.
Anthony Hopkins followed Robert around to pick up pointers for his
role in ``The Remains of the Day.'' Lanesborough butlers are not,
however, in the starchy Jeeves or John Gielgud tradition. They are
friendly, humorous, easy-mannered _ and completely correct.
</P>
<P>
   They also know when you're in your room and when you're not.
There are no hidden cameras to reveal exactly what you're doing and
where, but it's hard to escape the unnerving notion that Big Butler
is watching. Robert showed me how it's done. Sophisticated
computers register the status of motion detectors and sensors for
lights, television and air-conditioning in every room. If you
forget to turn off your Privacy button when you leave, and there's
no movement in your room for twenty minutes, the lights go out and
the staff feels free to enter.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to never disturb a guest. That works fine, unless
you happen to be quietly reading or soaking in a bubble bath and
find that the room suddenly goes dark, or that your butler has come
in to check the bar. (A regal wave of your hand will turn the
lights on at once; your butler won't blink an eye.)
</P>
<P>
   Walking dogs, buying clothes, planning menus and choosing wines,
even a 3 a.m. call to rehang a picture _ it's all in the life of a
Lanesborough butler. The Christophers, Sergios and Susans will do
just about anything that's asked of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``One butler had to roll an Indian prince's turban on his head,
which took hours,'' said Robert. ``Another had to find a
thoroughbred horse for a guest to buy _ lucky one of our butlers
had been a horse breeder. Another with an economic degree wrote a
speech for a Thai banker, then trained him to give it.''
</P>
<P>
   I had far less taxing needs, and they were usually anticipated
(another mark of a good butler). With Christopher, I never had to
put my boots out. Every evening he spirited them away and returned
them polished to a fine patina and stuffed with tissue paper. One
day, a button on my jacket came loose. Of course, I could sew it on
myself, but hey, if there's a butler in your life, you might as
well let him buttle. I was beginning to get the hang of this.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of my stay I felt confident enough to ask for help
with some research. Richard happened to be on call at the time.
(You didn't think the same butler attends to you round the clock,
did you? You can enjoy three of them a day.) I was trying to find
the name of a particular restaurant a friend told me about. All I
knew was that there were no prices on the menu and you pay what you
think the meal is worth. It sounded like fun, but the concierge had
never heard of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give me a couple of hours,'' said Richard. Two hours later
there was a note on my desk with the name, address, tube station,
even the bus route.
</P>
<P>
   So that's the story. And when I leave for the airport, I hope
there'll be two of us going back to the States. Christopher and me.
</P>
<P>
   If you long to be pampered at The Lanesborough, singles start at
about $380 and doubles about $510, suites begin around $780, and
the Royal Suite, with three bedrooms for your entourage, is about
$6,000. The butler comes for free. Call 800-999-1828.

PERSONAL HEALTH: SHIELDING THE BODY FROM ALLERGIC REACTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JANE E. BRODY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Brown University student who knew she was allergic to peanuts
died after dining on chili that, unbeknown to her, had been
thickened with peanut butter. A friend faces the same risk if she
inadvertently eats celery. A Minnesota school boy who had been
playing in a field with friends barely survived being stung by
angry yellow jackets. A Pennsylvania man with a known allergy to
bee stings died while snorkeling after being stung by jellyfish.
And a New York health care worker had to find a new career after a
near-fatal reaction to the latex in surgical gloves and medical
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   All are or were among millions of Americans at risk of
developing an anaphylactic reaction, an extreme and potentially
fatal allergic response. The immune system evolved to protect
people from foreign organisms that could threaten their health and
life.
</P>
<P>
   In ordinary allergies, the immune system reacts to innocent
substances like pollen, dust mites or cat dander grains as if they
were foreign invaders. But if allergies are a sign the immune
system has run amok, anaphylaxis resembles a wildly out-of-control
immunological riot. It is a systemic reaction that can kill within
minutes by shutting off the airways or causing a precipitous drop
in blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Allergic symptoms that can lead to anaphylaxis include itching,
hives, swelling of the throat, asthma, a drop in blood pressure,
irregular heart rhythm, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps and loss
of consciousness. If the reaction is not halted with epinephrine
(adrenaline) and emergency treatment, it can be lethal.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, several hundred people succumb to anaphylactic
attacks, the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology
says, because they fail to use epinephrine as a first-aid measure
or fail to use it soon enough. Further deaths result when victims
fail to seek professional medical help after using epinephrine,
which suppresses the attack for only about 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 1 percent to 2 percent of the population risks
anaphylaxis from foods or insect stings alone. Others may be
affected by penicillin or sulfa drugs, fish and shellfish, milk,
soy, wheat, eggs or sulfites used as preservatives. And some
experts say that as many as 62 million people could be at risk.
</P>
<P>
   While children often outgrow allergies to milk, soy and eggs,
allergic reactions to peanuts, tree nuts and shellfish tend to be
lifelong. People with asthma, those who are highly allergic or who
suffered a previous anaphylactic attack are especially vulnerable
to future anaphylaxis.
</P>
<P>
   Step One: Prevent Exposure
</P>
<P>
   Avoiding the offending substance is by far the best way to cope
with a possible anaphylactic attack. Anaphylactic reactions don't
result from a first-time exposure, and most people experience a
warning reaction that clues them in to their vulnerability. After
eating a few walnuts, for example, their mouths may feel itchy and
their throats a little tight. Or after being stung by a bee or wasp
they may develop a more widespread reaction than just local
swelling, pain or itchiness. Such reactions are warnings that the
next exposure could be lethal.
</P>
<P>
   People with serious food allergies must be extremely careful
about what they eat. They must learn all the different names or
descriptors applied to the food to which they are sensitive and
must check labels on packaged foods to be sure that food was not
included in any form. Eating out can be very risky. While they may
ask the food server if the dish they are considering contains nuts,
a nut oil might have been used in preparing it and that may not be
mentioned. Some people are so sensitive that simply inhaling
invisible airborne particles from someone else's meal or snack
could precipitate an attack, which is why some airlines have
decided to stop serving peanuts.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   People who have experienced an allergic reaction to the venom
from an insect sting have a 30 percent to 60 percent chance of
suffering a similar or worse reaction the next time they are stung.
Since insect stings are likely to occur when a person is far from
medical care, avoiding being stung is especially critical. This
means wearing protective light-colored clothing during activities
that could expose them to stinging insects, wearing shoes outdoors,
keeping food and garbage covered and letting someone else dump the
garbage, and not using scented detergent, shampoo, conditioner,
hairspray, body lotion, lipstick or any cologne. It may also be
advisable to stay out of waters that harbor jellyfish because there
is sometimes a cross-reaction between the stings of jellyfish and
insects.
</P>
<P>
   For those who know they are allergic to insect stings,
immunotherapy through injections of tiny doses of the offending
venom is now possible and up to 97 percent effective. Immunotherapy
should be administered only by a board-certified allergist with
proper emergency equipment at hand.
</P>
<P>
   Half a million people each year experience an allergic reaction
to medications administered in hospitals, and many more cases occur
outside hospitals. Penicillin and its derivatives are the main
culprits, accounting for as many as three-fourths of the documented
deaths from anaphylaxis in the United States and occurring mostly
in people with no history of allergic reactions to penicillin. They
may have become sensitized by previous treatment or even by eating
meat or poultry from animals that had been treated with
antibiotics. Other drugs that can cause anaphylaxis include sulfa
drugs, allopurinol, medications for seizures and abnormal heart
rhythms, muscle relaxants and even nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs like aspirin and ibuprofen. Sometimes vaccines,
antihypertensive drugs, insulin, blood products and dyes used in
X-ray examinations cause anaphylaxis.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who experiences an allergic reaction to a medication
should find out what drug was the likely cause and what class of
medications it belongs to because other drugs in that class may
have the same effect. Then they must be sure to tell every medical
and dental practitioner about their drug allergy. They would also
be wise always to wear a medical identification bracelet to inform
medical personnel of their allergy if they are unable to
communicate.
</P>
<P>
   Latex allergy has skyrocketed with the increased use of
protective gloves by members of the health professions and possibly
with the wider use of condoms and dental dams to prevent
transmission of AIDS and hepatitis. While repeated professional
exposure is the most common precipitant of latex anaphylaxis,
sometimes patients who have had multiple operations are also at
risk. To reduce the chance of becoming sensitized to latex, buy
lined gloves for household chores and avoid using powder or
cornstarch on rubber gloves or applying an oil-based hand lotion.
Wear a medical identification bracelet and inform all medical and
dental personnel before treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Lifesaving Treatment
</P>
<P>
   Epinephrine should be injected at the very first inkling of a
severe allergic reaction, because anaphylaxis can kill in minutes.
Taking an antihistamine is not adequate to stem a potential
anaphylactic attack, and waiting until you are sure the attack is
life-threatening can mean waiting until it is too late. Thus,
everyone who is at risk of anaphylaxis should carry a ready-to-use
syringe of epinephrine at all times (or, in the case of a small
child, it should always be carried by an accompanying caretaker,
teacher or counselor). An allergic person's family members, friends
and, in the case of children, teachers and caretakers should know
how and when to administer it.
</P>
<P>
   There are two versions of self-injectable epinephrine; both
require a doctor's prescription. The Epi-Pen and Epi-Pen Jr. (for
children weighing 22 to 45 pounds) is a spring-loaded auto-injector
that, when placed against the outer thigh, even through clothing,
injects a dose of epinephrine. Each pen contains one dose. Epi-Pens
are made by Dey Laboratories in Napa, Calif. The second device,
Ana-Kit by Bayer Laboratories in Spokane, Wash., is a preloaded
syringe that can deliver two injections.
</P>
<P>
   Epinephrine counters anaphylaxis by relaxing respiratory
muscles, constricting blood vessels, stimulating the heart and
reducing swelling. Each dose lasts only 10 to 20 minutes. It is a
first-aid measure only, not a replacement for professional medical
care, which should be obtained on an emergency basis. As many as
one-quarter of people who experience anaphylaxis will have a
recurrence of life-threatening symptoms within hours of the first
attack. Thus, further treatment with antihistamines and other
medications is often necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Side effects of epinephrine include palpitations, rapid
heartbeat, sweating, nausea and vomiting and respiratory
difficulty. People with cardiac arrhythmias should consult their
doctors about when to use epinephrine.

 &HT;    Reissued novels offer insight into Civil War
 &HT;    By Scott Eyman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. - Two fascinating reissues by nearly
forgotten writers, both published by the University of Alabama,
have arrived. The first, ``The Battle-ground'' is a novel of the
Civil War by Ellen Glasgow, a writer who spent her life (1873-1945)
in Richmond, Virginia. She was a good friend of Marjorie Kinnan
Rawlings, among others, and won the Pulitzer Prize for ``In This
Our Life,''1941.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Battle-ground ``is the first in a reprint series called
Classics of Civil War Fiction. The book was originally published in
1902, when the ground was still thick with people who remembered
the Civil War very well indeed. It's realistic on the surface,
romantic underneath, a clear precursor of Stark Young's ``So Red
the Rose,'' as well as Margaret Mitchell's ``Gone With the Wind.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Mitchell's famous ending is just a harsher
transposition of Glasgow's: ```We will begin again,' she said, `and
this time, my dear, we will begin together.'''
</P>
<P>
   In the same series is Upton Sinclair's ``Manassas `` written in
1904, two years before Sinclair wrote ``The Jungle,'' the book by
which he is still remembered. Sinclair was as much a reformer as a
novelist and invariably wrote out of a didactic impulse;
``Manassas'' is no exception.
</P>
<P>
   It follows Allan Montague, a young Southerner who moves to
Boston with his father, where he meets Levi Coffin, the founder of
the Underground Railroad. Coffin takes him to hear a speech by
Frederick Douglass, who provides Montague with a Pauline moment.
</P>
<P>
   Allan goes back to the South to free slaves and eventually finds
himself at the battle of Manassas.
</P>
<P>
   There's something slightly kitschy about Sinclair _ his
fictional heroes are always meeting famous people, in the manner of
docudramas or Herman Wouk _ but he was a passionate man, and
``Manassas'' retains a surprising amount of interest, mainly
because it's rigorously unsentimental _ at one point, a helpless
old woman is butchered.
</P>
<P>
   Both these books are $19.95 and worth it.
</P>
<P>
   Quote Unquote. . .
</P>
<P>
   ``A certain ruthlessness and a sense of alienation from society
is as essential to creative writing as it is to armed robbery. The
strong-armer isn't out merely to turn a fast buck any more than the
poet is out solely to see his name on the cover of a book, whatever
satisfaction that event may afford him. What both need most deeply
is to get even.''

 &HT;    A delightful time lollygagging around the shores of Sarasota Bay
 &HT;    By Mary Thurwachter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARASOTA, Fla. _ It would have been easy to drift off for a
late-afternoon rocking-chair nap under the mango, oak and palm
trees at The Cypress.
</P>
<P>
   But then we would have missed happy hour at the small
bed-and-breakfast overlooking Sarasota Bay.
</P>
<P>
   The two-story, tin-roofed house is tucked between two
condominium complexes.
</P>
<P>
   We had picked out a chair, begun to rock and take count of the
few dozen sailboats docked in the bay. There was a wisp of a breeze
to keep us cool.
</P>
<P>
   One of the owners, Robert Belott, a former commercial
photographer in New York, appeared with a drink menu.
</P>
<P>
   The mango margarita sounded tempting, but we opted for a Cypress
Squeeze (citrus juices _ mostly orange _ vodka and a slice of
orange or lime).
</P>
<P>
   The other owners _ Robert's wife, Nina, and their friend Vicky
Hadley, former New Jersey teachers, appeared minutes later with
lively conversation _ and a couple of Robert's scrumptious homemade
pizzas.
</P>
<P>
   It was a delightful afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Hadley said the three quit their jobs, pooled resources and
bought the house in 1995. They spent a year and a half fixing it
up, adding a deck and transforming it into a bed-and-breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take us long to determine that Robert has a good time
in the kitchen. His drinks were inspired, his pizzas (mozzarella
and tomato and garlic and pepperoni) were among the best we've
tasted, and his full-course breakfast (juice, coffee, fruit salad,
mango/cranberry muffins and mushroom and tomato omelets) were good
enough to get him a job at any fine restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   The owners' good taste in art and antiques was evident in every
room. There was an old piano and an interesting collection
ofstringed instruments and a four-seater ice cream table on the
cafe sun porch. Beautiful c to serve breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   The guest rooms are themed to elicit the charm of a bygone era.
The Martha Rose Suite has a balcony with a view of the gulf, French
mansion bed, plantation armoire, sitting area with loveseat and
Corinthian marble coffee table.
</P>
<P>
   The Essie Leigh Key West Room has a front porch facing the bay,
separate entrance on the side of the inn, pewter and brass bed,
Spanish pine side tables and antique oak chest.
</P>
<P>
   The two-bedroom Elizabeth Brittany Suite has a Victorian theme
with antique brass bed and oak high-back bed, rare bird's-eye maple
armoire, 19th century oak secretary, empire marble top dresser and
1800s burled walnut roll-top desk.
</P>
<P>
   We stayed in Kathryn's Room, which has a view of the gardens in
back of the house. The room was furnished with a Ralph Lauren
high-back wicker bed and side tables, oak vanity sink and Art Deco
mirror, sitting area and private bathroom with a Jacuzzi tub.
</P>
<P>
   After breakfast, we spent a few hours a block away at The Marie
Selby Botanical Gardens, which has more than 20,000 colorful
plants, many collected in the wild on scientific expeditions to
tropical rain forests. We especially enjoyed seeing the thousands
of orchids.
</P>
<P>
   We also walked up Palm Avenue, a block away, to check out the
art galleries, antique stores, and curiosity shops in the historic
arts and theater district.
</P>
<P>
   Other nearby attractions include the Mote Marine Aquarium, the
Sarasota Jungle Gardens, the John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art,
the Asolo Theater Company, the Van Wetzel Performing Arts Hall and
shopping at St. Armands Circle.
</P>
<P>
   Michael's waterfront restaurant, less than a mile from the inn,
serves up spicy Maryland-style crab cakes, garlic mashed potatoes
and a very good seafood gumbo.

&HT;     POSTCARDS HAVE A LONG HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By FRANCES INGRAHAM HEINS  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Long before the digital camera and other fast
means of sending images, there were postcards.
</P>
<P>
   Billions of postal cards were printed, with a broad appeal,
depicting global landmarks, holiday themes and vacation
destinations.
</P>
<P>
   For travelers who buy them to keep rather than send, postcards
continue to be the most popular souvenirs. Deltiology is the formal
name for postcard-collecting.
</P>
<P>
   The first American postcard depicted the main building of the
Inter-State Industrial Exposition in Chicago in 1873. It was later
sold as a souvenir in 1893 at the Columbian Exposition in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Postcards began as illustrations on government-printed postal
cards (with an imprinted 1 cent stamp) and privately printed
souvenir cards (a 2-cent stamp was applied).
</P>
<P>
   By 1898, American printers began making the ``private mailing
card.'' Writing was not allowed on the address side of the card.
Some printers left a wider border on the side or bottom of the
picture side so a short message could be added.
</P>
<P>
   The term postcard replaced private mailing card in 1901.
Individuals began having black-and-white photos printed on paper
with postcard backs, but writing was still not permitted on the
address side until the printed vertical line down the middle of the
address side was added in March 1907. The address went on the right
side and the message on the left side of the line.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the early cards were printed in Germany, where
lithographic processes were ahead of America's. But with World War
I, postcards came mainly from England and the United States.
</P>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When pushing a modern jet fighter through its
paces, being in a tight squeeze can be a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   Many of today's military aircraft accelerate so quickly and turn
so rapidly that they meet or exceed the physical limits of their
pilots. A new generation of higher-performance jets soon to join
air forces around the world promises to worsen the problem, making
it even harder for the human component of these weapon systems to
keep up with the mechanical.
</P>
<P>
   The human body, for all its extraordinary capabilities, is just
not made to take six, eight or 12 times the normal force of
gravity. Its responses to this assault, from impaired vision to
loss of consciousness, can prove fatal if they occur in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers working with the world's leading air forces are
trying to develop better countermeasures to the gravitational
acceleration, or so-called G forces, that can knock out a pilot
within seconds of a tight turn at high speed. These acceleration or
deceleration forces, expressed as multiples of gravity, or Gs,
force blood from the upper part of the body _ including the brain _
to the legs and feet, and also impair breathing.
</P>
<P>
   Not only are scientists working on improved versions of
traditional gravity-fighting gear, like air-inflatable pressure
pants or anti-G suits that push blood back up toward the head, but
some are also testing a radically different flight suit that
simulates immersing the body in water to counteract acceleration
forces. Swiss developers of the new suit, called Libelle, say
channels of fluids encased in the garment help it simulate the
protective effect enjoyed by a fetus floating a womb.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Fred Buick, a physiologist with the Canadian Defense
Ministry who recently helped develop a new anti-G system for his
nation's pilots, said the new work was resulting in the first major
upgrade in gravity protection since World War II. ``Most of the
suits in use now are just minor variations of what they developed
then,'' Buick said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was some truly pioneering research in the effects of
acceleration and G-forces on pilots, and what to do about it, 50
and 60 years ago,'' he said, ``but there was no way to practically
apply many of these ideas. Now we have the technology to implement
some of these designs.''
</P>
<P>
   Many experts say research in protection from gravitational
forces still lags far behind the development of new,
super-maneuverable aircraft like the American F-22 Raptor, the
multinational Eurofighter Typhoon, the Rafale in France and the
Swedish Gripen. These fighters are so fast and nimble that
improperly protected pilots could lose consciousness in a dogfight
or evasive maneuver before any of the usual warning signs of
trouble appear, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Pilots first complained about the effects of gravitational
acceleration during World War I when some suffered vision
impairment and occasional loss of consciousness when pulling out of
dives. It did not become a major problem until World War II, when
planes became sturdy and powerful enough to briefly subject pilots
to acceleration forces that built up to the equivalent of 6 to 8
times normal gravity.
</P>
<P>
   If a force of four to six Gs is sustained for more than a few
seconds, blood pressure in the head drops rapidly, starving the
brain and initially impairing vision. Under these conditions,
pilots first experience loss of color vision, or gray-out, then
narrowing tunnel vision followed by blackout. Tests show that
blackouts can last 15 to 20 seconds and it can take a pilot another
30 seconds to a couple of minutes to recover from an episode of
this gravity-induced loss of consciousness, termed G-LOC. In a
battle or when flying low to the ground, such episodes can be
fatal.
</P>
<P>
   The rate at which acceleration increases also plays a critical
role in tolerating the effects of G forces. If the so-called
``G-onset'' is gradual, the pilot will notice early symptoms, like
impaired vision, and can break off a dangerous maneuver or engage
countermeasures. But many of today's fighters are so quick that
they can accelerate to 12 Gs in less than a second, preventing
pilots from sensing any warning signs before blackout.
</P>
<P>
   The groundwork for countering these gravitational forces was
laid during World War II, when researchers found that the downward
rush of blood could be alleviated with special pants that applied
pressure to the abdomen and legs to keep blood in the head and
upper body.
</P>
<P>
   The first workable anti-G suit, successfully tested in 1941, was
developed by a Canadian team led by Dr. Wilbur R. Franks. The suit,
a set of overalls tightly laced to a pilot's body from his ankles
to the top of his chest, consisted of two layers of rubber with
water in between. Although cumbersome and impractical, the suit
protected a pilot from forces of six Gs or more when the downward
pressure on the water caused by acceleration created enough force
to counteract the downward rush of blood in the body.
</P>
<P>
   Franks then developed zippered pants with air-inflated bladders
to squeeze the stomach and legs, and that evolved into the first
production G-suit. Most current systems still use this approach,
with interconnected inflatable bladders powered by air pressure
generated from the plane and G-sensitive valves that apply and
release pressure when needed.
</P>
<P>
   Another defense against G forces developed then and still used
now is a forced-breathing technique called the anti-G straining
maneuver. This tolerance-increasing technique, which can be
extremely tiring if used often, involves rapid breathing followed
by holding a breath for several seconds while simultaneously
tightening leg and stomach muscles.
</P>
<P>
   To ease the strain of this maneuver and to aid breathing,
researchers developed a technique called positive pressure
breathing, which involves forcing pressurized air into a pilot's
lungs through a face mask. While the method improved G-tolerance,
it also could lead to lung damage through overinflation. To
counteract this, the U.S. Air Force introduced a system called
Combat Edge in the early 1990s. This combines positive pressure
breathing with a counterpressure vest to protect the chest.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force is testing a new Advanced Technology Anti-G Suit,
or Atags, that it expects will replace the current suit, which uses
inflatable bladders and stretch fabric. Atags, which is expected to
be used with the new F-22 fighter, surrounds the legs and covers
the entire lower body in one, air-pumped garment. Research
indicates these uniform-pressure pants coupled with the Combat Edge
system increase crew high-G endurance by 350 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Don Diesel of the Air Force, who evaluates G-suit
technology for the Air Expeditionary Force Battlelab at Mountain
Home Air Force Base in Idaho, said G-suits combined with Combat
Edge had proved highly effective in protecting pilots. But he said
these pneumatic systems, with their valves, pumps and switches,
added complexity and weight to the aircraft. ``It would be good to
have something simpler that worked as well or better,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One such advance could be the Libelle suit, being developed by
Life Support Systems, a Swiss company. The single-piece, full-body
suit, which has been tested by the Swiss and German air forces and
underwent U.S. Air Force trials this summer in Texas and
California, uses long tubes filled with fluid to combat high-G
acceleration forces.
</P>
<P>
   Andreas Reinhard, the physicist and former Swiss Air Force pilot
who invented the suit and has been developing it for 12 years, said
the Libelle worked using the same principles as a full-body water
suit _ only with most of the water removed. The suit is called
Libelle (pronounced lee-BELL-uh) after the German word for
dragonfly, the only animal that can withstand 30 Gs of lateral
force because its cardiac system is surrounded by a liquid-filled
sac.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like an unborn child immersed in liquid is protected from
stress, so is a pilot wearing this suit,'' Reinhard said. His first
prototype suit used 7 gallons of liquid sandwiched between two
layers of material to protect subjects in high-G centrifuge tests.
``The job of the last 10 years has been to reduce the liquid and
increase the efficiency and comfort of the suit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The latest Libelle looks like a tight, form-fitting wetsuit with
two tubes running from neck to ankle down the front and another two
down the back. Another set of tubes goes down the outside of each
arm, from shoulder to wrist. The tubes, which Reinhard calls liquid
muscles, have a diameter of about two inches at the top and taper
down to about one and a half inches at the bottom and are filled
with about a quart and a half of liquid.
</P>
<P>
   The other integral part of the double-skinned suit is the
material making up each layer between which the tubes run, he said.
Under a tough, nonstretching outer fabric of synthetic fiber is a
stretchable, waterproof membrane.
</P>
<P>
   Under high-G acceleration, hydrostatic forces increase the
pressure of the fluid at the bottom of the tubes, causing them to
swell and apply tension to the suit fabric, which tightens to
prevent the rush of blood to lower parts of the body. The
self-contained suit tenses and releases instantly in response to
G-forces and requires no external regulators or valves, Reinhard
said, and balances pressures at every point of the body just as
total water immersion would.
</P>
<P>
   ``The suit simulates what happens in water without all the
water,'' Reinhard said. Pilots testing the suit in centrifuges have
withstood 12 Gs of acceleration without a special breathing
apparatus like a Combat Edge because the whole body is protected,
he said. Subjects still use the anti-G breathing maneuver in high-G
situations, he said, but it is not as stressful as with
conventional anti-G suits and they can converse normally without
positive pressure breathing interfering.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Peter Demitry of the Air Force, the director of the Air
Combat Command's Human Systems Integration Division, who flew in a
Libelle suit this summer, said pilots did not feel the pressure
changes at high-G as much when wearing the new suit. ``You get into
kind of an equilibrium state, matching the pressures of the fluid
in the suit with the fluid in the body,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pilots also seem to be able to move their arms more easily in
the Libelle and report much less fatigue after flights, Demitry
said. ``But the big thing is that pilots can talk at eight or nine
Gs, which is difficult when using a positive pressure breathing
system,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force officials conducting the tests said much more research
on the Libelle suit was needed before they could recommend buying
it. ``But we are pleased, so far, with what the suit is doing,''
Demitry said.

<P>
   In a previous column, I told you how I had helped two younger
men pull an unconscious man from the shallow waters at Half Moon
Cay, a tiny island in the Bahamas.
</P>
<P>
   All of us had been cruising the Caribbean on the Holland America
Line ship Zaandam. We were spending the last day of the cruise,
Aug. 4, splashing and sunning on the pristine beach.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as we placed the man on the beach, his eyes opened and
he coughed up water. But his face was a deep purple, and his eyes
were fixed. A doctor and nurse, who also were fellow passengers,
quickly arrived and took over his treatment.
</P>
<P>
   My wife and I later watched as members of a first-aid team
removed the stricken man to the ship, which was anchored offshore.
His complexion had improved considerably after they got an oxygen
mask on his face.
</P>
<P>
   Many on the beach wondered if he would be OK. A number of us
watched for several hours to see if a helicopter would arrive to
remove the man to a hospital in Nassau, but one never arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Later, on returning to the ship, I was unsuccessful in attempts
to find out what had happened to the man. Ship personnel explained
that because of privacy regulations, they could not release any
personal information about a passenger. I found this understandable
but frustrating.
</P>
<P>
   The man was still on my mind as we disembarked the next morning
at Fort Lauderdale, Fla. I really hated leaving without knowing the
stranger's fate.
</P>
<P>
   Later, as Pat and I prepared to board our flight back home, we
saw the familiar faces of Zaandam passengers in line. Pat took the
window seat and I the middle one. I recognized the woman who took
the aisle seat as having been on the Zaandam.
</P>
<P>
   After a few remarks about our experiences on the ship, the woman
said, ``My husband was the man who nearly drowned yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   I was stunned. ``Where is he?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sitting behind you,'' she replied.
</P>
<P>
   I turned around and saw the familiar face of the man who had
appeared to be so near death 26 hours earlier: Myron J. Croft, 75,
of Wichita, Kan. I immediately noticed how the blue eyes that had
seemed so lifeless the day before now sparkled with life.
</P>
<P>
   Croft said he had been retired from the grocery business for
several years. I explained to Myron and his wife, Nelda, that I had
been one of the three men who had helped pull him from the water.
</P>
<P>
   As we chatted happily, a man sitting one seat away from Myron
introduced himself as the doctor who had ministered to him on the
beach. It was the first time that the Crofts had seen him since the
near-calamity. The doctor said he was a family physician from
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   It was a happy reunion of strangers brought together by a
near-tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   The Crofts had already met the two men who had done the heavy
lifting in the water. Ray Eldridge of Seattle had dropped by the
infirmary on returning to the ship. (I don't know why I didn't
think of doing that.) That evening, Chris Reichle, 44, of Lubbock
had visited them in their stateroom.
</P>
<P>
   I checked on Myron last Tuesday. He said he still had a little
water in his lungs, but his doctor in Wichita had assured him that
his body would absorb the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other than that, I'm feeling fine,'' he told me. ``The doctors
aren't sure what caused me to pass out in the water.''
</P>
<P>
   He remembered being suddenly stricken while playing in knee-deep
water with his 8-year-old granddaughter. He recalled falling face
forward into the sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I knew I was gone, I waved my hand,'' he recalled.
``That's the last thing I remember until they put me on the
stretcher'' on the beach.
</P>
<P>
   Myron said he considers himself a religious person who strives
to help others. (He helps support a boy from an impoverished family
in Bolivia and a girl from a poor family in Brazil.) He doesn't
think it was a mere coincidence that so many people were there to
help him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lord was watching over me that day,'' he said. ``He sent
me all the help I needed when I was in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lord was not ready to take me. And I was not ready to go.
He still has some plans for me.''

EVALUATING THE PERSONAL TRAINER'S TRAINING 
</HEADLINE>
   By LIZ NEPORENT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bob Esquire, president of the Esquire Fitness group, was working
out recently in a large New York City gym when he heard a loud pop.
``Everyone heard it,'' recalls Esquire. ``We all turned around to
see what it was.'' The pop was the sound of a woman's inner thigh
muscles ripping, the result of her personal trainer's overzealous
efforts to stretch her out.
</P>
<P>
   Esquire, whose company does personal training and fitness
consulting, said the trainer had recently taken a weekend
stretching workshop but had scant hands-on experience. ``This is a
perfect example of someone who took a little information but did
not have the proper knowledge or depth of experience to apply the
skills,'' Esquire said. (The injured client sued both the trainer
and the club; the suit was settled out of court, Esquire said.)
</P>
<P>
   Although more than 4 million Americans use personal trainers,
there are few standards governing the more than 66,000 people who
make a living buffing biceps and toning pecs. The term is not
legally defined and states do not require certification, minimum
training or licensing. Anyone who can hoist a dumbbell and print a
business card on a home computer can call him or herself a personal
trainer.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William Kraemer, director of the human performance
laboratory at Ball State University in Muncie, Ind., said few
people adequately screen their personal trainers. ``And even when
they do,'' he said, ``it is difficult to know what to assess.''
Some 250 organizations certify fitness professionals, but it is not
always easy to know how rigorous their standards are.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not all certifications are created equal,'' said Kevin Steele,
vice president for health services and corporate accounts at 24
Hour Fitness, a national chain of health clubs.
</P>
<P>
   For example, while some certifications require individuals to
take a stringent written and practical exam, others require little
more than a signature on a check to earn a passing grade. ``The
best certifications are sponsored by nonprofit organizations made
up of a professional membership,'' advised Kraemer. ``That means
they're certifying more for professional development and to improve
the quality of the industry than to enhance their bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   He says that the certification exam should also be nationally
recognized and standardized and that a four-year college degree
should be required.
</P>
<P>
   Most experts agree that the American College of Sports Medicine,
the American Council on Exercise and the National Strength and
Conditioning Association _ the so-called big three _ are the
certifications consumers should look for.
</P>
<P>
   ``A trainer must demonstrate at least a grasp of the basics in
order to pass them,'' said Esquire, who is a member of the faculty
advisory board of the American Council on Exercise.
</P>
<P>
   The American College of Sports Medicine offers several
certifications. The health fitness instructor exam is geared toward
personal trainers and emphasizes cardiovascular exercise and health
risk factor assessment but not weight training. The American
Council on Exercise certifies trainers and class instructors. Its
personal trainer exams are widely regarded as less technical, but
more practical, than the health fitness instructor exam. Esquire
said the National Strength and Conditioning Association's
certification in strength and conditioning is considered the gold
standard. It requires an in-depth knowledge of human anatomy,
physiology and weight training technique.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Germano, executive director of the American Council on
Exercise, cautioned that trainers should not dispense health or
medical advice. ``The personal trainer's role is to help clients
with their exercise programs,'' Germano said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the American Council on Exercise has a lifestyle and
weight management certification, Germano said, it is not a license
to prescribe or even recommend treatments, especially nutritional
supplements.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond certification, says Kraemer, a former executive director
of the National Strength and Conditioning Association, consumers
should look for a trainer with a four-year degree in an exercise
science discipline like physical education, exercise physiology or
kinesiology, the study of how muscles move.

WE HAVE SEEN THE REAL AL, AND HE IS ...
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By BILL THOMPSON 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now we know why Al Gore doesn't want to return a significant
portion of the federal budget surplus to the taxpayers: He wants to
spend it all on government programs that he claims will solve
virtually every problem known to humanity.
</P>
<P>
   Gore could add a few songs to that speech he delivered at the
Democratic National Convention the other night and take it to
Broadway as a revival of ``Promises, Promises.''
</P>
<P>
   Rarely has a politician succeeded in promising so much to so
many in a speech that took less than 51 minutes. It might have
taken longer if the vice president had bothered to take a breath
between promises or paused to savor the delegates' admiring chants:
``Go, Al, go!''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's old running mate, Bill Clinton, has officially been
dethroned as the promise king of American politics. Clinton can't
talk fast enough to jam more than three dozen policy proposals _
The Associated Press counted, I didn't _ into such a constricted
block of time.
</P>
<P>
   Gore sounded like Clinton on fast-forward. At moments when the
president would have used up precious time chewing his lower lip
and/or conjuring up an occasional lump in his throat, the Slick
One's would-be successor opted to step on the accelerator and drive
home a few extra pledges of government intervention in the daily
business of the people.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton-Gore crowd likes to chide George W. Bush and the
Republicans for wanting to ``spend'' the surplus on tax cuts for
all Americans _ even though they must know full well that returning
money to the people who handed it over the government in the first
place is not ``spending.''
</P>
<P>
   No, ``spending'' is what Gore has in mind for virtually every
dollar that the government collects from the taxpayers. He says he
wants to use the surplus to pay down the debt, but that's a ruse _
once the money is committed to governmental spending programs, it
will be easy enough to say, ``Oops, nothing left for debt
reduction.''
</P>
<P>
   If you cut taxes _ if you don't snatch the money out of
taxpayers' wallets to begin with _ then the compulsive spenders in
Washington won't get the chance to fritter it away.
</P>
<P>
   Gore paid lip service to the idea of tax reduction by graciously
offering ``targeted'' tax cuts _ which means that certain
politically favored groups and individuals will get to keep small
portions of their hard-earned dough but can only spend the money
for purposes that Gore considers worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   The targeted tax cut is not a new idea, of course. Democrats
have been running this scam for a long time because it allows them
to claim that they support tax relief when in fact they support no
such thing.
</P>
<P>
   Come to think of it, almost none of the ideas thrown at the wall
by Gore in his speech were new. He didn't sound much different from
George McGovern, Hubert Humphrey or Michael Dukakis, to name a few
liberal losers of yesteryear.
</P>
<P>
   The purported premise of the Clinton-Gore administration was
that Bill and Al were ``new Democrats'' who renounced the tired old
liberal dogma that voters rejected in five of the six presidential
elections preceding Clinton's first win in 1992. It wasn't so long
ago that Clinton stood before the American people and declared:
``The era of big government is over.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet Clinton's vice president _ the very same vice president
who claimed a few years back that he had ``reinvented government''
_ now strides to the podium to accept his party's presidential
nomination and calls for a veritable avalanche of new government
programs.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic spinmeisters had predicted that their nominee's
convention speech would showcase the ``real'' Gore _ as opposed,
presumably, to those ever-evolving versions of the ``real'' Gore
that had been showcased in other venues. If the latest Al is really
Al, then we finally know who and what he is: an old-time liberal
Democrat who believes that the American people are helpless victims
yearning to be rescued by the government.
</P>
<P>
   And you thought liberalism was extinct.

<P>
   In a stunning new result from what has become one of the largest
agricultural experiments ever, thousands of rice farmers in China
have doubled the yields of their most valuable crop and nearly
eliminated its most devastating disease _ without using chemical
treatments or spending a single extra penny.
</P>
<P>
   Under the direction of an international team of scientists,
farmers in China's Yunnan Province implemented a simple change in
their rice paddies. Instead of planting the large stands of a
single type of rice, as they typically have done, the farmers
planted a mixture of two different rices. With this one change,
growers were able to radically restrict the incidence of rice blast
_ the most important disease of this most important staple in the
world. Within just two years, farmers were able to abandon the
chemical fungicides previously widely used to fight the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't surprised that the system worked but I was surprised
that it worked so well,'' said Dr. Christopher Mundt, population
biologist at Oregon State University and the one American-based
author on the study, which was published in the current edition of
the journal Nature. ``I'm excited about the possibilities. There is
a lot of potential even beyond rice.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Youyong Zhu, plant pathologist at Yunnan Agricultural
University, heads the mostly China-based research team whose study
now covers 100,000 acres and involves tens of thousands of farmers.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, many researchers have long argued that planting a
diversity of crops should lead to benefits like greater
productivity and the suppression of disease, compared with single
variety plantings known as monocultures. Yet the use of diversity
and other ecologically based cures for agricultural ills have
tended to be viewed as more politically correct than economically
viable. Scientists say that this latest study shows that such
environmentally friendly methods can be highly effective, even more
effective, in this case, than standard chemical pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the results ``very significant,'' Dr. Alison Power,
agricultural ecologist at Cornell University, said, ``People have
said that these kinds of ecological approaches wouldn't work on a
commercial scale. This is a huge scale.'' She added, ``We have more
alternatives that are really viable than we often think about or
include in our arsenal of possibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Those studying natural ecosystems also welcomed the new work,
saying it closely paralleled findings for the role of species
diversity in reducing the incidence of disease in the wild.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an important study,'' said Dr. David Tilman, ecologist at
the University of Minnesota. ``It's going to raise a great deal of
interest.''
</P>
<P>
   The scientific hypothesis behind the study, the latest in a
growing number examining the effects of biodiversity, is simple. If
one variety of a crop is susceptible to a disease, the more
concentrated those susceptible types are, the more easily disease
can spread and the more victims it can claim. The disease should be
less likely to spread, however, if susceptible plants are separated
from one another by other kinds of plants that do not succumb to
the disease and can act as a barrier.
</P>
<P>
   Rice blast fungus, which destroys millions of tons of rice and
costs farmers several billion dollars in losses each year, moves
from plant to plant as an airborne spore _ a method of transport
that should easily be blocked by a row of disease-resistant plants.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists tested the hypothesis by asking farmers to plant
their farms in experimental plots using two kinds of rice: a
standard rice that does not usually succumb to rice blast disease
and a much more valuable sticky rice known to be highly
susceptible. Farmers also planted control plots of monocultures,
allowing scientists to rigorously test the importance of the
mixtures in the health and productivity on these farms.
</P>
<P>
   What scientists found was that farmers garnered even more
benefit from the mixtures than expected. Resistant plants did block
the airborne spores in a field, but as more and more farmers became
involved in the study, these positive effects began to multiply
across the region. Not only were disease spores not blowing in from
the next row, they were no longer coming from the next farmer's
field either or the next or the next, rapidly damping the spread of
the disease on a grand scale.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, scientists found that the sticky rice plants, which
poked up above the shorter, standard rice plants with which they
were grown enjoyed sunnier, warmer and drier conditions than they
would have in a stand of tall, sticky rice plants. These conditions
appeared to discourage the growth of the fungal rice blast in the
sticky rice plants.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that rice blast is the most devastating disease of
rice, the staple crop of most people worldwide, would alone make
the study important. Scientists interviewed said there was no
reason, however, why mixtures could not decrease disease spread in
other crops as well, though how powerful and useful a remedy it
will be is likely to vary.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's already a lot of work with barley in Europe and coffee
in Colombia,'' said Mundt. ``I've seen beautiful disease reduction
in mixtures of willows grown in England.''
</P>
<P>
   The study is of particular interest for organic farming as it
involves the application of no chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Biodiversity is an absolutely essential tool for organic
production,'' said Dr. Martin Wolfe, director of research at Elm
Farm Research Centre, an agricultural research institute. ``It's an
essential part of the armory.'' Yet, Wolfe said, even organic
farmers underuse diversity, as they also have been indoctrinated in
the simplicity of and seduced by the universality of monocultures.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the obstacles to using different varieties include the
extra work of keeping track of and maintaining a diversity of
plants that can require different kinds of tending and harvesting.
If kinds of crops require different harvesting methods or are
harvested at different times, it can increase the effort a farmer
must expend in a given field.
</P>
<P>
   In Yunnan province, farmers harvested rice grains by hand,
making it simple to gather and sell the two rice varieties
separately. Some scientists argue such problems can also be
overcome with mechanized harvesting. In the Pacific Northwest where
an increasing number of farmers are using mixtures of wheat to
increase yields and cut down disease, growers may choose varieties
that differ in useful qualities, such as resistance to disease, but
that can still be harvested and sold together.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers say the study's implications extend to prairies,
rainforests and other natural ecosystems.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the new study examines the role of a diversity of crops
in fighting disease and in productivity of a rice paddy,
biodiversity studies have been examining whether increased species
number can affect such things as the health of plants in natural
settings.
</P>
<P>
   So far the two kinds of studies appear to support one another
well. For example, Tilman and Charles Mitchell, an ecologist at
University of Minnesota, have found evidence in prairie ecosystems
that an increased diversity of plant species decreases the
incidence of disease. As in the rice paddies, in natural
ecosystems, when there is a greater diversity of plants, it is
simply more difficult for the disease to spread.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been quite a push by the agrotech industry to market
genetically engineered crops and genetically homogeneous crops that
perform really well,'' said Dr. Shahid Naeem, ecologist at the
University of Washington. ``But what's really neat about this paper
is that it shows how we've lost sight of the fact that there are
some really simple things we can do in the field to manage crops.''

ALWAYS REPUBLICAN? NO, TEXAS IS ITSELF
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By JIM WRIGHT 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Lufkin Daily News' publisher emeritus, Joe Murray, made an
intriguing argument in a recent column, ``Who lost Texas? Exploring
the question of when the Lone Star State began turning Republican,
Murray concluded: ``Deep in its heart, Texas has always been
Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   Presumably he was not referring to those 60 years between
Reconstruction and 1928, when Texas majorities never once voted
Republican. That fact Murray probably passes off as a six-decade
hangover from the Civil War. Perhaps it was.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even a casual review of Texas history reveals some
startlingly progressive democratic views among the state's earlier
icons and trendsetters. Our legendary hero Sam Houston, a
Jacksonian Democrat, openly opposed secession and supported racial
inclusion for Native Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Popular Gov. James Stephen Hogg was one of the nation's original
trustbusters. He broke up monopolistic price-setting by railroads
and other corporations, championed one of America's earliest state
antitrust laws, and originated the Texas Railroad Commission to
protect consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Weldon Bailey, Sam Rayburn's boyhood inspiration, was
essentially a Democratic populist in spite of his dalliance with
Standard Oil. And Gov. Jim Ferguson, for all his digressions,
championed legislation protecting homes from foreclosure and modest
homesteads from state taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Texans blazed a trail of equality for women in 1924 when Lone
Star voters elected Miriam Ferguson governor. Prior to that year,
no state had elected a female chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   It's worth remembering also that, in more recent years, Texas
became the first state to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment. Texas
history and Texan sentiment represent, I'd argue, a rich blend of
conservative and liberal sentiment not far aberrant from national
norms.
</P>
<P>
   When the same voters can elect two U.S. senators with views as
different as those of Ralph Yarborough and John Tower, who's to put
any confining ideological label on them?
</P>
<P>
   Murray cited the last 12 presidential elections as evidence that
Texas voters were closet Republicans all along who just recently
``came out of hiding.'' Looking at the same data, I think a better
argument is that Texas was the quintessential swing state, not to
be taken for granted by either party.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, Texas has been _ except for the last two
presidential elections _ a remarkably reflective barometer of
national sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   In the previous 16 election cycles _ 1928 through 1988 _ Texas
voters chose exactly as the nation did on all but one occasion.
That was 1968, when our state gave its nod to Democrat Hubert
Humphrey even though Richard Nixon won nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Our increasingly heterogeneous state has become a fairly
representative microcosm of America.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Texas is becoming more Republican. Democrats still hold
a slim margin in the state's delegation to the U.S. House and in
the state Legislature. There are more and more GOP officials in
statewide offices, however, and in local courthouses _ no doubt
about that.
</P>
<P>
   Texas ceased being a one-party state a few years ago. This
change began, I guess, when Tower went to the U.S. Senate in 1961
and stayed for 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Back when this was called a ``one-party'' state, the Texas
Democratic Party had a split personality. Its conventions through
the 1940s and '50s were anything but love fests. They were brawls.
</P>
<P>
   Trouncing and denouncing intraparty rivals was, for the party
activist, much more fun than beating the Republicans in November.
Winning a Democratic primary was, in the hackneyed phrase of
journalism, ``tantamount to election.''
</P>
<P>
   But back to Joe Murray's original question: What did make Texas
and other Southern states become two-party battlegrounds? Lyndon B.
Johnson thought it might be his and fellow Democrats' championing
of civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson sadly prophesied, in fact, when his 1964 and '65 Public
Accommodations and Voting Rights bills became law, that he'd just
forfeited the solid South to the Republicans for the next 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   I think it was something else, too: prosperity. We Democrats
fooled around and made conditions prosperous enough that folks
could afford to be Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   When a good ol' boy gets a big enough mortgage, he's entitled to
one Republican yard sign to show his neighbors that he's arrived!
</P>
<P>
   But it works the other way as well. If Democratic policies make
Republicans, then Republican policies make Democrats. The GOP
Congress will turn thumbs down on enough things that people want
and need that folks will start thinkin': ``Hold on, now! If we're
gonna keep livin' like Republicans, we'd better start votin' like
Democrats again!''
</P>

BIOTECH CORN CAN KILL BUTTERFLIES, NEW STUDY SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Iowa)   By CAROL KAESUK YOON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ever since scientists reported last year that pollen from
genetically engineered corn could kill monarch butterfly
caterpillars in the laboratory, scientists, industry
representatives and activists opposed to genetic engineering have
been battling over one central question: Are these butterflies
being harmed by the millions of acres of biotech corn being planted
across the country?
</P>
<P>
   Now, in the first study published on the subject since the
debate began, scientists from Iowa State University say plants
growing in and near the corn fields are being dusted with enough
toxic pollen to kill monarch caterpillars that feed on them. The
genetically modified corn produces the insecticide Bt in its
tissues, including its windblown pollen.
</P>
<P>
   The study provides the first published data showing the
potential for genetically engineered pollen in the wild to harm
monarchs. Critics of the original study, published by researchers
at Cornell University, said caterpillars in the study could have
died because they were fed levels of toxic pollen that were much
higher than those found in nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is telling us that with naturally deposited pollen
there's a good probability you'll get some mortality,'' said Dr.
John Obrycki, who along with fellow entomologist Laura Hansen wrote
the article published Saturday in the journal Oecologia.
</P>
<P>
   In their study, the researchers gathered leaves from plants
growing in and around corn fields and onto which pollen had blown.
The leaves were then fed to caterpillars in the laboratory. Twenty
percent of the caterpillars eating leaves bearing genetically
engineered pollen died, while all caterpillars eating leaves with
regular corn pollen survived.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big deal,'' said Dr. John Losey, one of the authors
on the original Cornell study. ``It's an important next step.''
</P>
<P>
   But far from settling the issue, the new research seems to have
fueled the continuing battle for public opinion inspired by the
monarch butterfly, which has become a symbol to many of fragile
nature threatened by genetic engineering.
</P>
<P>
   ``This study should dispel any doubts about whether or not the
effect observed in the Cornell study is a real one in the field,''
said Dr. Rebecca Goldburg, a scientist at the Environmental Defense
Fund, a group that has been critical of the biotechnology industry
and its regulators. ``The Environmental Protection Agency should
take some steps to ensure that butterflies in this coming planting
season are protected.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry representatives say the new study did not accurately
reflect what is happening in nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see how this can be construed as a field study,'' said
Lisa Dry, spokeswoman for the Biotechnology Industry Organization,
referring to the fact that leaves from the field were brought back
to the lab to be fed to caterpillars. Dry said she believed that
rain, wind and sun would degrade the pollen to the point that
caterpillars' chances of contacting toxic pollen in nature was
``remote.'' Dry said she knew of 20 other studies that would
disagree with the new research, though none had yet been published.
``We're confident that the Bt has minimal, if any, impact,'' she
added.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists interviewed agreed that there were still no data to
show what the ultimate impact would be on populations of monarchs.
</P>
<P>
   So far the Environmental Protection Agency has not required
farmers to alter plantings to reduce the flow of genetically
engineered pollen out of their fields. Earlier this month the
agency announced that the registrations that allow the widespread
planting of Bt corn would be extended through next year's growing
season until September 2001.

FOR ASPIRING CELEBS, INTERNET PROVIDING A SECRET PASSAGE TO FAME

<P>
   In Danni Ashe's own words, she was once just another
``big-breasted nude model.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, she's a big-breasted nude model _ with 840 million
downloads to her credit, making her the most downloaded woman in
history.
</P>
<P>
   You may not know her.
</P>
<P>
   But on the Internet, she's a star.
</P>
<P>
   Same goes for Matt Drudge, an online journalist who has made a
name for himself for his often unsubstantiated scoops in the
political world; Apollo Smile, a New York-based pop
singer/actress/live-action hero who is currently negotiating a TV
series; and Cindy Margolis, a onetime cyberspace pinup who does
have her own syndicated TV show, ``The Cindy Margolis Show.''
</P>
<P>
   They're all Internet celebrities: Actors, writers and musicians
who created their own stages when they created their own Web sites.
Their audience _ Net surfers _ expands every time a new Net user
logs on.
</P>
<P>
   Cybercelebs such as these have created an alternate universe in
which status is judged by how many hits a day their site receives.
More hits, obviously, means more people are paying attention.
</P>
<P>
   None of these performers had made much headway in the
entertainment business the traditional way. But the Internet
provided a secret passage to fame and success that allowed them to
bypass all the middlemen: the agents, the managers, the red tape,
the unanswered prayers.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you gotta do is go out and buy a $500 computer, some
software and a book, and you could become (a celebrity),'' says
Gregg Wetterman, president of the Dallas Internet Society and
founder of online community GeekMeet.com. ``It doesn't have to be
some flashy, wonderful site. It just has to have a point.''
</P>
<P>
   Wetterman points out that Drudge's site (drudgenews.com) is not
spectacular, just intriguing. ``It's about as simple as you can
get, you know, a whole lot of text,'' he says. ``But he found a
niche.''
</P>
<P>
   Harry Knowles did, too. Paralyzed from the waist down four years
ago in a work-related accident, the Austin-based Knowles killed
time while recuperating by building his own entertainment-news
site, aintitcool.com.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the site receives more than 10 million hits a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, it started off as something to keep my mind off
depressing topics, like, my legs not working,'' says Knowles, 28.
``After I started doing it, I thought, `This might be my life,
better figure out how to do it.' So I started updating it daily,
which meant a lot of research and work. After two or three months,
I started getting connections with film producers and others in the
industry. Now we've got people in China writing for us. It's like,
`Holy crap, I did this out of my bedroom?'''
</P>
<P>
   Pasadena, Calif., rock band Red Delicious also stumbled onto
luck via the Internet. A year ago, the group submitted material to
music Web site MP3.com. At the height of a music-downloading
explosion, the site prominently featured the band's music, leading
to major label interest and media coverage in magazines such as
Entertainment Weekly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a key factor in the success we've had,'' says the
band's keyboardist Rob King, who says the pop-rock group is
currently in negotiations with a major label. ``It's just getting
that buzz going, and you have to have something good and unique.
Once you have that, you can do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Bilge Ebiri, entertainment editor for Yahoo Internet Life
magazine, says Internet celebrities haven't necessarily altered the
face of pop culture as much as they have thrown it into overdrive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're already a celebrity-driven culture, but the Net has
really hastened it,'' he says. ``We're always looking for the next
big thing, and the Internet is full of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ebiri says the Internet has even turned the least likeliest
candidate for the spotlight into a household name. He cites Mahir
Cagri, a Turkish man whose site momentarily caught on with
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just this guy who had a home page who was, I guess,
trying to meet women from other countries,'' Ebiri says. ``But
Americans discovered his page, and he became a minor celebrity.
David Letterman had a guy on his show for a while, pretending to be
him. Whenever I would mention I was Turkish, people would ask me,
`Do you know Mahir?' Even more so than Drudge or Cindy (Margolis),
Mahir sort of symbolizes what the Internet can do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has certainly done major things for Margolis, a
one-time model who now, thanks to an enormous amount of word of
mouth about her site, has her own late-night TV show.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's somebody who owes all of her celebrity to the Net,''
Ebiri says. ``Very few people were aware of who she was a few years
ago. It seems like she came out of nowhere. People on the Net knew
who she was. People who weren't online didn't.''

MEDICAL SCHOOLS DISCOVER VALUE IN DISPENSING COMPASSION 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Mass., S.C., N.M., Kan., Texas, Pa.)  By JOHN LANGONE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The late dean of the Harvard Medical School, Robert Ebert,
delighted in telling applicants that a would-be student should be
first in his or her class, a concert violinist without an ego, an
Olympic skating champion who has climbed Mount Everest and has
lived in a tree hut in the Amazon, and a relative of Mother Teresa.
</P>
<P>
   Putting it less facetiously in letters to elementary
schoolchildren who had written asking what they had to do to get
in, Dr. Gerald Foster, a dean of admissions, advised, ``You should
be a good student, but it's also important that you be a good
person, helpful to your parents and to your classmates, because
these are the things we look for in people who apply.''
</P>
<P>
   Implicit in the two educators' remarks is respect for a quality
that some fear is perilously close to extinction: compassion.
</P>
<P>
   Once the hallmark of the buggy-riding, house-calling,
bedside-sitting, fee-waiving family doctor of yesteryear, the
ability and the willingness to feel another's pain often seems a
poor substitute for skilled robo-surgical hands and dazzling
diagnostic electronics.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it is out of guilt, the need to shape an institution's
public relations image, health care consumer protests, or some
Hippocratic epiphany, compassion has become medically and
politically correct.
</P>
<P>
   Re-emerging increasingly among educators, medical associations
and hospital administrators, it is as though medical professionals
and their patients have suddenly discovered humility, mortality and
goodness, and given the boot _ at least on the surface _ to the
God-like physician whose idea of a doctor-patient relationship is
looking down at a groggy patient and saying, ``Do you see these
hands, Madame? They saved your life!''
</P>
<P>
   Consider these recent examples:
</P>
<P>
   _ At Yale, deans of medical departments put white coats, known
as ``cloaks of compassion,'' on each newly enrolled student. During
the ceremony, the students also recite a ``Human Relations Code of
Conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   _ At the University of Texas Medical Branch, medical school
graduates who embody the ultimate in patient care are nominated to
receive the Gold-Headed Cane Award because of their ``interest in
the welfare of patients.''
</P>
<P>
   _ At the University of New Mexico, second-year medical students
on pediatric rotation learn how to deliver ``bad news'' from a
panel of parents.
</P>
<P>
   _ At the Medical University of South Carolina College of
Medicine, students participate in interactive seminars on faith,
mindfulness, forgiveness, guilt, shame, prayer, tragedy and the
power and limitations of the healer.
</P>
<P>
   _ At the Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, some
fourth-year students take an elective course that includes a daily
spiritual log, a personal spiritual profile and a case report of a
patient who has used religion as a means of addressing a medical
problem.
</P>
<P>
   _ At the University of Kansas, the medical students learn
``cultural competency,'' participating in overseas programs to help
them develop cross-cultural awareness and capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   _ At Harvard, first-year students are assigned patients with a
life-threatening illnesses, and the students are expected to
develop ongoing relationships with the patients and their family
members through multiple visits.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, medical students study family dynamics and domestic
violence, take to hospital beds and play at being patients
themselves, smear their eyeglasses with vaseline to appreciate what
it feels like to have cataracts, and interview ``standardized
patients'' _ real or simulated patients who have been carefully
coached to present their feigned illnesses in a standardized form.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is communication, the keystone of the doctor-patient
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Without a doubt, for many patients, the worth of their doctors
has more to do with their ability to listen than with where they
went to medical school or how many years they have been in
practice.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a national survey conducted in 1999 for the Association
of American Medical Colleges found that only 27 percent of patients
cited prestigious medical schools as a factor in choosing doctors,
while 85 percent attributed their choices to the doctors'
communication skills and caring attitude, and 77 percent cited the
ability to explain complicated medical procedures.
</P>
<P>
   It was a wake-up call for the nation's physicians. As Dr. Nancy
Angoff, associate dean of student affairs at Yale Medical School,
tells her incoming students, ``None of us here has any doubt that
you will be able to speak the speak. What we don't want to happen
is for you to forget the human element, the patient's story.''
</P>
<P>
   But can compassion be taught in medical school?
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to start with students who show signs of caring at
the very beginning and who value it,'' Angoff said. ``It also needs
to be valued by the institution. It needs to come from the top.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, embedding compassion in every aspect of the curriculum
is not easily accomplished. Often, it is emphasized only if the
basic science faculty does not have to give anything up.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, good role models, vital in the making of good doctors,
do not grow on every ward, and students are still rewarded for
their skill in recalling minutiae.
</P>
<P>
   Students also find all too quickly that many hospitals are so
high-tech that hands-on care often means hands on a hand-held
computer that registers symptoms, diagnoses and treatment options,
and that the hospital environment can sometimes even be indifferent
to a student's presence.
</P>
<P>
   What does seem to be effective, however, is for students to be
on intimate terms with patients from the very beginning of their
training, continuing the relationship through the third and fourth
years when they are apt to be less under the control of the medical
school and more under the sway of their hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   At Harvard, if a patient dies during the elective course that
pairs students with dying patients, the students are encouraged to
attend the wake and funeral and to share in the family's grief.
</P>
<P>
   ``Learning to grieve,'' says Dr. Susan Block, an associate
professor of psychiatry at Harvard, ``is also part of being a
doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   But will new doctors hold on to ideal values once they are out
practicing in the real world?
</P>
<P>
   Even when they want to, the system seems to conspire against it.
Hospitals are committed to the concept of the
``rapid-through-put-patient'' _ get them in, get them fixed, get
them out.
</P>
<P>
   Personal history-taking that used to take 30 to 45 minutes now
often takes just five to 15.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors are pressured to see more patients in a shorter period
of time and to focus on the ailment, not on any behavioral elements
that might ``intrude.''
</P>
<P>
   What effect the current emphasis on compassion will have on
future generations of doctors remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, there will always be doctors who heed the bit of
verse about the Victorian physician:
</P>
<P>
   He asked no social questions,
</P>
<P>
   He probed no hidden shame;
</P>
<P>
   He only spoke obstetrics
</P>
<P>
   When the little stranger came.
</P>
<P>
   On the other, some medical students, no doubt, will share the
sentiment that one Harvard student wrote recently to her patient:
</P>
<P>
   ``Prior to the class, I never was sure about how to talk to
anybody about death. You have given me invaluable gifts of insight.
Now when I am caring for my own patients, especially those who are
near the ends of their lives, you will always be there.''

 UNDATED: online didn't'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are several advantages to being an Internet celebrity,
cybercelebs say, the dominant one being you have the freedom to
control your career. Many performers feel like they never get a
fair chance going through established channels in the entertainment
industry. They can't get in front of the top agents or producers,
and so they are frozen out of the business without ever getting an
opportunity to show what they can do. Or, if they do land an agent
or manager, they often have to compromise their vision for their
career or sign away potentially valuable rights.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet changes all that _ it provides a venue for
performers to go directly to a large audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can actually take control of my life and my own image and
start profiting from my name,'' says model Danni Ashe, who has her
own site (danni.com) and her own online business. ``You model for
$500 a day, you sign away all your rights. The people who own your
image can do anything they want with it. It traps a lot of women.
What the Internet allows us to do is build a name and notoriety,
then be in control of our careers. It's incredibly empowering.''
</P>
<P>
   Apollo Smile, a New York-based actress and singer, says another
advantage of Internet celeb status is that it's easier to keep your
integrity intact.
</P>
<P>
   ``That, to me, is a big deal, keeping your integrity,'' she
says. ``You can protect yourself on the Internet, because you're
the one in control of things. You can stay solid in the vision you
have.''
</P>
<P>
   But Apollo, like other Internet celebrities, is certainly not
opposed to gaining mainstream attention. And agents, networks and
studios are beginning to use the Internet as a sort of minor
leagues, picking up popular Net performers for TV or movie work.
Apollo is currently negotiating for a TV-series deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we want to do, expand our horizons,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   It's not as easy as setting up a Web site, though. Making it as
a cyberceleb can be a crap shoot, too _ even becoming an online
celebrity is no guarantee that you'll be able to make a living.
Luck and marketing are just as important online as off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very easy to get lost,'' Ebiri says. ``Or to never be
found. It's a giant cacophony out there. There are millions of Web
pages.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as pop culture often tires of movie stars and musicians,
Ebiri says, we can easily grow weary of online personalities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you achieve a certain amount of celebrity on the Net, it
can get deafening,'' he says. ``That's kind of what's happened to
Drudge. We're sick and tired of hearing about him, but he's managed
to remain relevant because he does a certain amount of journalism.
His luster has faded, though, so there's often an expiration date
on (Internet celebrities), but that doesn't mean that someone who
builds their celebrity on the Net won't last as long.''
</P>
<P>
   Knowles says the key to his success has been in the pacing of
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've moved very slowly,'' he says. ``Two years ago, there were
TV offers that didn't allow me any control and book offers and
such. When we go to make those next steps, we want to make sure
everything is in place, that we're not making any hasty decisions,
because the Internet is just another medium, and you have to treat
it like that. You always have people who become famous out of any
new invention. It's not like the Internet is going to get rid of
movies or magazines. It just adds to them.''

SCIENTISTS GROW TOOTH BUDS IN BIRD EMBRYOS 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
 By NICHOLAS WADE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Spelling the possible demise for the phrase ``as scarce as hen's
teeth,'' a team of researchers at Harvard Medical School and
elsewhere has succeeded in making chick embryos grow tooth buds.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a rehearsal for Jurassic Aviary _ the earliest birds
like archaeopteryx sported menacing rows of teeth along their beaks
_ but rather a test of new knowledge about how organs are generated
in developing embryos.
</P>
<P>
   Mice are often used to study mammalian development, and teeth
are easy to work with because they grow well outside the body.
Researchers at Harvard and elsewhere figured that a natural
substance known as BMP4, which plays a central role in the
development of mouse teeth, might be absent in birds, and that
suppression of the gene that makes it might be the reason why
modern day birds do not have teeth.
</P>
<P>
   By inserting BMP4-laden beads into the jaw region of chick
embryos, they showed that tooth buds would develop, Dr. Richard
Maas and colleagues report in today's issue of the Proceedings of
the National Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably, birds have retained the basic genetic apparatus for
developing teeth, even though they ceased to grow them some 60
million years ago. But through a genetic change that occurred at
that time, they ceased to produce the vital BMP4 protein at the
embryo's tooth-formation stage.
</P>
<P>
   In mice, two classes of cells are generated which swathe the
tooth buds in layers of dentin and enamel. This did not occur with
the tooth buds in the treated chicks, presumably because birds have
lost the ability to make these two substances.
</P>
<P>
   Maas said there had been brisk progress in understanding tooth
formation in the last six years, largely because of ``knock-out
mice.'' These are strains of mice in which a single gene has been
deleted. Finding strains that are completely or partly toothless
helps identify genes that are vital for tooth development.
</P>
<P>
   The emerging picture is that teeth develop through genetically
signaled interactions between two sheets of embryonic cells, known
as the epithelium and the mesenchyme. First the epithelium signals
the mesenchyme, then the mesenchyme induces the epithelial sheet to
bud into it. Within this bud a tooth develops. BMP4, short for bone
morphogenetic protein number 4, is a major factor in the initial
formation of the bud.
</P>
<P>
   So far at least 25 different genes have been found to be
involved in the development of mouse teeth. Probably all of them
have counterparts in people. After a knock-out mouse lacking the
gene known as Msx1 was found, a human family also lacking the gene
was identified. But people lacking Msx1 are only partly toothless.
Their primary teeth are fine, but they fail to develop the second
set that replaces the milk teeth.
</P>
<P>
   The bioengineering of human teeth is more complicated than mouse
teeth since people live much longer and need more durable teeth.
The fact that the second set develops later is an exception to the
fact that most organ development occurs exclusively in the womb.
</P>
<P>
   That raises the question of whether the factors discovered by
tooth biologists might someday be useful in generating new teeth in
humans. ``Maybe you could stimulate yet one more round of
replacement if you understood how these pathways worked,'' Maas
said.
</P>
<P>
   If other organs develop in a similar way, the organ-shaping
genes discovered by embryologists may one day help to repair
damaged organs or even generate new ones in the laboratory, perhaps
using the versatile stem cells that seem to be part of each organ's
natural repair kit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have entered an era where we can understand organ fates
based on molecular principles,'' Maas said. ``The field is clearly
headed in the direction of organ regeneration. If you understood
all the different pathways you could hope to influence organ
development.''

DARK SIDE OF QUIRKS IN BEHAVIOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Dr. Anna Fels is a psychiatrist in Manhattan.) 
 By ANNA FELS, M.D.    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the many odd experiences of being a psychiatrist is
discovering that seemingly benign traits can have a dark and even
pathological side to them.
</P>
<P>
   A characteristic that we would typically dismiss lightly in
everyday life _ a tendency to procrastinate, a hot temper, or a
fastidiousness about details _ sends up a red flag for a
psychiatrist.
</P>
<P>
   Is this simply a quirk or is it part of a more pervasive
behavioral pattern? And if it is the latter, should it simply be
considered the person's style or could it be part of a disorder in
need of treatment? At times what appears to be a minor eccentricity
can afford a glimpse into a large and unsuspected landscape of
symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Shyness is a case in point. I had always thought of shyness as a
sweet, even endearing quality. But that was before I first met
Alonzo in the waiting room.
</P>
<P>
   I saw an elegant, if conservatively dressed, man in his early
30s. As I shook his hand and introduced myself, he flashed me a
tense smile but did not meet my eyes. In my office, Alonzo stared
into the middle distance and haltingly told me why he had come to
see me.
</P>
<P>
   He was an accountant at an established firm, and he had recently
been passed over for a promotion, despite his history of
outstanding work. His boss had taken him aside to explain the
problem: He made clients uncomfortable. Alonzo was at a loss as to
how to begin to address this issue.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the consultation, I knew just what his boss was
talking about. Alonzo's replies to my routine questions were terse
to the point of being monosyllabic. The conversation never flowed.
It lurched from statement to statement. The few times when he tried
to expand on a point, Alonzo would suddenly break off, look at me
searchingly and lapse into silence. I realized that I, too, was
becoming uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   In themselves, these feelings of anxiety did not surprise me.
Transiently experiencing the same symptoms as a patient is a
well-documented phenomenon in psychiatry. Depressed patients can
leave therapists mildly enervated; angry patients can leave them in
a slow burn. Actually, such elicited feelings are often used as
handy therapeutic guideposts. But what amazed me in this patient
was the intensity of the sensations I was beginning to share with
him. I felt increasingly self-conscious as my words hung in the
air. It was painful.
</P>
<P>
   As I questioned Alonzo further, it became clear that his
symptoms of shyness infiltrated his life outside of work as well.
He rarely ventured beyond his small circle of friends, and his
girlfriend complained about his reclusiveness _ he always preferred
for them to sit home. Alonzo rarely picked up the phone, preferring
to communicate by e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   To the outside world, Alonzo was a highly competent professional
with some social awkwardness. But the pervasiveness and intensity
of his symptoms suggested that he had crossed the diagnostic
Rubicon from a simple occasional shyness to a severe, chronic
shyness across a multitude of situations.
</P>
<P>
   The psychiatric terms for shyness of this intensity, social
phobia or social anxiety disorder, may appear to bestow a slightly
pompous, pseudo-medical sound to a common human trait. But a large
body of research has demonstrated that such symptoms do, in fact,
define a seriously debilitating condition.
</P>
<P>
   Like Alonzo, people with this disorder often lead difficult and
diminished lives. The emotional toll of the disease is huge.
Studies have shown that a majority of people with social phobia
have difficulty reaching their educational and professional goals
or even maintaining employment. They can be more likely to depend
on others financially and to try to relieve anxiety with alcohol
and drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because of the very recessiveness of the symptoms that
define social phobia, until recently psychiatrists remained largely
unaware of the diagnosis. And for many people, social phobia is
still experienced as a perplexing series of private defeats.
Explaining to patients that they have a defined illness often
causes relief.
</P>
<P>
   When I described the syndrome of social phobia to Alonzo at the
end of the consultation, he listened with a look of incredulity.
</P>
<P>
   Then, for the first time in the session, as he slowly considered
what I had said, he looked me directly in the eye. For a long
while, we sat there together in silence. But it was a comfortable,
shared silence as we both contemplated the long, difficult road he
had traveled alone.

&HT;     DEN MOTHER JOINS PROTEST AGAINST SCOUTS' BAN ON GAYS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A Cub Scout den mother from the San Francisco
Bay area joined demonstrators across the country Monday to protest
the Boys Scouts' ban on homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrations in 36 cities and 21 states, mostly lightly
attended, came two months after the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the
Boy Scouts' right to exclude gays, dashing activists' hopes that
the courts would accomplish what public pressure has failed to do.
</P>
<P>
   The 6.2-million-member Scouts view homosexuality as contrary to
their pledge to be ``morally straight.''
</P>
<P>
   When she retired from her high-tech management job to raise her
son Will, Jan Tyler never expected to find herself helping stage a
protest against an organization she and her family have long
revered.
</P>
<P>
   But the Cub Scout den mother from Mountain View protested
outside the San Leandro office of the San Francisco Bay Area
Council of the Boy Scouts of America.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the day of protest is the Petaluma, Calif., group
Scouting for All and its co-founder, 15-year-old Eagle Scout Steven
Cozza. He and his father, Scott were in Texas to lead a delegation
to the doorstep of Scouts national headquarters in Irving.
</P>
<P>
   Tyler, who said she has never before been an activist, explained
that as the mother of a 7-year-old boy she was trying to raise
according to her values and as a leader of his Cub den, she had to
take part.
</P>
<P>
   ``We find ourselves in the weird situation now where in order to
be participants in scouting, we feel we are being disrespectful to
people we love and respect,'' Tyler said. ``It's a little like
being a Nazi and saying to my Jewish friends, `I hope this doesn't
offend you.''
</P>
<P>
   Scouting for All hopes to add steam to its 3-year-old campaign
to get the BSA to change its anti-gay policy. Scouting for All has
gathered 52,000 signatures on a petition on its Web site. The
organization lobbied Rep. Lynn C. Woolsey, D-Calif., to introduce a
bill in Congress seeking to revoke the federal charter of the Boy
Scouts of America.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Dybeck, spokesman for the San Francisco Bay Area Council
in San Leandro, said his chapter serves 46,000 boys in Alameda and
San Francisco counties. ``We respect the right of Scouting for All
to protest the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court, as I'm sure they
respect our right to continue to focus our resources, time and
energy on serving the youth and families through a high-quality
scouting program,'' he said.

 &HT;    FOR AMERICAN WORKERS, 'GOOD OLD DAYS' ARE NOW
 &HT;    960&AMP;add. With LABOR-DATA. Moving in (w) Washington and (f)
financial categories for release Sunday, Sept. 3.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For the American labor force, a century of hard
work has paid off.
</P>
<P>
   On Labor Day 1900, the typical American worker was a man
accustomed to toiling 10 hours a day, six days a week on a farm or
in a factory. Injury and illness were constant threats. Frequent
baths, fun vacations and full lunch buckets were virtually unknown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think many people would want to go back to those good
old days,'' said Carl Van Horn, a labor expert at Rutgers
University. ``Working conditions are so much better today.''
</P>
<P>
   Workers of 1900 may have been tired, hot and dirty, but they
were also optimistic. New technologies such as electric lights,
telephones and automobiles were appearing, stirring hopes that work
would be easier and life more enjoyable.
</P>
<P>
   A century later, those dreams have become our reality. On Labor
Day 2000, American workers are healthier, safer and better paid
than at any time in history. One of the few things they have in
common with their counterparts 100 years ago is a sense of
confidence that technology will continue to improve working
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Coming changes could scarcely be more sweeping than those of the
past century.
</P>
<P>
   Government statistics show that overwhelmingly, Americans in
1900 worked with their backs and often endured brutal working
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The most common job for men was farm laborer. For women, it was
domestic servant. Even children _ one-sixth of them under 16 were
working _ held strenuous jobs, commonly working in coal mines and
textile mills.
</P>
<P>
   Without machinery such as tractors, washing machines and power
tools, jobs were physically demanding and dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``The workplace was quite unsafe,'' said Roy Rosenzweig, a
history professor at George Mason University. In the late 1800s,
about 35,000 workers were killed each year in industrial accidents,
Rosenzweig said. Many employers found ``it was cheaper to let
people die than to improve safety,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs involving railroads or coal mines were especially lethal.
On May 1, 1900, in Scofield, Utah, more than 200 miners were killed
when coal dust ignited and created a huge fireball.
</P>
<P>
   Today, with a much larger work force, only about 6,000 people
die each year on the job.
</P>
<P>
   About 60 percent of all employees now work in stores and
offices, enjoying the benefits of central heat and air
conditioning. Even factory workers generally have indoor plumbing,
plenty of light and climate control.
</P>
<P>
   In 1900, vacations were virtually unknown except in a few
white-collar professions. Leisure for common workers came only on
Sundays, Christmas, July 4 and perhaps Labor Day, a legal holiday
in most states at that time. Retirement was rare, even for the
relatively few people who lived to age 65.
</P>
<P>
   Today, full-time employees typically work five days a week, get
paid vacations and look forward to more than a decade of retirement
beyond age 65. Benefits unimaginable in 1900 are routine for many
workers in 2000: medical insurance, life insurance, subsidized
retirement savings, stock options, and subsidies for child care,
education and travel.
</P>
<P>
   Compensation also has improved. Although the average work week
in 1900 was 59 hours, family incomes averaged just $375 a year. A
typical worker had to toil about two hours to purchase a dozen
eggs, compared to five minutes' work at today's average hourly wage
of $13.71.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty of getting enough good food was reflected in
people's physical stature. At the turn of the century, the average
height of Army recruits was just under 5 feet 7 inches. Today it's
5 feet 10 inches, and researchers say the change can be credited to
improved nutrition.
</P>
<P>
   Hard work and low pay also helped shorten life spans. The
average American died at about age 49, compared with today's
average of more than 76 years.
</P>
<P>
   What's behind the improvement in workers' lives?
</P>
<P>
   Van Horn of Rutgers said part of the credit goes to changes in
public policies. Child labor laws, Social Security, occupational
safety regulations, wage-and-hour laws and employer-backed pensions
and insurance vastly improved the lot of workers. Union efforts to
win a 40-hour work week and paid vacations helped, too.
</P>
<P>
   But technological change was the key to higher living and
working standards. In 1900, more than four out of five workers
performed manual labor.
</P>
<P>
   But the development of heavy equipment, such as earth movers,
backhoes and cranes, increased productivity and reduced the number
of workers needed for physical labor, according to Steve Hipple, an
economist with the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big shift in labor in the past century has been away from
mining, manufacturing and construction,'' Hipple said.
</P>
<P>
   Only 15 percent of workers are now employed in manufacturing,
and agricultural workers make up just 2.5 percent of today's labor
force.
</P>
<P>
   Technology has contributed to another big change, Hipple said:
``the mass influx of women into the work force.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1900, only about 18 percent of the labor force was female.
</P>
<P>
   In the early part of the century, ``factory work pulled young
women off the farm,'' said Paula Rayman, a labor economist at
Harvard University. But after they married, women generally
returned to the home to raise children, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The number of female workers remained relatively low until the
1960s, when inflation and rising housing costs spurred more females
to seek work in the office buildings, restaurants, hotels and malls
rising up around them, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, the advent of computers accelerated the shift of
work's burdens from legs and backs to fingertips and brains.
</P>
<P>
   Today, with most jobs located in offices and stores, about 62
million women are among the 133.5 million Americans working, or 47
percent.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   And now another wave of innovation is generating
turn-of-the-century optimism. With new technologies boosting
productivity, consumer confidence is at historic highs and labor
experts say working conditions may soon be getting even better.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are going to need more education'' to keep pace with
the changes, Van Horn said. But for those who get the right
training, the workplace soon could have all the comforts of home.
In fact, it will be home for the millions of workers who will be
using advanced telecommunications devices as their tools.
</P>
<P>
   ``When wireless connections start to work (well), that will
change our ideas about whether people have to work in certain
buildings,'' such as offices or factories, he said. ``Houses will
be redesigned so that our work space will be in the home.''
</P>
<P>
   In the new century, a major shift for women may be toward
self-employment, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest issue we are hearing about now from young women
is: Can you work and still have a life?'' she said. To give
themselves more scheduling flexibility, many women will be looking
for ways to work from home or to run their own businesses, she
predicted.
</P>
<P>
   But Rutgers labor expert Van Horn says it won't be only women
looking for more scheduling freedom. New technologies will soon be
freeing 21st century workers from hectic commutes, giving rise to
more leisure time, he predicted.
</P>
<P>
   While it's difficult to forecast the future of work, only thing
that seems certain is that ``you're going to have much more
flexibility about where you can work,'' he said.

 &HT;    RAILROADS HAVE SHRUNK, BUT JOBS LARGELY THE SAME

<P>
   ATLANTA _ When retired Southern Railroad machinist Bill Purdie
began his career in 1936, old-timers could remember the Civil War,
and the railroad was still the main mode of long-distance travel.
</P>
<P>
   His starting salary? Twenty-two and half cents an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Purdie spent the next several decades doing pretty much the same
thing: making and repairing steam engine parts.
</P>
<P>
   The steam engine required a lot of welding and drilling holes
and making bolts, parts and castings, said Purdie, now an
85-year-old retiree. ``It was hard work and heavy repair.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as they did a century ago, laborers still build, repair and
maintain the railroad engines, equipment and lines, and conductors
still oversee business on the train.
</P>
<P>
   ``Railroading, in general, is fundamentally about the same job
as years ago,'' said conductor Jack Hunt, 46.
</P>
<P>
   Aboard the Crescent, an Amtrak train that links New Orleans and
New York, conductor Hunt recently sat down in the lounge car and
penciled in numbers on his ``turnover sheet'' and ``delay report,''
just as historians say early conductors did in the mid-1800s.
</P>
<P>
   The only new technology Hunt regularly uses on the job is his
cell phone, which replaced his radio last year as his tool for
contacting the engineers at approaching stations. While radios had
limited frequencies, he said, cell phones almost guarantee
immediate contact.
</P>
<P>
   The most significant change in railroad work can be found in the
type of labor required to build a train or a railroad line, said
Lesa(cq) Campbell, a historian with the Southeastern Railway Museum
in Duluth, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Around the turn of the century, railroad tracks were built with
the brawn of outdoor laborers. But today, most of the line work now
involves repair and maintenance. Instead of 30 work gang members
driving spikes, one by one, a crew of about six skilled workers
operates hydraulic equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The job of engine shop and roundhouse workers also has became
less labor-intensive in the second half of the century. After the
diesel engine replaced steam in the 1950s, their work evolved into
what now is primarily parts assembly.
</P>
<P>
   The number of workers needed to operate the railroads has
declined sharply from earlier years. Currently, about 24,000
employees work for Amtrak, according to spokesman Steven
Taubenkibel. Another 200,000 work for the four major freight
railroad companies _ CSX and Norfolk Southern in the East, and
Burlington Northern Santa Fe and Union-Pacific in the West.
</P>
<P>
   According to Campbell, 1.8 million people worked for the
railroads in 1917, one of the peak years for the industry.

   RUSSIA-SUBMARINE (Moscow) _ As divers gained entry to the wreck
of the nuclear submarine Kursk and declared it completely flooded
and the 118-member crew dead, Russian Defense Minister Marshal Igor
Sergeyev said in a nationally televised interview Monday that the
military might have made mistakes in how it responded to the
disaster. But he defended the armed forces, saying the institution
had been robbed and stripped in recent years and he disclosed new
information to support the strong suspicion of Russian military and
civilian leaders that the Kursk collided with another submarine
that also suffered severe damage, but managed to escape undetected.

   DEMS-WORKING-FAMILIES (Washington) _ Through the four days of
the Democratic National Convention last week, it was impossible get
through a hour, much less a day, without hearing the words
``working families.'' Neophyte candidates in obscure congressional
districts talked about them in their brief nonprime-time
appearances; the party's platform championed their needs; and the
presidential nominee himself took up their cause and continued to
pound the theme as his campaign steamed down the Mississippi River.
And it's not a matter of coincidence; the phrase was the result of
weeks of research and focus groups, and the campaign is making sure
that voters remember it. By Katharine Q. Seelye.

unions, which makes provisions on these issues and many more, has
raised eyebrows. While the direct effect is almost impossible to
gauge, the apparent consensus about the settlement is that the
unions came away as winners and, perhaps, as meaningful
participants in the New Economy that was ready to leave them at its

   SCI-CHINA-RICE (Undated) _ In a stunning result from what has
become one of the largest agricultural experiments ever, thousands
of rice farmers in China have doubled the yields of their most
valuable crop and nearly eliminated its most devastating disease _
without using chemical treatments or spending a single extra penny.
Under the direction of an international team of scientists, farmers
in China's Yunnan province implemented a simple change in their
rice paddies. Instead of planting the large stands of a single type
of rice, as they typically have done, the farmers planted a mixture
of two different rices. With this one change, growers were able to
radically restrict the incidence of rice blast _ the most important

   SCI-RACE-GENES (Undated) _ Scientists have long suspected that
the racial categories recognized by society are not reflected on
the genetic level. But the more closely that researchers examine
the human genome _ the complement of genetic material encased in
the heart of almost every cell of the body _ the more most of them
are convinced that the standard labels used to distinguish people
by ``race'' have little or no biological meaning. They say that
while it may seem easy to tell at a glance whether a person is
Caucasian, African or Asian, the ease dissolves when one probes
beneath surface characteristics and scans the genome for DNA
hallmarks of ``race.'' By Natalie Angier.

   BKN-KNICKS-TRADE (Undated) _ In a startling four-team trade that

center to Seattle and in exchange receive forward Vin Baker from

played for 15 seasons in New York, often with distinction and
always with remarkable effort. But in recent seasons, his injuries
mounted, as did the sense that he was unable to adjust to being a
secondary player in the team's offense. By Mike Wise.

 &HT;    FOR AMERICAN WORKERS, 'GOOD OLD DAYS' ARE NOW
 &HT;    960&AMP;add. With LABOR-DATA. Moving in (w) Washington and (f)
financial categories for release Sunday, Sept. 3.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For the American labor force, a century of hard
work has paid off.
</P>
<P>
   On Labor Day 1900, the typical American worker was a man
accustomed to toiling 10 hours a day, six days a week on a farm or
in a factory. Injury and illness were constant threats. Frequent
baths, fun vacations and full lunch buckets were virtually unknown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think many people would want to go back to those good
old days,'' said Carl Van Horn, a labor expert at Rutgers
University. ``Working conditions are so much better today.''
</P>
<P>
   Workers of 1900 may have been tired, hot and dirty, but they
were also optimistic. New technologies such as electric lights,
telephones and automobiles were appearing, stirring hopes that work
would be easier and life more enjoyable.
</P>
<P>
   A century later, those dreams have become our reality. On Labor
Day 2000, American workers are healthier, safer and better paid
than at any time in history. One of the few things they have in
common with their counterparts 100 years ago is a sense of
confidence that technology will continue to improve working
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Coming changes could scarcely be more sweeping than those of the
past century.
</P>
<P>
   Government statistics show that overwhelmingly, Americans in
1900 worked with their backs and often endured brutal working
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The most common job for men was farm laborer. For women, it was
domestic servant. Even children _ one-sixth of them under 16 were
working _ held strenuous jobs, commonly working in coal mines and
textile mills.
</P>
<P>
   Without machinery such as tractors, washing machines and power
tools, jobs were physically demanding and dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``The workplace was quite unsafe,'' said Roy Rosenzweig, a
history professor at George Mason University. In the late 1800s,
about 35,000 workers were killed each year in industrial accidents,
Rosenzweig said. Many employers found ``it was cheaper to let
people die than to improve safety,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs involving railroads or coal mines were especially lethal.
On May 1, 1900, in Scofield, Utah, more than 200 miners were killed
when coal dust ignited and created a huge fireball.
</P>
<P>
   Today, with a much larger work force, only about 6,000 people
die each year on the job.
</P>
<P>
   About 60 percent of all employees now work in stores and
offices, enjoying the benefits of central heat and air
conditioning. Even factory workers generally have indoor plumbing,
plenty of light and climate control.
</P>
<P>
   In 1900, vacations were virtually unknown except in a few
white-collar professions. Leisure for common workers came only on
Sundays, Christmas, July 4 and perhaps Labor Day, a legal holiday
in most states at that time. Retirement was rare, even for the
relatively few people who lived to age 65.
</P>
<P>
   Today, full-time employees typically work five days a week, get
paid vacations and look forward to more than a decade of retirement
beyond age 65. Benefits unimaginable in 1900 are routine for many
workers in 2000: medical insurance, life insurance, subsidized
retirement savings, stock options, and subsidies for child care,
education and travel.
</P>
<P>
   Compensation also has improved. Although the average work week
in 1900 was 59 hours, family incomes averaged just $375 a year. A
typical worker had to toil about two hours to purchase a dozen
eggs, compared to five minutes' work at today's average hourly wage
of $13.71.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty of getting enough good food was reflected in
people's physical stature. At the turn of the century, the average
height of Army recruits was just under 5 feet 7 inches. Today it's
5 feet 10 inches, and researchers say the change can be credited to
improved nutrition.
</P>
<P>
   Hard work and low pay also helped shorten life spans. The
average American died at about age 49, compared with today's
average of more than 76 years.
</P>
<P>
   What's behind the improvement in workers' lives?
</P>
<P>
   Van Horn of Rutgers said part of the credit goes to changes in
public policies. Child labor laws, Social Security, occupational
safety regulations, wage-and-hour laws and employer-backed pensions
and insurance vastly improved the lot of workers. Union efforts to
win a 40-hour work week and paid vacations helped, too.
</P>
<P>
   But technological change was the key to higher living and
working standards. In 1900, more than four out of five workers
performed manual labor.
</P>
<P>
   But the development of heavy equipment, such as earth movers,
backhoes and cranes, increased productivity and reduced the number
of workers needed for physical labor, according to Steve Hipple, an
economist with the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big shift in labor in the past century has been away from
mining, manufacturing and construction,'' Hipple said.
</P>
<P>
   Only 15 percent of workers are now employed in manufacturing,
and agricultural workers make up just 2.5 percent of today's labor
force.
</P>
<P>
   Technology has contributed to another big change, Hipple said:
``the mass influx of women into the work force.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1900, only about 18 percent of the labor force was female.
</P>
<P>
   In the early part of the century, ``factory work pulled young
women off the farm,'' said Paula Rayman, a labor economist at
Harvard University. But after they married, women generally
returned to the home to raise children, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The number of female workers remained relatively low until the
1960s, when inflation and rising housing costs spurred more females
to seek work in the office buildings, restaurants, hotels and malls
rising up around them, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, the advent of computers accelerated the shift of
work's burdens from legs and backs to fingertips and brains.
</P>
<P>
   Today, with most jobs located in offices and stores, about 62
million women are among the 133.5 million Americans working, or 47
percent.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   And now another wave of innovation is generating
turn-of-the-century optimism. With new technologies boosting
productivity, consumer confidence is at historic highs and labor
experts say working conditions may soon be getting even better.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are going to need more education'' to keep pace with
the changes, Van Horn said. But for those who get the right
training, the workplace soon could have all the comforts of home.
In fact, it will be home for the millions of workers who will be
using advanced telecommunications devices as their tools.
</P>
<P>
   ``When wireless connections start to work (well), that will
change our ideas about whether people have to work in certain
buildings,'' such as offices or factories, he said. ``Houses will
be redesigned so that our work space will be in the home.''
</P>
<P>
   In the new century, a major shift for women may be toward
self-employment, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest issue we are hearing about now from young women
is: Can you work and still have a life?'' she said. To give
themselves more scheduling flexibility, many women will be looking
for ways to work from home or to run their own businesses, she
predicted.
</P>
<P>
   But Rutgers labor expert Van Horn says it won't be only women
looking for more scheduling freedom. New technologies will soon be
freeing 21st century workers from hectic commutes, giving rise to
more leisure time, he predicted.
</P>
<P>
   While it's difficult to forecast the future of work, only thing
that seems certain is that ``you're going to have much more
flexibility about where you can work,'' he said.

 &HT;    DEVELOPMENT, TECHNOLOGY BRINGS CHANGE TO FRUIT GROWERS
 &HT;    With LABOR. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial
categories for release Sunday, Sept. 3.

   GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. _ Jim Miller's Redlands orchard used to
sit among dozens of farms in the shadow of the Colorado National
Monument, a national park. Now, suburban homes line the road.
</P>
<P>
   Peaches have been grown in the Grand Valley for more than 100
years. The last century has changed not only how the crop is
harvested, but the product itself. Smaller trees, different
pesticides and changing labor pools have transformed how farmers
grow their peaches.
</P>
<P>
   A major difference starts with the actual trees, said Harold
Larson, a fruit pathologist with the Colorado State University's
Orchard Mesa Research Station. Trees are smaller, closer together
and so laden with fruit many need to be propped up with supports
once the harvest nears.
</P>
<P>
   The shorter trees mean easier harvests, Larson said. Pickers can
now work almost entirely from the ground, using shorter ladders
when needed.
</P>
<P>
   The chemicals used to keep the trees pest-free and healthy have
shifted as well.
</P>
<P>
   Growers used to spray the trees with pesticides such as sulfur,
arsenic and nicotine, Larson said. Technology has replaced those
chemicals with less toxic pesticides that only need to be used once
or twice a summer. And some pests can be lured into traps with
chemicals that mimic those bugs produce in the mating season.
</P>
<P>
   Suburban sprawl creates a separate problem for farmers like
Miller. The pesticides can drift in the air, Miller said, wafting
into neighboring homes.
</P>
<P>
   While the homes may be closer to the orchards, the sense of
community that once characterized the harvest has all but vanished,
said Harry Talbott, whose Orchard Mesa farm is one of the largest
in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the 1950s, when the whole town would come out for the
harvest, both Talbott and Miller said they can rarely find local
workers to pick and prune in the orchards. Local students would
rather work in the packing shed or even at a local restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``One year, I hired 24 high school students to pick cherries.
They couldn't pick a ton a day,'' Miller said. The next summer,
migrant workers from Mexico picked more than three times the amount
of the high school students. This year, Miller said, he paid
pickers by the hour rather than the pound, marking a subtle change
in the labor market.
</P>
<P>
   Peaches themselves have changed in response to consumers, who
now tend to eat a few peaches a week rather than canning dozens at
once.
</P>
<P>
   The harvest has spread to nearly the entire summer, giving
customers about three months of fresh peaches. Growers have shifted
from the traditional Elberta, an even-colored peach that separates
easily from its pit for canning, to tastier varieties that have a
more reddish tint and clings to the pit.

 &HT;    NCR'S FOUNDER WAS A PIONEER IN CARING FOR WORKERS
 &HT;    With LABOR. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial
categories for release Sunday, Sept. 3.
 &HT;    By LYNN HULSEY

<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ A hundred years ago, an eccentric and visionary
industrialist was setting a pattern for business and labor
practices now in common use.
</P>
<P>
   He was John H. Patterson, a co-founder of National Cash Register
Co. Patterson was famous for impulsive actions, often firing
executives who displeased him. But he also had a paternalistic
interest in workers' welfare.
</P>
<P>
   For many men and women, getting hired on at ``the Cash'' was the
ticket to a lifetime job at the world's largest producer of
mechanical cash registers.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson understood, long before his contemporaries, that a
happy, comfortable worker is a more productive one. He offered
higher wages and a cleaner, safer work environment than the typical
1900-era factory.
</P>
<P>
   Company cafeterias sold hot meals for less than it cost to
provide the food. The well-lit factories had first aid stations,
locker rooms and a ventilation system. Employees were even
permitted two baths a week on company time in company bathrooms.
</P>
<P>
   The hours were long. Employees typically put in 59 hours per
six-day week in 1902. Weekly wages for a messenger totaled $5 per
week, while a carpenter could expect to take home the handsome sum
of $14.85. By 1917, company records show that Patterson offered
time-and-a-half wages for work exceeding 48 hours a week.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton businessmen criticized Patterson for paying workers more
than they were worth.
</P>
<P>
   In 1900, paid vacations were still many years away, but
Patterson would load employees onto trains and take them on an
expenses-paid, out-of-state excursion.
</P>
<P>
   Total employment was 2,269, mostly men engaged in the
manufacture of cash registers at the Dayton headquarters. NCR also
operated far-flung international sales offices that used
Patterson's pioneering sales techniques, including quotas,
territories and regular communication with salesmen.
</P>
<P>
   According to local historian Claudia Watson, Patterson ``would
always say he was selling a system, not a cash register. He would
understand the term 'business solution'.''
</P>
<P>
   But the company once known for innovation failed to adapt
quickly to the world of microelectronics. It suffered a wrenching
period of downsizing, restructuring, a 1991 takeover by AT&AMP;T and,
at its worst, near collapse in the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of 1996, the company was again restructured. Its name
was changed back to NCR, and it began shedding unprofitable
businesses and rebuilding.
</P>
<P>
   Today, it is a high-technology, publicly traded company involved
in the collection, warehousing and analysis of data for retail,
financial and communications industries.

 &HT;    CHICKEN WASN'T ALWAYS AN EVERYDAY MEAL
 &HT;    With LABOR. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial
categories for release Sunday, Sept. 3.
 &HT;    By JOHNNY JOHNSON
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ It was in 1928 that Herbert Hoover's
presidential campaign coined the slogan ``a chicken in every pot.''
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of the 20th century, a chicken dinner was a
delicacy for most Americans. But over the years, improvements in
breeding and technology have created a poultry farming industry and
made chicken one of the main protein sources for the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``There just wasn't really a market for poultry meat'' in
Hoover's day, said David Alders, a local poultry producer for
Pilgrim's Pride. The main purpose of chickens back then was to
produce eggs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone did want to make a meal out of a spare chicken, the
bird would have to be caught, killed, plucked, dressed, cut up and
cooked.
</P>
<P>
   The next generation of consumers could buy a whole chicken at
the market, but they still had to dress, cut and cook it.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, people could buy only the cuts they desired. Better yet,
restaurants specializing in cooked chicken by the piece appeared,
and then became ubiquitous.
</P>
<P>
   America has gone from producing 34 million chickens in 1934 to 7
billion in 1994, and per-capita consumption has risen from less
than one pound to more than 81 pounds over the same period.
</P>
<P>
   These changes were made possible by radical improvements in the
poultry industry.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest changes has been in the birds themselves.
Chickens have been engineered to yield more meat, especially white
meat, in a shorter time, Alders said. Most people don't even think
of today's chickens as once having been a specific breed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Technology has transformed the poultry farm almost as
completely, slashing labor costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I operate a seven-house broiler farm, with no permanent help,
other than my 13-year-old son, and still have time to do many other
things,'' he said. ``That would have been unheard of several years
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Alders raises about 140,000 chickens a year. In the early days,
feed and water had to be put out manually, which was very
time-consuming, he said. Even after the invention of automated
</P>
<P>
   chain troughs, which could deliver feed throughout a house, feed
had to be manually distributed for baby chicks, which could not yet
reach the troughs.
</P>
<P>
   Today, many new houses are allowing growers to automatically
distribute feed on paper during the ``brooding stage,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other advancements include automated water and climate control
systems, Alders said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have computers that run fans, heaters and foggers,'' he
said. ``I never have to turn anything on manually.''
</P>
<P>
   Alders said automated ``chicken catchers'' that herd grown
chickens from the houses onto trucks for market are already being
advertised in many poultry magazines. Those could eventually cut
labor costs by 60 to 70 percent, he said.

 &HT;    BABY BOOMERS RE-INVENTING NOTION OF RETIREMENT
 &HT;    With LABOR. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial
categories for release Sunday, Sept. 3.
 &HT;    By DOUGLAS KALAJIAN

<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Retirement, which barely existed at the
dawn of the 20th century, could evolve quickly in the 21st under
the influence of the Baby Boomers.
</P>
<P>
   Civil War veterans were probably the first group to get
pensions, but retirement still wasn't even a dream for small-town
shopkeepers and farmers as the 20th century approached. Few had to
worry long: average life expectancy was 49 in 1900, and only about
one in 25 Americans was 65 or older.
</P>
<P>
   Calls for old-age security had become standard fare for labor
organizers and social reformers by the end of World War I, but they
were little heeded.
</P>
<P>
   Then, suddenly, the Crash of 1929 made retirement an unwelcome
reality for millions. The Great Depression spurred more than a
dozen states to enact old-age plans among other relief measures,
but most were restricted to the truly poor, and few paid enough to
live on.
</P>
<P>
   President Franklin Roosevelt proposed ``cradle to grave''
economic security, and Congress passed the Social Security Act
overwhelmingly in 1935. It took nearly two years to set up the
system before Ernest Ackerman, a streetcar motorman from Cleveland,
became the first person to apply for benefits. He got a lump-sum
payment: 17 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Today, older people are a force in American society like never
before. Already, one in eight Americans is 65 or older, and by 2030
it will be one in five.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to decades of strong overall economic growth and the
flowering of public and private pensions, the 65-to-74 age group
has the country's highest median net worth, $190,000 in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   And thanks to medical progress, older people can actively enjoy
their wealth. More than 72 percent of retirement-age Americans say
they are in good or excellent health, and a 65-year-old can expect
to live another 17.7 years.
</P>
<P>
   So barring an economic shock, the Baby Boomers who changed
America in the '60s are poised to change it again as they enter
their own 60s, a milestone just over five years away for the
generation's leading edge.
</P>
<P>
   One survey found that eight in 10 intend to keep working in
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leading-edge Baby Boomers are likely to work at least 20
hours a week,'' says Charles F. Longino Jr., professor of
gerontology at Wake Forest University in North Carolina. ``They'll
be returning for second careers. They'll be going back to school.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be much more mainstream to get up and go,'' said
R. Alan Fox, editor and publisher of Where to Retire magazine. ``It
will be like going away to college.''

   AUSTIN, Texas _ In the early 19th century, Abraham Lincoln and
his youthful peers attended so-called ``blab'' schools, where they
repeated their lessons aloud, over and over again.
</P>
<P>
   When Deborah Husak left public school more than 150 years later,
recitation and memorizing still were in vogue. But when Husak began
teaching in 1968, education was undergoing a fundamental change.
Students were being encouraged to think for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``A teacher is really more of a facilitator now,'' said Husak,
who teaches fourth grade at Mills Elementary School in South
Austin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Blackboards and chalk have given way to computers and overhead
projectors, and personal counseling, even ethics instruction, have
joined readin', writin', and 'rithmetic. The profession of an
estimated 3 million people nationwide has never been more
challenging _ even if the pay remains relatively low and respect is
a now-and-then thing.
</P>
<P>
   And there's the frightening new circumstance of being potential
targets of kids with guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that guns can be at your school makes the whole
environment very unstable,'' said Leyla Cohlmia, a chemistry
teacher at Austin High School.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, teachers must compete with television, radio, movies,
wireless communication, computers and the Internet _ especially the
Internet. These technology choices offer children a wealth of
sophisticated information that they expect to encounter in school.
They get angry and bored when they don't.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we have to be that much more prepared,'' Cohlmia said. ``We
never thought of talking to someone in England on the Internet
about their weather. We went to the encyclopedia.''
</P>
<P>
   Teachers have to be ready, as well, to act as emotional,
financial and even ethical counselors to the young survivors of the
disintegration of the two-parent family. At the same time, they're
teaching a new generation of immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mothers work,'' Husak said. ``Sometimes there's no one at
home. Sometimes kids speak the language, and sometimes they
don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet another problem that teachers must solve, said Jackson Pace,
who teaches physics and computer networking at LBJ High School, is
that while contemporary education encourages children to think for
themselves, employers increasingly complain that new graduates
can't do it. Pace believes the problem is caused by students'
overriding need to master multiple-choice tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids scope out the teachers, and the way they test, and forget
the content,'' Pace said. ``They don't know biology, but they're
making A's in biology. The multiple-guess test has got to go, if
you're trying to figure out if they can think.''

 &HT;    DEVELOPMENT, TECHNOLOGY BRINGS CHANGE TO FRUIT GROWERS
 &HT;    With LABOR. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial
categories for release Sunday, Sept. 3.

   GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. _ Jim Miller's Redlands orchard used to
sit among dozens of farms in the shadow of the Colorado National
Monument, a national park. Now, suburban homes line the road.
</P>
<P>
   Peaches have been grown in the Grand Valley for more than 100
years. The last century has changed not only how the crop is
harvested, but the product itself. Smaller trees, different
pesticides and changing labor pools have transformed how farmers
grow their peaches.
</P>
<P>
   A major difference starts with the actual trees, said Harold
Larson, a fruit pathologist with the Colorado State University's
Orchard Mesa Research Station. Trees are smaller, closer together
and so laden with fruit many need to be propped up with supports
once the harvest nears.
</P>
<P>
   The shorter trees mean easier harvests, Larson said. Pickers can
now work almost entirely from the ground, using shorter ladders
when needed.
</P>
<P>
   The chemicals used to keep the trees pest-free and healthy have
shifted as well.
</P>
<P>
   Growers used to spray the trees with pesticides such as sulfur,
arsenic and nicotine, Larson said. Technology has replaced those
chemicals with less toxic pesticides that only need to be used once
or twice a summer. And some pests can be lured into traps with
chemicals that mimic those bugs produce in the mating season.
</P>
<P>
   Suburban sprawl creates a separate problem for farmers like
Miller. The pesticides can drift in the air, Miller said, wafting
into neighboring homes.
</P>
<P>
   While the homes may be closer to the orchards, the sense of
community that once characterized the harvest has all but vanished,
said Harry Talbott, whose Orchard Mesa farm is one of the largest
in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the 1950s, when the whole town would come out for the
harvest, both Talbott and Miller said they can rarely find local
workers to pick and prune in the orchards. Local students would
rather work in the packing shed or even at a local restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``One year, I hired 24 high school students to pick cherries.
They couldn't pick a ton a day,'' Miller said. The next summer,
migrant workers from Mexico picked more than three times the amount
of the high school students. This year, Miller said, he paid
pickers by the hour rather than the pound, marking a subtle change
in the labor market.
</P>
<P>
   Peaches themselves have changed in response to consumers, who
now tend to eat a few peaches a week rather than canning dozens at
once.
</P>
<P>
   The harvest has spread to nearly the entire summer, giving
customers about three months of fresh peaches. Growers have shifted
from the traditional Elberta, an even-colored peach that separates
easily from its pit for canning, to tastier varieties that have a
more reddish tint and clings to the pit.

 &HT;    NCR'S FOUNDER WAS A PIONEER IN CARING FOR WORKERS
 &HT;    With LABOR. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial
categories for release Sunday, Sept. 3.
 &HT;    By LYNN HULSEY
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ A hundred years ago, an eccentric and visionary
industrialist was setting a pattern for business and labor
practices now in common use.
</P>
<P>
   He was John H. Patterson, a co-founder of National Cash Register
Co. Patterson was famous for impulsive actions, often firing
executives who displeased him. But he also had a paternalistic
interest in workers' welfare.
</P>
<P>
   For many men and women, getting hired on at ``the Cash'' was the
ticket to a lifetime job at the world's largest producer of
mechanical cash registers.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson understood, long before his contemporaries, that a
happy, comfortable worker is a more productive one. He offered
higher wages and a cleaner, safer work environment than the typical
1900-era factory.
</P>
<P>
   Company cafeterias sold hot meals for less than it cost to
provide the food. The well-lit factories had first aid stations,
locker rooms and a ventilation system. Employees were even
permitted two baths a week on company time in company bathrooms.
</P>
<P>
   The hours were long. Employees typically put in 59 hours per
six-day week in 1902. Weekly wages for a messenger totaled $5 per
week, while a carpenter could expect to take home the handsome sum
of $14.85. By 1917, company records show that Patterson offered
time-and-a-half wages for work exceeding 48 hours a week.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton businessmen criticized Patterson for paying workers more
than they were worth.
</P>
<P>
   In 1900, paid vacations were still many years away, but
Patterson would load employees onto trains and take them on an
expenses-paid, out-of-state excursion.
</P>
<P>
   Total employment was 2,269, mostly men engaged in the
manufacture of cash registers at the Dayton headquarters. NCR also
operated far-flung international sales offices that used
Patterson's pioneering sales techniques, including quotas,
territories and regular communication with salesmen.
</P>
<P>
   According to local historian Claudia Watson, Patterson ``would
always say he was selling a system, not a cash register. He would
understand the term 'business solution'.''
</P>
<P>
   But the company once known for innovation failed to adapt
quickly to the world of microelectronics. It suffered a wrenching
period of downsizing, restructuring, a 1991 takeover by AT&AMP;T and,
at its worst, near collapse in the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of 1996, the company was again restructured. Its name
was changed back to NCR, and it began shedding unprofitable
businesses and rebuilding.
</P>
<P>
   Today, it is a high-technology, publicly traded company involved
in the collection, warehousing and analysis of data for retail,
financial and communications industries.

 &HT;    CHICKEN WASN'T ALWAYS AN EVERYDAY MEAL
 &HT;    With LABOR. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial
categories for release Sunday, Sept. 3.
 &HT;    By JOHNNY JOHNSON
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ It was in 1928 that Herbert Hoover's
presidential campaign coined the slogan ``a chicken in every pot.''
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of the 20th century, a chicken dinner was a
delicacy for most Americans. But over the years, improvements in
breeding and technology have created a poultry farming industry and
made chicken one of the main protein sources for the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``There just wasn't really a market for poultry meat'' in
Hoover's day, said David Alders, a local poultry producer for
Pilgrim's Pride. The main purpose of chickens back then was to
produce eggs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone did want to make a meal out of a spare chicken, the
bird would have to be caught, killed, plucked, dressed, cut up and
cooked.
</P>
<P>
   The next generation of consumers could buy a whole chicken at
the market, but they still had to dress, cut and cook it.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, people could buy only the cuts they desired. Better yet,
restaurants specializing in cooked chicken by the piece appeared,
and then became ubiquitous.
</P>
<P>
   America has gone from producing 34 million chickens in 1934 to 7
billion in 1994, and per-capita consumption has risen from less
than one pound to more than 81 pounds over the same period.
</P>
<P>
   These changes were made possible by radical improvements in the
poultry industry.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest changes has been in the birds themselves.
Chickens have been engineered to yield more meat, especially white
meat, in a shorter time, Alders said. Most people don't even think
of today's chickens as once having been a specific breed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Technology has transformed the poultry farm almost as
completely, slashing labor costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I operate a seven-house broiler farm, with no permanent help,
other than my 13-year-old son, and still have time to do many other
things,'' he said. ``That would have been unheard of several years
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Alders raises about 140,000 chickens a year. In the early days,
feed and water had to be put out manually, which was very
time-consuming, he said. Even after the invention of automated
</P>
<P>
   chain troughs, which could deliver feed throughout a house, feed
had to be manually distributed for baby chicks, which could not yet
reach the troughs.
</P>
<P>
   Today, many new houses are allowing growers to automatically
distribute feed on paper during the ``brooding stage,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other advancements include automated water and climate control
systems, Alders said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have computers that run fans, heaters and foggers,'' he
said. ``I never have to turn anything on manually.''
</P>
<P>
   Alders said automated ``chicken catchers'' that herd grown
chickens from the houses onto trucks for market are already being
advertised in many poultry magazines. Those could eventually cut
labor costs by 60 to 70 percent, he said.

 &HT;    RAILROADS HAVE SHRUNK, BUT JOBS LARGELY THE SAME
 &HT;    With LABOR. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial

<P>
   ATLANTA _ When retired Southern Railroad machinist Bill Purdie
began his career in 1936, old-timers could remember the Civil War,
and the railroad was still the main mode of long-distance travel.
</P>
<P>
   His starting salary? Twenty-two and half cents an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Purdie spent the next several decades doing pretty much the same
thing: making and repairing steam engine parts.
</P>
<P>
   The steam engine required a lot of welding and drilling holes
and making bolts, parts and castings, said Purdie, now an
85-year-old retiree. ``It was hard work and heavy repair.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as they did a century ago, laborers still build, repair and
maintain the railroad engines, equipment and lines, and conductors
still oversee business on the train.
</P>
<P>
   ``Railroading, in general, is fundamentally about the same job
as years ago,'' said conductor Jack Hunt, 46.
</P>
<P>
   Aboard the Crescent, an Amtrak train that links New Orleans and
New York, conductor Hunt recently sat down in the lounge car and
penciled in numbers on his ``turnover sheet'' and ``delay report,''
just as historians say early conductors did in the mid-1800s.
</P>
<P>
   The only new technology Hunt regularly uses on the job is his
cell phone, which replaced his radio last year as his tool for
contacting the engineers at approaching stations. While radios had
limited frequencies, he said, cell phones almost guarantee
immediate contact.
</P>
<P>
   The most significant change in railroad work can be found in the
type of labor required to build a train or a railroad line, said
Lesa(cq) Campbell, a historian with the Southeastern Railway Museum
in Duluth, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Around the turn of the century, railroad tracks were built with
the brawn of outdoor laborers. But today, most of the line work now
involves repair and maintenance. Instead of 30 work gang members
driving spikes, one by one, a crew of about six skilled workers
operates hydraulic equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The job of engine shop and roundhouse workers also has became
less labor-intensive in the second half of the century. After the
diesel engine replaced steam in the 1950s, their work evolved into
what now is primarily parts assembly.
</P>
<P>
   The number of workers needed to operate the railroads has
declined sharply from earlier years. Currently, about 24,000
employees work for Amtrak, according to spokesman Steven
Taubenkibel. Another 200,000 work for the four major freight
railroad companies _ CSX and Norfolk Southern in the East, and
Burlington Northern Santa Fe and Union-Pacific in the West.
</P>
<P>
   According to Campbell, 1.8 million people worked for the
railroads in 1917, one of the peak years for the industry.

 &HT;    BABY BOOMERS RE-INVENTING NOTION OF RETIREMENT
 &HT;    With LABOR. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial
categories for release Sunday, Sept. 3.

<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Retirement, which barely existed at the
dawn of the 20th century, could evolve quickly in the 21st under
the influence of the Baby Boomers.
</P>
<P>
   Civil War veterans were probably the first group to get
pensions, but retirement still wasn't even a dream for small-town
shopkeepers and farmers as the 20th century approached. Few had to
worry long: average life expectancy was 49 in 1900, and only about
one in 25 Americans was 65 or older.
</P>
<P>
   Calls for old-age security had become standard fare for labor
organizers and social reformers by the end of World War I, but they
were little heeded.
</P>
<P>
   Then, suddenly, the Crash of 1929 made retirement an unwelcome
reality for millions. The Great Depression spurred more than a
dozen states to enact old-age plans among other relief measures,
but most were restricted to the truly poor, and few paid enough to
live on.
</P>
<P>
   President Franklin Roosevelt proposed ``cradle to grave''
economic security, and Congress passed the Social Security Act
overwhelmingly in 1935. It took nearly two years to set up the
system before Ernest Ackerman, a streetcar motorman from Cleveland,
became the first person to apply for benefits. He got a lump-sum
payment: 17 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Today, older people are a force in American society like never
before. Already, one in eight Americans is 65 or older, and by 2030
it will be one in five.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to decades of strong overall economic growth and the
flowering of public and private pensions, the 65-to-74 agemedian
net worth, $190,000 in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   And thanks to medical progress, older people can actively enjoy
their wealth. More than 72 percent of retirement-age Americans say
they are in good or excellent health, and a 65-year-old can expect
to live another 17.7 years.
</P>
<P>
   So barring an economic shock, the Baby Boomers who changed
America in the '60s are poised to change it again as they enter
their own 60s, a milestone just over five years away for the
generation's leading edge.
</P>
<P>
   One survey found that eight in 10 intend to keep working in
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leading-edge Baby Boomers are likely to work at least 20
hours a week,'' says Charles F. Longino Jr., professor of
gerontology at Wake Forest University in North Carolina. ``They'll
be returning for second careers. They'll be going back to school.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be much more mainstream to get up and go,'' said
R. Alan Fox, editor and publisher of Where to Retire magazine. ``It
will be like going away to college.''

 &HT;    TECHNOLOGY, SOCIAL FACTORS HAVE RESHAPED THE TEACHER'S JOB
 &HT;    With LABOR. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial
categories for release Sunday, Sept. 3.
 &HT;    By DICK STANLEY

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In the early 19th century, Abraham Lincoln and
his youthful peers attended so-called ``blab'' schools, where they
repeated their lessons aloud, over and over again.
</P>
<P>
   When Deborah Husak left public school more than 150 years later,
recitation and memorizing still were in vogue. But when Husak began
teaching in 1968, education was undergoing a fundamental change.
Students were being encouraged to think for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``A teacher is really more of a facilitator now,'' said Husak,
who teaches fourth grade at Mills Elementary School in South
Austin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Blackboards and chalk have given way to computers and overhead
projectors, and personal counseling, even ethics instruction, have
joined readin', writin', and 'rithmetic. The profession of an
estimated 3 million people nationwide has never been more
challenging _ even if the pay remains relatively low and respect is
a now-and-then thing.
</P>
<P>
   And there's the frightening new circumstance of being potential
targets of kids with guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that guns can be at your school makes the whole
environment very unstable,'' said Leyla Cohlmia, a chemistry
teacher at Austin High School.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, teachers must compete with television, radio, movies,
wireless communication, computers and the Internet _ especially the
Internet. These technology choices offer children a wealth of
sophisticated information that they expect to encounter in school.
They get angry and bored when they don't.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we have to be that much more prepared,'' Cohlmia said. ``We
never thought of talking to someone in England on the Internet
about their weather. We went to the encyclopedia.''
</P>
<P>
   Teachers have to be ready, as well, to act as emotional,
financial and even ethical counselors to the young survivors of the
disintegration of the two-parent family. At the same time, they're
teaching a new generation of immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mothers work,'' Husak said. ``Sometimes there's no one at
home. Sometimes kids speak the language, and sometimes they
don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet another problem that teachers must solve, said Jackson Pace,
who teaches physics and computer networking at LBJ High School, is
that while contemporary education encourages children to think for
themselves, employers increasingly complain that new graduates
can't do it. Pace believes the problem is caused by students'
overriding need to master multiple-choice tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids scope out the teachers, and the way they test, and forget
the content,'' Pace said. ``They don't know biology, but they're
making A's in biology. The multiple-guess test has got to go, if
you're trying to figure out if they can think.''

   Ice Cubes and Ice Ages
</P>
<P>
   A tray of ice cubes is something of a closed system. Left on the
kitchen counter on a hot summer day, the ice turns to liquid water.
Put back in the freezer, the liquid water turns back to ice. But
the number of water molecules in the tray remains more or less
constant (unless, of course, a couple of cubes are plopped into a
drink).
</P>
<P>
   This basic fact is a key to understanding how icy the earth got
in the last ice age 200 centuries ago. As the earth got colder, the
ice thickened and spread, with a corresponding drop in the amount
of water in the oceans. While how far the ice sheet extended is
fairly well known, a reliable measurement of the sea level at that
time would allow calculation of just how thick it got, and when.
</P>
<P>
   Now researchers from the Australian National University in
Canberra, analyzing sediment cores from an area off the continent's
northern coast that was partly exposed back then, have made what is
considered the first such reliable measurement. The sea level, they
report in the journal Nature, reached its low point of 425 feet to
440 feet below the present level from about 22,000 to 19,000 years
ago. That means that the volume of land-based ice at the time was
at its maximum _ roughly 12 million cubic miles more ice than
exists now.
</P>
<P>
   While the research does not show how all that ice was
distributed, it does indicate that the ice sheets reached some
level of equilibrium and stability. But the data also shows that
19,000 years ago, the ice lost its stability rather quickly,
perhaps due to major climate change. About 10 percent of the ice
melted away in just a few hundred years.
</P>
<P>
   Shakespeare in the Sky
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers can get as excited as first-time parents when they
discover new objects in the solar system. It just takes a lot
longer to name them. The International Astronomical Union this
month approved names for several moons of Uranus, some of which
were discovered in 1997. The union is the international authority
for names, and only offers approvals every three years.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike moons of other planets, which are named for characters
from classical mythology, most of the names from Uranus' moons have
been taken from Shakespeare. The new names continue this tradition,
with Caliban, Prospero and Stephano, among others, joining Ariel,
Oberon, Titania and others in the cast.
</P>
<P>
   The astronomical union also approved names for various other
bodies and features in the solar system, including Petit-Prince for
the tiny satellite orbiting the asteroid Eugenia and Lolita, Cupid,
Don Quixote and other love-struck names for features on Eros, the
asteroid that is currently being studied by the Near Earth Asteroid
Rendezvous spacecraft. The group also approved the naming of a
60-mile-wide crater on Mars for Carl Sagan.
</P>
<P>
   Arsenic and Old Wood
</P>
<P>
   The use of pressure-treated lumber for decks, playground
equipment and other structures has become widespread, and with good
reason. The chemicals added to the lumber, often chromated copper
arsenate, or CCA, help it withstand the effects of insects and
fungi far longer than untreated wood.
</P>
<P>
   But CCA contains, among other things, chromium and arsenic, both
of which are toxic. So one concern is what happens when old
pressure-treated wood is disposed of. Manufacturers warn against
burning it, but undoubtedly some old wood makes its way to
incinerators where the arsenic, in particular, forms very small
particles that may not be trapped by pollution control equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Now, researchers at the University of Florida say they have come
up with a technique that may make the incineration of treated
lumber less of a problem. By introducing limestone into the
incineration process, the researchers say, the arsenic forms much
larger particles, which wind up in waste ash.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers note that their work is only in the laboratory
phase, and much more research must be done.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Are there really caterpillars that scream to protect
themselves? If so what types? Can we hear the sound they make?
</P>
<P>
   A. While they do not exactly scream, some caterpillars have
noise-making organs, and the sound they produce is used to call in
troops of ants to protect them from predatory wasps. The noise has
an average frequency of 1,877 hertz, which would be audible to
human ears if it were not so very faint.
</P>
<P>
   Some noisy butterfly larvae species belong to the Riodinid
family and live in the tropical rain forests of the New World.
Members of the Lycinid family, which has a worldwide range, also
make sounds, for similar purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The caterpillars' sound-producing organs and their relationship
with ants were first reported by Dr. Philip DeVries in research
published in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   There are actually two sets of organs: just behind the head is a
pair of grooved rods, and rows of projections resembling guitar
picks protrude from the top of the head. DeVries described the
noise as being like the sound of a comb running over the edge of a
table.
</P>
<P>
   The caterpillars reward the ants with amino acid secretions that
the ants feed on.
</P>

&HT;     CALIF. COLLEGE STUDENT CHARGED WITH COMMITTING A HATE CRIME
AGAINST GAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By SCOTT WINOKUR  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A college student has been charged with a hate
crime after allegedly calling two men standing in front of a Los
Gatos, Calif., hair salon ``faggots'' and assaulting one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Ellsworth, 21, a senior majoring in business economics at
the University of California at Santa Barbara, was arrested early
Friday morning and charged with battery and interference with the
exercise of civil rights. He was booked into the Santa Clara County
jail and released four hours later, police said.
</P>
<P>
   A Los Gatos police spokesman said it was the first time in at
least 12 years that an alleged hate crime had occurred in Los
Gatos.
</P>
<P>
   Both charges are misdemeanors, but the civil rights charge falls
under the state's hate-crime statute, increasing possible
penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Ellsworth and his attorney, Joe O'Sullivan of San Francisco,
denied the charges Saturday. Ellsworth said he was shocked to learn
that Los Gatos police had made the charges public.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea of the severity of the situation,'' he said when
contacted by a reporter. ``In my opinion, I was just defending
myself.'' He claimed one of the alleged victims had punched him
while the other held him in a headlock.
</P>
<P>
   Ellsworth said he was too stunned to provide further details.
But he said he never used the word ``faggots'' or said anything at
all, and he said he had no hostility toward homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Los Gates/Monte Sereno Police Department
statement, the alleged altercation occurred a few minutes before 2
a.m. Friday in front of the hair salon.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the victim, who was not named, was talking to his
brother about ``career plans after graduation from cosmetology
school'' when Ellsworth and two other men approached them and
called them ``faggots.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellsworth allegedly attacked the victim, injuring his jaw and
knees, police said, adding that the three men then fled but
Ellsworth was stopped and arrested soon afterward.
</P>
<P>
   According to O'Sullivan, the word ``faggots'' may have been used
but not by Ellsworth.
</P>
<P>
   O'Sullivan confirmed that the young man had fled the scene, but
said the alleged victim and his brother pursued him and then
attacked him, chipping one of his teeth.
</P>
<P>
   ``My client walked away,'' O'Sullivan said. ``These two
individuals who were apparently gay went after him because they
were bigger. My client ran. They chased him. He made a stand and
that's when they engaged in the fighting and the police rolled up.
If any pejorative words were used, they were not used by Peter.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellsworth declined to say who might have used the derogatory
work. Nor would he comment when asked if he believed he had been
mistakenly identified.
</P>
<P>
   Early this year, the Santa Clara County Sheriff's Office
reported 11 hate crimes of all kinds in 1999 in the county,
excluding San Jose. That city's police department reported 43 in
1998, the last year for which it had data.

   CONSEQUENCES: Hysterectomy and Risk of Incontinence
</P>
<P>
   About 600,000 women a year have hysterectomies in the United
States, usually only after a long and difficult consideration of
the consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Now there is something else for them to think about: women who
have had hysterectomies have a substantially higher risk of having
urinary incontinence in later years, a new study reports.
</P>
<P>
   Writing in The Lancet, the researchers say it appears that women
who have had the surgery have a 60 percent greater risk of being
incontinent by the time they are 60. The onset, they said, can be
well after the surgery, since most women who have hysterectomies do
so in their 40s or 50s.
</P>
<P>
   The operation is the second most common major surgical procedure
for women, said the researchers, from the University of California
at San Francisco. Most of the time, it is done to treat
noncancerous but painful conditions like fibroids.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers based their findings on a review of 12 previous
studies. They said it was unclear why the incontinence set in so
long after the surgery, but noted that incontinence caused by
childbirth also tended to begin later.
</P>
<P>
   The lead author, Dr. Jeanette Brown, said in a statement that
women contemplating hysterectomies need to weigh the difficulties
of incontinence with their current levels of discomfort.
</P>
<P>
   TREATMENT: Report Questions Antibiotics for Earache
</P>
<P>
   With rates of resistance to antibiotics growing in this country,
many doctors have long advocated a more measured hand when it comes
to dispensing the drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a new study suggests that when it comes to one of the
conditions for which antibiotics are often dispensed _ children's
earaches _ the treatment may be of little value.
</P>
<P>
   A study sponsored by the federal Agency for Healthcare Research
and Quality has found that almost two-thirds of children with acute
otitis media, or middle-ear infection, recover from pain and fever
within 24 hours of diagnosis _ without antibiotics. And 80 percent
recover in one to seven days, the study found.
</P>
<P>
   Of the children given antibiotics, up to 93 percent recover
during the first week.
</P>
<P>
   The report also found that amoxicillin, long a staple of
ear-infection treatment, was about as effective as newer, more
expensive antibiotics and caused fewer side effects. And for
children 2 and older, the report said, there appeared to be no
difference between taking a drug for five days or for seven.
</P>
<P>
   The study was based on a review of studies done of children age
four weeks to 18 years, from 1964 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
   About 5 million episodes of acute otitis media occur in the
United States each year and are routinely treated with antibiotics.
The report notes that in other countries, like the Netherlands,
doctors prefer a method known as ``watchful waiting'' in children
over 2. Only if the infection does not clear up in one or two days
do they administer an antibiotic.
</P>
<P>
   The rate of resistance to antibiotics in the Netherlands is
about 1 percent. In the United States, it is about 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   IN THE LAB: Simpler Monitoring Device for Diabetics
</P>
<P>
   For many diabetics, the task of monitoring their blood-glucose
levels is an onerous one.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of diabetics need to take blood samples several times a
day by piercing their fingers _ a time-consuming, somewhat painful
practice that makes some patients less diligent than they should be
about monitoring their conditions.
</P>
<P>
   But a recent study suggests that things may become easier.
Writing in the journal Diabetes Technology and Therapeutics,
researchers said diabetics might one day be able to monitor glucose
levels by passing a beam of infrared light through the skin. The
researchers are from Ohio State University and the University of
Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Although earlier studies had suggested that the technique might
work, this was the first to prove it reliable, said the lead
author, Dr. Gary Small of Ohio State.
</P>
<P>
   Because various molecules in the blood, including glucose,
absorb differing frequencies of light, the scientists were able to
measure the concentration of glucose in the diabetics.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it will be some time before diabetics will be able to
benefit. Researchers need to develop much smaller and less
expensive monitoring units than the ones used in the test (they
hope to produce models about the size of a portable CD player and
costing about $500).
</P>
<P>
   OUTCOMES: Ear Implants May Offer Social Benefits
</P>
<P>
   Cochlear implants have been used for almost a decade to help
thousands of profoundly deaf children, but some two-thirds of
insurance companies are often unwilling to pay, citing a lack of
evidence that the devices are cost-effective.
</P>
<P>
   A new study, however, reports that over the course of a deaf
person's life, the implants can save more than $50,000 in costs
associated with the disability. It also found that the devices,
used in children who are not helped by conventional hearing aids,
have made a difference in the lives of the children using them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cochlear implants in profoundly deaf children have a positive
effect on quality of life, at reasonable direct costs, and appear
to result in a net saving to society,'' researchers at Johns
Hopkins University wrote in a recent issue of the Journal of the
American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers based their conclusions on a study of 78
families of deaf children.
</P>
<P>
   Although the cost of the implants is well over $10,000, the cost
to society of someone who develops profound deafness as a young
child is believed to be over $1 million, the report said. The
figure includes special education and reduced work productivity.

&HT;     CORRUPTION TRIAL MAY HINGE ON A SINGLE SPANISH WORD 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By BONNIE PFISTER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAREDO, Texas _ When is a fix not a fix? Perhaps when it's an
``arreglo,'' a word that earns 15 column inches in the Oxford
Spanish Dictionary.
</P>
<P>
   As a verb, ``arreglar'' can mean to repair, mend, tidy up, take
care of, deal with, sort out. The word, or one of its derivatives,
is heard dozens of times on audiotapes that federal prosecutors
have entered as evidence in a public corruption trial involving
five men with close ties to the Webb County district attorney's
office.
</P>
<P>
   The ambiguous meaning of the word is a nuanced detail upon which
attorneys for one of the five defendants hope they can trip up the
prosecution's case.
</P>
<P>
   FBI translators transcribed the tapes into written, bilingual
renderings in which, defense attorneys asserted in opening
arguments, the word arreglo nearly always is translated into the
English word ``fix'' _ as in fixing a case.
</P>
<P>
   The five are accused of using their relationships with the
district attorney's office to solicit $200,000 in bribes from
criminal defendants on promises of reducing or dismissing those
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors say the men conspired to fix 32 drug, weapon
and drunken driving cases from 1992 through 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants include two employees of the local district
attorney's office, a bail bondsman and the father and brother of
sitting District Attorney Joe Rubio. The recently re-elected Rubio
has not been charged and has said he knew nothing of such alleged
schemes.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors are not building their case around debates about the
precise meaning of arreglo. Rather, they argue that fixing, as in
``taking care of'' or ``arranging,'' was carried out with only one
result in mind: the buying and selling of justice in the South
Texas city of Laredo.
</P>
<P>
   But the lack of clarity surrounding the meaning underscores the
question that jurors must ponder: Were the defendants selling
justice, or simply trying to expedite cases in an overloaded court
system?
</P>
<P>
   Along with hours of direct testimony, the 16-person panel of
jurors and alternates has listened to snippets of more than 100
conversations taped by FBI informants.
</P>
<P>
   The stories those tapes tell are laced throughout with indirect
references to the alleged crimes. The banter heard is a combination
of Spanish and the Texas-Mexico dialect of the border that
effortlessly glides from Spanish to English and back again.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors played the tapes in the cavernous, 90-year-old
courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone, from jurors to U.S. District Judge George Kazen,
strained to hear. Even native speakers of border Tex-Mex who
listened from the gallery admitted they were flummoxed, largely
because they could not hear the taped conversations.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors then outfitted trial participants, including the
jury, with headsets that, presumably, made the conversations easier
to hear.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors listened intently, following along with the transcripts,
the 4-inch-thick documents perched on their knees.
</P>
<P>
   Kazen has stressed to the panel that the tapes _ not the
FBI-prepared transcripts _ are the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   So how will jurors, all residents of a county that is 94 percent
Hispanic and where the Tex-Mex dialect is common, interpret arreglo
and the charges that have been leveled against the defendants?
</P>
<P>
   Was one of the accused, bail bondsman Jesse Castaneda, arranging
for criminal suspects to get out of jail on bond under law, or was
he ``fixing'' the case in a sinister sense?
</P>
<P>
   A wise listener will pay attention to the larger conversation,
said Houston-based Ramon de Villar, who has served on the board of
examiners of interpreters for the federal court system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Words have to be used in context,'' de Villar said. ``It's not
an exact science. It's not mathematics.''
</P>
<P>
   Arreglo as a noun, for instance, usually means arrangement. It
also can signify plea bargain.
</P>
<P>
   While Chinese has dialects that are radically different, Spanish
is more uniform, de Villar said.
</P>
<P>
   But in the Americas, inconsistencies tend to arise around themes
that didn't exist when European conquistadors brought their
language here.
</P>
<P>
   This is evident in the automotive field and technology, de
Villar said, where different words can be used to convey the same
concept. It also is found in the courts, particularly because not
all Latin American countries have grand juries, jury trials or even
the concept of innocent until proven guilty.
</P>
<P>
   In courtrooms where interpreters simultaneously translate, much
time is lost because, as de Villar said, about 30 percent more
words are needed in Spanish to say the same thing in English.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, U.S. District Judge Filemon Vela of Brownsville
conducts guilty-plea hearings in Spanish whenever possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always with the consent of everyone present, and the
court interpreter is repeating everything to the court reporter in
English,'' Vela said.
</P>
<P>
   The unorthodox proceeding is a time-saving alternative, Vela
said. Otherwise, the judge, who is fully bilingual, would have to
question the witness in English, wait for the interpreter to
translate it to Spanish, wait for a reply, then move back into
English.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio-based lawyer George Shaffer was born in Mexico City
and has practiced criminal law in Texas for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   He said he sometimes enjoys an advantage over his opposing
counsel on the half-dozen occasions when he has taken issue with a
court interpreter's phrasing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you just lose something in the translation, or the
emphasis comes out differently,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of arreglo, he said, ``It's certainly a term that
could be ambiguous. It's not fair to say that it always means one
thing and not another.''
</P>
<P>
   As the trial in Laredo proceeds, that will be for the jury to
determine.

   CHEMICAL WEAPONS CLEANUP
</P>
<P>
   Weapons experts at the Deseret Chemical Depot in Tooele, Utah,
are racing to destroy the last of 27 million pounds of poison gas.
</P>
<P>
   About 33 percent has been incinerated, but the clock is ticking.
Aging artillery shells filled with lung-searing mustard gas and
paralyzing sarin nerve gas have begun to leak. As a precaution,
containers stored outdoors were recently moved into earthen
``igloos.'' These enclosures proved their worth in June, when three
155 mm artillery shells began leaking mustard gas. The gas did not
escape.
</P>
<P>
   Not all releases have been contained inside the plant, which is
located about an hour's drive from Salt Lake City, site of the 2002
Winter Olympics. In May, a baby-aspirin quantity of sarin leaked
from the incinerator after an emergency shutdown.
</P>
<P>
   Although no one was injured, the airborne release proved
embarrassing for Judge Tena Campbell. In April, she ruled against a
lawsuit that sought to close down the plant. The suit was filed by
environmentalists who feared an accidental incinerator release
might occur.
</P>
<P>
   The Tooele installation is the largest of eight poison gas bomb
stockpiles in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   GAS TANKS LIGHTEN UP
</P>
<P>
   Buses that run on compressed natural gas would be more
attractive if they would lose some weight. Empty, a typical
300-gallon fuel system for a bus tips the scales at about 3,400
pounds, according to French tank maker Ullit.
</P>
<P>
   The company says that the same system using its newest plastic
tanks weighs only 1,250 pounds. The interior of the tank is a
thermoplastic liner, surrounded by a carbon-fiber and epoxy matrix.
</P>
<P>
   Ullit says that 33-gallon tanks can be pressurized to 250 bars
100,000 times, without showing any sign of damage. Corrosion-proof,
they always look new. The lightweight tanks will make their North
American debut in Mexico City this year.
</P>
<P>
   NEW FUSION REACTOR HEATS UP
</P>
<P>
   Hopes for a practical fusion reactor have heated up following
the startup of the National Spherical Torus Experiment, housed at
the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   NSTX is smaller and uses a lower magnetic field than earlier
devices. ``The modest magnetic field allows simplified and flexible
designs that ease upgrades,'' says a lab spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Ultrahigh temperatures inside fusion reactors cause lightweight
isotopes of hydrogen to fuse into heavier helium, thus releasing
massive quantities of energy. Unlike fission or atom-splitting
reactors, fusion reactors create virtually no radioactive residue.
</P>
<P>
   Hydrogen isotopes are also plentiful in seawater, and relatively
easy to extract. If tests are successful, the lab will propose
building an advanced spherical torus device that would be fueled
with deuterium and tritium. It would be built in the space vacated
by the lab's historic Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor, which is being
dismantled.
</P>
<P>
   GROW YOURSELF A NEW LIVER
</P>
<P>
   Here's a breakthrough worth toasting. Doctors at New York
University School of Medicine have grown liver tissue from bone
marrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about a significant amount of functional liver
tissue, up to 40 percent in one case,'' says Neil Theise, who led
the research team.
</P>
<P>
   The finding has broad implications for transplant surgery. Stem
cells in marrow might be coaxed to grow into any organ. And donors
don't reject their own tissue.
</P>
<P>
   SAILING INTO THE COSMOS
</P>
<P>
   NASA's first interstellar probe will borrow the technology that
brought Christopher Columbus to the New World _ the sail.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of catching the ocean breezes, the sail will capture
sunlight by driving a spacecraft to our nearest neighbor, Alpha
Centauri, which is 4.3 light-years away. ``Thin, reflective sails
could be propelled through space just as the wind pushes
sailboats,'' says a spokesman for the NASA Advanced Space
Transportation program based at the Marshall Space Flight Center in
Huntsville, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   To catch enough energy for the trip, the sail will span about
one-quarter of a mile. Carbon fiber is the top candidate for
sailcloth. The unnamed probe is scheduled to launch in 2010.
</P>
<P>
   STICK A LASER IN YOUR MOUTH
</P>
<P>
   The luxury-car price tags on dental lasers are a big part of the
reason only one in five dentists has adopted the painless tool.
</P>
<P>
   A dual-power laser could make it more economically attractive
for dentists to switch. Developed by NASA and two private
companies, the laser uses the same hardware to produce two
wavelengths of light. One is useful for drilling teeth, the other
for cutting gums. These two separate lasers now cost about $25,000
and $38,000, respectively. The dual-action laser will sell for
$30,000. FDA approval is expected sometime next year.

   SUBARU LEGACY OUTBACK LIMITED

lot of Subaru Outbacks. Now that we're conscious of that little
fact, we can't help but notice them all around us as we drive ours.
And as we drive ours day in and day out, we understand why the car
is so popular here.
</P>
<P>
   The Outback is a highly competent, all-season, all-weather road
guerrilla. The car is innocuous enough to slide through traffic
without attracting unwanted attention. It's utilitarian enough to
securely swallow whatever you might need to port home from Ikea
_what doesn't fit inside straps to the roof rack. And since the
rear seats fold almost flat with no hassle, those seatbacks go up
and down like a Duncan yo-yo as demands warrant.
</P>
<P>
   Folding those seatbacks fully flat, however, usually doesn't
seem worth the effort: The three rear headrests must be removed and
stowed somewhere, and the seat bottoms, when tumbled up and
forward, force the front seats upright and forward. The gain in
real cargo volume is minimal.
</P>
<P>
   Those rear-seat headrests, however, have become a sore spot for
some of our shorter drivers who find rearward vision totally
lacking when all three of those headrests are in place atop the
seatback.
</P>
<P>
   Another sore spot for everyone is the front seatbelts. From day
one, the seatbelts had fairly lazy retractors, and both driver and
passenger would often slam their doors on the seatbelts because
they were hanging out of the car. Eventually, both front seatbelts
lost their latch positioning buttons as they got crushed in the
door. That means that each time you put on the seatbelt, you've got
to fish around to find the latch that has slid down the belt to the
floor. Both belts have been replaced under warranty. So far their
retractors have a little more snap than the originals did.
</P>
<P>
   Other than that, despite the cars lack of verve, we remain
impressed by its comfort, handling and sure-footed stability. And
so far not one squeak, rattle or bolt out of place.

   MERCEDES-BENZ S500
</P>
<P>
   Someone asked us recently what it was like driving an S-Class
Mercedes. It's like driving a bank safe on wheels. This is a car
that feels as if it were carved out of a single billet of solid
steel. We'd even use the phrase ``tanklike'' except that it would
be a disservice to the S500. It feels as solid as a tank, yes, but
it's as nimble and agile as any sport sedan you're likely to run
into, very different from an Abrams.
</P>
<P>
   It's also fast, thanks to its 302-hp V8 engine and five-speed
automatic transmission. Here's a car that wants to act like half
its size and weight.
</P>
<P>
   In the December 1999 issue, in our judges' citation for the
S-Class Design &AMP; Engineering Award, we said that you could make a
case for the S500 being the best car ever made. After spending
several months and almost 10,000 miles in the car, we still feel
that way. But, of course, no car is perfect and the S500 is no
exception.
</P>
<P>
   We've driven right through the recommended service interval and
a date with the dealer's service department is imminent. One thing
we'll ask them to check is the climate control system. In cold
weather, we've had to set the temperature control on 78 to keep the
interior comfortable. Now that it's turned warm, a 63 setting is
needed to keep it cool. Definitely not normal.
</P>

   TOYOTA AVALON XLS
</P>
<P>
   Avalon is kind of a no-name brand of six-passenger sedan and a
Johnny-come-lately to the market. Its styling lines can be called
eye-catching only because they are different. Its angular surfaces
contrast sharply against the smoothly rounded bodies of competitor
sedans like a Ford Taurus. But Avalon is more than just a different
shape.
</P>
<P>
   Word has gotten around, if you gauge appeal by the number of
cars sold. In Avalon's case, sales in the first half of 2000, with
its new body shape, doubled the level of a year ago. More
impressive, Avalon is currently outselling many of the more
familiar full-size six-passenger sedans _ cars like Bonneville,
Crown Victoria and both Chryslers.
</P>
<P>
   For our part, the popularity is no surprise. Avalon offers full
six-passenger roominess in a cabin as quiet as some of today's most
expensive sedans. One key to the low noise level is the smoothness
of the drivetrain, especially the engine noise levels. In
car-to-car comparisons with its peers, Avalon should rank near the
best in noise control. That holds true even when matched against
many models of the pricey breed.
</P>
<P>
   In nearly 15,000 miles of mixed city and highway driving, the
Avalon still maintains this blend of smoothness and quietness. Only
on the roughest roads will the body show some sign of flex. Even
then, rattle and shake are minimal and brief.
</P>
<P>
   Fuel economy is commensurate with the Avalon's size and power.
We ran a consistent 23.9 mpg, with a high of close to 25 mpg during
steady freeway drives. Plus, the Avalon thrives quite nicely on a
diet of regular-grade fuel, a bonus in these days of higher pump
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Surprising is the almost $90 we had to fork over for a scheduled
10,000-mile maintenance and checkup. The work was performed at
McInerney Toyota dealership in suburban Detroit where the charge
included $47.20 for labor. Labor was essentially a simple change of
oil and filter.
</P>

<P>
   LINCOLN LS
</P>
<P>
   The more we drive the Lincoln LS in our test fleet, the more we
appreciate it. When was the last time anyone could say that a
Lincoln _ any Lincoln _ was fun to drive? Probably not since the
1939 Lincoln Zephyr model was introduced. The ad copywriter for the
LS said it all: ``Wood. Leather. Adrenaline.''
</P>
<P>
   We do have one bone to pick. The engineer who decided that the
automatic transmission should start in second gear all the time
should be shot. This idiotic strategy makes the LS feel lethargic
around town and in normal driving. Even under full throttle, the
transmission starts in second. Why? In fact, with this shift
strategy, why have a first gear at all?
</P>
<P>
   Ford Motor Co., builder of the Lincoln, claims the ``American
Luxury'' position for the Lincoln LS. Hey, Ford, Americans are into
acceleration. Give the car back its first gear so it has some guts
coming off the line at a stoplight.
</P>
<P>
   Once under way, the LS comes into its own and it is quick and
extremely responsive. You can carve up a twisty road or a freeway
off ramp fender to fender with your friend who owns the BMW 540i
for half the price.
</P>
<P>
   To us, the LS is exactly the right size. Then again, we didn't
have to sit in the back seat. A couple of our passengers claimed
the legroom was tight. We didn't notice. We were too busy having
fun driving this thing.

 By JIM WILSON  
 c.2000 Hearst Communications Inc.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I'm getting strange looks in the men's room of a McDonald's
outside Boston. A few minutes ago, I interviewed the scientists who
founded Invent Resources. One of their creations is a hand dryer
that uses turbulent rather than smooth-flowing air. They didn't
have a demo unit at the meeting. So, to see if their idea really
works, I'm frantically wiggling my fingers while shaking my hands.
Strangers probably think I'm a pianist off his medication.
</P>
<P>
   My hands actually do dry fast. You'll eventually find this out
for yourself. The dryers are destined to become standard restroom
equipment. Restaurants will buy them because they use two-thirds of
the energy of standard models and plug into a convenience outlet,
saving the cost of a dedicated 220-volt line.
</P>
<P>
   The hand dryer is one of more than 200 patents that members of
Invent Resources have either received or applied for. While the
idea is no match for the light bulb, telephone or TV, it is an
example of another type of invention, an invention created to solve
a prosaic problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our forte is developing new inventions and technologies for
clients,'' explains Richard Pavelle, IR's president. ``We call this
service Invention Upon Demand.''
</P>
<P>
   When you talk to people who use words like forte, you know
you're not dealing with the Napster generation. Pavelle and his
three colleagues are what is known in the science trade as
graybeards. In their youth they were whiz kids who carried slide
rules and memorized trig tables. They didn't use electronic
calculators because they hadn't invented them yet. Pavelle hadn't
anyway. He did that in 1978 when he patented a flexible calculator
and licensed the idea to Casio, Canon and Sharp. Together, the
group's many patents cover the technological waterfront, from a
process for making transistors, to a microwave coffeemaker, to a
golf club with an oversize sweet spot. You can see a partial list
on their Web site (www.weinvent.com).
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the company was founded we have developed more than 200
products,'' says Pavelle. That's an impressive track record _
almost two products a month flowing off the invention-factory
assembly line.
</P>
<P>
   I thought it would be valuable to sit down with Pavelle and his
colleagues to try to learn a little about how they work their
magic.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Pavelle of pocket calculator fame, there is
George Freedman, who holds a series of patents on microwave cooking
appliances, including one for a microwave popcorn popper. A. Ze'ev
Hed is an expert on high-temperature superconductor materials. His
inventins include a lighting device to help shift workers adjust
their internal clocks and a catheter that destroys the heart cells
responsible for fatal arrhythmia. Lastly, there is Sol Aisenberg,
who is himself often the last word on inventions. His scientific
expertise is in developing drug-delivery systems for cancer
treatments and techniques for using thin films of diamonds as
coatings.
</P>
<P>
   During the team's weekly brainstorming meetings, Aisenberg is
the ``spoiler.'' He knocks down ideas that are too costly, or smell
of kludge. And if an idea is already covered by someone else's
patent, Aisenberg has a knack for spotting a loophole that can be
used to legally break that patent. On paper, patents protect new
ideas. In the real world, patents are little more than permission
slips to start lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Seated quietly around the conference table while Pavelle makes
introductory remarks, the IR team looks a lot like any other group
of corporate scientists. The veneer splits when they begin talking,
several at once. Corporate and government scientists tend to be
low-key at meetings. The members of the IR team have what show
business people call stage presence. They become animated, and
animate the air around them.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are only five of us in a room that can
comfortably accommodate 20, it feels crowded. Ideas fill the space.
Aisenberg once described this phenomenon as the group merging to
become a superbrain. Soon after IR formed in the early 1990s, Mary
Martin, a Boston Globe reporter, described one of these sessions
more graphically: ``Posing problems to the foursome has a similar
effect to tossing bread to ducks.'' Ten years and 200 patents
later, they haven't lost any of that enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   For those who believe they have already struck upon a
million-dollar idea, there are three rules that can be distilled
from seeing how the IR team gets it done.
</P>
<P>
   Rule 1: Know what you own. Sadly, most people with good ideas
don't own them. If you work for a company that makes things, there
is a good chance that you signed away some or all of your rights to
ownership of future inventions in exchange for your paycheck. The
same holds true for graduate students. Check the fine print of the
paperwork you signed when you were hired.
</P>
<P>
   Rule 2: Don't reinvent the wheel. During my meeting with IR,
inspiration struck one of the members. He had a quick side
conversation with one of his colleagues. It ended: ``OK, we'll run
a patent search.''
</P>
<P>
   With patent numbers about to reach 7,000,000, the odds are that
your idea has been hit upon before. You can hire a patent agent to
conduct a search for about $500. Or, you can do it yourself.
</P>
<P>
   A word of caution: before trying a search at the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office Web site (www.uspto.gov), first read ``Patent
Searching Made Easy'' by David Hitchcock, published by Nolo Press.
Hitchcock is a real rocket scientist who worked on the MX missile
program and later invented the Home Fire Shield. Nolo
(www.nolo.com) specializes in yanking the legal community's
collective chain by publishing self-help books that show the public
how little work lawyers really do.
</P>
<P>
   Rule 3: Own what you invent. IR invites organizations to come to
them with their problems. After a little earnest money has been
laid on the table, it finds a solution. Then, it locks up the
intellectual property rights to that invention and offers it to the
client. If the client bites, they work out a deal. If not, IR is
free to shop the invention to other companies, including
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Will the tactics that work for IR help other inventors? In a
world where most inventors tend to die poor, the IR bottom line
stands out as a golden exception. ``Products originated by our
group have produced sales more than $1 billion,'' says Pavelle.

<P>
   With new malicious and devastating computer viruses popping up
all the time, it's easy to forget that viruses aren't the only
security threat on the Internet. Thanks to high-speed Internet
services like cable and DSL, you could also be vulnerable to a
direct attack by computer hackers.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what you need to know.
</P>
<P>
   A unique IP address _ a series of numbers in a special format _
identifies every computer connected to the Internet. When you
connect using a modem, your Internet provider assigns you an IP
number called a dynamic IP address, which you keep for the duration
of that session. However, with cable and DSL connections that are
always on, you typically keep the same IP address as long as you
have that service. This is called a static IP address, and this is
where the security risk comes in.
</P>
<P>
   If a hacker knows that you have a static IP address and an
always-on connection to the Internet, he can use that information
to attempt access to your computer at any time.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a Windows whiz, you can change various settings in the
Networks control panel to sufficiently tighten security on your
computer. However, it's much easier to install so-called firewall
software to handle matters for you. (Firewall refers to any
combination of hardware and software designed to prevent
unauthorized access to a system through the Internet.) In addition,
these types of programs provide you with extra capabilities you
wouldn't otherwise have.
</P>
<P>
   NORTON
</P>
<P>
   One of my favorites is Norton Internet Security 2000 Family
Edition by Symantec (www.symantec.com). A capable firewall is just
the beginning of this family friendly package. The software also
includes:
</P>
<P>
   _ A privacy-control feature that lets you manage Internet
cookies.
</P>
<P>
   _ Norton's famous antivirus software.
</P>
<P>
   _ The ability to block banner advertising on Web pages.
</P>
<P>
   _ Filtering software to help keep the kids out of inappropriate
Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   _ The ability to set up multiple users, so different family
members have access to different resources from the same computer.
</P>
<P>
   The Personal Edition leaves off these last two family-type
features. If your primary interest is simply a firewall without the
extras, you also can buy Norton Personal Firewall as a separate
product.
</P>
<P>
   MCAFEE
</P>
<P>
   McAfee Software (www.mcafee.com), another well-known name in
utility software, offers a pair of products that provides the same
sort of functionality as Norton Internet Security 2000 Family
Edition. These are McAfee Firewall and McAfee Guard Dog.
</P>
<P>
   McAfee Firewall does what any good firewall should _ it blocks
unauthorized access, prevents stealth programs from being planted
on your computer and stops programs already on your computer from
secretly accessing the Internet without your knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   McAfee Guard Dog offers a few unique and interesting features.
For example, while many programs of this type allow you to block
online chatting completely, Guard Dog lets you allow chatting while
blocking out any objectionable words. However, even the best
filtering software isn't completely foolproof. Give a teen-ager a
couple of hours in the middle of the night, and he might be able to
find his way into a few risque sites the filtering software didn't
catch. With Guard Dog, you can set allowed-access times for each
user on the system. That means you can tell Guard Dog to allow
Junior access only between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m., for example.
</P>
<P>
   MORE BLOCKAGE
</P>
<P>
   If you're looking for an easy, yet powerful, ``set it and forget
it'' firewall, BlackICE Defender from Network ICE (www.networkice.
com) may be just what the doctor ordered. Network ICE develops
security software for major corporate networks and has used that
same technology to create its consumer product. Once you install
the software, it works quietly in the background, blocking out any
unauthorized access and keeping a record of any suspicious
activity.
</P>
<P>
   ESafe Desktop from Aladdin Knowledge Systems (www.esafe.com)
delivers on the promise of a true all-in-one personal firewall and
Internet security package. It's a nice product for beginners and
experts alike. That's because during system configuration, you have
two options. You can use a wizard to answer a few simple questions,
letting eSafe Desktop default to its most common options. Or you
can dig right in and fine-tune the software to your exact needs.
</P>
<P>
   One interesting feature is the use of what eSafe Desktop calls
sandboxes. A sandbox is an operating environment for a specific
application, such as your Web browser or e-mail program. The
settings for the sandbox determine what can and can't be done using
that particular application. What's more, you can create different
sandboxes for the same application, and assign each sandbox to a
different user.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, even though you and the kiddies may use the same
applications, you can limit what they're able to do with those
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, knowing which resources to allow or not allow for any
given sandbox could be trouble for anyone lower than expert level.
To simplify this, each sandbox has a learning mode. In that mode,
eSafe Desktop makes a record of what resources are used. Then, when
you switch out of learning mode, only the ``learned'' resources are
available.
</P>
<P>
   How about an easy-to-use personal firewall that provides
excellent protection and best of all doesn't cost you a penny?
ZoneAlarm from Zone Labs (www.zonealarm.com) offers exactly that.
The program provides protection both from intrusion through the
Internet and intrusion from other computers on your network. You
can set separate security levels for each of these, too.
</P>
<P>
   Are you a Microsoft Outlook user who's not totally satisfied
with the script-virus patch? ZoneAlarm includes a special feature
that can automatically quarantine script-type e-mail attachments
without entirely blocking access to executable attachments.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best features of ZoneAlarm is that it's available for
free download for personal use from the Zone Labs Web site.
</P>
<P>
   High-speed Internet access is great. I couldn't even imagine
going back to an analog modem. However, just as with so many other
things, the greater the benefit, the greater the risk. When it
comes to surfing the Internet, you can do it as fast as you want,
just don't do it without protection.

<HEADLINE>
`THE MAN BEHIND THE GENIUS': SHAKESPEARE, STILL HIDING FROM THE
BIOGRAPHERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes at end of review) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Shakespeare is in the singularly fortunate position,'' Auden
once observed, ``of being, to all intents and purposes,
anonymous.''
</P>
<P>
   Though a documented record exists of his publishing history, his
real-estate transactions and his involvement in assorted court
cases, the man himself has successfully eluded the prying eyes of
biographers and historians for four centuries. Almost nothing is
known of the years between his childhood in Stratford and his
appearance as a young man on the London theater scene, and his
personality, vaguely sketched by contemporaries like Ben Jonson as
being courteous, pragmatic and mild-mannered, remains enigmatic as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Barrels of ink have been expended in debating the playwright's
love life, his sexuality and the emotional arc his plays suggest he
traveled _ from youthful exuberance into darkening melancholy and
existential doubt, toward something approaching acceptance and
reconciliation. And yet for all the Sturm und Drang, no biographer
has shed any real light on how this small-town boy with no more
than a grammar school education became the author of masterworks
like ``Hamlet,'' ``Othello'' and ``King Lear,'' and in doing so
permanently transformed the course of Western literature.
</P>
<P>
   The new biography, ``William Shakespeare: The Man Behind the
Genius,'' by Anthony Holden _ the author of earlier books on
Tchaikovsky and Laurence Olivier _ is no exception. Though breezily
readable, the book offers no new facts about the playwright's life,
adds nothing to our appreciation of the plays or poems and indulges
in copious _ and often irresponsible _ speculation. Because so
little is known about Shakespeare, all of his biographers have been
forced to venture into the hazy realm of conjecture, but unlike,
say, Samuel Schoenbaum and Park Honan, Holden does not tell the
reader when he is extrapolating from the facts or offering a
theory; instead, he cavalierly presents subjective opinion as
recorded truth.
</P>
<P>
   He writes, for instance, that both Shakespeare's ``parents were
illiterate,'' though this is a matter of some debate, and he
similarly asserts, with little supporting evidence, that the
playwright was secretly reared as a Catholic, and that his
``Catholic indoctrination in childhood ran deep, whatever the
subsequent falling-off in his beliefs.'' Like a number of previous
biographers, he also suggests that the young Shakespeare worked as
a tutor ``in a noble, wealthy and illicitly Catholic household in
Lancashire.''
</P>
<P>
   Holden goes on to suggest that a teen-age Shakespeare was
strong-armed into marrying the older Anne Hathaway after she became
pregnant, and that he became a lackadaisical husband and doting but
absent father. He moved to London during his children's infancy and
spent the next 25 years there leading an independent life. His
return to Stratford in 1611, Holden implies, was not the happy
homecoming many biographers have portrayed: The restless
Shakespeare, he writes, bought a pied-a-terre in London and spent
considerable periods of time there until ``failing health finally
drove him back to his family for good.''
</P>
<P>
   As for other controversies in Shakespeare scholarship, Holden
contends that the Sonnets ``should not be taken _ as they so often
are _ to suggest that Shakespeare himself was homosexual.'' He
looks at the usual suspects identified as the so-called ``Dark
Lady'' of the Sonnets (including a married woman named Jeanette
Davenant, who gave birth to a child, believed by some to be
Shakespeare's illegitimate son), but concludes that it is perhaps
best, in Anthony Burgess' words, to leave the Dark Lady
``anonymous, even composite,'' an icon of ``some of the commonest
experiences known to men.''
</P>
<P>
   Early on in this biography, Holden wisely observes that ``we
must remain ever vigilant against too readily reading the poet's
own sentiments into those of his characters.'' But he then proceeds
to do exactly that, uncovering autobiographical clues everywhere he
looks. He describes ``The Merchant of Venice'' as a parable
exploring Shakespeare's ``lifelong ambivalence about money, with
especial reference to the usury which had so haunted his stricken
father.'' He writes that the Sonnets, ``Othello'' and ``The
Winter's Tale'' make it ``hard to resist the conclusion that the
poet capable of evoking the `green-eyed monster' in such violent
language must have experienced its unique horrors himself,'' and he
further suggests that an adulterous love affair might have spurred
the playwright to the bravura writing in ``Antony and Cleopatra.''
</P>
<P>
   Holden adds that the playwright's grief over the death of his
11-year-old son, Hamnet, in 1596 ``becomes a recurring strain in
his work, through `Hamlet' to `The Winter's Tale,''' and that his
``preoccupation with his daughters'' _ ``sharpened by years of
guilty absenteeism'' _ surfaces in the plays from ``Lear'' onward.
</P>
<P>
   These sorts of highly speculative observations linking
Shakespeare's life and art are about the only form of original
literary criticism Holden has to offer in this book. Clearly
insecure about his own ability to render critical appraisals,
Holden tends to confine himself to expressing bland platitudes
(Shakespeare achieved ``a level of intelligence, honesty, wit and
humanity unmatched in any other era'') or summarizing the opinions
of others. When on the rare occasion he attempts to assess a play
himself, the results verge on the laughable. Of ``Titus
Andronicus'' he writes: ```Titus' has always been notoriously hard
going for both cast and audiences; if not laughed off the stage, it
requires extra paramedics to cope with the number of fainting
spectators.''
</P>
<P>
   By far the strongest portions of this book have to do with
Holden's depictions of the theatrical world in which Shakespeare
came of age. He does a nimble job of sketching in the rivalries of
the day, as well as the fashions in writing, which Shakespeare both
exploited and transcended. He gives the reader a succinct overview
of the historical backdrop to the playwright's life, while also
providing insights into how political developments _ and changes in
the theater _ might have affected Shakespeare's writing.
</P>
<P>
   None of this has the hard-earned specificity of serious
scholarship, but instead feels fuzzily atmospheric and
impressionistic. In fact ``Shakespeare: The Man Behind the Genius''
is perhaps best read not as a work of biography, but as a kind of
historical novel starring a playwright as its conquering hero.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A college student has been charged with a hate
crime after allegedly calling two men standing in front of a Los
Gatos, Calif., hair salon ``faggots'' and assaulting one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Ellsworth, 21, a senior majoring in business economics at
the University of California at Santa Barbara, was arrested early
Friday morning and charged with battery and interference with the
exercise of civil rights. He was booked into the Santa Clara County
jail and released four hours later, police said.
</P>
<P>
   A Los Gatos police spokesman said it was the first time in at
least 12 years that an alleged hate crime had occurred in Los
Gatos.
</P>
<P>
   Both charges are misdemeanors, but the civil rights charge falls
under the state's hate-crime statute, increasing possible
penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Ellsworth and his attorney, Joe O'Sullivan of San Francisco,
denied the charges Saturday. Ellsworth said he was shocked to learn
that Los Gatos police had made the charges public.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea of the severity of the situation,'' he said when
contacted by a reporter. ``In my opinion, I was just defending
myself.'' He claimed one of the alleged victims had punched him
while the other held him in a headlock.
</P>
<P>
   Ellsworth said he was too stunned to provide further details.
But he said he never used the word ``faggots'' or said anything at
all, and he said he had no hostility toward homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Los Gatos/Monte Sereno Police Department
statement, the alleged altercation occurred a few minutes before 2
a.m. Friday in front of the hair salon.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the victim, who was not named, was talking to his
brother about ``career plans after graduation from cosmetology
school'' when Ellsworth and two other men approached them and
called them ``faggots.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellsworth allegedly attacked the victim, injuring his jaw and
knees, police said, adding that the three men then fled but
Ellsworth was stopped and arrested soon afterward.
</P>
<P>
   According to O'Sullivan, the word ``faggots'' may have been used
but not by Ellsworth.
</P>
<P>
   O'Sullivan confirmed that the young man had fled the scene, but
said the alleged victim and his brother pursued him and then
attacked him, chipping one of his teeth.
</P>
<P>
   ``My client walked away,'' O'Sullivan said. ``These two
individuals who were apparently gay went after him because they
were bigger. My client ran. They chased him. He made a stand and
that's when they engaged in the fighting and the police rolled up.
If any pejorative words were used, they were not used by Peter.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellsworth declined to say who might have used the derogatory
word. Nor would he comment when asked if he believed he had been
mistakenly identified.
</P>
<P>
   Early this year, the Santa Clara County Sheriff's Office
reported 11 hate crimes of all kinds in 1999 in the county,
excluding San Jose. That city's police department reported 43 in
1998, the last year for which it had data.

MY DOCTOR THE AUTHOR 
</HEADLINE>
   By HOWARD MARKEL, M.D.    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Each year it seems that more and more physicians are putting
aside their stethoscopes for word processors. The most casual look
at publishers' book lists or major magazines and newspapers
demonstrates that an increasing cadre of doctors is writing
best-selling works of nonfiction, novels, plays, motion pictures
and essays. Even professional conferences are being held to
encourage physicians with literary aspirations.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors have been writing about their patients since at least
the time of Hippocrates. For most of this vast stretch of time, the
writing was confined to an audience of other physicians, and the
main goal was to inform them about the natural history of disease,
but today's era is characterized by the presentation of medical
narratives to large lay audiences.
</P>
<P>
   The mass appeal of this literary genre is hardly surprising.
What could be more central to the understanding of the human
condition than a reflection on the diseases to which we are all
susceptible? Perhaps more to the point, doctor stories are dramatic
with clear beginnings, middles and ends.
</P>
<P>
   To many observers, the practice of medicine and the writing of
books seem disparate, despite exemplars like the
playwright-physician Anton Chekhov and the poet-pediatrician
William Carlos Williams. Those who practice these dual crafts
fervently defend how complementary they are. Dr. Sherwin B. Nuland,
the National Book Award-winning author of ``How We Die,''
explained:
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a surgeon who has been at this calling for a very long
time, and even the least introspective of us cannot escape without
having developed an entire steamer trunkful of experiences,
impressions, philosophies and musings on the human condition,
values and ethics. Writing brings everything forward. It enables us
to recall things as they were experienced by us while they were
happening; it enables us to find out what we think, often for the
first time; it is a process that is totally honest if we are
willing to allow ourselves to feel those emotions that are coming
forth from preserved memories and then scribble the accompanying
words down, uncensored.''
</P>
<P>
   Abraham Verghese, an internist who wrote the AIDS memoir ``My
Own Country,'' said of the dual roles: ``To me, they're a seamless
enterprise. I'm really struck by how much of what I learned in
medical school has helped me to be a writer, and how much of what I
learn as a writer helps my thinking as a physician. They are very
parallel disciplines. When you take a patient's clinical history,
what is that but a story? What makes a good doctor is that he or
she takes the story down well, sees the links and makes the
connections toward a diagnosis. That's also what writing is
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Several prominent medical journals regularly feature personal
essays by physicians about their experiences. The best-known
column, ``A Piece of My Mind,'' has run in The Journal of the
American Medical Association each week for more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Roxanne Young, who has edited this series since 1984, said she
receives more than 400 submissions a year from doctors around the
world, even though only about 10 percent make it into print. These
stories have been widely anthologized and taught in medical
schools, and have inspired two books of collected essays.
</P>
<P>
   What compels busy physicians to reveal their thoughts and
feelings to a readership of more than 400,000 clinical peers? Young
believes that the simple act of writing is a catharsis, a part of
the self-healing process that allows doctors to confront troubling
issues _ fear, failure, guilt _ and to resolve them from within. It
is also a means to honor a patient for helping them to come to
grips not only with death but with life.
</P>
<P>
   As more physicians take to the pen, professional conferences
have sprouted to bring them together for readings of their work,
lectures and workshops on the rewards and pitfalls of being a
doctor-writer. The largest such symposium held so far was the
Narrative Matters conference sponsored by the health policy journal
Health Affairs and the W.K. Kellogg Foundation this past March.
</P>
<P>
   It brought together leading physician-writers in the United
States with interested editors and policy makers. More than 70
participants discussed the parallels of creating literature and
doctoring.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Fitzhugh Mullan, a pediatrician who wrote ``Vital Signs,'' a
memoir about overcoming cancer, organized the conference with
specific goals in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to give the genre a clearer and more prominent
role,'' . Mullan said, ``to stir the pot of the narrative essay as
it relates to medical practice and health policy. I really believe
that amidst the increasingly powerful quantitative science that
exists today, human observation remains and should remain an
important force in the forming of opinion in the national dialogue
on health matters.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most serious debates in the field has to do with
confidentiality. Since antiquity, doctors have promised patients
not to discuss their individual cases, except with other doctors,
both as a means of protection and to encourage frank patient-doctor
conversations.
</P>
<P>
   When writing about a particular patient, most doctor-writers
will change the name and identifying details. But sometimes
mistakes are made. In 1926, Dr. William Carlos Williams heard a
remarkable story about a person while on his medical rounds. As was
his habit, he wrote it down quickly as it was told to him without
changing any of the details. Several months later, when he sent the
story off to a magazine, he forgot to change the subject's name.
</P>
<P>
   As Williams recounted in ``The Autobiography of William Carlos
Williams,'' the subject recognized himself immediately and promptly
brought a lawsuit against the physician for what was then the
princely sum of $15,000. Williams settled for $5,000, an amount
that equaled his annual salary, and never made that mistake again.
</P>
<P>
   Some participants in the Narrative Matters conference argued for
obtaining written permission or informed consent and even showing
the article or essay to the patient before publishing it. Many
others argued that such steps were not necessary, provided that the
author changed the obvious identifying features and at least asked
for oral consent.
</P>
<P>
   ``My patients haven't been particularly aware of or worried
about my writing about them,'' Mullan said, ``but many colleagues
have expressed concern since I have written about my life in
medicine. Not infrequently, I have had friends say in my presence,
be nice to Fitz or you'll wind up in his next book. They are only
half-kidding.''
</P>
<P>
   This points up the problem that the art of writing is
cannibalistic in nature and the telling of great stories often
fails to meet the medical profession's ethical standards of
studying patients.
</P>
<P>
   Nuland observes that there is no possibility of considerations
of ethics, confidentiality or even loyalty to participants, only
what the writer feels is the truth of what he is describing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I change the names, and never consider the consequences of the
text that results from the process,'' he said. ``Others have
written that all writers ultimately betray those who are their
subjects, but they would betray themselves if it were otherwise.
Writing is not an exercise in discretion, it is an exercise in
truth. In this sense, the story belongs to the storyteller, because
he is the truth seeker.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those in medicine who believe in the power of stories and
the importance of communicating them to a wide audience, there
seems to be agreement with Chekhov, who in 1888 wrote to his
publisher: ``I have two professions and not one. Medicine is my
lawful wife and literature is my mistress. When I get tired of one,
I spend the night with the other. Though it's disorderly, it's not
so dull and besides, neither loses anything through my
infidelity.''

CLASSIC BOOK ON 1960 CAMPAIGN CHANGED POLITICS AND JOURNALISM
FOREVER
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By JEFF GUINN 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   No less an authority than David Halberstam believes that ```The
Making of the President 1960' changed everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Theodore White's seminal work on campaign politics won a
Pulitzer Prize in 1961, stayed on the bestseller list for 56
consecutive weeks; although it is out of print (except for a $45.95
library edition from Buccaneer Press), you can find hardcover and
paperback editions in most used bookstores. To read it, some of
today's most distinguished journalists and scholars insist, is to
hold history in your hands _ and to understand how we arrived at
today's exhaustive presidential campaign process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teddy White showed every other journalist how to write about
presidential politics,'' declares Halberstam, himself a Pulitzer
Prize winner and author of history-defining books like'' The Best
and the Brightest'' and ``The Powers That Be.'' ``He took something
everyone knew a little bit about and showed how all the pieces fit
together _ primaries, using TV, everything behind the scenes. It
was a major upgrade intellectually that educated his readers, too.
The book transformed my own ambitions. Think about it _ he took a
story where everybody already knew the ending and still made it
read like a cliffhanger.''
</P>
<P>
   But White's book was far more than a primer for aspiring
political journalists. It was a guidebook for a whole new way of
waging political campaigns that would dramatically change America's
electoral system. In ``The Making of the President 1960,'' White
showed prospective candidates how to run modern, media-saturated
campaigns, and showed state officials how to get their states more
influence in the presidential process.
</P>
<P>
   White's book, says presidential-campaign scholar Paul Boller of
Fort Worth, made a definitive impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, it changed the way newspapers and magazines and books
presented campaign coverage,'' says Boller, whose own book
``Presidential Campaigns'' (Oxford University Press, paperback,
$15.95) is in its third printing. ``It changed the perception, and,
eventually, the importance, of state primaries. White was the first
one to demonstrate how a candidate could use the primaries to win
the nomination, instead of relying on bargaining for delegate votes
at the convention. That was just a huge thing.''
</P>
<P>
   It is no exaggeration to say that if you hate the drawn-out,
state-by-state presidential campaign process that glorifies
political strategy and campaign operatives, and reduces the
elections' significance to that of a horse race, Theodore White
deserves some of the blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``That campaign he wrote about, 1960, was a turning point in
American politics even without his book,'' Halberstam says. ``TV
was becoming more of a force, Kennedy proved how the primaries
could be a tool to getting your party's nomination. People would
eventually have figured these things out anyway. But (White's book)
captured it all and made it easy to understand. So he was a part of
the process of change.''
</P>
<P>
   Prior to White's book, most voters and politicians considered
state primaries a sideshow to the real nominating events _ national
conventions. Major-party nominees were chosen by powerful insiders
behind closed doors or, on occasion, on the convention floor by
delegates. Front-runners for the nominations rarely wasted time on
primaries; in 1956, Democratic front-runner Adlai Stevenson,
following tradition, didn't plan on actively campaigning in the
country's few primaries. But when dark-horse opponent Estes
Kefauver did campaign and won 84 percent of the vote in New
Hampshire, Stevenson was forced to spend money and time in the
remaining primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Few members of the media paid any attention, as Stevenson
coasted to the nomination as expected. But Massachusetts Sen. John
F. Kennedy did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kennedy decided he would use the primaries to win the
nomination, since he wasn't all that well-known nationally,''
Boller says. ``White was there to write about how he did it.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, 16 states had presidential primaries. Kennedy entered,
and won, just seven. He used the Wisconsin primary against
Minnesota Sen. Hubert Humphrey to prove to party movers and shakers
that he could win votes in farm communities, and he contested West
Virginia, again opposing Humphrey, as evidence that a Catholic
could carry a heavily Protestant state. Though his primary
victories earned Kennedy only 134 delegate votes of the 761 he
needed to win the nomination, his point was made with party
heavyweights, and he was nominated on the first ballot.
</P>
<P>
   White, a former Time magazine correspondent who turned to a book
about the presidential election during a low point in his career,
provided detailed accounts of these primary battles in 1960. His
compelling descriptions of the inner workings of the campaigns
intrigued the national media, which had provided scant coverage of
them. Beginning in 1964, reporters began blanketing primary states
for the first time, and more candidates began taking them
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   This had a twofold effect. Candidates who wanted to bypass the
party power structure and benefit from increased media attention
began entering more primaries, and more states wanted to hold
primaries of their own. In 1964, only one state added a primary,
increasing the total to 17 state presidential primaries, but there
was ``five times the media coverage'' compared with four years
previously, according to Halberstam. By 1972, 21 states had
primaries. In 1980, the number had jumped to 36. In 2000, there
were 44.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wanted a piece of it,'' recalls author/playwright
Larry L. King, who worked on the Kennedy/Johnson campaign staff in
1960. ``White had shown why primaries ought to get a lot of
attention.''
</P>
<P>
   MORE nn
</P>
<P>
   As more states added presidential primaries, the power to
nominate swung from party power brokers to voters. The old
tradition of multiple convention votes and behind-the-scenes
bartering for delegate support abruptly ended. Since White's book
and the subsequent expansion of the state primary system, neither
major party has taken more than a single vote to determine its
nominee for president.
</P>
<P>
   ``George McGovern in 1972 was the first real example'' of the
change, Boller says. ``The party bosses certainly didn't want him,
but he came into the Democratic convention with a majority of the
delegates already pledged to him, so he got the nomination. (Maine
Sen.) Ed Muskie was supposed to be the shoo-in nominee. But
McGovern did with Muskie what Kennedy did with Humphrey _ faced him
in early primaries and beat him. That made the media label McGovern
the front-runner, and that is what he stayed. The strategy he
followed was in White's book, and he obviously read it.''
</P>
<P>
   With McGovern's surprising success, White's books _ he wrote
``Making of the President'' accounts of the 1964, '68 and '72
elections as well _ became not just must-reads, but guidebooks for
a slew of presidential campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, Democrat Jimmy Carter mapped out his successful
campaign ``by reading books,'' Richard Reeves wrote in
``Convention.'' ``His reading began with Teddy White's `Making of
the President' series.''
</P>
<P>
   ``(White) laid it all out,'' Boller says. ``In his first book,
he showed Kennedy deciding how television could be crucial, Nixon
making the mistake of promising to campaign in all 50 states _ he
got ill and looked terrible, which hurt him in the TV debates with
Kennedy. Certainly I remember (Carter campaign manager) Hamilton
Jordan saying he studied White's books and used what was in them
for Jimmy Carter's successful campaign in 1976.''
</P>
<P>
   Former House Speaker Jim Wright says colleagues itching to run
for president ``devoured'' White's books.
</P>
<P>
   ``Particularly in the '60s and '70s, many wanted to emulate the
appeal of John F. Kennedy, and they surely dipped into `The Making
of the President,''' Wright says.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   As a result, White became not just a chronicler but a powerful
figure himself. After ``The Making of the President 1960'' won the
Pulitzer, White's personal attention was sought by almost every
presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember (campaigns) asking if Teddy White was free on a
certain day, because they wanted him to come to their
announcements,'' Halberstam says. ``Having him take your campaign
seriously enough to cover it was a signal to everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   And if White's books made him a power broker, some observers
felt he was not an entirely objective one. A Harvard graduate like
the Kennedys (though, unlike them, White attended on a scholarship
made available to impoverished applicants), White certainly felt
closest to the Kennedy camp. His ``Making of the President 1968,''
which chronicled Richard Nixon's defeat of Democrat Hubert
Humphrey, was dedicated to the memories of John and Robert Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   White's liberal leanings were well-known in the Nixon camp, says
historian Irwin Gellman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nixon never trusted White,'' says Gellman, whose next book,
``The Apprentice,'' will delineate Nixon's career from 1952 through
January 1961. (It is the second in a projected three-book series.)
``There are 20, 30 letters from White asking for personal time with
Nixon, but it was never given. Of course, White could still travel
on planes with Nixon during campaigns, could still talk to his
staff. But personal access to Nixon was denied.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gellman adds, ``White is a beautiful writer, and though
his 1960 book is flawed _ he never really understood the nature of
Nixon and Kennedy as Cold Warriors _ he opened up everyone's eyes
to how campaigns operated.''
</P>
<P>
   Halberstam says ``definitive books about presidential campaigns
began with White's. ``The Making of the President 1960'' made it
possible for Joe McGinnis to write ``The Selling of the President
1968'' about Nixon's campaign, then Tim Crouse wrote ``The Boys on
the Bus'' about media coverage of presidential campaigns, then
Richard Ben Cramer with ``What It Takes'' about the 1988
Bush-Dukakis campaign. Those are all great books, in some ways
better than White's, and that's only right, because the pupils are
supposed to learn from and eventually surpass the master.''
</P>
<P>
   White proved that newspapers could fascinate readers with
``information about little things,'' Halberstam adds. ``He wrote
about what John Kennedy said to his wife on the morning of the 1960
election. He explained why Nixon misunderstood TV. He showed we
should put the good stuff into daily copy, the stuff we previously
only talked about at the bar.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to being the only source for behind-the-scenes
details instead of just straightforward news accounts, White's book
was also the only mainstream book about the 1960 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really can't recall any books about any previous campaigns,
though I guess there were some,'' Boller says. ``Otherwise, there
were biographies of presidents but nothing much until they'd left
office.''
</P>
<P>
   That too, of course, has changed. In the first eight months of
2000 alone, major publishers have printed more than 50 politically
themed books.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants to do it now,'' King says.
</P>
<P>
   Before his death in 1986 at age 71, White used his final book to
express some regrets concerning what he had helped bring about.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential primary system, he declared in 1982's ``America
in Search of Itself,'' his last book, exhibited ``the madness of a
good idea run wild ... the number of primaries has grown from 14
(in 1956) to 36 (in 1980), exhausting candidates, attendant press,
and public interest alike. Special interests, from the most greedy
to the most idealistic, pour more money into politics than ever
before, finding the primaries the most vulnerable point in the
American process.''

LAUGHLIN, Nev. _ Location is everything. Even here.
</P>
<P>
   In this sweltering gambling town along the Colorado River,
Harrah's hotel and casino is situated at a natural cove, which is
bracketed by buoys that limit watercraft to speeds that don't
produce wakes (and sometimes, the little devils actually abide by
it).
</P>
<P>
   As a result, a day on which the mercury bubbles above 120
degrees can be mitigated with a plunge into a roped-off swimming
area along the Colorado _ with minimal threat of propeller
lacerations.
</P>
<P>
   Sand has been trucked in to cover the mud along the river's
edge, creating a private beach so popular that room keys are
mandatory for gaining access to it.
</P>
<P>
   Harrah's, at the extreme south end of the Laughlin strip, has
several other features working in its favor. Prominent among them
is William Fisk's Steakhouse, an attempt to enhance the fine-dining
options in an area known chiefly for its pig-out buffets.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't take any chances with the menu items _ there are no
fewer than nine offerings of beef or lamb among 16 entree choices _
but it does them well. (Prices average in the upper $20s.) And the
wine list features a nice range.
</P>
<P>
   But probably the restaurant's finest attribute is its wide,
arched windows that face east. Time your dinner for sunset and
you'll get quite a show, as some of the desert hills are draped in
deep, dark shadows, while more distant mountains are fired in
brilliant shades of red, orange and purple.
</P>
<P>
   It's an elegant, intimate setting, with white tablecloths and
attentive service that isn't impressed with itself. The restaurant
even takes a stab at maintaining respectable decorum by having the
semblance of a dress code (no beachwear or flip-flops), and most
diners seem thrilled to have an excuse to put on resort wear.
</P>
<P>
   A stay at Harrah's in June was marred only by some troubles with
the room. Or rooms.
</P>
<P>
   We were first issued keys to a room that was already occupied _
difficult to say who was more startled when we barged in. We were
then assigned a different room, but late in the evening found that
our keys wouldn't open the door _ and it took three maintenance men
and a door jack that looked like a medieval torture device to
finally get it open. On to another room, which deviated from the
preferences specified on our reservation, but it had to do for a
night. The fourth room was perfect. Through all the moves, we felt
lucky to have lost nothing more than a swimsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the swimming cove and the restaurant, Harrah's Laughlin
was found to have several other attributes:
</P>
<P>
   _To conform to a south-of-the-border theme, according to
spokeswoman Madeleine Weekley, ``exposed slump blocks'' were used
in the hotel's construction. An ancillary benefit is that the thick
walls seem to knock down all noise from neighboring rooms. You
sleep soundly here.
</P>
<P>
   _Unlike most hotels on this strip, Harrah's takes full advantage
of the river's presence, having its pools and spas on a patio that
overlooks the water. One pool-spa complex is for families, the
other for adults only.
</P>
<P>
   _An entire tower of rooms is designated for adults only, too,
and you even have to sign a pledge to that effect when you check
in. Enforcement must be difficult, though, because a number of
squealing little ones were encountered running in and out of rooms
on the various floors we stayed on. At checkout, we heard another
guest complaining about this; the front-desk staffer said security
needs snitch help when there are abuses.
</P>
<P>
   _The casino has a no-smoking section. ``We're a very Southern
California-friendly resort,'' said Weekley. ``We felt it fit very
well with our (target) market.''
</P>
<P>
   _Harrah's, a couple hundred yards removed from the strip, is not
connected to Laughlin's River Walk, so you don't have to contend
with parades of looky-loos traipsing through the pool area, for
example. Getting to the other casinos, however, is as simple as
hopping a water taxi. &QL; 
_____ &QL; 
IF YOU GO &QL; 
For a Sunday-Tuesday stay in June, we paid $46 per night for a room
overlooking the river. As in most gambling cities, room rates vary
drastically depending on demand and time of year or week. Harrah's

<P>
   OATMAN, Ariz. _ The burro stepped abruptly into the center of
the roadway, oblivious to the approaching car that was forced to
slam to a halt. Then the beast, a descendant of the animals that
did all the heavy lifting for miners working the Black Mountains in
the early 1900s, belligerently stood its ground, staring down the
driver over the hood of the car. It didn't budge until a pedestrian
noisily shooed it away.
</P>
<P>
   The burro, which had taken its defiant stance smack in the
middle of Oatman's main street, undoubtedly just wanted a carrot or
an apple. But with a little imagination, you could discern a deeper
message in that posture and that expression:
</P>
<P>
   ``If you wanted predictability, you should have stayed on the
interstate and not wandered through here. This road's different.
This is Route 66.''
</P>
<P>
   It's just a strip of asphalt, a highway that once stretched
2,278 miles between Chicago and Santa Monica, but over the years it
has been examined in literature, celebrated in song, psychoanalyzed
on screens both small and large.
</P>
<P>
   It was supplanted by a sleek, safe, nondescript interstate
highway in the 1960s and '70s, and became a ghost road for the 15
or so years after I-40 was completed, a period during which neglect
killed many of its eccentric little roadside settlements and
severely crippled others. But when America was swept up in a wave
of nostalgia in the late-'80s, Route 66 seemed to find its way to
the crest, and some travelers suddenly decided they just weren't in
that big a hurry after all. They came looking for its remnants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Route 66 always was a media road,'' said Tom Snyder of
Ventura, author of the ``Route 66 Traveler's Guide'' (St. Martin's
Griffin). ``From the first, promotional work was done in Oklahoma
in the late '20s and early '30s. Then (John) Steinbeck comes down
the road and makes it famous. Then songs and movies featured it,
because writers, producers and directors drove that road coming
west.''
</P>
<P>
   This is probably why every Route 66 guidebook is written in an
east-to- west narrative. That, after all, was the direction
followed by the Joad family in Steinbeck's ``Grapes of Wrath,'' by
songwriter Bobby Troup as he sped along with his wife and started
composing a little ditty about how you can ``get your kicks on
Route 66,'' and by Martin Milner and George Maharis (Tod and Buz)
as they bummed from town to town in their Corvette in the '60s TV
show ``Route 66.''
</P>
<P>
   For those who grew up in Southern California, however, Route 66
is infused with entirely different overtones. This was the route of
family vacations to the Grand Canyon, or to summer visits with
relatives in the Midwest. It conjures up memories of being rousted
in the dead of night, and sleeping against a back-seat window of
the station wagon, because ``we've got to get across that desert
before it gets hot.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, random stretches of 66 can be found all the way across
California, but some of them are nothing more than suburban
thoroughfares cluttered with Burger Kings and big-box stores, while
others are essentially frontage roads that closely parallel the
interstate.
</P>
<P>
   To get a truer feel for Route 66 _ and those vacation trips of
old _ it's best to embark on a section that wanders through open,
long-neglected country. Two such stretches can easily be
incorporated into a Laughlin, Nev., trip.
</P>
<P>
   On the journey to or from the Colorado River gambling city,
simply duck off the interstate in the midst of the Mojave Desert
(at Ludlow eastbound, at Mountain Springs Road westbound) and take
a swing south on 66 through such last-gasp towns as Amboy and
Essex. Or follow another stretch of the old road through Fenner and
Goffs, just west of Laughlin off U.S. 95.
</P>
<P>
   Also, on a day trip from Laughlin, you can wind into the Arizona
hills to the former mining town of Oatman _ perhaps continuing on
that desolate route to a lunch stop in Kingman, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   You may not get where you're going in any particular hurry, but
you're sure to get in touch with a fascinating strip of Americana.
</P>
<P>
   When you exit eastbound I-40 at Ludlow and strike out on the old
road, you'll bounce along a pock-marked stretch of ancient asphalt,
passing an abandoned auto-repair shop and the dilapidated Ludlow
Cafe. Within a few miles, the interstate can no longer be seen,
heard or sensed. You'll get 70-some miles of that respite on this
detour.
</P>
<P>
   Now (ITAL)this(END ITAL) is a highway with character. Route 66
was never particularly straight. It borrowed shamelessly from
survey work already done for the Santa Fe rail line, which had
sought low ground and locations where there was precious water for
its steam engines.
</P>
<P>
   The interstate lies along an elevated bed and was cut
arrow-straight. Route 66 follows the natural contours of the
desert, dipping through washes, curving around mountains. It's a
road much more in touch with the landscape, for better or worse.
</P>
<P>
   The old road cuts through a valley between the Bullion and
Bristol mountains, and the rugged beauty of the desert is revealed
fully. Dust devils erupt on the dry lakes to the south. And it's
not unusual to come over a rise, as we did, and surprise a crow
pecking at some road kill on the center stripe.
</P>
<P>
   Along Route 66, it's particularly fun to look for ruins of old
service stations, coffee shops and motor courts, which were once
essential to motorists but shriveled up when various segments of
the road were bypassed.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 miles from Ludlow, watch for a lone, scraggly tree that
stands in the middle of an open area on the north side of the road.
This is no mere turnout; it used to be an entire town. It was
Bagdad, christened by railroad officials trying to come up with a
name suitable to the oppressive climate but apparently unaware that
the capital of Iraq has an ``h'' in it.
</P>
<P>
   It was a thriving railhead at the turn of the 20th century, as
the yields of nearby mines were collected and hauled off, but it
expired in the late 1960s, and vandals have since reduced it to a
few patches of asphalt, broken glass and rusted auto parts. When we
stopped here, the wind was whistling mournfully through that lone
salt cedar tree, but the mood was broken when the engineer of a
passing freight issued a friendly blast from his horn.
</P>
<P>
   A few miles farther on, in Amboy, Roy's Cafe was open for
business, but the experience wasn't particularly pleasant. The
counter man, drinking beer from a long-neck bottle at midday on a
Sunday, at first ignored us, then cheerlessly sold us a couple of
1-ounce bags of potato chips for $1 each. Then he bristled when a
flash photo was taken of the cafe counter.
</P>
<P>
   Although the experience shattered our reverie, it was just as
well. While it's a delight to get in touch with Route 66 and what
it used to be, the simple highway has been terribly
over-romanticized, such that its many shortcomings are forgotten in
all the nostalgic rhapsodizing.
</P>
<P>
   The little businesses along Route 66 were often manned by
reclusive, sometimes sullen desert rats who may have resented the
fact that their livelihood was dependent on the Griswolds and their
ugly green station wagon. The accommodations were often rough, the
food mediocre and the mechanics larcenous.
</P>
<P>
   The road itself, meanwhile, was extraordinarily dangerous. One
lane in each direction, broken yellow stripe down the middle _ and
all those undulations into desert washes and curves around
mountains. It was not unusual to check the oncoming lane and find
it clear, pull out to pass a truck or a car towing a trailer, and
have an oncoming vehicle suddenly pop up out of one of those dips.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond Amboy, a corrugated tin roof flapped in the wind above a
long-closed cafe and gas station in Essex. We preferred this to the
cafe we found open in Amboy.
</P>
<P>
   A general cantankerousness remains in these crumbling
settlements, though. Because souvenir-hunters have replaced the
family tourist caravans of old, many of the ruins are surrounded by
chain-link fences, some topped with barbed wire. In Essex, one
junkyard that might have been somebody's home bore signs
prohibiting not only trespassing but parking as well.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Oatman proved to be considerably more hospitable.
It is a 30-mile drive from Laughlin (15 miles south on Arizona 95
from the Laughlin bridge, then 15 miles into the mountains after
turning left on Boundary Cone Road).
</P>
<P>
   Mercifully, this part of the old highway was bypassed in 1952
when Route 66 was rerouted through lower ground to the south. Until
then, travelers had to coax their jalopies along steep, treacherous
switchbacks and over 3,550-foot Sitgreaves Pass in the Black
Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Oatman, a thriving gold-mining town in the early 1900s, awaited
the survivors. Now it sells carrots to tourists. Huh? The
vegetables (25 cents at the General Store) are for the wild burros
that freely roam the main drag.
</P>
<P>
   ``They go off into the mountains at night but come into town
first thing in the morning,'' said Shirley Burrous, manager of a
shop selling Route 66 memorabilia. ``They spend the afternoon on
this side of the street, where the shade is, and they leave in the
evening when the tourists leave.''
</P>
<P>
   A popular stop for visitors is the Oatman Hotel, where Clark
Gable and Carole Lombard sneaked off for a honeymoon after their
marriage in 1939. Their room is preserved much as it was then _ a
real dump. But privacy was as elusive for Hollywood stars then as
it is now.
</P>
<P>
   The stretch of road east of Oatman is truly godforsaken. It's
said that local residents used to have to back up these hills in
reverse gear, because the fuel systems in their Model Ts were
gravity-fed. Imagine being a cross-country traveler cresting a hill
only to have a rear bumper barreling toward you. Fortunately, the
only road hazard we encountered was a coyote dashing for cover.
</P>
<P>
   At the ruins of a former tourist business called Cool Springs
Camp (which appears to be none of the three), we encountered a
father-son party of German tourists, Adolf and Michael Lange of
Nuremberg, rattling along in a rented RV.
</P>
<P>
   They had been picking their way along old 66 from Williams,
Ariz., 163 miles to the east, and admitted a keen interest in the
highway's place in American history. They were positively
fascinated to hear that my dad had driven this very stretch of
mountain road on his own western migration in 1951.
</P>
<P>
   In Kingman, 30 miles beyond Oatman, it seemed only fitting to
have lunch in a non-chain restaurant along Route 66 _ preferably
one with a big plastic steer on the roof. We found exactly this at
Dambar Steakhouse, where the menu features a picture of Andy
Devine, the perpetual cowboy sidekick and Kingman's favorite son.
</P>
<P>
   It serves third-of-a-pound burgers with something called cowboy
beans, and the waitress arrives at the table with a basket of
buttermilk biscuits. It's the kind of place with sawdust on the
floor, old pictures and license plates on the wall, and local
law-enforcement fellows sliding into one of the booths on a lunch
break.
</P>
<P>
   On the return, if you don't want to retrace your steps through
Oatman and descend to the river on another old stretch of 66, jump
on I-40, then reach Laughlin via the River Road along the west side
of the Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   In either event, reflect on a shameful chapter in California
history as you cross the river.
</P>
<P>
   During the Depression, as Dust Bowl refugees poured west looking
for work, patrols of badge-wearing thugs formed ``bum blockades''
here, according to Snyder's book. They would detain and often turn
back families that couldn't show they had sufficient money (usually
$100), the fear being that these desperate souls might be a drain
on the state's economy. Federal marshals ultimately had to step in
to stop the practice.
</P>
<P>
   Folk legend Woody Guthrie wrote about those unfortunate days in
his poem ``Do Re Mi'':
</P>
<P>
   (ITAL)``They think they're goin' to a sugar bowl
</P>
<P>
   But here is what they find
</P>
<P>
   The police at the port of entry say
</P>
<P>
   You're number 14,000 for the day.''(END ITAL)
</P>
<P>
   There are no impediments now. If they're so inclined, travelers
can zip across the bridge and haul their disposable cash up to the
gambling halls of Laughlin, or rent fishing gear or a Jet Ski on
the river ... or hurry down that straight, seamless, profoundly
boring interstate highway and stop at some nameless minimart to buy
a microwaved snack, hastily eaten. &QL; 
_____ &QL; 
IF YOU GO &QL; 
GETTING THERE: Route 66 followed various courses in eastern
California and western Arizona as engineers twice redirected it to
achieve a straighter route to Los Angeles. Here are some options
for exploring it in conjunction with a Laughlin, Nev., trip.
</P>
<P>
   _Eastbound from Barstow: Exit I-40 at Ludlow, turn right, then
left onto Old 66. This is a delightfully desolate loop through the
desert. Just past Essex, take the left fork to drive an ancient
segment through Fenner and Goffs, then head north on U.S. 95
(leaving 66 behind) and reach Laughlin via Nevada 163. Or, if you
prefer, you can take the right fork just past Essex (this was a
later incarnation of 66) and return to the interstate, continuing
on to Laughlin on a more conventional route.
</P>
<P>
   _Eastbound from Laughlin: Cross the bridge at the north end of
town and endure the spectacularly uninteresting strip town of
Bullhead City, Ariz., as you head south for 15 miles on Arizona 95.
Turn left at Boundary Cone Road. After about 12 miles, you'll veer
left onto Route 66 toward Oatman, and can continue on to Kingman
(30 miles beyond Oatman) if you wish.
</P>
<P>
   _Westbound from Kingman: Follow Old 66 to Oatman and slightly
beyond, then veer left, staying on 66, toward Topock and the river.
You'll regain I-40 on the Arizona side, then return to Laughlin
along either of two routes that parallel the river (Arizona 95, or
the River Road in California and Nevada).
</P>
<P>
   _Westbound from Laughlin: Multiple options. You can reverse the
direction of the first option, or take the River Road to I-40 west,
then exit onto U.S. 95 north. This was once 66. Turn left at
Arrowhead Junction toward Goffs (you'll still be on 66), and follow
this route about 85 miles to Ludlow. One final option: from I-40,
you can take just the southern dip of 66, exiting at Mountain
Springs Road, turning left onto 66, and following the old highway
75 miles to Ludlow, through Essex and Amboy.
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL TIP: Route 66 used to be liberally peppered with roadside
businesses, but nearly all of them were reduced to ghostly hulks
when the various bypasses were completed. Thus, while driving this
road, you're not likely to find many opportunities to purchase gas,
food or even water. And there are no call boxes. Even the
60-or-so-mile stretches in eastern California and western Arizona
can be pretty forbidding _ especially in the event of a breakdown.
It's advisable to gas up on the interstate and carry an ice chest
holding food and water.
</P>
<P>
   OFF THE SHELF: One of the best guides to the highway is the
``Route 66 Traveler's Guide'' (St. Martin's Griffin; $12.95), by
Tom Snyder, founder and director of the US Route 66 Association.
Another informative book is ``Route 66: A Guidebook to the Mother
Road'' (USDC Inc.; $19.95), by Bob Moore and Patrick Grauwels. If
you're so inclined, the latter book will advise you on when to set
your car's trip-counter odometer at zero, then will give you
precise commentary on the positioning of old rest stops and
long-abandoned roadside businesses _ but these directions only
apply to westbound travel. All guidebooks to Route 66 are written
in this east-to-west narrative. Key advisory: A version of the
Moore-Grauwels guide ostensibly is configured west to east, but
don't be fooled (as we were); it's a fraud. The chapters were
merely positioned in reverse order. The book opens in California,
but it starts in Needles(!), headed west, not in Santa Monica,
headed east. &QL;

<P>
   OATMAN, Ariz. _ The burro stepped abruptly into the center of
the roadway, oblivious to the approaching car that was forced to
slam to a halt. Then the beast, a descendant of the animals that
did all the heavy lifting for miners working the Black Mountains in
the early 1900s, belligerently stood its ground, staring down the
driver over the hood of the car. It didn't budge until a pedestrian
noisily shooed it away.
</P>
<P>
   The burro, which had taken its defiant stance smack in the
middle of Oatman's main street, undoubtedly just wanted a carrot or
an apple. But with a little imagination, you could discern a deeper
message in that posture and that expression:
</P>
<P>
   ``If you wanted predictability, you should have stayed on the
interstate and not wandered through here. This road's different.
This is Route 66.''
</P>
<P>
   It's just a strip of asphalt, a highway that once stretched
2,278 miles between Chicago and Santa Monica, but over the years it
has been examined in literature, celebrated in song, psychoanalyzed
on screens both small and large.
</P>
<P>
   It was supplanted by a sleek, safe, nondescript interstate
highway in the 1960s and '70s, and became a ghost road for the 15
or so years after I-40 was completed, a period during which neglect
killed many of its eccentric little roadside settlements and
severely crippled others. But when America was swept up in a wave
of nostalgia in the late-'80s, Route 66 seemed to find its way to
the crest, and some travelers suddenly decided they just weren't in
that big a hurry after all. They came looking for its remnants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Route 66 always was a media road,'' said Tom Snyder of
Ventura, author of the ``Route 66 Traveler's Guide'' (St. Martin's
Griffin). ``From the first, promotional work was done in Oklahoma
in the late '20s and early '30s. Then (John) Steinbeck comes down
the road and makes it famous. Then songs and movies featured it,
because writers, producers and directors drove that road coming
west.''
</P>
<P>
   This is probably why every Route 66 guidebook is written in an
east-to- west narrative. That, after all, was the direction
followed by the Joad family in Steinbeck's ``Grapes of Wrath,'' by
songwriter Bobby Troup as he sped along with his wife and started
composing a little ditty about how you can ``get your kicks on
Route 66,'' and by Martin Milner and George Maharis (Tod and Buz)
as they bummed from town to town in their Corvette in the '60s TV
show ``Route 66.''
</P>
<P>
   For those who grew up in Southern California, however, Route 66
is infused with entirely different overtones. This was the route of
family vacations to the Grand Canyon, or to summer visits with
relatives in the Midwest. It conjures up memories of being rousted
in the dead of night, and sleeping against a back-seat window of
the station wagon, because ``we've got to get across that desert
before it gets hot.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, random stretches of 66 can be found all the way across
California, but some of them are nothing more than suburban
thoroughfares cluttered with Burger Kings and big-box stores, while
others are essentially frontage roads that closely parallel the
interstate.
</P>
<P>
   To get a truer feel for Route 66 _ and those vacation trips of
old _ it's best to embark on a section that wanders through open,
long-neglected country. Two such stretches can easily be
incorporated into a Laughlin, Nev., trip.
</P>
<P>
   On the journey to or from the Colorado River gambling city,
simply duck off the interstate in the midst of the Mojave Desert
(at Ludlow eastbound, at Mountain Springs Road westbound) and take
a swing south on 66 through such last-gasp towns as Amboy and
Essex. Or follow another stretch of the old road through Fenner and
Goffs, just west of Laughlin off U.S. 95.
</P>
<P>
   Also, on a day trip from Laughlin, you can wind into the Arizona
hills to the former mining town of Oatman _ perhaps continuing on
that desolate route to a lunch stop in Kingman, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   You may not get where you're going in any particular hurry, but
you're sure to get in touch with a fascinating strip of Americana.
</P>
<P>
   When you exit eastbound I-40 at Ludlow and strike out on the old
road, you'll bounce along a pock-marked stretch of ancient asphalt,
passing an abandoned auto-repair shop and the dilapidated Ludlow
Cafe. Within a few miles, the interstate can no longer be seen,
heard or sensed. You'll get 70-some miles of that respite on this
detour.
</P>
<P>
   Now (ITAL)this(END ITAL) is a highway with character. Route 66
was never particularly straight. It borrowed shamelessly from
survey work already done for the Santa Fe rail line, which had
sought low ground and locations where there was precious water for
its steam engines.
</P>
<P>
   The interstate lies along an elevated bed and was cut
arrow-straight. Route 66 follows the natural contours of the
desert, dipping through washes, curving around mountains. It's a
road much more in touch with the landscape, for better or worse.
</P>
<P>
   The old road cuts through a valley between the Bullion and
Bristol mountains, and the rugged beauty of the desert is revealed
fully. Dust devils erupt on the dry lakes to the south. And it's
not unusual to come over a rise, as we did, and surprise a crow
pecking at some road kill on the center stripe.
</P>
<P>
   Along Route 66, it's particularly fun to look for ruins of old
service stations, coffee shops and motor courts, which were once
essential to motorists but shriveled up when various segments of
the road were bypassed.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 miles from Ludlow, watch for a lone, scraggly tree that
stands in the middle of an open area on the north side of the road.
This is no mere turnout; it used to be an entire town. It was
Bagdad, christened by railroad officials trying to come up with a
name suitable to the oppressive climate but apparently unaware that
the capital of Iraq has an ``h'' in it.
</P>
<P>
   It was a thriving railhead at the turn of the 20th century, as
the yields of nearby mines were collected and hauled off, but it
expired in the late 1960s, and vandals have since reduced it to a
few patches of asphalt, broken glass and rusted auto parts. When we
stopped here, the wind was whistling mournfully through that lone
salt cedar tree, but the mood was broken when the engineer of a
passing freight issued a friendly blast from his horn.
</P>
<P>
   A few miles farther on, in Amboy, Roy's Cafe was open for
business, but the experience wasn't particularly pleasant. The
counter man, drinking beer from a long-neck bottle at midday on a
Sunday, at first ignored us, then cheerlessly sold us a couple of
1-ounce bags of potato chips for $1 each. Then he bristled when a
flash photo was taken of the cafe counter.
</P>
<P>
   Although the experience shattered our reverie, it was just as
well. While it's a delight to get in touch with Route 66 and what
it used to be, the simple highway has been terribly
over-romanticized, such that its many shortcomings are forgotten in
all the nostalgic rhapsodizing.
</P>
<P>
   The little businesses along Route 66 were often manned by
reclusive, sometimes sullen desert rats who may have resented the

food mediocre and the mechanics larcenous.

all those undulations into desert washes and curves around
mountains. It was not unusual to check the oncoming lane and find
it clear, pull out to pass a truck or a car towing a trailer, and
have an oncoming vehicle suddenly pop up out of one of those dips.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond Amboy, a corrugated tin roof flapped in the wind above a
long-closed cafe and gas station in Essex. We preferred this to the
cafe we found open in Amboy.
</P>
<P>
   A general cantankerousness remains in these crumbling
settlements, though. Because souvenir-hunters have replaced the
family tourist caravans of old, many of the ruins are surrounded by

   photo caption: A classic-car exhibit at the Riverside Resort in
Laughlin, Nev., can generate inspiration for a Route 66
exploration. A 1941 Ford pickup truck on display might have climbed
the hills of nearby Oatman, Ariz., before that section of the old
road was bypassed in 1952. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
LAUGHLIN, Nev. _ There's probably no better way to get in the mood
for a Route 66 exploration in western Arizona and eastern
California than to visit the classic-car exhibit at the Riverside
Resort, at the extreme north end of Laughlin's strip.
</P>
<P>
   Here is American highway travel from its glory era: Detroit
gas-guzzlers and sports cars from the 1950s and `60s, with flashy
colors, black-vinyl seats and acres of shiny chrome.
</P>
<P>
   Corvettes? They are numerous, from '54 through the first year of
the Sting Ray ('63) and on up. Also T-birds, Camaros, Mustangs,
Malibus, Galaxies, even a '58 Dodge Custom Royale, with a two-tone,
red-and-white paint job and tail fins so prominent they could
probably pick up HBO.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are what I remember best in that era,'' said Don
Laughlin, 69, founder of the resort and ... well, the town. ``You
get a real education about cars. It takes you back in time and lets
you feel young again.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not solely an exhibit. The hotel is licensed as a car
dealer, and most of the restored classics on display have been
placed on consignment by their owners. The cars _ and a lot of
vintage motorcycles, too _ are displayed in two exhibit rooms (one
at the front of the hotel, the other on the second floor). There is
no charge to look at them.
</P>
<P>
   Don Laughlin personally owns a half-dozen of them, he said,
including one from what could be described as Route 66's ``Grapes
of Wrath'' era: a '31 Ford Roadster. ``I get it out a couple of
times a year,'' he admitted, ``drive it around for a week or two
and then put it back.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the cars is sure to resonate with baby boomers who can
recall striking out across the desert on long-past family
vacations. It is a '55 Chevy Nomad station wagon _ a two-door, at
that. If you peer through the windows, you might even notice the
vintage, stainless-steel ice chest in the back. &QL;

FORMER SECRET SERVICE AGENT RETURNS TO BRITAIN TO BE ARRESTED 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By SARAH LYALL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ He had lived in self-imposed exile for the past three
years, infuriating the British government with a series of
disclosures about the country's two ultra-secret security agencies.
But on Monday, David Shayler, a former security agent who calls
himself a patriot and a whistleblower, returned to Britain to be
branded a criminal.
</P>
<P>
   Under a deal with the government, which agreed to release him on
bail if he surrendered, Shayler, 34, was arrested in Dover on
Monday morning as he stepped off a ferry from Calais, France.
Shayler was charged with two violations of Britain's Official
Secrets Act, a sweeping law that outlaws unauthorized disclosures
of any kind about the internal workings of the government. He will
face a trial and, if found guilty, could be sentenced to up to four
years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Shayler worked for three years at one of Britain's security
agencies, known as MI5, serving in areas dealing with terrorism in
Northern Ireland as well as throughout the world, and with
background checks for government officials. He quit in early 1997,
disillusioned with what he said was a pervasive culture of
drunkenness, apathy, incompetence and lack of accountability there.
His complaints were outlined in an August 1997 article in the Mail
on Sunday newspaper, as was Shayler's accusation that the MI5 had
kept secret files on several members of the current government,
including Peter Mandelson, now the Northern Ireland secretary, when
they were active in student movements in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   The government quickly obtained a far-reaching civil injunction
barring the British news media from airing any more of Shayler's
disclosures, which included accusations that MI5 mishandled
investigations of Irish Republic Army attacks in London in the
1990s and that it failed to take steps that would have prevented
the bombing of the Israeli Embassy in 1994. Shayler, sensing that
he was about to be arrested after the August 1997 article, fled the
country, moving to the Netherlands and eventually settling in
France.
</P>
<P>
   But what really angered the British government was a far more
explosive allegation by Shayler, who said that Britain's other
security agency, MI6, the foreign intelligence service, had spent
$160,000 or so in a plot to assassinate Col. Moammar Gadhafi, the
Libyan leader, in February 1996. (The plot went awry, he said, when
agents paid by the agency put a bomb under the wrong car, killing
several Libyan bystanders.)
</P>
<P>
   When Shayler threatened to publish details of the alleged plot
on the Internet, he was arrested and held in a Paris prison for
three and a half months in 1998. But he was released when the
French government refused to extradite him, saying that the British
charges against him were politically, not criminally, motivated.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the government dismissed talk of an
anti-Gadhafi plot as ``pure fantasy.'' In an interview in 1998,
Robin Cook, the foreign secretary, said that he was ``perfectly
satisfied'' that the previous Tory government had never put forward
such a plan, and that there was nothing to suggest that MI6 had
``any interest, any role or any experience of any such escapade.''
</P>
<P>
   Shayler has always said that he eventually wanted to come home.
Now that Britain is poised to incorporate into its domestic law the
European Convention on Human Rights _ a set of principles that
includes the right to free speech _ he said he feels he stands a
better chance of being acquitted when his case comes to trial.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But it remains to be seen, he told the British Broadcasting
Corp, whether the British government will really go through with a
prosecution against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the government really wants me in court,'' he
told the BBC. ``The government has always misled and lied to the
British public in my case, and I would be seeking disclosure of
documents to prove that in any trial. In those circumstances, I
think the government would rather drop the prosecution.''
</P>
<P>
   Shayler was taken to Charing Cross police station in London on
Monday, where his passport was confiscated. After he was released
on bail, he told a crowd of reporters and supporters that the
government needed to reform the Official Secrets Act, to ensure
that security agencies would be made accountable to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a farcical situation to make it a crime to report a
crime,'' he said.

<P>
   Everything seemed fine that spring afternoon as Capt. Ken Blyth
watched over the loading of his ship in Singapore. He was
skippering the Petro Ranger, a medium-size tanker with a $1.5
million cargo of jet fuel and diesel oil bound for Ho Chi Minh
City. It was a three-day turnaround. No big deal. After it was
over, he'd fly back to his home in Queensland, Australia, to
celebrate his 25th wedding anniversary the following week with his
wife, Denise.
</P>
<P>
   When the Petro Ranger finally slipped its berth, it was just
another cargo vessel amid the daily parade that makes Singapore the
busiest port in the world. Not far outside the harbor is the
Horsburgh Lighthouse, the last outpost of domestic law. From
Horsburgh on, you pass into the only true frontier of the 21st
century: international waters _ the no-man's land of the new world
economy. Not technically owned or patrolled by anyone, these waters
are the last place on earth where you are truly alone.
</P>
<P>
   That night, a Malaysian sailor of Indian extraction was the
officer of the watch, but instead of performing his duties, he
tuned the shortwave to his favorite Indian music station and didn't
pay attention to the radar screen.
</P>
<P>
   Just after 1 a.m., the blue speedboat opened its engines.
Cruising straight up the wake, without any threat of detection, it
pulled up to the ship's stern. There were 12 pirates on board _ as
multicultural as their 18th-century avatars: seven Indonesians,
three Malaysians and two Thais. They had learned the layout of the
ship beforehand and moved with feline grace. Securing bamboo
ladders to the stern, the men scrambled to the main deck and leapt
upon the outside ladder of the accommodation housing, climbing five
stories to the open bridge. Dressed in jeans and T-shirts and with
balaclavas pulled over their faces, they appeared in the bridge's
doorway. They were armed with machetes. The officer of the watch
panicked and fled the chart room by a back exit. The lookout was
overtaken in a struggle that thumped the floor loudly enough to
awaken the captain below.
</P>
<P>
   Blyth sat up in the dark, thinking perhaps that someone on the
bridge had been drinking. Suddenly, he was startled by the sound of
a loud banging at his door. Instinctively, he unlocked it. The door
blew open. Four hooded pirates waving machetes rushed in. A fifth
pirate stepped forward with a gun. He put the barrel to Blyth's
head and ordered the captain to place his hands in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   The pirates bound Blyth with boat lacing. He would remain bound
for the next 13 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have burn marks on my wrists,'' Blyth, 55, a tall,
blue-eyed Scot, recently told me.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pirates wanted me to go around with the master key _ the
one the captain has to unlock any door _ and round up the crew,''
Blyth recalled of that April 17, 1998, night. ``The idea was that I
would knock on the door, tell them not to worry and not to do
anything silly. Then the pirates would tell them to get their hands
out and tie them up.''
</P>
<P>
   One by one, every crew member, except for the officer of the
watch and an engineer who accompanied two pirates to the engine
room, was taken and dumped in the captain's day room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then they took me to the bridge,'' Blyth continued. ``I was
still tied up, and then they taped my arms and legs to the chair.
They didn't understand how to turn off the automatic pilot, and the
pirates were baffled by touch-screen computerized piloting. So I
said, 'If you're going to kill me anyway, why should I help?'''
Then one of the head pirates told Blyth something that convinced
him: the names of his wife and two daughters _ and their street
address.
</P>
<P>
   The pirates unbound Blyth long enough for him to alter course,
taking the Petro Ranger far from the regularly trafficked corridors
of international shipping and into the maritime equivalent of a
dark alley. By the time the pirates retaped him to the chair, the
ship was still steaming northward but no longer on a course for
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   The pirates had taped over the portholes, but the captain once
saw through a crack in the tape over the bathroom porthole that the
bottom half of his ship's identifying blue funnel had been painted
red. And could he have seen the stern, he would have found that the
Petro Ranger no longer existed. He was now aboard the ``Wilby,''
just another vessel bobbing along without notice in international
sea lanes. Over the next several days, changes in the weather and
the flies buzzing in through the vents were enough to convince
Blyth that they were nearing the China coast. Blyth theorized that
the pirates intended to meet some black-market tankers to offload
the fuel cargo. They would need Blyth and his crew to help make
that transfer. But then what?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Piracy's Rivival &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Piracy on the high seas resurfaced in the mid-1980s and in
recent years has ratcheted up to a true crisis both for shippers
and recreational yachtsmen. In 1989, there were 48 acts of piracy
reported around the world; in 1999, there were 285. So far this
year, it's up by 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of piracy's revival is no different from its
appearance centuries ago. Ships serving the top trading nations
(England, Holland and Spain in the old days; America, Germany and
Japan now) are transiting through a global geography of poverty,
envy and desperation. Often these vessels are carrying on board a
king's ransom of commodities _ no longer cinnamon, indigo and flax,
but jet fuel, alkali and aluminum ingots _ all easily
black-marketed into quick money.
</P>
<P>
   Modern piracy ranges from desperate fishermen pulling off petty
larcenies at sea to highly organized syndicates slaughtering crews
to steal multimillion-dollar vessels. Today's pirates are a
troubling symptom of a new world order, one shaped by a fierce
Darwinian struggle in the feral markets of modern international
trade.
</P>
<P>
   Most piracy is of the mugging-at-sea variety. The pirates just
zip up in a speedboat, point a rocket launcher at the hull and
demand money. Lately it has been getting a little rougher. Last
January, an Australian couple were sailing around the world. In the
Gulf of Aden off Yemen, a small powerboat pulled up beside the
couple's catamaran; a burst of machine-gun fire tore through the
hull, wounding the wife. Four pirates boarded the boat, ripped out
some high-tech communications equipment, then left.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, more ambitious pirates realize that stealing some
watches and shipboard cash is small stakes when you're dealing with
a huge vessel carrying cargo worth millions. Often the pirates will
contract with black marketeers to hawk the cargo. And they also
want the ship. This may mean repainting it at sea, obtaining fake
registration papers and then selling it or just using it themselves
to become seemingly legitimate shippers. This process, known as
phantom shipping, is costly and dangerous, requiring serious
planning and organization.
</P>
<P>
   The more sophisticated forms of piracy are carried out by
Southeast Asian syndicates and Chinese triads. According to a 1998
report on piracy published by the International Chamber of
Commerce, the corporate-style organization of the syndicates is
impressive: ships can ``be hijacked to order in the Philippines for
about $300,000 and delivered within three days.''
</P>
<P>
   The global reaction to the piracy revival has been, by all
accounts, slow. So the pirates aren't too scared. Ships disappear
pretty regularly and with impunity. Once a ship has been captured,
the crew faces one of two fates. In the case of the tanker Global
Mars, which was seized by pirates last Feb. 23, the 17 crewmen were
bound and blindfolded before being set off in lifeboats. But the 21
crew members of the Hualien No. 1, which disappeared with a cargo
of river sand last Feb. 28, have never turned up and are now
presumed dead. Most seamen know such stories. They hear them and
can't believe it will ever happen to them. Ken Blyth was certainly
thinking about them when one of the junior pirates told him that
their leader wished to see him at once.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Pirate King &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Blyth was escorted to his own day room, where the pirates had
set up their headquarters. The pirate king was 49 years old, a
well-educated and heavyset Indonesian of medium height. He spoke
four or five languages, including grammatically perfect English.
The pirate king's name, Blyth would learn, was Herman.
</P>
<P>
   The two men sat down and had a cup of coffee. Blyth was
surprised that Herman wanted to chat a little. ``The impression I
got,'' Blyth told me, ``was that having achieved what he had done _
the Petro Ranger was the most modern tanker he'd swiped _ he would
have loved to phone up CNN and say, 'Look what I pulled off.' He
was so exhilarated he wanted to share it with someone. I was the
only one around who could possibly appreciate what he'd done.''
</P>
<P>
   The syndicate he worked for, Herman explained, had five men in
leadership positions: one each from China, Hong Kong, Indonesia,
Malaysia and Singapore. He claimed that they had ``inside access''
to Petroships, the shipping company. They knew that the Petro
Ranger would be sailing with a simple commodity _ fuel _ easily
fungible on the black market. They knew the date of embarkation.
They knew all about Blyth and most of the crew. Herman had all the
documents he would need: registration for the ``Wilby,'' papers
that identified Herman as the legitimate captain along with his
crew and bills of lading identifying the cargo on board as part of
a legitimate charter.
</P>
<P>
   Blyth was returned to his mattress, quite impressed by the
extent of Herman's operation. One thing worried him, though. Why
would Herman tell him all this if he didn't also intend to kill
him?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Great Escape &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After a week, Blyth realized time was running out. Somewhere at
sea, two tankers had pulled up alongside for cargo transfers. A
third tanker was delayed, Blyth learned. The Petro Ranger idled at
sea for several days. Then, on the 13th day of the crew's
captivity, one of the pirates made a huge mistake. With the third
tanker sailing around unable to find the ``Wilby,'' the No. 2
pirate called the tanker on the public VHF frequency. The Chinese
heard him.
</P>
<P>
   Not long afterward, a Chinese patrol vessel stopped, boarded and
inspected the Petro Ranger. But Herman handled it smoothly. He
locked Blyth and a few of his men down below in crew cabins. He
presented papers indicating that he was the captain and passed off
both Blyth's legitimate sailors and his own henchmen as his crew.
(The pirates kept Blyth's crew in check by routinely reminding them
that they knew the whereabouts of their wives and families.)
</P>
<P>
   Suspecting a smuggling operation, the Chinese withdrew and
waited to see what might happen. When the third tanker did arrive,
the Chinese sped in, stopped both ships at sea, and escorted them
to Haikou harbor on the island of Hainan in southern China. Since
the Chinese were now convinced that the ``Wilby'' was a smuggling
ship, Herman quietly contacted his syndicate and got a lawyer to
facilitate the usual round robin of bribes. Blyth learned all this
from, of course, Herman, who enjoyed summoning the captain back to
the day room to boast about his caginess.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided I had to get to the Chinese,'' Blyth recalled, ``and
then I could only hope that I was in fact getting to the good guys,
the ones who weren't corrupt.'' With one of his crew members,
Saini, who spoke a little Mandarin, he arranged a midnight meeting
with a Chinese lieutenant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saini explained who I was,'' Blyth recalled, ``and I gave him
my passport and some Malaysian documents stating I had command of
the Petro Ranger, which the pirates had neglected to destroy.''
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, Chinese soldiers came to the ship and herded
first Herman and his ``officers'' and then nearly the entire mix of
pirates and legitimate crew onto their boat. Told they were simply
going ashore to sign documents granting port clearance, they easily
complied as 30 armed soldiers held their weapons at the ready.
Blyth then pointed at each man in turn, identifying him as either
pirate or crew.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Trouble in Port &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not long after the Chinese officials arrested the pirates, Blyth
was taken ashore and interrogated by two different law-enforcement
agencies: the People's Liberation Army, all dressed in green
outfits, and the Public Security Bureau, distinguished by khaki.
Days of repetitive interviews and odd accusations _ at one point, a
PSB official suggested that Blyth had made the whole pirate thing
up _ gave the captain the impression his ship had become ensnared
in a major power play. The PLA was deeply concerned with how this
might look internationally (and were, therefore, sort of on Blyth's
side). The PSB, however, seemed more beholden to provincial powers
in southern China, which are widely suspected not only of
tolerating piracy but also of organizing it.
</P>
<P>
   In the end Petroships retrieved its stolen ship _ but the
Chinese kept all of the remaining 5,100 tons of fuel, nearly half
the original cargo, as ``evidence'' before waiting some time and
selling it off.
</P>
<P>
   Petroships was luckier in some respects that the owners of the
Anna Sierra, which was ``saved'' from pirates by the Chinese in
1996. In that case, the cargo was sold and the authorities even
refused to permit the owners to reclaim the ship. Without care, it
took on water and to this day the ship remains beached in Beihai
harbor in southern China, a rusting monument to the inadequacy of
policing modern piracy.
</P>
<P>
   Four months after Blyth went home, the Chinese authorities
quietly released Herman and all of his men. The Chinese have
refused to explain why they would let the pirates go, as they have
done repeatedly in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my old crew members phoned me up in early August,''
Blyth said. ``He's still at sea, and he told me that five of our
pirates, three of the Malaysians and the two Thais, have been
spotted doing piracy again, working the waters between Port Dickson
and Port Klang near Kuala Lumpur. You just can't believe it, but
they're back out there.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   On a balmy night in Albuquerque, 80 homeowners shuffle into the
cafeteria at Whittier Elementary School to listen to New Mexico's
governor, Gary Johnson, a lithe, boyish figure in a checked blazer
and clashing patterned tie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made you all a pledge that I was going to put the issues
that should be on the front burner on the front burner, regardless
of the consequences,'' he says. ``Half of what we spend on law
enforcement, half of what we spend on the courts and half of what
we spend on the prisons is drug-related. Our current policies on
drugs are perhaps the biggest problem that this country has.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone tells kids not to do drugs, Johnson says. Despite this
chorus, nearly 80 million Americans have tried them, including more
than half of this year's graduating high school class. No one
condones this, he adds, but do we really want our kids to be
branded ``criminals'' for having experimented with drugs? If
they're not driving or stealing while high, where is the harm?
</P>
<P>
   Johnson looks down at his cheat sheet; he's an unpolished if
ardent speaker. Last year, he points out, 450,000 people died from
smoking cigarettes. Alcohol killed 150,000, and another 100,000
died from legal prescription drugs. How many people died last year
from the use of marijuana? Few, if any. From cocaine and heroin?
Five thousand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yet we are arresting 1.5 million people a year in this country
on drug-related crime,'' Johnson says, his voice rising. ``Half of
those arrests are for marijuana, and half those arrested are
Hispanics. Tell me that half the users of marijuana in the United
States of America are Hispanic! I don't think so.'' We're locking
up nonviolent people senselessly, he tells the mostly white
audience, his blue eyes and neck veins bulging. ``We ought to
legalize marijuana. We need to stop 'getting tough' with drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to believe this is a Republican governor. People say
they want politicians who will give it to them straight. Well, this
is what straight must sound like. Yet people look dubious. ``If
everyone were like Gary Johnson and a triathlete, it would be
fine,'' one man tells me. They'd have the fortitude to steer clear
of legally available dope. ``But they're not.''
</P>
<P>
   That's putting it mildly. Johnson, 47, regularly finishes near
the top of his age group in Ironman competitions, which combine a
2.4 mile swim, a 112-mile bike ride and a marathon. He once ran 100
miles in 30 consecutive hours in the Colorado Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   And these are just his physical feats. Johnson is manic about
being on time. He sets 10 or so goals each year and writes them on
the back of a business card; this year, the list includes learning
yoga (he's in a class each Wednesday after work), reading a book a
month and having one ``adventure'' each week.
</P>
<P>
   So how did a hokey role model like Johnson come to be viewed by
the drug policy establishment as a threat to the nation's youth? By
acting like the uncompromising heroes in the Ayn Rand novels he
admires. Last summer, a few months into his second and
(constitutionally mandated) final term, Johnson told state GOP
leaders that he was determined to make the most of his bully pulpit
while he had it. Days later, without having thought it all through
(he says now), Johnson told reporters that he would support
legalizing marijuana and heroin.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Into the Spotlight &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ka-boom! The White House drug czar, Gen. Barry McCaffrey, flew
in to condemn him. Ed Bradley came down to do a segment for ''60
Minutes.'' Johnson became the toast of the libertarian Cato
Institute and Rolling Stone magazine, on his way to a starring role
at the recently convened ``shadow conventions.'' Meanwhile, his
chief law-enforcement official quit in protest, a local sheriff
called him an ``idiot'' and his approval rating sank from 54
percent to 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the people surrounding him wish he would stop,'' says
Darren White, the top cop who quit Johnson's cabinet. ``But this is
vintage Gary Johnson.'' Meaning pigheaded or principled, depending
on whom you ask.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has vetoed a record-shattering 578 bills during his
tenure, producing the state's worst gridlock _ and lowest spending
increases _ in decades.
</P>
<P>
   All of which means that Johnson, the highest-ranking official
ever to call for partial drug legalization, may have just the
temperament to force an overdue debate. Can a fitness addict who's
an improbable mix of Howard Roarke, Tony Robbins and Stephen Covey
break America's $40-billion-a-year drug-war habit?
</P>
<P>
   It is 5 a.m. in Santa Fe the morning after his elementary school
talk. I've come along for his notorious morning workout. We're
running 11 miles up a mountain in the dark. I'm gasping for air
after 10 minutes. By the 25-minute mark, he has circled back four
times to urge me on. I finally persuade him to go on alone; he'll
catch me on the way down.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has a point system for his workouts _ one point each for
a running mile, a quarter-mile swim, three miles of biking or 10
minutes of weight lifting. Johnson racks up 77 points a week. (It's
one of his goals.)
</P>
<P>
   Johnson hasn't always been this driven. His father was a public
school teacher; his mother worked at the Bureau of Indian Affairs.
A middling student, Johnson never thought about going anywhere but
the University of New Mexico. That's where the pot he started
smoking in high school became something of a lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   The governor talks about those days with remarkable candor. He
didn't just ``experiment'' with marijuana, the invariable
confession of boomer politicians. Johnson told me he was high two
to three times a week between his senior year of high school and a
year after college, when he decided it was a ``handicap'' and
stopped. He also tried cocaine twice. ``Whoa!'' Johnson remembers
feeling. ``I understand why people do it. This is
UN-be-LIEV-able.'' And therefore too dangerous to continue, he
reckoned.
</P>
<P>
   Having put himself through school with a string of construction
jobs, Johnson began his own handyman and remodeling business. His
break came a decade later, when his company got a hefty chunk of a
huge Intel plant expansion.
</P>
<P>
   The deal swiftly took Johnson's revenues from $1.5 million to
$38 million, sparking a classic small-business crisis. Endless days
spent chasing receivables to meet his firm's swelling payroll drove
him to the brink. ``I felt like I understood suicide,'' he recalls.
To cope, he took a night course in time management in 1987. It made
him reassess everything.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Turning Point &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized, looking back over my life,'' he says, ``that when
I was fit everything seemed to work.'' He gave up liquor, ramped up
his fitness program and began writing down goals.
</P>
<P>
   By 1993, at age 40, the now-prosperous Johnson told friends he
was ready to run for the U.S. Senate. But the incumbents looked
entrenched, so he decided he would become governor. Republican
elders were amused. They told him a likable young businessman could
have a big future if he started with the state legislature. Johnson
thanked them for their advice, plunked down half a million dollars
(serious money in New Mexico politics) to win the GOP primary and
rode Newt Gingrich's coattails into the Statehouse.
</P>
<P>
   I ask Johnson about his political philosophy. He says he is not
a true libertarian, because he thinks government often has a role.
But he will never qualify as a ``compassionate conservative.''
After six years of his stewardship, New Mexico remains among the
nation's poorest states, with one of the highest levels of
uninsured citizens. Shouldn't government do more on health
coverage? Johnson dismisses the problem, saying that many folks
don't want insurance and that with emergency rooms, nobody really
goes without.
</P>
<P>
   What about help for the working poor in an age when unskilled
folks are losing ground? ``I don't buy into that,'' Johnson snaps.
``Anybody that wants to be an entrepreneur in this country can make
an absolute fortune.'' Even somebody who cleans houses, he says.
</P>
<P>
   How's that? I ask, huffing behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I started a business tomorrow just cleaning houses by
myself,'' he says, ``I think I could make $100,000 a year. You
clean four houses at $100 a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what these people do when they come in and clean. In
three hours I could do what they do. I just don't buy into the
notion that anybody can't still make it today if they are willing
to work hard.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Paradoxical Approach &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's empathy gap highlights a paradox in his approach to
drugs. His fierce belief in personal responsibility is what
convinced him that the drug war is a waste of money; if you're
spending $40 billion and the drugs keep coming in, he figured, why
not just legalize the stuff and work on people so they don't get
hooked? Yet he has vetoed millions for drug treatment partly
because he seems to feel people should be able to straighten
themselves out by an act of willpower, just as he did. As a result,
he has alienated natural allies in the public health community in a
state that boasts the county with the highest death rate from
heroin overdoses in the country.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, government at all levels spent less than $5 billion on
drug control and incarcerated about 50,000 Americans for nonviolent
drug offenses; today, it spends some $40 billion and jails more
than 450,000 (more than Europe, with a larger population, jails for
everything). Blacks make up 17 percent of cocaine users but also 88
percent of those convicted on crack cocaine charges.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Johnson isn't the first official to say there's something
wrong with this picture, but a crusade by a sitting Republican
governor marks a new high point for dissent. For years,
conservative intellectuals like Milton Friedman and William F.
Buckley Jr. have made a libertarian case for legalization. But both
political parties found prison-building, ``tough'' sentencing laws
and calls to ``Just Say No'' politically irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1988, Kurt Schmoke, the black mayor of Baltimore and a
rising Democratic star, stunned the U.S. Conference of Mayors by
saying the drug war was doing more harm than good. All options,
decriminalization included, he said, should be considered.
Schmoke's stand landed him on the front page of newspapers around
the country. When he was re-elected twice afterward, it proved that
a black, big-city mayor, at least, could buck the bromides and
survive.
</P>
<P>
   The year since Johnson glibly floated the notion of providing
heroin legally by prescription has seen the taming of governor. He
now seeks legalization for marijuana only and promotes ``harm
reduction'' strategies for other drugs, a policy associated with
reformers like Ethan Nadelmann of the George Soros-backed
Lindesmith Center. These analysts view drugs as a public health
problem, not a criminal one, and back broad programs for needle
exchange and methadone maintenance. They also criticize ``mandatory
minimum'' sentences that can leave nonviolent drug offenders in
jail longer than rapists or burglars.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey, who has himself fought to fix unfair sentencing laws,
nonetheless views much of the harm-reduction agenda as a ploy to
pave the way toward full legalization. Johnson's efforts, he tells
me sharply, are ``irresponsible,'' ``misguided'' and ``anathema to
America's parents.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so, but back at Whittier Elementary School, at least, a
lot of parents see it differently. A Vietnam veteran, an elderly
man in a red baseball jacket and a 40-ish professional type rise
one after another to say they don't usually agree with Johnson but
admire his courage in raising this issue. There's assent and
applause from the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson says that a number of governors have told him privately
they respect what he's doing; they also say their careers would be
over if they tried it. But the issue is gaining steam. A California
ballot initiative this November would divert nonviolent first-time
drug offenders to treatment; New York's chief judge recently
introduced a similar system administratively. Johnson, meanwhile,
has his first-ever bipartisan task force coming back in December
with a slate of reforms in drug policy, which he says could even
include pardons for nonviolent offenders.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is determined to get something done. He has been at it
only a year, and he has two and a half more to go before he leaves
office. After that, as everyone in the state seems to know,
Johnson's only firm plan is to climb Mount Everest.
</P>
<P>
   Discussing this, Raymond Sanchez, the speaker of New Mexico's
House of Representatives, hunts down his copy of ``Into Thin Air,''
Jon Krakauer's best seller about the 1996 Everest disaster, and
cites this passage to sum up what you need to know about Gary
Johnson: ``Any person who would seriously consider'' climbing
Everest, Krakauer writes, ``is almost by definition beyond the sway
of reasoned argument.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Earlier this summer, I went for a swim at Barton Springs, a
freshwater pool that lies at the geographical and spiritual center
of Austin. Under an oak tree, I found Stuart Stevens of the Bush
campaign, typing on a Dell laptop. He was writing the script for
the video that would be shown at the Republican National
Convention. All around him, half-naked kids with ornate tattoos
lolled on the grass, working on nothing except their tans.
</P>
<P>
   Austin has always been a city of distinct worlds _ a college
town, a state capital and a live-music center all in one. But
lately the number of worlds that Austin contains has been
multiplying, and now, everywhere you look, there is the spectacle
of worldviews clashing.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last century, the population of Austin has doubled
every 20 years, and in the metropolitan area there are now more
than 1 million residents. Thirty-five thousand people, the
equivalent of a fair-sized town, moved here last year alone. And in
the last five years, Austin has produced or acquired 17,000 new
millionaires. Now an upper class of tech barons lord it over a
middle class of state government and university workers; a national
Republican campaign machine whirs above a local Democratic power
structure; yuppies infiltrate the habitat of punk rockers. It's as
if every Austin stereotype has spawned its opposite: easy-going
Slackers live beside hard-driving Techies, and old-school liberals
drink at the same bars as new-school conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   The magnitude of this transformation was not wholly apparent to
me until I spoke with John Thornton in mid-April. Thornton is a
general partner at Austin Ventures, the most powerful venture
capital firm in town. That puts him at the epicenter of the New
Economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rate of change in activity in venture capital has been
larger in Austin than probably anywhere else in the country,''
Thornton told me. ``In 1996, venture capitalists spent $67 million
in Austin. In 1999, we told people that we thought, Gee golly, $700
million would be spent. The actual number ended up being about $1.1
billion.''
</P>
<P>
   The impact of all this new money on Austin is debated endlessly
over breakfast tacos and barbecue dinners. Is the laid-back
hipster's paradise doomed to become another mess of a big city?
People talk a lot about it, but few end up doing anything.
</P>
<P>
   An exception, Thornton told me, is a guy named Ross Garber, one
of the city's freshly minted tech millionaires. After Thornton
introduced us via e-mail, Garber and I arranged to meet at a
Starbucks in his neighborhood southwest of downtown. Garber's
mild-mannered looks disguise an intense personality. He began his
career in the tech corridor along Route 128 in Boston, he told me,
and moved with his wife to Austin in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Their reasons for coming, I learned, were remarkably similar to
those of most Austin newcomers. Jobs, yes, but also that amorphous
allure known as ``quality of life.'' With its bars, bands and
barbecue joints, its lakes, parks, low crime and temperate winters,
Austin is a lifestyle mecca that attracts all kinds.
</P>
<P>
   Garber and I took a driving tour of Austin when we met for the
second time. As we nosed under an elevated highway, we came face to
face with a modern-looking fortress of red brick and glass.
``That's Vignette,'' he said, tapping on the window. He helped
start Vignette four and a half years ago; today it is the largest
e-business software firm in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vignette has created about $3 billion worth of employee
wealth,'' he noted with pride. Garber himself is 33, and his net
worth is somewhere upward of $200 million. On Garber's side of
town, brand-new mansions have spread as rapidly as cedar trees
across the rolling limestone hills. The recent history of Austin is
written on those hills. For a generation, the definition of a
political fight was a developer wrestling with environmentalists
over how fast the city should grow. Those fights seem almost quaint
compared with what's on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   Because of all the new people, Austin now suffers from
world-class traffic jams, polluted air, a serious lack of
affordable housing and a school system in disarray. Eager to become
part of the solution, Garber recently formed a coalition of tech
leaders to hustle a light-rail project through the city's
cumbersome political process.
</P>
<P>
   Garber's perspective on Austin _ that its extreme rate of growth
threatens to wipe out the very qualities that attracted people in
the first place _ may be the one notion that finds support across
the city's disparate worlds.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A Decade of Change
</P>
<P>
   When the movie ``Slacker,'' set in Austin, came out in 1991, the
city was in the grip of a profound economic malaise. Rent
``Slacker'' today, and it's like flipping through a scrapbook of
how much has been eradicated in one busy, busy decade. Gone are the
vacant lots, the Quack's coffee shop near campus, the bookstore
staffed by JFK conspiracy nuts. Today the local paper publishes
breathless stories about $500 bottles of wine.
</P>
<P>
   The maker of ``Slacker,'' Richard Linklater, is working on an
animated feature called ``Waking Life.'' When I visited him at
Detour Filmproduction, every room was filled with artists sitting
in front of Macintosh computers, transforming film footage into
animated action. ``It's very human,'' said Linklater of the
results. ``It's a great marriage of film and computer. I think
Austin is the kind of place where that cross-pollination can
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Linklater doesn't think he could start out
here today. ``I came to Austin 16 years ago. My rent was $133 a
month, all bills paid, and I could live on $3,500 a year. So I
spent all my time watching movies, editing, shooting. Film students
are like, How do you do it? I don't know. If you have to work all
day just to pay your rent, I don't know. If I was just starting out
now? Might go to San Antonio.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the rest of Texas, Austin has always been a place where
what mattered most _ music, film, education, public policy _ was
supposedly motivated by concerns that were not entirely commercial.
Now Austin has developed an indigenous business scene. First came
Dell, later Tivoli, Trilogy and Vignette. These days Austin has a
1.9 percent unemployment rate and has been named the best city in
the country for doing business by Fortune and Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   Day-to-day living, however, has become harder for a lot of
people. The public schools, for example, used to be considered
pretty solid; now the Austin Independent School District struggles
to keep up with the profound population shifts. For every new
computer programmer who arrives in town, a gardener, a housecleaner
and a couple of construction laborers follow. In recent years, the
greatest job growth has been not in the software industry but in
the restaurant sector: busboys, dishwashers, short-order cooks,
waitresses. These service workers are generally poor _ their
incomes have not kept pace with the rising cost of living _ and the
school system struggles to find a place for their children. One
thousand new kids converge on schools in the southern part of the
district every year.
</P>
<P>
   One bright spot is Travis High School, which, by all rights,
should be a catastrophe. The student body is 90 percent minority,
80 percent low-income. So many students get pregnant that there is
a waiting list for their infants to get into the nursery that
principal Nelda Howton set up.
</P>
<P>
   Howton set up a foundation to accept donations of money and
equipment. When she held meetings with executives at companies in
town, they responded generously _ particularly hardware companies
like AMD and 3M. Howton looked at what was happening in Austin and
decided to start classes in C++ and Java computer languages, and
set up a multimedia lab where students build Web sites. She filled
classrooms with orange and aqua i-Macs, got every kid an e-mail
address and wired up the shabby brick building with fiber-optic
lines. It's a blinking, glowing declaration of progress where you'd
least expect to find it.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Fusion of Old and New &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Austin's politics have been changing right along with the
economy. Mayor Kirk Watson represents a fusion of old and new
priorities and has earned a reputation as perhaps the most
effective mayor in memory. Early in May, Watson wooed the New
Economy crowd at a mixer to raise money for his re-election.
Venture capitalists and software CEOs lined up to shake Watson's
hand, then write him a check. It has been a difficult constituency
to seduce. Many hardware companies have a long tradition of civic
engagement. But the software types are younger, more arrogant, less
responsible. Their start-ups also have no tradition of corporate
philanthropy, and few, if any, local clients.
</P>
<P>
   National politics has a certain luster to it, and many of
Austin's tech lords have gotten swept up in George W. Bush's bid
for the White House. Two local tech stars, the hardware king
Michael Dell and the software guru Steve Papermaster, have formed a
team of high-tech executives to advise the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   I asked Papermaster whether he thought it was weird that this
liberal enclave should become the launching pad for a possible
Republican presidency. ``Austin has changed from being a purely
liberal city into being more centered, though still with a liberal
bent,'' asserted Papermaster. ``It's a place that has aggressively
embraced growth. And that reasonably approximates the governor's
philosophy. It's not a clash. It's closer to a parallel, and
perhaps even a convergence.''
</P>
<P>
   As for local affairs, the various tasks of making a city
function, well, that just isn't as sexy, compared with national
politics. Earlier this year, at a gathering of local software CEO's
called the Austin 360 Summit (which Papermaster helped start),
Watson delivered an impassioned speech about the challenges facing
the city. While the mayor was talking, a baby-faced CEO raised his
hand. ``Why are you looking at us to help with these community
issues?'' asked the software CEO. ``That's your job.''
</P>
<P>
   Just when it seemed as if the tech barons deserved to be cast as
villains, matters took an unexpected turn. Last year, after
Vignette went public, Ross Garber sold a large amount of stock,
turned down a bunch of job offers and spent nine months wondering
what to do with his time.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Garber was sitting in traffic when his cell phone
rang. It was Lee Walker, whom he knew from the 360 Summit. Walker
is Old Austin (he has shoulder-length white hair and wears a suede
hat) but possesses a New Austin resume (he was the first president
of Dell). He's now the volunteer chairman of Capital Metro, the
city's public transportation system.
</P>
<P>
   Walker approached Garber with a small request. In November, the
city was going to vote on whether to build a light-rail system. By
law, Capital Metro could not campaign for the ballot initiative.
And the idea faced stiff opposition from people like Gerald
Daugherty, a conservative figure in Old Austin circles who had
formed an antirail group called Reclaim Our Allocated Dollars, or
ROADS. ``I need a high-tech poster boy,'' Walker told Garber.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, light rail is a deeply countercultural idea. Natives
consider the pickup truck roughly equivalent to the American flag
in symbolic value, and public transportation a Kremlinesque
conspiracy to undermine their way of life. But Dallas, of all
places, built a light-rail line that has proved surprisingly
popular, and now Austin's leaders were convinced that they could,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Garber formed a team of techies to consider light rail. John
Thornton joined it, and so did Steve Papermaster, among others.
Light rail was imperative, the group determined; the city's air was
becoming so dirty that it would soon violate federal health
standards. Garber got all fired up. ``I'm not a train hugger,'' he
vowed. ``But this place is exploding.''
</P>
<P>
   Garber then embarked on something that might be called a
21st-century political campaign. Early in May, we drove past
rainbow-colored bungalows smoldering in the heat in search of
Garber's billboards. Downtown, Garber spotted one: MORE TRAFFIC
AHEAD. PERIOD. On I-35, a main north-south artery, a yellow
billboard announced: FREE PARKING AVAILABLE ON I-35.
</P>
<P>
   By choosing mass transit as their cause, the techies were
picking a fight with Austin's traditional business groups, the real
estate developers, car dealers and oilmen who have always loved
highways. Garber himself went through culture shock. ``Different
language, different pace,'' he reported. ``With Old Austin, the art
is the process _ the listening, the communicating, the cajoling,
the time it takes. In tech, you just don't work that way.''
</P>
<P>
   It had been clear what would happen if the tech people had
remained secluded in their parallel universe. This dusty Eden would
turn into another Silicon Valley, then everybody who could afford
to would move on to the next paradise. But what if Old and New
Austin learned to work together instead? This was what was so
promising about the rail project: Maybe someday Austin could become
the kind of place where the private sector gets involved and stays
involved, instead of just sitting idly by while the public sector
falls apart. A school like Travis might become the rule, not the
exception.
</P>
<P>
   But as time passes, the balance of things keeps tilting the
other way. In July, Nelda Howton gave up. The buzz around Austin
was that she wasn't appreciated sufficiently. Howton said that
wasn't true. ``I couldn't get to work!'' she told me. She lives in
a town called Salado, and she used to be able to get to work in 45
minutes. But as Austin kept expanding, her commute did, too, until
it swelled to two hours. ``I was spending 20 hours a week on the
road,'' she said. There was a lightness in her voice, as if some
great frustration had eased. She was going to open a brand-new
school in Killeen, about 60 miles from Austin, and now it would be
somebody else's job to worry about whether the children of Austin's
housekeepers and gardeners and short-order cooks had food, or beds,
or access to modern marvels like the i-Mac.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Follow the crack of the Liberty Bell as far as the eye can see
and there he is, alone on a park bench in the middle of
Philadelphia, as obscure as he wants to be. ``Getting a little
vitamin D,'' he says when I reach him, and lifts his face to the
first sun either of us has seen after 15 hours on a bus, riding the
interstate through the night and into this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   He's as obscure as he wants to be _ except for all those tour
buses parked on the other side of the square, his in particular,
with the tops of two '49 Buick Roadmasters erupting through the
roof and a license plate that reads POCAHONTAS. For a while we talk
about the allure of the road (``I like it,'' he says, ``I mean, I
miss my family, but. ...'' and then shrugs, a concession not an
apology), the music he listens to (``I don't play that much pop
these days, mostly Beethoven, Wagner''), about his recent CD,
``Silver and Gold'' (his first studio recording in four years). We
talk about the eight-disc archival box set he's preparing for
release this fall, covering his ascent from obscurity in the
mid-'60s to 1972, when he had Billboard's No. 1 album of the year;
and the two tours he's staging, one on his own and one with three
old friends, who, 30 years ago, were the biggest band in America.
</P>
<P>
   Time has finally cornered him long enough to monumentalize him,
it seems; but we'll see. Once he wrote songs with titles like
``Journey Through the Past'' _ barely conscious efforts to conquer
the present and cheat the future _ and he has always given a very
good impression of a man running from his place in musical history
as if it were a tomb. When we make our way to the hotel where the
bus is parked, a fan works up the nerve to ask for an autograph,
but Neil Young says, ``No, I don't do that,'' and walks right on
by, breaking his stride not even a little.
</P>
<P>
   Until I actually step on board, everyone assures me the
Pocahontas is a sanctuary never breached. Back beyond the special
well designed for Ben, his 21-year-old son with cerebral palsy who
watches the highway from his wheelchair, Young sprawls on his huge
bed. ``I was playing in a club in Fort William,'' he begins, ``and
we're doing a song called 'Farmer John,' and toward the end of it
we started jamming. ...''
</P>
<P>
   This is way back. This is back in the autumn of 1964 with a band
called the Squires, in Canada, where Young was reared in the little
town of Omemee with its ``blue, blue windows behind the stars'' and
where at the age of 3 he slipped into a nearby lake and nearly
drowned. This is back before his early days as part of a Motown
band with Rick James, back before his long exodus to L.A. in a
hearse looking for Stephen Stills, whom he would find only at the
last minute in a Sunset Strip traffic jam, before they formed
Buffalo Springfield. This is before ``After the Gold Rush'' and
``Harvest'' put him on the map in the early 1970s, and before the
subsequent 28 albums that have kept him on and off the map ever
since.
</P>
<P>
   This is way back, before a crumbling spinal disc in 1971 and
before the epilepsy, which still haunts him onstage. This is before
the afternoon he fired his lead guitarist for an uncontrolled
heroin problem that took the guitarist's life that very night, and
before the subsequent music that Young recorded in a
tequila-flooded exorcism of grief and guilt. This is before the
Thermidor of late-'70s punk, when one rock icon after another fell
before its guillotine of cultural relevancy, and Young was the one
'60s artist not only spared by the revolution but also embraced as
a kindred spirit.
</P>
<P>
   This is back before the nitwitted lawsuit filed against him in
the '80s by the head of his record label, David Geffen, for not
making true ``Neil Young'' records, before the '90s, when Kurt
Cobain quoted him in his suicide note, before he became the only
artist in the year 2000 that one could possibly imagine sharing a
concert bill with, say, Merle Haggard on the one hand and Nine Inch
Nails on the other. This is back before he became rock's Man That
Time Forgot, making music at once primordial and futuristic,
homegrown and surreal, traditional and insurrectionist, beguiling
and cataclysmic _ before he became, with his distinctive voice and
racked Mojave-storm guitar, a one-man vortex for folk, country,
blues, psychedelia, grunge, electronica, symphonic sweep, metallic
squall.
</P>
<P>
   Way back, playing ``Farmer John'' when he wasn't yet 20, Young
remembers, the music got really wild. ``I had never played like
that before. We were just slamming it. We played the song without
the song, we played what the song was about,'' and in that moment
his musical identity was born. If rock has always been driven by
two impulses, the utopian and the anarchic, many of its most
enduring figures have straddled the two: Chuck Berry, Elvis
Presley, John Lennon, Bob Dylan, Jimi Hendrix, Neil Young. It's the
utopian Neil whose records people buy in droves. But with songs
like 1995's sonic Imax ``I'm the Ocean,'' or the brilliant
``Powderfinger,'' about a young frontier boy killed in an explosion
of survivalist pride and madness (``Then I saw black, and my face
splashed in the sky''), it's the anarchic Neil who howls into the
zeitgeist and alters it.
</P>
<P>
   He likes it when the zeitgeist howls back. With Crazy Horse, a
band just cacophonous and primal enough to capture ``Farmer John''
on record with Young a quarter-century after Fort William, he makes
a point of recording around a full moon, when ``a lot of mechanical
things go wrong, technical difficulties, things that usually work
don't work.'' And in the congenitally enlightened company of
Crosby, Stills and Nash, unabashed utopians who have always sounded
a little funny singing ``Down by the river I shot my baby,'' Neil
Young is Baader-Meinhof: when he performs ``Rockin' in the Free
World'' in Philadelphia, it seems he simply won't let go of the
song, until it becomes clear the song won't let go of him.
</P>
<P>
   From out of the conflict between utopia and anarchy has emerged
moral ambiguity and complexity. In 1970, when he wrote ``Ohio''
following the murder of four students by National Guardsmen at Kent
State University, his rage was more instinctive than political:
``My lyrics get personal about it,'' he acknowledges. ``I'm
singing: 'What if you knew her and saw her dead on the ground? How
could you run when you know?''' But that anger was also answered a
few years later by ``Campaigner,'' when alone among major spokesmen
for the counterculture he expressed compassion for a disgraced
president who lost everything (``Even Richard Nixon has got
soul''); and conspicuously over the years he has refused to adopt
any ideological line. At one time or another he has supported
Ronald Reagan and Jesse Jackson. His ideal ticket in 2000 is
Gore-McCain.
</P>
<P>
   The utopia of his early music succumbed to anarchy most
spectacularly during an unhinged 1973 tour that was his rude answer
to superstardom. The shows would routinely climax with Young
screaming, ``Wake up!'' at his audiences as the '60s crashed down
around him in a rain of dead junkies; now, at the back of the
Pocahontas, all he can manage to say of the period is, ``I'm glad I
made it through it,'' before a pall settles over the interview.
Whenever Young ``tried to get away from success,'' his manager,
Elliot Roberts, remarks of the period, ``it just turned into a
bigger success,'' which wasn't just confusing but mortifying, since
success wasn't particularly subtle about its human toll. Young went
on to chronicle the deaths of the people around him in a series of
anti-drug songs _ ``The Needle and the Damage Done,'' ``Tired
Eyes,'' ``Tonight's the Night'' _ that were all the more
authoritative for the way they were reportorial rather than
judgmental, never denying for a moment the attraction of excess and
darkness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just didn't like people telling me what to do,'' he explains
almost offhandedly. ``I didn't like people telling me if I made
more records like 'Harvest,' I would be successful. That's when I
came up with the concept of destroying what I created in order to
move on. I wanted to do what I called audio verite.''
</P>
<P>
   He pauses and looks out the window. ``At a certain point,
trained, accomplished musicians'' _ which is to say, not him _
``hit the wall. They don't go there very often, they don't have the
tools to go through the wall, because it's the end of notes. It's
the other side, where there's only tone, sound, ambience,
landscape, earthquakes, pictures, fireworks, the sky opening,
buildings falling, subways collapsing. ... I don't know too many
musicians who try to go through the wall.'' He stops for a moment.
``I love to go through the wall,'' as if you ever doubted it for a
moment.
</P>
<P>
   In the collective memory of his longtime audience, he may
forever be the brooding figure reclining alone in the shadowy
gatefold of ``After the Gold Rush.'' But in fact virtually everyone
who has ever known him attests to his humor _ sometimes zany,
sometimes wry, mischievous. Over six feet tall, he has an easy yet
determined stride that encompasses all his contradictions: zen yet
a little obsessive, open yet a little unapproachable, lurching
toward his ambitions yet held back by his wariness of having to
explain himself.
</P>
<P>
   During a disgruntled taping with Crosby, Stills and Nash of
``Storytellers,'' the VH-1 series in which songwriters relate the
stories behind their songs, he paces the small stage like a caged
animal and cracks, ``I thought the song was supposed to tell the
story.'' And when I bump into him in a hotel lobby one afternoon
after failing to pin him down for an interview, and he assures me,
``I'm really not avoiding you, I'm just waiting until I feel more
alert,'' personally I feel quite certain he's avoiding me. But I'm
in the curious position of respecting him all the more for it.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, Elliot Roberts was just a 22-year-old from the Bronx
managing Buffalo Springfield when Young abruptly stopped a
rehearsal one afternoon to demand Roberts be fired on the spot. ``I
was shocked,'' Roberts recalls. ``It blew my mind.'' For days he
wandered L.A. stunned, trying to figure out what hit him, only for
Young to appear suddenly one night at 2 a.m. to explain he was
leaving the band and wanted Roberts to manage him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, he had plotted it all out,'' Roberts now laughs. ``I
thought, Wow, cool _ this guy is as devious as I am.'' To those who
have watched him over the years, Young comes off as a mastermind of
unpredictability. But sometimes he can appear less integrated and
more genuinely divided against himself than people think. The
utopian-anarchic ``schizophrenia'' (Young's word) of his music
reveals both a Spontaneous Neil and a Control-Freak Neil, each real
and each peering over the other's shoulder, each trying to correct
the other's misjudgments, each averting the other from perceived
disaster.
</P>
<P>
   There is no better example of this than the recent misadventures
of Young's authorized biographer. After signing a contract with
both Young and Random House, Jimmy McDonough, a journalist, spent
eight years writing, researching and interviewing more than 300
people, all with Young's cooperation. But when McDonough delivered
a manuscript at the end of 1998, Young suddenly _ according to the
publisher _ ``sabotaged'' the book by withholding his approval of
it, and Random House dropped the biography. In the Young camp,
nobody will comment for the record about why he killed the project.
But the unofficially stated reason _ that McDonough submitted the
book to Random House before submitting it to Young and thereby
breached the contract, betraying Young's trust _ sounds flimsy.
McDonough is now suing him for $1.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   The melodrama of Neil Young's early life reached critical mass
in November 1978 with the birth of his second son _ by his wife,
Pegi _ and the subsequent realization that, like Young's first son,
Zeke, by the actress Carrie Snodgrass, Ben had cerebral palsy.
Zeke's case is mild (he is 27 and works as a sound engineer on a
number of his father's projects), but Ben is a quadriplegic. Young
would later recount walking out of the hospital and ``looking at
the sky, looking for a sign, wondering: What did I do? There must
be something wrong with me.''
</P>
<P>
   But cerebral palsy is a twist of fate, not of genetics _ Young's
daughter, Amber, doesn't have the disease. If all this weren't
overwhelming enough, not long after Ben's birth, Pegi was found to
have a brain tumor, from which, at the time, she had only a 50-50
chance of recovering. So in the early '80s, the man whose obsession
with his music was supposedly all-consuming set the music aside to
devote himself to his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of thoughts in my mind at that time,'' he
says now, ``that I wasn't ready to share with the world,'' and the
matter of Ben's health was so personal that in 1982, when Young
released a strange album called ``Trans'' with electronically
distorted vocals, few knew it grew out of an effort to communicate
with his speechless son by computer. During the rest of the decade,
Young's music seemed at loose ends on a series of recordings that
in hindsight appear redeemed as stylistic explorations of an
artistic identity in turmoil _ out of which ultimately emerged one
of his best albums, ``Freedom,'' in 1989. He then spent the '90s
making one important record after another.
</P>
<P>
   One afternoon in Philadelphia, when we had once again scheduled
an interview and he had once again vanished, I found out he had
gone to a school for children with cerebral palsy. Along with Pegi,
Young is a major supporter of such a school in California, and
during tours he often arranges for young people with the disease to
see the shows. I was annoyed that I hadn't been with him to get the
scene at the school for the story; in true Neil Young fashion, it
even happened during a full moon, when an elevator at the school
suddenly malfunctioned and the singer hovered for several
precarious minutes between floors. But then it occurred to me that
99 out of 100 rock stars would have jumped at the chance to drag me
along and put their humanitarianism on display, and that like so
much else with Young, maybe this was private, too.
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes, you know, he just wings it. Sometimes it's not a
matter of a personal code (which he obviously has), or a
Machiavellian ploy (of which he's clearly capable); it's a matter
of impulse. Standing in the middle of a shopping-center parking lot
on the highway to Cleveland, waiting for the bus to refuel, Young
is talking about spending some time with his family after the tour
on the volcanic Big Island of Hawaii, when a young woman pulls up
in a pickup truck. She leans over and rolls down the window on the
passenger side, and on her face is the disbelief of her own eyes.
``Are you who I think you are?'' she asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who do you think I am?'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you Neil Young?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' he finally answers.
</P>
<P>
   Suspended between astonishment and opportunity, she sputters,
``Would you sign your name for me?''
</P>
<P>
   She scrambles to find something for him to write on. I'm
remembering the autograph hound outside the hotel in Philadelphia.
Now this woman in a pickup truck on her way to get her kid from
school maybe, or coming home from a job waiting on tables, in the
middle of a Wal-Mart parking lot that everybody knows is nowhere,
happens to peer through her windshield to see, standing over on a
small square of grass waiting for his dog to relieve himself, the
full-moon genius of rock 'n' roll. And then she makes two
decisions: the first, to have faith in what her eyes tell her; and
the second, to confront it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure,'' he says. He steps up to the truck, leans in and
scrawls his name on whatever she has offered him, a gut reaction to
the purity of her wonder; and then as she drives away, with a story
she'll tell for the next 50 years, he goes back to contemplating
volcanoes and the sea, and the tropical winds where utopia and
anarchy converge.
</P>
<P>
   As he now seems eternally young, in earlier days Young was old
before his time. ``I'm getting old,'' he sang in his most famous
song, ``Heart of Gold,'' written when he was 24. In Phoenix, after
another show, as the others in the band celebrate with friends
backstage, Young sits alone in a dark, hushed room with a few
candles burning low nearby, nursing his back with an ice pack; he
seems every one of his 54 years. Earlier onstage he lost himself in
a deranged ``Down by the River'' as he had with ``Rockin' in the
Free World'' in Philadelphia, the Man That Time Forgot shredding
time to ribbons. But back here in the dark he's the Man That Time
Remembers, and it's remembering him in his lower back.
</P>
<P>
   So for a while we make small talk that he probably finds more
awkward than his graciousness allows him to admit. And then I
finally leave, after he has just ``slammed '' one more time through
the wall of age, the wall of fear, the wall of passion, to the end
of the night. As if you ever doubted it for a moment, he loves to
go through the wall, beyond the end of notes.

 By STEPHEN J. DUBNER

<TEXT>
<P>
   Stephen King is addicted to writing. It isn't a matter of liking
to write or even loving it. He needs it, chemically, the way years
ago he needed his cocaine and his beer, sometimes a case a day.
``Writing is just this great big conduit, this outflow pipe that
keeps the pressure nice and even,'' he says. ``It just pours all
this (expletive) out. All the insecurities come out, all the fears
_ and also, it's a great way to pass the time.''
</P>
<P>
   And if he hadn't been able to make a career of it?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I'd be dead. I would have drunk myself to death or drugged
myself to death or committed suicide or some goddamn thing.''
</P>
<P>
   In June 1999, he almost died anyway. He and his family were
staying at their lake house in western Maine. It was late afternoon
and King was finishing up his daily four-mile walk. As usual, he
was carrying a book. Although he often reads while walking _ on
dirt roads, for instance, or down Broadway while visiting New York
_ he was not reading at the moment, for this stretch took him up a
steep hill alongside a small highway.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly a blue Dodge minivan crested the hill and pinballed
King off its windshield. He came down in a clump. His head was
bleeding, his lap seemed to be turned sideways and he saw that a
bone in his right leg was pointing in the wrong direction, skyward,
bulging out of his jeans. A short while later, one of his lungs
collapsed. This was all happening in a blur, literally, for King's
eyeglasses were missing. They had somehow landed on the front seat
of the minivan. They would help convince Bryan Smith, the man
driving the van, that he had hit a person and not, as he first
thought, ``a small deer.''
</P>
<P>
   Five weeks later, after King knew he would survive but before he
knew if he would walk again, he resumed writing. His wife, Tabitha,
who is his rock and his redeemer, set him up at a makeshift desk in
the back hallway of their Victorian sprawl in Bangor. It reminded
him of the laundry room in their old trailer, where he wrote
``Carrie,'' back when he washed motel sheets for a living and she
sold Dunkin' Donuts.
</P>
<P>
   Now he sat in a wheelchair, propped up by foam cushions,
brimming with pain and painkillers. Besides the fractured hip,
mangled leg, collapsed lung and lacerated scalp, he had four broken
ribs and a chipped spine, and he had lost 50 pounds. He didn't feel
like working, but a voice in his head _ yes, Stephen King, like his
characters, hears voices _ told him to.
</P>
<P>
   If there is an opposite of writer's block, King has it. As a
teen-ager, he would come home from a Roger Corman movie, write a
novelization in two days, mimeograph a few dozen copies and sell
them at school for a quarter each. By the time he was a college
sophomore, he had five finished novels in a drawer. Last month, his
hyperproductivity paid off yet again. Reaching into another drawer,
he pulled out a novel called ``The Plant'' and did something with
it that made worldwide headlines: he published it himself.
</P>
<P>
   A few months earlier, he became the prince of e-publishing by
releasing, through Scribner, an Internet-only novella. Its success
tickled him, and made him yearn for an even closer-to-home
publishing experience. Enter ``The Plant.'' Instead of a mimeograph
machine, he used his Web site to release it; instead of a quarter a
copy, he suggested a $1 payment for the first installment, with
more to come only if 75 percent of the downloaders paid up. ``My
friends,'' he wrote on his Web site, ``we have the chance to become
Big Publishing's worst nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the novel's plot _ a writer sends a man-eating plant to
a publishing house that rejected his manuscript _ Big Publishing
did its best to appear unruffled. ``I don't feel particularly
threatened,'' said Susan Moldow, the publisher of Scribner, King's
offline publishing house. The literary agent Mort Janklow told a
reporter, ``That's a fellow sitting up in Maine having fun, but
it's not a way to run a business.''
</P>
<P>
   The day after ``The Plant'' was released, King said in an e-mail
message: ``I'm satisfied with the downloads _ about 40,000 as of 4
p.m. yesterday, and we're estimating a total pay-through of maybe
88 percent. Let Mort Janklow put that in his pipe and smoke it!''
</P>
<P>
   Lost in the hubbub was the novel's provenance. King began ``The
Plant'' back in the early 1980s but shelved it because it too
closely resembled ``Little Shop of Horrors.'' It was distributed
only to the people on his Christmas-card list. ``If I gave someone
a coffee maker and they sold it at a yard sale, it wouldn't bother
me,'' he said at the time. ``If they want to sell 'The Plant,'
fine. It's theirs. They can tear out the pages and use 'em for
toilet paper, if that's what they feel like doing.''
</P>
<P>
   This may be what his friends mean when they call him a genius.
After all, who but the chairman of Stephen King Inc. would think to
turn 15-year-old toilet paper into an Internet rage?
</P>
<P>
   The book he finished in his wheelchair, meanwhile, ``On Writing:
A Memoir of the Craft,'' will be published in _ yawn _ early
October. With paper and cloth and glue. For King, 52, it was one of
the scariest books he has written. While a large part of it gives
point-blank advice to the aspiring author (``The adverb is not your
friend''), it also tells the true story of how writing saved
Stephen King from the sort of life _ or death _ that he has instead
had the luxury of turning into fiction.
</P>
<P>
   He has two offices in Bangor: one in the house for writing, the
other in a low-slung flesh-colored building near the airport. This
is where he and two assistants manage the empire that has arisen in
the wake of more than 40 books and nearly as many films based on
the writing of Stephen King and Richard Bachman, King's
pseudonymous counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   It's a Monday morning, mid-June, almost a year to the date of
his accident. King uses one red metal crutch to get from his pickup
truck to the office door. He is sick of the crutch. At a recent
reading in New York, he was determined to appear without it but was
stymied by three steep flights of stairs. Once onstage, however, he
leaned the crutch against a wall and limped to the microphone. He
got a standing ovation. King, as his longtime editor puts it, ``is
the rock star of writers.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, after telling his assistants, Marsha and Julie, how nice
they look, King lowers himself into a jungle-print recliner. He
appears healthily haggard, if that's possible _ still underweight
but generally fit. He's wearing faded jeans, a blue sweatshirt and,
on his feet, soccer socks (maroon-and-white stripes) and karate
shoes (soft white leather). The combination invokes something like
a woodsman who breaks at lunch for ballet. At one point in the
conversation, he raises his right pant leg to illustrate the story
of visiting his beloved Red Sox at spring training: ``Nomar comes
over, Bret Saberhagen comes over, Tim Wakefield comes over, and Tim
goes, 'Come on, get it up, get it up!' They wanted to see the leg,
and they all knew what the injury was.''
</P>
<P>
   The major scar, running the length of the calf, is surrounded by
any number of puckers and pockmarks. The leg is not pretty (maybe
it never was), but it's there. Attached to the rest of him. ``I
tell Tabby this is the bonus round,'' he says. ``And I believe it,
man. I have a lot of pain, but there's so much that doesn't hurt,
that I'm capable of. To be able to walk around, to still be able to
make love to my wife _ because that could have gone as well, it's
just a physiological thing. I'm grateful for everything that I
have, and I try to stay as grateful as I can, because it doesn't
matter how much money you've made or how rich you are or whether
your book's on the Internet or anything else. If you snap your
spine, you're a quad, and mine was chipped in five or six places,
almost down to the bare wires in a couple of places, so I'm very
lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   His desk is stacked with books to be autographed, the rest of
the office thick with Kingalia. It traces the arc of a long and
variegated and uniquely successful career: a ``Green Mile''
director's chair, a ``Pet Sematary'' rug, a chipper little sign
reading ``Redrum'' (if you have to ask ... ). In the bathroom,
there's a framed photo of a very large woman in a bathtub,
presumably a fan, with a thought bubble above her head: ``A Ton of
Fun?''
</P>
<P>
   King doesn't want for fans. In the summertime, tour buses idle
outside his house. On the Internet, King rumors swarm: his minivan
encounter was not an accident (false); he is suffering from
writer's block (false); someone else _ maybe his wife, also a
novelist _ actually writes some of his books.
</P>
<P>
   That rumor is also false, as far as anyone can tell. Still,
King's prolificacy borders on promiscuity. ``You almost expect when
he refers to 'the boys in the basement''' _ King's term for his
internal muses _ ``that maybe there are real people, doing at least
his typing,'' says Chuck Verrill, a literary agent who is also
King's personal editor.
</P>
<P>
   In the year since King went back to work, he has written the
second half of ``On Writing''; ``Riding the Bullet,'' the e-novella
whose success prompted a storm of the-future-is-here coverage; the
better part of a haunted-house screenplay for a six-hour ABC
miniseries; and a 900-page novel, ``Dreamcatcher,'' which opens
with a group of hunters coming upon a man who claims to have been
lost in the woods. (He finished another novel, ``From a Buick
Eight,'' just before his accident, but its release has been pushed
back, in part because it involves a nasty car crash.)
</P>
<P>
   As King says in ``On Writing,'' the first draft of a novel
shouldn't take more than three months. That, after all, is how it
works for him. He writes seven days a week, with the stereo turned
up loud (lots of Eminem, Kid Rock and Wilco these days), but he
often knocks off by lunchtime. Friends say that despite his ambling
disposition, King is fiendishly focused and gets more done per hour
_ whether writing or not _ than any other human they know. ``He's
curious about everything around him,'' says Kathi Kamen Goldmark,
who founded the Rock Bottom Remainders, the authors-only rock band
that includes Amy Tan, Barbara Kingsolver, Dave Barry and, on
rhythm guitar, King. ``You can't mention a book he hasn't read, you
can't mention an obscure musician who he can't sing a lyric of one
of his songs.'' King's brain is known as an extraordinarily fecund
place, constantly sprouting jokes, opinions and, above all, story
ideas.
</P>
<P>
   King alone fails to marvel at his output. That would be like a
sprinter gloating over his speed. What does delight King is his
forward momentum. He is not only the richest and most famous living
author but also among the most entrepreneurial. A few years ago, he
pulled a Dickens and published ``The Green Mile'' in six serial
installments. (At one point, all six volumes sat on The Times's
best-seller list.) Earlier this year, he released a short-story
collection exclusively as an audiobook. Even his contract with
Scribner is an anomaly, sacrificing gigantic advances for a bigger
piece of the back end. (He doesn't remember the specifics, he says:
``I think the deal is a million dollars a book and split the
royalties pretty much down the middle.'')
</P>
<P>
   And now he has given e-publishing a kick-start. ``Riding the
Bullet,'' released in March, was the world's first mass e-book,
with more than 500,000 downloads. The number of actual readers was
another question because the encryption caused countless computers
to crash. Still, thanks to King, online publishing seemed a real
possibility at last. (Never mind that the Web was already swimming
with downloadable music and movies; even though plain words are far
easier to upload, it was somehow taken for granted that Big
Publishing would be the last one in.)
</P>
<P>
   King was stunned by the success of ``Riding the Bullet.'' In
Scribner's office pool, he had predicted 16,000 downloads. Now he
wanted to try again. He made up a wish list: a downloadable story
without encryption ... released in serial form ... with
honor-system payments ... published by ... ME! Thus was ``The
Plant'' brought forth from its drawer and posted on
www.stephenking.com.
</P>
<P>
   The media worked hard to turn King's insurgent act into a
writers' revolution. It is probably not. Most writers, unlike King,
can't book themselves onthe ``Today'' show and ``Good Morning
America'' on the day of their launch. Most writers, like Carlos
Detweiller of ``The Plant,'' would make more of an impact by
sending a man-eating vine to the publishing house.
</P>
<P>
   For King, though, anything is possible and, in time, probable.
``I've continued to say yes to these things rather than kind of
pulling back and saying, Well, I'm going to write a book a year,
and that's what I'm going to do,'' he says. ``I dislike writers who
behave like old cart horses, dozing their way back to the stable.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he has written a how-to-write book laced with memoir. Some
critics, King says, ``think I can't write,'' and he knows how ``On
Writing'' will sit with them: ``Like the town whore trying to teach
women how to behave.'' He doesn't care. In the book, he even
invites his readers-writers to submit their work to him. He's
thinking about publishing the best offerings in the paperback
edition.
</P>
<P>
   Such approachability is a major upside of King's down-to-earth
reputation. Even in his native Maine, where celebrity is considered
a sort of disease, he is extraordinarily well regarded. It doesn't
hurt that he and his wife are world-class philanthropists, but
their just-folks nature is just as deeply appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   There is at least one more upside to his earthiness. ``He said
to me recently,'' Verrill says, ``that one of the advantages of not
being an acclaimed literary novelist is that you get to write about
stuff like ...,'' and here Verrill names a variety of bodily
functions that are regularly featured in King's work.
</P>
<P>
   The thing is, King wants to write from the gut and be an
acclaimed literary novelist. His complaints are by now familiar:
the literary establishment has long misunderstood popular fiction,
and just because he sells millions of books, serious readers won't
take him seriously. King has recently made headway. His novels have
come to be reviewed more respectfully; a Hawthorne-ish short story
he wrote, ``The Man in the Black Suit,'' won a 1996 O. Henry Award.
King was happy for the award, ``but it made me feel like an
impostor too,'' he says. ``Like someone made a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   In the main, King is right: serious readers generally haven't
read him. When they do, they are usually impressed. Cynthia Ozick,
for instance, had never given King much thought until they did a
reading together. ``It dawned on me as I listened to him that,
never mind all the best sellers and all the stereotypes _ this man
is a genuine, true-born writer, and that was a revelation,'' she
says. ``He is not Tom Clancy. He writes sentences, and he has a
literary focus, and his writing is filled with literary history.
It's not glib, it's not just contemporary chatter and it's not
stupid _ that's a bad way to say that something's smart, but that's
what I mean.''
</P>
<P>
   If King wanted to find the genesis of his bad reputation, he
might try looking in Hollywood. Except for ``Carrie'' and ``The
Shining,'' most early King films _ think ``Pet Sematary'' or
``Maximum Overdrive'' or ``Children of the Corn'' _ were dopey
gorefests. As King the author became a brand name, his movies gave
serious readers everywhere reason not to read him.
</P>
<P>
   But as his writing matured, so did the films. In 1986, Castle
Rock released ``Stand by Me,'' a sharp coming-of-age film based on
a King novella. Castle Rock has since made five more King films:
``Misery,'' ``Needful Things,'' ``The Shawshank Redemption,''
``Dolores Claiborne'' and ``The Green Mile.'' Each one was a few
thousand percent better than ``Children of the Corn.'' Too bad for
King that Castle Rock wasn't around in the 1970's. On the other
hand, he often hurts his own cause. Last year, King gave himself a
party at Tavern on the Green to celebrate the 25th anniversary of
the publication of ``Carrie.'' It was a fancy night, full of
literary VIPs, capped off by ... a highlight reel including the
goriest moments in King's film repertory.
</P>
<P>
   King never set out to be a horror writer and doesn't consider
himself one now. Horror, he implies, is a cheaper version of fear,
and it's the fear he's interested in: the frantic bleats in a
protagonist's mind more than the monster causing them. Two of his
recent works, ``Hearts in Atlantis'' and ``Bag of Bones,'' seemed
intent on minimizing the monstrous. They are driven by character,
not scenario, and are each rooted in sober realism. They are big,
serious-ish books; Scribner even classed up their dust jackets. But
by story's end the ghosts have arrived. A reader feels almost as if
the writer wanted to resist but couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   A reader feels more of King at work than of most writers. His
narrative voice, extraordinarily controlling and full of wry
intrusions, is always right in your ear, just outside the
campfire's light. But what most makes King unique is that he fully
exploits the writer's great natural advantage: he is the one making
up the story. If there is a single trait common to most of King's
writing, it is the reader's feeling that the author is playing God.
He can and will make really bad things happen to his beloved
creations. He will then watch them confront this evil, occasionally
offering aid. Finally, after they've been scared witless and have
proved themselves worthy, they are welcomed back into His warm
embrace, humble and grateful.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon,'' a novella that King published
last year, is a good example. In it, a 9-year-old girl gets lost in
the woods and ends up praying to her hero, the Red Sox pitcher Tom
Gordon, to help save her. It is a simple, beguiling, frightful
story. It begins in innocence, passes through the valley of the
shadow of death and ends with a benevolent wink of an author's
note: ``The woods themselves are real. If you should visit them on
your vacation, bring a compass, bring good maps ... and try to stay
on the path.''
</P>
<P>
   King says he might soon retire _ ``I think that my trick bag is
pretty well empty'' _ but instantly cautions that he probably won't
be able to. Those who know him well agree. He is preternaturally
driven, they say. But by what?
</P>
<P>
   Warren Silver, a Bangor friend and one of King's lawyers, says
that ``he's just a competitive guy who wants to be the best at what
he does.'' King has befriended John Grisham _ a few years ago, they
paid their own way to the National Book Awards, in sly protest of
being perennially unconsidered _ but he is bothered by the
inferiority of other best-selling authors. ``I never wanted to be
content with being, let's say, a Robin Cook or even a Michael
Crichton, who's a little bit better,'' he says. Of Danielle Steel
and Mary Higgins Clark, he complains, ``These people are selling
fairy tales.''
</P>
<P>
   If King's Internet orgy proves anything, it's that he likes
attention, a lot. What doesn't drive King is money. ``The truth is,
Stephen King is rich because he never set out to be rich,'' says
Susan Moldow of Scribner. ``If the money mattered to him, it
wouldn't be there.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is, many times over. Responding to an e-mail query about
his finances, he wrote: ``I don't know how much I make in a good
year. Gross could be $40 million, I'd think. What finally nets out
is maybe a third.'' For the movie of ``The Green Mile'': ``I think
I got $3 million plus a piece of the back end (up to a certain
point). The movie has earned, unlike most of them, so I think I'll
see some back end. I saw some from 'Stand by Me,' too. Mostly
(people won't believe it) the movies are just sort of fun. Like
investing in some weird margin stock like United Kurmfurling or
Yermal SpringTronix. I can't break my finances down further than
that, and you are impudent to ask (I say it without rancor, but you
know it's true). The money isn't very important. The idea is to
take care of your family and have enough left over to buy books and
go to the movies once a week. As a goal in life, 'getting rich'
strikes me as fairly ludicrous. The goal is to do what God made you
for and not hurt anyone if you can help it.''
</P>
<P>
   The not-hurting-anyone credo is important to King, and personal.
When he was 2, his father ``did a runout.'' King grew up with his
mother and older brother, on the move and poor. In ``On Writing,''
he recalls this childhood with typical candor (which can be very
moving) and typical scatalogical flair (which will probably keep
him, for now, on the wrong side of Art). His mother set high
standards, worked like a martyr, encouraged his writing; he loved
her. Shortly before his first book was published, she found out she
had uterine cancer. ``We could hear the pause after each rasping
breath she drew growing long and longer,'' he writes. ``Finally
there were no more breaths and it was all pause.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, King's own family is his greatest happiness. He speaks of
Tabitha with the ardor of a newlywed and the awe of a Lourdes
pilgrim. It was Tabitha who, about 15 years ago, gave him a choice:
clean up or move out. He was a mess; he says he can't really
remember writing ``Cujo'' at all. Tabitha took him before a group
of family and friends and emptied his trash can onto the rug. Out
poured, he writes, ``beer cans, cigarette butts, cocaine in gram
bottles and cocaine in plastic Baggies, coke spoons caked with snot
and blood, Valium, Xanax, bottles of Robitussin cough syrup and
NyQuil cold medicine, even bottles of mouthwash.'' He bought a
little time, as addicts will do, but soon started treatment and
stuck with it.
</P>
<P>
   King seems genuinely surprised that he has lived to see his
first grandchild. He and Tabitha have had an eventful marriage;
friends say it is one of the strongest they have seen. For Tabitha,
who has published seven novels, it cannot have been easy being the
No. 2 writer in this two-writer home. Worse yet, for years they
shared a publisher. Tabitha's last manuscript got caught in limbo
when Elaine Koster, Tabitha's editor and Stephen's paperback
publisher, left Penguin Putnam in 1997. Stephen wound up signing
his lucrative deal with Scribner. Tabitha's novel wound up dead.
</P>
<P>
   Now two of their three children are writers, Joe near Boston
(who writes under a pseudonym) and Owen in New York (who doesn't).
``I read Joe's stuff, and I kind of relate to it because it's like
plot-driven, it's high conflict,'' King says. ``Owen is more like
this sort of _ I don't want to dis him but _ Bret Easton Ellis. I
don't know, more like flavor-of-the-month, New York
relationships.'' The Kings' daughter, Naomi, is a Universalist
minister. ``I tell her, and I think it's true, that Unitarianism is
God for people who don't believe in God, and she just laughs.''
Naomi, who once owned a restaurant in Portland, Maine, now lives in
Chicago. ``She met a woman out there, and she's going to marry this
woman or have a commitment thing or something like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, the whole family was up at the lake, including
Joe's wife and infant son. It was the first time in six months they
had all been together. On June 19, a Saturday, Owen was returning
to New York, so his father dropped him at the airport, drove home,
took a nap, then headed out for his daily constitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Owen had just walked into his apartment when he got a phone call
from Tabitha: his father had been in an accident. He flew back.
King had been airlifted to the Central Maine Medical Center in
Lewiston. Tabitha, Joe and Naomi arrived, and later, Owen. ``What
they did to me there was apparently set something in my leg,'' King
recalls, ``and there's this horrible scream _ it came out to where
they were signing papers. Joe turned pale at that. The nurse gave
them a form, a do-not-resuscitate kind of thing. Tabby said Joe
realized it was serious and he just left, went out for a while. He
had his Red Sox cap. He put the cap over his face until he was in
control.''
</P>
<P>
   King, leaning forward in his recliner, takes a pause, and a
breath. ``Later, they all gathered around.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he's fully choked up. He whispers, in a model of Maine
understatement, ``They're good people.''
</P>
<P>
   King's near-death, as the facts came forth, unspooled like a
scene from his novels, full as they are of automotive menace and
rural blunderings. The driver who hit him, 42-year-old Bryan Smith
of Fryeburg, is known locally as a bit of a simpleton. King recalls
a sheriff's investigator visiting him in the hospital and saying,
``That Pepsi can has more IQ than Bryan Smith.''
</P>
<P>
   When Smith hit King, his minivan was well onto the right
shoulder. He had been distracted by his Rottweiller's trying to get
into a food cooler. Smith came back and sat with King to wait for
the ambulance. A woman and three children soon joined them.
According to her, Smith apologized and told King he had never even
gotten a parking ticket before, to which King replied, ``Well, I've
never been hit by a car before.''
</P>
<P>
   The local weekly, The Bridgton News, later reported that Smith
actually had a long history of driving violations. He had been
convicted for operating under the influence, driving to endanger
and failure to stop for a police officer. Once, after running
several cars off the road, he pulled into his driveway and promptly
passed out on his lawn, in view of the police officer who had been
chasing him. In 1998, his license was suspended three times but
each time was restored.
</P>
<P>
   At it turned out, Smith has a brother, Everett, on the Fryeburg
police force. The sheriff's deputy who responded to the King
accident, Matt Baker, used to serve on the Fryeburg force with
Everett Smith. And the only eyewitness Baker took a statement from
on the scene was his own uncle, Chip Baker. ``It's not nepotism,
it's ineptness, that's what I would credit those police departments
with,'' says Lisa Williams Ackley, who covered the story for The
News.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings were enraged when it was announced that only
misdemeanor charges would be pressed against Smith. The accident,
they felt, should be treated as a seriously criminal act. ``They
should have impounded the vehicle, and they should have tested him
for drugs and alcohol at the scene, and they didn't do it,'' says
Warren Silver, the Kings' lawyer in Bangor.
</P>
<P>
   Silver had gone to western Maine shortly after the accident to
investigate it and meet with Smith. He came home with an idea that
he prayed Smith hadn't had: the 1985 blue Dodge Caravan, fresh with
King's dents, might fetch a frighteningly high price on eBay. The
next day, Silver called Smith, offered him $1,500 for the van and
had it shipped back to Bangor.
</P>
<P>
   King wants to use the van for a charity event: three
sledgehammer swings for $5. ``But my wife is kind of like, 'Why
don't we just get past this whole thing,''' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He smiles at his own grisly perseverance. He takes off his
glasses, rubs his eyes, puts the glasses back on. They are the same
lenses he was wearing that day; only the frames had to be replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Why is he still wearing them?
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess that I wanted to say that things that we ordinarily
would see as quite fragile aren't necessarily that fragile,'' he
says. ``It's true of the glasses, and it's true of me. I got bent,
I got busted around a lot, but I'm still here.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Jimmy Iovine, co-chairman of Interscope Geffen A&AMP;M, slips the
videocassette in the player and plunks down in a comfy chair. He's
screening an early episode of ``Farmclub.com,'' a weekly music show
he's producing on the USA network. ``Farmclub'' runs right after
the World Wrestling Federation's ``Raw Is War,'' a
let-them-eat-beefcake extravaganza that is cable TV's highest-rated
show. The conjunction was no accident. Iovine avidly pursued it
because he wanted to capture the young males who watch wrestling.
The star of this episode is unquestionably Fred Durst, front man
for Limp Bizkit, a group that minted rap-metal, the aggressive,
hypermacho and extremely lucrative new pop-music genre that mixes
rap with rock. ``Watch this,'' Iovine says. ``This is what
'Farmclub' is all about.'' Just then, on the tape, Durst, enraged
that the show has just run the wrong version of a Limp Bizkit
video, threatens to hide a TV camera somewhere on the person of a
staff member.
</P>
<P>
   This attitude is quite possibly the future of white male youth
culture _ camera-ready anger, staged to resemble wrestling. Iovine
is an entrepreneur of rage. He linked arms with the rap label Death
Row in the early '90s and made the gangsta rappers Snoop Dogg and
Dr. Dre household names. He signed Nine Inch Nails, whose
transgressive lyrics are the target of Washington conservatives,
and he, along with Dr. Dre, brought the world Eminem, the
anti-role-model white rapper who has recently been embroiled in a
public dust-up over virulent antigay lyrics. Iovine sees a great
future ahead for artists who take hip-hop in new directions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you understand the impact on young white America that
hip-hop is having?'' he asks. To illustrate, he searches his Los
Angeles office for the FBI tally of crime statistics he keeps close
at hand. ``Crime has gone down remarkably. And rap music has been
the biggest it's ever been. So do guys like Tupac and DMX deserve
the Nobel Peace Prize? I don't know. What do you think?'' He's
joking, but only just.
</P>
<P>
   It's no wonder that Iovine frequently ponders the connections
between outrageous music and outrageous behavior, if only because
his artists and others like them often have a foot on both sides of
the line. Take last year's Woodstock, where rap-metal had its messy
coming out. The artists Rage Against the Machine, Korn, the Insane
Clown Posse and Everlast all played there, all of them fusing heavy
guitar sounds to boastful, profane hip-hop attitude. Promoters were
hoping for a nice millennial assortment of good vibes, while
audiences and artists clearly wanted to carve out a nastier slice
of history. It was Durst who put his finger on the scale. Before
the sea of Woodstock humanity, he announced: ``They want us to ask
you to mellow out. They said too many people are getting hurt.
Don't let nobody get hurt, but I don't think you should mellow
out.'' And then the seams split open. Limp Bizkit played their
testosterone-drenched ``Break Stuff,'' and the mood changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Break Stuff'' rants against ``the he says-she says'' and
builds to a vow to ``break your ... face tonight.'' That's the
quintessential rap-rock moment, when everyday pressures and the old
he says-she says ignites in an updraft of rage. At Woodstock one
woman was reportedly raped as Limp Bizkit played, and a gang rape
allegedly occurred while the band Korn performed. Crisis counselors
say there were even more attacks, and at party's end, fires broke
out all over the grounds as rock fans trashed vehicles, automatic
teller machines and vendor stalls. There were few reports of
anybody mellowing out.
</P>
<P>
   Iovine thinks those who link Limp Bizkit to the Woodstock melee
miss the point. Earlier that day, he informs me, a 6-year-old
Michigan youth shot and killed another child. Iovine's artists have
been blamed before when fans have engaged in criminal behavior, so
he is quick to say now that music is not responsible for the
Michigan killing. While he laments what happened at Woodstock, he
contends that pushing audiences to respond is what great art does.
</P>
<P>
   I grew up in Detroit _ rap-metal's ground zero, home to Kid
Rock, Eminem and the Insane Clown Posse _ and I knew people who
needed Kid Rock in their lives, an artist raising the self-esteem
of doormats everywhere. The last time I saw my best friend from
high school, he was standing on the hood of his car, smashing in
the windows with his dad's golf clubs. I bet today he and his
children are Kid Rock fans. Boasting that he comes ``straight out
of the trailer,'' Rock hurls the epithet of ``white trash'' back at
the world, much in the same way gangsta groups like NWA did with
Compton and ``nigga.'' At its best, the current fusion of rap and
metal lets people who feel unblessed by the economy express some
righteous anger. But more often, rap-metal aims a lot lower.
</P>
<P>
   The new rap-metal frequently seems calculated _ to offend, to
rake in a quick, lewd buck. The influence of pornography on this
culture is worth noting. The band Korn, for example, garnered early
credibility among fans by posting interviews with porn stars on its
Web site. The Insane Clown Posse goes on cable-access porn shows.
Fred Durst appeared in ``Backstage Sluts 2.'' Porn gives bands cool
points and boosts their fan base.
</P>
<P>
   There is something creepy about the ongoing compulsion to wed
rap and metal and from there to fuse it with wrestling and porn and
seemingly every other precinct in popular culture. And it hasn't
peaked yet. Recently, Eminem's new album broke records for
first-week sales.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the music itself can sometimes be profound. Eminem, in
his brilliant ``Guilty Conscience,'' ponders robbing a liquor
store, taking advantage of a 15-year-old and killing a cheating
wife. He gleefully forces you to consider whatever differences
exist between thoughts and deeds while making you extremely
uncomfortable to discover that maybe the two aren't far enough
apart. (And judging from recent reports of his offstage behavior,
words and deeds might not be so distant for Eminem, either.) It is
about the meaninglessness of good intentions and maybe even the
death of them.
</P>
<P>
   Call them knuckleheads or young white guys; Spin magazine
lambasted them with the term ``mooks,'' a label that has since been
picked up as a badge of honor. And suddenly there are enough
members of the mook club to fill up many Woodstocks. We've all seen
them at the mall: kids who ostentatiously say ``whuzzup'' to one
another; the frat brothers who wear stop-and-frisk fashions; the
countless fans who recognize the porn star on the cover of
Blink-182's last album.
</P>
<P>
   White music fans have long been curious about black culture, but
the wholesale interest in miming the black underclass is new. As
far back as ``On the Road,'' Jack Kerouac fantasized raptly, ``At
lilac evening I walked with every muscle aching ... wishing I were
a Negro, feeling that the best the white world offered was not
enough ecstasy for me, not enough life, joy, kicks, darkness,
music, not enough night.''
</P>
<P>
   James Brown fascinated white kids in the '60s with a peephole
glimpse of a world of grace and grit. But the black rapper DMX, and
before him Tupac Shakur and Notorious B.I.G., now offers a
wide-screen movie of ghetto life, relishing the details, relating
the intricacy of topics like drug dealing, brawling, pimping and
black-on-black crime. Rap makes these things seem sexy, and it
makes life on the streets seem as thrilling as a Playstation game.
</P>
<P>
   Today black youth culture is no secret, nor is it about joy and
kicks. Today a thousand arena spotlights shine on such race
fantasies, and they are billboarded and exploited by media outlets
and entertainment conglomerates. The fantasy lands of rap,
wrestling and porn have aligned to shape a real audience, one that
looks awfully hardened. Woodstockers have been called spoiled
brats, pacified suburbanites, testosterone junkies with no real
reason to be angry. Their crime, to their critics, is one of
insincerity. It's a powerful argument. But once the windows start
breaking, rage isn't really earned or counterfeit. It just is. And
at that point, rage is no longer the problem of a group of problem
kids. At that moment, it's everybody's problem.
</P>
<P>
   The literature of mookography is full of family turmoil, of
parents and children turning on one another. Take the weekly saga
(run between matches) involving the WWF overlord McMahon and his
kids, who wrestle, turn very, very bad, ``marry'' wrestlers Dad
doesn't approve of, get ``gang raped'' and so on. Even professional
wrestling is about family excess.
</P>
<P>
   Making parents mad and recounting family tensions have always
been a part of rock 'n' roll since Daddy took the T-Bird away, but
today's full-out family trauma is different, and part of what makes
rap-metal stand out in comparison with the other top-ranking pop
music, teen bubble gum. Eminem raps about discovering that his
mother was a drug addict. In real life, she's suing him for $10
million for defamation of character. Kid Rock once told an
interviewer that he found career motivation in being kicked out of
his parents' house for refusing to go to family therapy. The band
Korn once put out a news release stating that some of its members
were child-abuse survivors. Fans know the lyrics and the back
stories and are drawn in because in these stories, they see
something of themselves.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Fred Durst, the man who has taken lumps for
``triggering'' Woodstock, hedges his bets, sounding simultaneously
apologetic and defiant. ``I literally don't do anything to hurt
anyone,'' Durst says. ``I believe in karma more than you
understand. And I believe in God. And when I'm at Woodstock and a
riot breaks out _ I didn't know. Everybody's jumping and I can't
see and all of a sudden there's these riots and someone got raped.
Dude, if I'd known that, I would have stopped it.''
</P>
<P>
   He calls ``Break Stuff,'' the song he played when the mood
palpably changed at Woodstock, ``a mistake,'' which he won't repeat
on the next Bizkit album. But he's not ready to shoulder all the
blame: ``They burned the place down, but it's not my fault.''
</P>
<P>
   Durst, 29, grew up in Gastonia, N.C., a small town where one of
his best friends was a black kid whose father, a D.J., played Fred
rap records that he had bought in New York. ``All of a sudden I was
obsessed with this beat and this way of storytelling,'' Durst
explains. ``And I thought, Man, I tell you what, this has got to be
the best thing that's ever happened in my life.'' He became a
figure common everywhere today: the white kid with the boom box,
the stylized walk, the pants flashing boxers. Before this kid was
an archetype, though, he was more likely to be called weird, or
worse. In a place like Gastonia, and then Jacksonville, Fla., where
his family moved, Durst was called ``nigger lover.''
</P>
<P>
   He joined a break-dance crew _ four black kids and him _ and won
the seventh-grade talent show. But after that, things were
different at school. Suddenly all the jocks wanted to beat him up,
he says, ``and anybody that was, like, 'normal' said, 'Hey this
guy's a freak.'''
</P>
<P>
   In the years after school, Durst fathered a child, spent a year
in the Navy, worked as a tattoo artist and then formed a band. The
mid-90's was a savvy moment to create a new sound. Jordan Schur,
who founded Limp Bizkit's label, Flip, explains: ``Rock had kind of
fizzled, and a lot of these young kids in the suburbs, the
skatekids, they wanted a rock-star element. They were getting more
of that from rap. But a lot of those kids still liked the big riffs
and the big sound of rock. It was natural to go toward a fusion of
the two.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, in the Los Angeles rehearsal studio, standing among
mannequins of monsters, the members of Limp Bizkit don't look like
teen-age icons. Durst sits on a couch, repairing a skateboard as
the rest of the group sets up. The band plays four songs that this
fall, on their next album, ``Chocolate Starfish and Hotdog Flavored
Water,'' will continue posing the argument that hip-hop is white
culture too.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is happy with where the music is going. The
African-American rapper Mos Def pointedly attacks Limp Bizkit
(along with Elvis and Kenny G) on his recent album ``Black on Both
Sides,'' recasting a familiar charge that hip-hop and rock 'n' roll
are both black music that whites have appropriated. He is in some
ways right.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Limp Bizkit continues to pursue total world
domination. Durst has become a senior vice president at Interscope
Records; as a high-ranking talent scout, he envisions huge
battles-of-the-bands traveling across the country, with the best
getting signed to his label. And Durst says he has raised
``hundreds of thousands of dollars'' for a cable channel featuring
round-the-clock extreme sports and music programming.
</P>
<P>
   It's not even his most ambitious project. He hopes to erase the
blot of Woodstock with a huge festival of hard-core hip-hop and
rap-metal, the edgiest stuff he can get. He would like to line up
Korn, the Ruff Ryders, Wu-Tang Clan, Dr. Dre and Eminem and more.
The show will be free, and he's toying with the idea of making the
food and drinks free, too, a rebuke to Woodstock's $12 pizzas. And
he vows to make it violence-free.
</P>
<P>
   The responsibility weighs heavily on Durst's sloping shoulders.
``Pretty much everybody says our generation has this problem,'' he
says. ``We were the problem at Woodstock. But you know what? I'll
put together the heaviest rock and hip-hop bands, and it will be
the most peaceful, fun, killer event you'll ever see.'' It's a long
way from happening, though. Should it work, a generation will have
a whole new set of defining symbols. And one of them will be
wearing a red baseball cap backward.

<P>
   Follow the crack of the Liberty Bell as far as the eye can see
and there he is, alone on a park bench in the middle of
Philadelphia, as obscure as he wants to be. ``Getting a little
vitamin D,'' he says when I reach him, and lifts his face to the
first sun either of us has seen after 15 hours on a bus, riding the
interstate through the night and into this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   He's as obscure as he wants to be _ except for all those tour
buses parked on the other side of the square, his in particular,
with the tops of two '49 Buick Roadmasters erupting through the
roof and a license plate that reads POCAHONTAS. For a while we talk
about the allure of the road (``I like it,'' he says, ``I mean, I
miss my family, but. ...'' and then shrugs, a concession not an
apology), the music he listens to (``I don't play that much pop
these days, mostly Beethoven, Wagner''), about his recent CD,
``Silver and Gold'' (his first studio recording in four years). We
talk about the eight-disc archival box set he's preparing for
release this fall, covering his ascent from obscurity in the
mid-'60s to 1972, when he had Billboard's No. 1 album of the year;
and the two tours he's staging, one on his own and one with three
old friends, who, 30 years ago, were the biggest band in America.
</P>
<P>
   Time has finally cornered him long enough to monumentalize him,
it seems; but we'll see. Once he wrote songs with titles like
``Journey Through the Past'' _ barely conscious efforts to conquer
the present and cheat the future _ and he has always given a very
good impression of a man running from his place in musical history
as if it were a tomb. When we make our way to the hotel where the
bus is parked, a fan works up the nerve to ask for an autograph,
but Neil Young says, ``No, I don't do that,'' and walks right on
by, breaking his stride not even a little.
</P>
<P>
   Until I actually step on board, everyone assures me the
Pocahontas is a sanctuary never breached. Back beyond the special
well designed for Ben, his 21-year-old son with cerebral palsy who
watches the highway from his wheelchair, Young sprawls on his huge
bed. ``I was playing in a club in Fort William,'' he begins, ``and
we're doing a song called 'Farmer John,' and toward the end of it
we started jamming. ...''
</P>
<P>
   This is way back. This is back in the autumn of 1964 with a band
called the Squires, in Canada, where Young was reared in the little
town of Omemee with its ``blue, blue windows behind the stars'' and
where at the age of 3 he slipped into a nearby lake and nearly
drowned. This is back before his early days as part of a Motown
band with Rick James, back before his long exodus to L.A. in a
hearse looking for Stephen Stills, whom he would find only at the
last minute in a Sunset Strip traffic jam, before they formed
Buffalo Springfield. This is before ``After the Gold Rush'' and
``Harvest'' put him on the map in the early 1970s, and before the
subsequent 28 albums that have kept him on and off the map ever
since.
</P>
<P>
   This is way back, before a crumbling spinal disc in 1971 and
before the epilepsy, which still haunts him onstage. This is before
the afternoon he fired his lead guitarist for an uncontrolled
heroin problem that took the guitarist's life that very night, and
before the subsequent music that Young recorded in a
tequila-flooded exorcism of grief and guilt. This is before the
Thermidor of late-'70s punk, when one rock icon after another fell
before its guillotine of cultural relevancy, and Young was the one
'60s artist not only spared by the revolution but also embraced as
a kindred spirit.
</P>
<P>
   This is back before the nitwitted lawsuit filed against him in
the '80s by the head of his record label, David Geffen, for not
making true ``Neil Young'' records, before the '90s, when Kurt
Cobain quoted him in his suicide note, before he became the only
artist in the year 2000 that one could possibly imagine sharing a
concert bill with, say, Merle Haggard on the one hand and Nine Inch
Nails on the other. This is back before he became rock's Man That
Time Forgot, making music at once primordial and futuristic,
homegrown and surreal, traditional and insurrectionist, beguiling
and cataclysmic _ before he became, with his distinctive voice and
racked Mojave-storm guitar, a one-man vortex for folk, country,
blues, psychedelia, grunge, electronica, symphonic sweep, metallic
squall.
</P>
<P>
   Way back, playing ``Farmer John'' when he wasn't yet 20, Young
remembers, the music got really wild. ``I had never played like
that before. We were just slamming it. We played the song without
the song, we played what the song was about,'' and in that moment
his musical identity was born. If rock has always been driven by
two impulses, the utopian and the anarchic, many of its most
enduring figures have straddled the two: Chuck Berry, Elvis
Presley, John Lennon, Bob Dylan, Jimi Hendrix, Neil Young. It's the
utopian Neil whose records people buy in droves. But with songs
like 1995's sonic Imax ``I'm the Ocean,'' or the brilliant
``Powderfinger,'' about a young frontier boy killed in an explosion
of survivalist pride and madness (``Then I saw black, and my face
splashed in the sky''), it's the anarchic Neil who howls into the
zeitgeist and alters it.
</P>
<P>
   He likes it when the zeitgeist howls back. With Crazy Horse, a
band just cacophonous and primal enough to capture ``Farmer John''
on record with Young a quarter-century after Fort William, he makes
a point of recording around a full moon, when ``a lot of mechanical
things go wrong, technical difficulties, things that usually work
don't work.'' And in the congenitally enlightened company of
Crosby, Stills and Nash, unabashed utopians who have always sounded
a little funny singing ``Down by the river I shot my baby,'' Neil
Young is Baader-Meinhof: when he performs ``Rockin' in the Free
World'' in Philadelphia, it seems he simply won't let go of the
song, until it becomes clear the song won't let go of him.
</P>
<P>
   From out of the conflict between utopia and anarchy has emerged
moral ambiguity and complexity. In 1970, when he wrote ``Ohio''
following the murder of four students by National Guardsmen at Kent
State University, his rage was more instinctive than political:
``My lyrics get personal about it,'' he acknowledges. ``I'm
singing: 'What if you knew her and saw her dead on the ground? How
could you run when you know?''' But that anger was also answered a
few years later by ``Campaigner,'' when alone among major spokesmen
for the counterculture he expressed compassion for a disgraced
president who lost everything (``Even Richard Nixon has got
soul''); and conspicuously over the years he has refused to adopt
any ideological line. At one time or another he has supported
Ronald Reagan and Jesse Jackson. His ideal ticket in 2000 is
Gore-McCain.
</P>
<P>
   The utopia of his early music succumbed to anarchy most
spectacularly during an unhinged 1973 tour that was his rude answer
to superstardom. The shows would routinely climax with Young
screaming, ``Wake up!'' at his audiences as the '60s crashed down
around him in a rain of dead junkies; now, at the back of the
Pocahontas, all he can manage to say of the period is, ``I'm glad I
made it through it,'' before a pall settles over the interview.
Whenever Young ``tried to get away from success,'' his manager,
Elliot Roberts, remarks of the period, ``it just turned into a
bigger success,'' which wasn't just confusing but mortifying, since
success wasn't particularly subtle about its human toll. Young went
on to chronicle the deaths of the people around him in a series of
anti-drug songs _ ``The Needle and the Damage Done,'' ``Tired
Eyes,'' ``Tonight's the Night'' _ that were all the more
authoritative for the way they were reportorial rather than
judgmental, never denying for a moment the attraction of excess and
darkness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just didn't like people telling me what to do,'' he explains
almost offhandedly. ``I didn't like people telling me if I made
more records like 'Harvest,' I would be successful. That's when I
came up with the concept of destroying what I created in order to
move on. I wanted to do what I called audio verite.''
</P>
<P>
   He pauses and looks out the window. ``At a certain point,
trained, accomplished musicians'' _ which is to say, not him _
``hit the wall. They don't go there very often, they don't have the
tools to go through the wall, because it's the end of notes. It's
the other side, where there's only tone, sound, ambience,
landscape, earthquakes, pictures, fireworks, the sky opening,
buildings falling, subways collapsing. ... I don't know too many
musicians who try to go through the wall.'' He stops for a moment.
``I love to go through the wall,'' as if you ever doubted it for a
moment.
</P>
<P>
   In the collective memory of his longtime audience, he may
forever be the brooding figure reclining alone in the shadowy
gatefold of ``After the Gold Rush.'' But in fact virtually everyone
who has ever known him attests to his humor _ sometimes zany,
sometimes wry, mischievous. Over six feet tall, he has an easy yet
determined stride that encompasses all his contradictions: zen yet
a little obsessive, open yet a little unapproachable, lurching
toward his ambitions yet held back by his wariness of having to
explain himself.
</P>
<P>
   During a disgruntled taping with Crosby, Stills and Nash of
``Storytellers,'' the VH-1 series in which songwriters relate the
stories behind their songs, he paces the small stage like a caged
animal and cracks, ``I thought the song was supposed to tell the
story.'' And when I bump into him in a hotel lobby one afternoon
after failing to pin him down for an interview, and he assures me,
``I'm really not avoiding you, I'm just waiting until I feel more
alert,'' personally I feel quite certain he's avoiding me. But I'm
in the curious position of respecting him all the more for it.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, Elliot Roberts was just a 22-year-old from the Bronx
managing Buffalo Springfield when Young abruptly stopped a
rehearsal one afternoon to demand Roberts be fired on the spot. ``I
was shocked,'' Roberts recalls. ``It blew my mind.'' For days he
wandered L.A. stunned, trying to figure out what hit him, only for
Young to appear suddenly one night at 2 a.m. to explain he was
leaving the band and wanted Roberts to manage him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, he had plotted it all out,'' Roberts now laughs. ``I
thought, Wow, cool _ this guy is as devious as I am.'' To those who
have watched him over the years, Young comes off as a mastermind of
unpredictability. But sometimes he can appear less integrated and
more genuinely divided against himself than people think. The
utopian-anarchic ``schizophrenia'' (Young's word) of his music
reveals both a Spontaneous Neil and a Control-Freak Neil, each real
and each peering over the other's shoulder, each trying to correct
the other's misjudgments, each averting the other from perceived
disaster.
</P>
<P>
   There is no better example of this than the recent misadventures
of Young's authorized biographer. After signing a contract with
both Young and Random House, Jimmy McDonough, a journalist, spent
eight years writing, researching and interviewing more than 300
people, all with Young's cooperation. But when McDonough delivered
a manuscript at the end of 1998, Young suddenly _ according to the
publisher _ ``sabotaged'' the book by withholding his approval of
it, and Random House dropped the biography. In the Young camp,
nobody will comment for the record about why he killed the project.
But the unofficially stated reason _ that McDonough submitted the
book to Random House before submitting it to Young and thereby
breached the contract, betraying Young's trust _ sounds flimsy.
McDonough is now suing him for $1.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   The melodrama of Neil Young's early life reached critical mass
in November 1978 with the birth of his second son _ by his wife,
Pegi _ and the subsequent realization that, like Young's first son,
Zeke, by the actress Carrie Snodgrass, Ben had cerebral palsy.
Zeke's case is mild (he is 27 and works as a sound engineer on a
number of his father's projects), but Ben is a quadriplegic. Young
would later recount walking out of the hospital and ``looking at
the sky, looking for a sign, wondering: What did I do? There must
be something wrong with me.''
</P>
<P>
   But cerebral palsy is a twist of fate, not of genetics _ Young's
daughter, Amber, doesn't have the disease. If all this weren't
overwhelming enough, not long after Ben's birth, Pegi was found to
have a brain tumor, from which, at the time, she had only a 50-50
chance of recovering. So in the early '80s, the man whose obsession
with his music was supposedly all-consuming set the music aside to
devote himself to his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of thoughts in my mind at that time,'' he
says now, ``that I wasn't ready to share with the world,'' and the
matter of Ben's health was so personal that in 1982, when Young
released a strange album called ``Trans'' with electronically
distorted vocals, few knew it grew out of an effort to communicate
with his speechless son by computer. During the rest of the decade,
Young's music seemed at loose ends on a series of recordings that
in hindsight appear redeemed as stylistic explorations of an
artistic identity in turmoil _ out of which ultimately emerged one
of his best albums, ``Freedom,'' in 1989. He then spent the '90s
making one important record after another.
</P>
<P>
   One afternoon in Philadelphia, when we had once again scheduled
an interview and he had once again vanished, I found out he had
gone to a school for children with cerebral palsy. Along with Pegi,
Young is a major supporter of such a school in California, and
during tours he often arranges for young people with the disease to
see the shows. I was annoyed that I hadn't been with him to get the
scene at the school for the story; in true Neil Young fashion, it
even happened during a full moon, when an elevator at the school
suddenly malfunctioned and the singer hovered for several
precarious minutes between floors. But then it occurred to me that
99 out of 100 rock stars would have jumped at the chance to drag me
along and put their humanitarianism on display, and that like so
much else with Young, maybe this was private, too.
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes, you know, he just wings it. Sometimes it's not a
matter of a personal code (which he obviously has), or a
Machiavellian ploy (of which he's clearly capable); it's a matter
of impulse. Standing in the middle of a shopping-center parking lot
on the highway to Cleveland, waiting for the bus to refuel, Young
is talking about spending some time with his family after the tour
on the volcanic Big Island of Hawaii, when a young woman pulls up
in a pickup truck. She leans over and rolls down the window on the
passenger side, and on her face is the disbelief of her own eyes.
``Are you who I think you are?'' she asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who do you think I am?'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you Neil Young?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' he finally answers.
</P>
<P>
   Suspended between astonishment and opportunity, she sputters,
``Would you sign your name for me?''
</P>
<P>
   She scrambles to find something for him to write on. I'm
remembering the autograph hound outside the hotel in Philadelphia.
Now this woman in a pickup truck on her way to get her kid from
school maybe, or coming home from a job waiting on tables, in the
middle of a Wal-Mart parking lot that everybody knows is nowhere,
happens to peer through her windshield to see, standing over on a
small square of grass waiting for his dog to relieve himself, the
full-moon genius of rock 'n' roll. And then she makes two
decisions: the first, to have faith in what her eyes tell her; and
the second, to confront it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure,'' he says. He steps up to the truck, leans in and
scrawls his name on whatever she has offered him, a gut reaction to
the purity of her wonder; and then as she drives away, with a story
she'll tell for the next 50 years, he goes back to contemplating
volcanoes and the sea, and the tropical winds where utopia and
anarchy converge.
</P>
<P>
   As he now seems eternally young, in earlier days Young was old
before his time. ``I'm getting old,'' he sang in his most famous
song, ``Heart of Gold,'' written when he was 24. In Phoenix, after
another show, as the others in the band celebrate with friends
backstage, Young sits alone in a dark, hushed room with a few
candles burning low nearby, nursing his back with an ice pack; he
seems every one of his 54 years. Earlier onstage he lost himself in
a deranged ``Down by the River'' as he had with ``Rockin' in the
Free World'' in Philadelphia, the Man That Time Forgot shredding
time to ribbons. But back here in the dark he's the Man That Time
Remembers, and it's remembering him in his lower back.
</P>
<P>
   So for a while we make small talk that he probably finds more
awkward than his graciousness allows him to admit. And then I
finally leave, after he has just ``slammed '' one more time through
the wall of age, the wall of fear, the wall of passion, to the end
of the night. As if you ever doubted it for a moment, he loves to
go through the wall, beyond the end of notes.

LOOKISM: UGLIES OF THE WORLD UNITE! 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Aug. 27)  
(Eds: Items in bold should be set in italics.) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Communism is all but dead, and socialism is passe. Capitalism is
doing fine, but as an attack word it has been replaced by  &UR; market
economy &LR; . Has the suffix - &UR; ism &LR;  lost its sting?
</P>
<P>
   In politics,  &UR; ism &LR; -itis is receding, but in reference to forms
of discrimination, the beatism goes on. On the analogy of  &UR; racism &LR; ,
a term that began as  &UR; racialism &LR;  in 1907 but dropped the second
syllable in 1935, we have  &UR; sexism &LR;  (1968) and  &UR; ageism &LR;  (1969). And
now a relatively new entry:
</P>
<P>
   ``We face a world,'' says Nancy Etcoff, a psychologist at
Massachusetts General Hospital, ``where  &UR; lookism &LR;  is one of the
most pervasive but denied prejudices.'' She is author of ``Survival
of the Prettiest''; though her title is Darwinian, her message
bewails the evolution of the power of beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Oxford's 1999 ``20th Century Words,'' by John Ayto, defines
 &UR; lookism &LR;  as ``prejudice or discrimination on the grounds of
appearance (i.e., uglies are done down and the beautiful people get
all the breaks).'' The lexicographer's earliest citation was in The
Washington Post Magazine in 1978, which reported that fat people
coined a defensive word: `` &UR; lookism &LR;  _ discrimination based on
looks.''
</P>
<P>
   When the GOP candidate George W. Bush flashed a half-smile that
struck some as a smirk, he was widely derided for this facial
expression. ``Bush isn't the only presidential candidate to suffer
from this elaborately sanctioned  &UR; lookism &LR; ,'' wrote Julia Keller in
The Chicago Tribune. ``Former Republican hopeful Steve Forbes
endured numerous remarks about his blinkless stare ... while Al
Gore has been called `wooden' so often that he probably measures
himself by the board foot.''
</P>
<P>
   The word's usage is trans-Atlantic. `` &UR; Lookism &LR;  is a crime,'' a
writer in London's Daily Telegraph observed in 1991, ``on the same
level as racism, sexism, ageism, heterosexism, classism, etc.'' In
Barre, Maine, last year, a workshop was held on the topic ``Today's
Pressures: Drugs, Alcohol, Sex and  &UR; Lookism &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   A Reuters reviewer of the new Oxford Compact English Dictionary
had a bright lead: ``So there you are, all decked out in chuddies,
carpenters and a shrug with a brand-new buzz cut, and for some
reason your best friend refuses to talk to you. It is probably a
serious case of  &UR; lookism &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   OK:  &UR; Chuddies &LR;  are underpants,  &UR; carpenters &LR;  are pants with loops
for tools, a  &UR; shrug &LR;  is a tight-fitting cardigan and a  &UR; buzz cut &LR; 
is a close crewcut. I'll also pass along the OCED's  &UR; screenager &LR; ,
``Internet- or computer-addicted teenager.''
</P>
<P>
   The extension of  &UR; lookism &LR;  is already in circulation: If you
call out to someone you consider in any way attractive, ``Hey,
good-lookin','' you are a  &UR; lookist &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   GENTILE-AMERICAN PERSON'S GUIDE
</P>
<P>
   ``What disturbs me,'' writes Jack Tucker from somewhere in
cyberspace, ``is the politically correct way that Senator Joseph
Lieberman has to be referred to on television: `a Jewish person.'
The media don't want to say he is a `Jew' because the word sounds
so harsh.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only is Tucker correct in construing  &UR; media &LR;  as plural, he
is also sensitive to the oversensitivity of some newscasters. He
was not the only one to notice the lengthy terminology: In a
related vein, a call came from Gerald Rafshoon, the documentary
producer who was a Carter White House aide, to ask, ``How come I
never hear `Episcopalian-American'?''
</P>
<P>
   The use of the word  &UR; Jew &LR;  is not a problem in print journalism;
both The New York Times and The Washington Post headlined ``First
Jew on Major U.S. Ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason is to save space, a consideration of all headline
writers; another is that speaking _ even in quick news flashes _
differs from writing. Speaking is more personal. That's why many in
broadcast and cable news preferred  &UR; first Jewish person &LR;  or  &UR; first
Jewish-American &LR;  or even  &UR; first person of the Hebrew faith &LR;  to be
so named. They had the vague feeling that the monosyllabic word
might be taken as offensive _ as it is when delivered with a curled
lip _ and went out of their way not to offend.
</P>
<P>
   No Jew would say, ``I am a Jewish person'' or, except in the
most formal circumstances, ``Mine is the Hebrew faith.'' Jews are
comfortable with the adjective, ``I'm Jewish,'' or the noun, ``I'm
a Jew.'' The reluctance of non-Jews to use the ``harsh'' word is
well intentioned, but such overly sensitive shying-away from the
J-noun draws a sardonic smile from some Jews.
</P>
<P>
   When many whites referred to blacks in their speech, they
hesitated to apply the noun to a person; instead of saying, ``He's
a black,'' they would say, ``He's a black guy,'' as if the use of
 &UR; black &LR;  as an adjective to modify  &UR; guy &LR;  somehow removed it from any
interpretation as derogation. This awkwardness was removed by the
adoption of  &UR; African-American &LR; ; that compound noun is not as stark
as  &UR; black &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Nouns often sound harsher than the adjectives on which they are
based; thus  &UR; Jew &LR;  is felt to be stronger than  &UR; Jewish &LR; , which could
also be taken to mean ``like a Jew.'' Take  &UR; blond/blonde &LR; : ``She's
 &UR; blond &LR; '' is acceptable as a description of hair color, but
`` &UR; She's a blonde &LR; ,'' using the noun form to impute fun-loving
characteristics, could be taken by some to be the newly dread
 &UR; lookism &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   What about  &UR; Jewish-American &LR; ; is it any different from  &UR; American
Jew &LR; ? Yes; the difference is context. When I am in a voting booth,
I can fairly be counted by demographers to be Jewish-American, and
when I am in a synagogue, I can be identified as an American Jew.
</P>
<P>
   Back to Lieberman. He is undeniably a person and a member of a
religious faith, but the quick identification is best: Joe's a Jew.
So is his wife, Hadassah, whose name is the Hebrew equivalent of
Esther. The feminine form  &UR; Jewess &LR; , popularized in Sir Walter
Scott's ``Ivanhoe'' (1820), has long been considered sexist, like
 &UR; actress &LR; .

   GORE _ HANNIBAL, Mo. - Al Gore's campaign riverboat steamed into
Mark Twain's boyhood home Monday night with a message drawn from
the legenday humorist: news of the death of Gore's presidential bid
has been greatly exaggerated. Gore's trip along 400 miles of the
Mississippi River ended with the vice president having erased the
commanding lead Republican rival has held in public opinion polls.
But Gore still has a long way to go. (Shepard, Cox News Service).

   RUSSIA-SUB _ MOSCOW _ Russian and Norwegian officials broke off
rescue operations and declared the 118 crewmembers of a wrecked
Russian submarine dead after confirmation came Monday that the
vessel was entirely flooded. Russian Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov
said he would ask for international help to raise the 500-foot
Kursk submarine from the frigid depths of the Barents Sea, and
recover its two nuclear reactors, a process that is expected to
take months. ``Our worst expectations are confirmed. All sections
of the sub are totally flooded and not a single member of the crew
remains alive,'' Russia's naval chief of staff Mikhail Motsak said
in a televised statement. (Coker, Cox News Service). 30.

   HURRICANE-PREPARE _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ South Florida is
entering the teeth of the hurricane season. You can expect at least
the threat of a hurricane, with everything that triggers that, at
least once in the next three to four weeks. Perhaps you'll be
looking at a hurricane warning as early as Thursday, if Debby aims
our way. Perhaps not. Now is not the time to panic. But it is time
for this: all those things you were supposed to do in May, but
didn't? Do them now. If Debby, or any other storm, comes our way in
the coming weeks, and you wait until a watch or warning has been
issued, you can expect to be fighting for plywood, batteries and
water. And that's just not fun. (Kleinberg, Palm Beach Post).

   SCHOOLS-ECHO _ WASHINGTON _ Education Secretary Richard Riley
releases his fifth annual Baby Boom Echo report on national and
state trends Monday in Henderson, Nev. It will say that rising
enrollments (53 million this year in K-12) set a record, and Riley
will claim that this shows that educating the children of baby
boomers requires federal subsidies for school modernization,
renovation and repair and for the reduction of the number of
portable classrooms parked on school grounds. This launches a
week-long drive by the administration to build support for
``building better schools'' before the Republican Congress returns
for the final weeks of nose-to-nose negotations with the Democratic
president over the budget for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1.

A CUT MAN TURNED WRITER ROLLS WITH THE PUNCHES By RICHARD c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   F.X. Toole is an erudite and profane character with a seemingly
apocryphal life: actor, teamster, salesman, bartender and
bullfighter. He added one more trade in 1979 _ boxing trainer and
cut man _ and has stuck with it since.
</P>
<P>
   Yet prominent boxing folk cannot place Toole or remember his
corner work. One promoter wondered if he was a scam artist. Another
said that if he were any good as a cut man, he would be known. They
could not recall him even when told of a sideline that surely makes
him stand out in their raffish universe.
</P>
<P>
   Toole writes fiction, a craft that he quietly pursued when he
wasn't stopping blood coming from fighters' noses. His first book
of short fiction, ``Rope Burns: Stories From the Corner,'' is to be
published next month by Ecco Press, an imprint of HarperCollins.
</P>
<P>
   The book has received lavish praise from the novelists Joyce
Carol Oates and James Ellroy, each of whom has also made detours
into writing about boxing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is unique,'' Oates said during a telephone interview.
``He's a born storyteller who uses the language of the ring.'' She
described his prose as an ``an elevated colloquial American
English.'' In its review, Publishers Weekly said that his writing
was ``as tight as a well-laced pair of gloves.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the widely known trainer Lou Duva has never heard of
Toole, and chuckles at the idea of a corner man moonlighting with
fiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Half the cut men I know can't speak English, let alone write
it,'' Duva said, ``because they've got mouthpieces in their
mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Bob DePhillipis, who manages three fighters Toole claims to
have assisted, said he had never heard of Toole until he was
offered this description: tall, lean, short white hair, 70 years
old.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's Jerry Boyd!'' he said. ``He's been around the world
with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Boyd invented F.X. Toole to shield his boxing life (which has
brought him psychic fulfillment but no riches) from his writing
(which had until recently brought him only rejection). He did not
want anyone in boxing to view him as anything but a corner man or
to be recognized for sucking up his gym buddies' lives and
conversations for his short stories and novellas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want anybody to know what I was doing,'' Boyd said
during one of several rollicking telephone interviews from Los
Angeles. ``And F.X. Toole lets me write determinedly
Irish-Catholic.''
</P>
<P>
   Boyd's lack of literary success made it easy to maintain his
secret. ``I've failed at everything,'' he said. ``I failed with
every woman, I failed as a father, I failed as a writer. I was a
bullfighter, but I wasn't good enough to be a matador. I wrote, but
I wasn't a writer.''

<P>
   Boyd refused to divulge his writing to his ``boxing daddy,'' the
trainer Dub Huntley, until a few months ago, when a book review by
F.X. Toole appeared in The Los Angeles Times. ``He told me
something about it, but I didn't believe him,'' said Huntley, a
former middleweight with failing vision who uses Boyd as ``my
eyes.'' ``I didn't think nothing of it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Boyd's luck turned last year when Zyzzyva, a literary
journal in San Francisco that he discovered in Writer's Market (a
sourcebook of publishing opportunities), published one of his
tales.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Junker, Zyzzyva's editor, said, ``My first thought was
that he was a little like Hemingway, and I didn't know if that was
good or not. But quite clearly it was more than that. He's enough
of a naif not to know about strategies or to disguise or call
attention to the act of narration.''
</P>
<P>
   Boyd celebrated the $50 sale with a dram of malt whiskey and
some dark chocolate. ``My fondest dream was to get published in a
literary magazine,'' he said. ``Think of the Sistine Chapel, with
the fingers of God and Adam about to touch _ that's my story. The
odds against me being published and talking to you about it are
greater than the odds against the existence of God.''
</P>
<P>
   Nat Sobel, a Manhattan agent who trolls literary magazines in
search of talent, read the story and wrote Boyd to ask if he had
more to sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised I hadn't heard of him and wondered if F.X. was
a pseudonym,'' Sobel said. He sold ``Rope Burns,'' five short
stories and a novella, plus a future boxing novel to Ecco for a
``high five-figure sum.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Halpern, Ecco's editorial director, showed the collection
to people at the publishing house who disliked boxing. ``Their
reaction,'' he recalled, ``was immediate and intense: `How does a
corner man learn to write?'''
</P>
<P>
   (Answer: he takes one college writing course, attends no
workshops, reads voraciously, absorbs the way boxing people act and
talk, and writes long after there is any legitimate hope of being
published.)
</P>
<P>
   Ecco is so certain of the quality of ``Rope Burns'' _ and of
Boyd's impetuous personal magnetism _ that it has ordered an
unusually large first printing of 50,000 copies and is sending him
on a six-city tour. HBO is also negotiating for the rights to turn
three stories into movies, Boyd said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Rope Burns'' is inhabited by cynical and sentimental trainers,
heroic boxers and slimy promoters, familiar archetypes flavored
with Boyd's ring-savvy, story structure and use of dialect. His
stories are essentially about love _ a love of pure boxing, a love
between boxers and corner men, and a love among corner men _
conveyed in gentle, graphic and occasionally violent terms. But
that love rarely equates with joy.
</P>
<P>
   Boxing may be corrupt, but when done right, Boyd sees magic.
``Some people say boxing is a metaphor for life,'' he said. ``I
think life is a metaphor for boxing.''
</P>
<P>
   Boyd grew up in Gardena, Calif., south of Los Angeles, the son
of an Irish immigrant father and a mother who was raised in rural
Ventura County. His mother's culinary legacy lives on in her son
the recreational pie baker. ``People grovel when you come in with a
pie,'' he said. ``It's better than being published.'' (He baked a
gooseberry pie for Junker, who called it ``exquisite.'')
</P>
<P>
   He started acting in high school and graduated from Los Angeles
City College with a drama degree in 1951. He joined the Navy
Reserve and was posted at Floyd Bennett Field in Brooklyn, N.Y.
Through friends he had made on Broadway, he began to take nighttime
acting courses in 1953 under Sanford Meisner at the Neighborhood
Playhouse in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider Sandy one of my writing teachers, particularly for
dialogue and giving your characters freedom,'' he said. ``You must
know your characters well enough to turn them loose.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that he was smitten by Meisner's technique, though not
by the actor's life; he became more fascinated by bullfighting. He
said he made it to Mexico, married and had a daughter. But his
bullfighting resume included being gored three times. The bulls, he
said, were learning more than he was.
</P>
<P>
   Needing money, he and his family returned to Los Angeles, where
he began a long series of blue-collar jobs to support his family.
He would eventually marry and divorce three times and father two
sons. Mostly, he tended bar. ``I was close to the seven deadly sins
at all times,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, nearly 50 years old, he followed a personal passion for
boxing and tried to become a fighter. He trained and fought, but
when his nose was broken and his teeth bashed in, he chose the
safer route of becoming a corner man. He later received a license
from the California State Athletic commission.
</P>
<P>
   And he continued to write, intermittently and unsuccessfully.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd submit things and I'd be destroyed when they were
rejected, but then I'd crawl back to the typewriter to do some
more,'' he said. ``This went on for years and years, and it hurt so
bad.''
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-to-late 1980s, he said, he quit writing altogether to
focus entirely on boxing. His boxing profile is as modest as the
boxers he has worked with, among them Jesus Salud, a former junior
featherweight champion; Antoine Byrd, a super middleweight; and
King Ipitan, a heavyweight, with whom Boyd had a falling-out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was happy with boxing, but I kept writing in my head,'' he
said. ``I rejected it like I'd caught my wife cheating on me, like,
`I love you, now leave.''' But after complications from heart
surgery in 1988, he said, his religious faith was reawakened along
with his ardor for writing.
</P>
<P>
   ``One night, sitting in bed, I looked across the wall and saw a
story,'' he said. ``I got to the point in my life that if I can see
the story, I can write it. It's not mystical, just something that
seems to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1996, while living in Missouri, he suffered a heart
attack. In bed, he said, fearing death, he remembered a final task:
tacking a new ending onto the novel he was rewriting. He said he
ignored the heart attack and slept until morning: ``I woke up and
climbed the hills to force the heart to work to see if I was
dreaming. I had a little wine, a cigar and had sex. Then my heart
began to hurt again, so I said if I'm going to die, I'm going to
finish the novel, so I spent a few hours putting it together, and
told the woman I was living with, `Baby, let's go to Springfield,'
and they inserted two stent implants.''
</P>
<P>
   Boyd's survival has positioned him for an unanticipated
publishing deliverance, one that will come under the pseudonym F.X.
Toole.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could I have written all these years if the process isn't
as rewarding as it is, as much as it hurts?'' he said. ``When
you're on a roll, baby, there ain't nothing like it, like a guy who
can throw six or eight punches in a row and come out unscathed,
then can do it again and again. When I'm writing, I can get blown
up, blown up to the ceiling. The muse taps you on the shoulder and
it's love at first sight; if you don't follow, you look at yourself
like a punk.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   After a cool dawn, breezes from the south will deliver
seasonably warm conditions to most of the Northeastern states on
Tuesday. High pressure moving off the Middle Atlantic Coast will
promote abundant sunshine near the coast. Sunshine will mix with
increasing clouds over the interior Northeast during the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   A broken band of thundershowers will weaken early Tuesday over
the central Great Lakes and northern Ohio Valley. Farther west, a
jet stream disturbance will produce a cluster of thunderstorms
across eastern Nebraska and Iowa that will spread east during the
afternoon. Damaging winds are possible with some of the storms in
the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Hot weather will linger over a large area from the southern
Plains to the interior West. Most areas will stay dry, however
afternoon thunderstorms will develop over many mountain peaks in
the southern and central Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: WINTER IN AUGUST
</P>
<P>
   Snow driven by 45-mph winds whitened Mount Washington, N.H., on
Sunday morning. At an elevation of 6,288 feet, the summit of Mount
Washington rises above all other peaks in the Northeast, exposing
it to frequent harsh weather. But, snow in August is unusual. On
average, an inch of snow falls on Mount Washington in August only
once every 10 years. Elsewhere in the the Northeast, temperatures
fell below freezing early Monday in a few protected valleys from
Pennsylvania to New England.

 &HT;    CRITICS DON'T UNDERSTAND AOL MERGER, TIME WARNER CHIEF SAYS
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASPEN, Colo. Time Warner Chairman Gerald M. Levin came out
swinging at his critics Monday, saying they don't understand the
nature of his company's proposed merger with America Online Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators and consumer advocates who worry about the creation
of a new monopoly have ``such (a) misperception about what this is
about,'' Levin said at a high-tech conference here.
</P>
<P>
   The merger is not intended to create a monopoly over what
content consumers can receive, but rather to vastly expand the
choices of programming and to enhance communication, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over time, there won't be any distinction'' between television
and the Internet, he said. ``Because in fact, what we are creating
is really the first Internet-powered media-communications company
of the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   By this fall, federal regulators will understand that and
approve the deal, he said. ``I don't think there are any regulatory
issues,'' he said. ``There are no business overlaps'' that would
put a choke hold on consumers.
</P>
<P>
   At the annual Aspen Summit, Levin spoke on the topic of
``convergence,'' the idea that TV, telephones and the Internet are
coming together. The conference is sponsored by the Progress &AMP;
Freedom Foundation, a non-profit organization that does research on
the digital revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Levin recounted how Time-Warner began experimenting with two-way
television long ago. ``In the early '90s, I was obsessed by the
notion of interactive television,'' he said. Though those early
tests didn't pan out technologically, they ``convinced me that
interactive, digital capability will eventually be what consumers
want.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in January 2000, he saw the chance to move toward
``convergence'' through a merger with AOL, the No.1 Internet
service provider.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very big idea,'' he said, ``a watershed,'' because it
would combine Time Warner's vast media and cable operations with
AOL's 23 million subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Levin will become chief executive of AOL Time Warner Inc. AOL's
leader, Steve Case, will serve as chairman.
</P>
<P>
   When he first evaluated the proposal to have AOL essentially buy
Time Warner, he was befuddled because the online upstart was much
smaller in terms of revenues.
</P>
<P>
   As he studied AOL's high-flying stock price, he said he had to
ask himself: ``Is that a fluke? Is there substance to these
valuations? So I had to take a long walk in the woods to try and
figure this out.''
</P>
<P>
   When he concluded the deal made sense, ``I was affirming the
value, and the sustainability and the growth trajectory that the
Internet was going to provide.''
</P>
<P>
   Levin says he is taking a gamble, but believes he will win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am betting my company _ a very significant company,
everything from Time Magazine to Gone with the Wind _ on this
reality of the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The merged company hopes to put itself at the center of the
convergence revolution with a black box about the size of a
briefcase. The box connects to a TV and a telephone line and allows
subscribers to a new service, called AOLTV, to surf the Internet
with a wireless keyboard write and send e-mail, and flash instant
messages on the same screen where they are watching television.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, AOL has been rolling out the service in eight test
markets from Baltimore to Sacramento. Within four years, nearly a
third of U.S. households will have access to interactive
television, according to projections by Jupiter Communications
Inc., a research firm.
</P>
<P>
   But critics of the merger fear that the future of
next-generation television could get locked up in one company's
hands.
</P>
<P>
   Many ``old media'' competitors, especially the Walt Disney Co.,
NBC Inc. and USA Networks Inc., have been warning the Federal
Communications Commission that AOL Time Warner would be able to use
its cable wires to force AOL TIme Warner services and programming
on captive consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Such arguments don't ``make any sense at all,'' Levin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a lot of commentary that we are going to take
Time Warner content and it's going to be exclusively available on
AOL,'' he said. But that would never happen ``because no one has a
monopoly on creativity. And the consumer is in charge, and the
consumer is going to go where there is the best material.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, AOL would never tie its online services too closely to
Time Warner because it wants to serve all Americans, whether their
neighborhoods are served by Time Warner cable or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``AOL's future, like the past and present of (Time Warner
networks) HBO, CNN, TBS, is to get on every platform possible,
whether that is cable, DSL, fixed wireless or satellite,'' Levin
said.
</P>
<P>
   After his speech, Levin dismissed questions about a recent news
story, appearing on Inside.com, that suggested AOL executives want
to sell off Time

 &HT;    GOP's 'inclusion illusion at least sets a goal
 &HT;    By Jay Bookman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In his speech in Los Angeles last week, Jesse Jackson dismissed
the abundance of black and Hispanic faces on the stage at the
Republican Convention as an ``inclusion illusion.'' Others
suggested that there might have been more minority faces up on the
stage in Philadelphia than out on the convention floor.
</P>
<P>
   There was truth to both observations. While the GOP may
officially oppose what it calls ``quotas,'' there's no question
that party leaders wanted a certain number of minority faces
broadcast on the nation's TV screens, and that those faces were far
out of proportion to their actual number and influence in the
party.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than an expression of hypocrisy, however, perhaps it's
best to look at that radiant picture of diversity from Philadelphia
as the stating of a goal. George W. Bush clearly understands that
the Republican Party's image as the home of disgruntled white guys
wasn't going to work. In marketing terms, he needed to reposition
his product, and the convention was the unveiling of his new ad
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   That says something reassuring about this country. The
bitterness, anger and defensiveness that has marked the GOP through
most of the '90s simply hasn't washed with a large majority of
Americans. We have proved a more tolerant and accepting people than
some in the GOP had anticipated. Bush understands that if his
party's angry tone had continued, it would have cost the
Republicans control of the House and perhaps the Senate, and would
also have denied them any real chance of regaining the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The pictures out of Philadelphia also said something reassuring
about Bush. As governor of Texas, he has never indulged in the type
of mean-spirited politicking practiced by men such as Jesse Helms,
Dick Armey and other prominent Republicans in Congress. In that
display of personal decency, he is much like his father.
</P>
<P>
   However, it's also true that as governor of Texas, Bush has
seldom confronted those within his own party who do indulge in
race-baiting, gay-bashing and the politics of personal destruction.
Within his concept of leadership, it is apparently enough that he
himself refrains from such behavior. He has shown little interest
in steering the rest of his party away from that approach. In that
too, he is much like his father.
</P>
<P>
   And there's the rub. If Bush remains content to serve merely as
his party's mask of reason and tolerance, while behind that mask
the party continues to operate as it has in the past, the promises
implied in that rainbow of faces at the Republican Convention will
never be made real. Nor will the party succeed in reaching out to
the black, Hispanic and immigrant populations that make up an
increasing percentage of the national electorate.
</P>
<P>
   It's also important to acknowledge the difficulty of making that
transition. The modern Republican Party has been built on Richard
Nixon's so-called ``Southern strategy,'' which exploited the
resentments of many in the traditional white majority toward the
gains of those perceived as outsiders. Those voters by no means
constitute the majority of Republican voters nationwide, but they
do represent a significant chunk of the party, and in some states
and congressional districts their influence is enormous. If you can
account for the fact of Jesse Helms any other way, I'd like to hear
it.
</P>
<P>
   Making the promises of Philadelphia real would require the
Republicans to wean themselves of dependence on that voting bloc.
And elected officials who have built careers on appealing to that
segment of the population aren't going to change willingly, in no
small part because men like Tom DeLay and Georgia's own Bob Barr
share the attitudes they exploit in others.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those difficulties, however, that transition is
inevitable. Over the last quarter century, as our country has grown
more tolerant of diversity in all its forms, the number of voters
motivated by fear and resentment has declined, while the number of
minority voters has increased. The effectiveness of the GOP's
``Southern strategy'' has been further eroded by the remarkable
prosperity the country is enjoying at the moment. It's harder to
feel resentful when you've got a full belly, a nice house, steady
work and prospering kids.
</P>
<P>
   Some people, of course, can manage to nurture resentment in even
the best of times. And I must confess to feeling a guilty little
pleasure at their expense as I watched the events in Philadelphia.
Did the fans of Jesse Helms and the boys, the ones who have seen
the Republican Party as their protector, dismiss those diverse
faces on the stage as just an ``inclusion illusion?'' Or did they
sit there simmering in rage, watching ``their party'' being taken
over by ``those people'' just as ``their country'' has been?

 &HT;    FIRST-TIME LEADER IN REUTERS/ZOGBY POLL
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Al Gore, helped by a convention bounce, sprung into a narrow
lead over George W. Bush on Monday, the first time he has led in
the Reuters/Zogby poll. The survey, conducted Friday through
Sunday, found Gore leading Bush 44-41 percent. But with a 3
percentage point margin of error, the race was still a statistical
dead heat. The Green Party's Ralph Nader polled 5 percent and the
Reform Party's Pat Buchanan 2 percent, with 7 percent still unsure.
In a two-man matchup, Gore led 47-43 percent. A week ago, Bush led
Gore 43-40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   SPECIFICALLY, HE THINKS IT A GOOD MOVE
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore said that his surge in polls following the Democratic
convention is evidence that voters want a campaign based on issues
rather than images. ``I do think that from the reaction of the
crowds, the risks I took to talk specifics has paid off,'' he said.
New polls suggest the race between him and George W. Bush has
tightened since last week's convention. Several voter surveys
indicated the race is in a dead heat; 10 days ago Bush led by 10
points or more.
</P>
<P>
   BEATING THE DRUM FOR MILITARY
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to slow Al Gore's post-convention gains in the polls,
George W. Bush is taking multiple swings at the Clinton
administration on military affairs, proposing to spend $1.3 billion
on pay raises, schools near military bases, and veterans' health
care. ``We are going to restore morale in the U.S. military,'' Bush
told the Veterans of Foreign Wars in Milwaukee today. In addition,
he pledged ``orderly and timely'' withdrawal of troops from Bosnia
and Kosovo, saying the administration has committed the nation to
military confrontations that lack a direct national interest.
</P>
<P>
   INVASION OF DEMOCRATIC TERRITORY
</P>
<P>
   Backed by a pair of new TV spots, George W. Bush and Dick Cheney
plan to visit 16 battleground states between now and Labor Day.
Most of those states have not been won by Republican presidential
candidates in the past two elections. Democrats have taken
Wisconsin and Iowa, Bush's stops Monday, since 1984. Today, Bush
will visit Illinois and Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   ROLLING ON THE RIVER
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore and Joe Lieberman were wrapping up their 400-mile boat
and bus tour down the Mississippi River in Hannibal, Mo., Mark
Twain's boyhood home. They advocated targeted tax cuts to help the
middle class pay for child care, elder care and college tuition. By
contrast, George W. Bush favors an across-the-board tax reduction
whose chief beneficiaries would be the upper-income people who bear
most of the income tax burden. Said Gore: ``I want the tax cuts to
go to the people who have the hardest time paying taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   FINANCIAL FOCUS ON FLORIDA
</P>
<P>
   As a measure of the electoral prize that Florida holds, both Al
Gore and George W. Bush will make post-convention visits to the
Sunshine State, and both campaigns are enlarging their presence
there. Gore will raise money for the Democratic Party at a friend's
home in Fort Lauderdale on Wednesday night and campaign in south
and central Florida on Wednesday and Thursday. Bush will raise
money for the Republican Party at a private home in Miami on
Thursday night and campaign in Miami on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   SCHOOL'S STILL OUT
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush has made education a major focus of his campaign
speeches and is running two new education ads this week. Since Bush
took office in 1994, the Lone Star state has given schools more
money, tougher classes, help with troubled students and pay raises
for teachers. But among educators, policy-makers and parents in
Texas, and beyond, there's no clear consensus about how much credit
he deserves. Critics say many reforms began before he took office
and others were pushed by Democrats in the state Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   A RECORD IN TAXPAYER FUNDING
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore last month became the first presidential candidate to
receive $15 million in taxpayer money for nomination expenses. Gore
agreed to limit his spending to $40.5 million in exchange for
matching federal funds, and so received an additional $673,000 in
July, bringing his total to $15.3 million, short of the ceiling of
$16.9 million. George W. Bush, who declined matching funds so he
could spend as much as he could raise, set his own record in July
by breaking the $100 million mark for fund-raising. Four years ago,
Republican Bob Dole received $13.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   A RECORD IN PRIVATE FUNDING
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush's fund-raising total broke the $100 million mark
in the final month before receiving the Republican presidential
nomination. And he spent $9.6 million in July, bringing his total
spending to $97.2 million, according to records filed with the
Federal Election Commission. The old record for fund-raising in a
single presidential race belonged to Ross Perot, who took in $72.8
million for the 1992 general election, nearly all of it from his
own pocket.
</P>
<P>
   CHALLENGE TO CORPORATION COOPERATION
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge in Boston has scheduled a hearing for Wednesday
in a lawsuit brought by Green Party candidate Ralph Nader and
voters challenging corporate financing of the upcoming presidential
debates as illegal political contributions. Plaintiffs include
Susan Sarandon, Phil Donahue and other Nader supporters. Under
rules of the Commission on Presidential Debates, candidates must
poll at least 15 pecent in order to participate, shutting out Nader
and the Reform Party's Pat Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   ULTERIOR MOTIVE KISSED OFF
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore insists his and wife's Tipper's electrifying kiss and
heavy embrace just before his acceptance speech last week was a
spur-of-the-moment emotional thing, not an effort to create a new
image. That's what he told TV interviewers this morning on NBC's
``Today,'' ABC's ``Good Morning America'' and CBS' ``The Early
Show.'' He denied the unabashed public show of affection was an
attempt to cast off an image if being ``wooden.'' He said the
public talk about the kiss has surprised him: ``Somebody said, `Are
you trying to send a message.' I said, `Actually, I was trying to
send a message to Tipper.' ''
</P>
<P>
   PRIMARIES AREN'T HISTORY YET
</P>
<P>
   There still are several late primaries to sort out. Today,
voters head to the polls in Alaska, Oklahoma and Wyoming. The
hottest congressional race of the day takes place in Oklahoma's 2nd
District, a historically Democratic stronghold in the northeastern
corner of the state that has trended Republican in recent years.
There are tight races on both sides to replace GOP Rep. Tom Coburn
, who term-limited himself and is returning to his medical practice
after three terms in the House. After Tuesday, it's Minnesota and
Rhode Island on Sept. 12 and Washington state Sept. 19.
</P>
<P>
   YES, VIRGINIA, THEY'RE SLUGGING IT OUT
</P>
<P>
   Both parties are plunging into Virginia's Senate race this week
with $1 million in TV attack ads. The Republican shelled out
$570,000 in ads for challenger George Allen, and the Democrats
responded with a $438,000 outlay on behalf of two-term incumbent
Charles Robb. The dueling ads, airing through Thursday, revolve
around taxes, one of the major themes in the Nov. 7 Robb-Allen
contest, as well as the presidential election.

ECONOMICS, POWER OF SELF-DETERMINATION AT HEART OF AFRICAN WOMEN'S
RISK OF HIV 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLAUDIA DREIFUS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Lounging in a high-floor room at the St. Francis
Hotel, drinking coffee served in perfect porcelain cups, Dr. Nancy
Padian was far from the sad, overcrowded streets of Harare,
Zimbabwe, but they and their beleaguered people remained on her
mind.
</P>
<P>
   Padian, 48, an epidemiologist who is director of research for
the AIDS Research Institute of the University of California at San
Francisco, is one the world's foremost experts on the heterosexual
transmission of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   For the past seven years, she has commuted between San Francisco
and Harare _ about 10,000 miles _ to help Zimbabwean health workers
gain some measure of control over the AIDS epidemic tearing through
their nation in southern Africa. Their chief weapon against HIV has
been the barrier method of contraception, using devices like
condoms.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's this zeal to find this new magic bullet,'' Padian
said. ``But there are all these existing methods with great
potential and they are right under our noses and that haven't
really been looked at. I'm hoping that what we do in Harare will
help the women there and, frankly, here too.''
 &UR; Q. You've racked up thousands of frequent flier miles between San
Francisco and Zimbabwe. What exactly do you do there?  &LR; 
A. I run a series of studies as part of a joint project between the
University of Zimbabwe and the University of California, San
Francisco. We examine the effect of contraception in preventing HIV
in Zimbabwean women. In Africa, AIDS is mainly heterosexually
transmitted. So what we are looking at in a country where 25
[percent) to 30 percent of the population is infected with HIV is
whether different forms of contraception might increase or decrease
the acquisition of HIV.
</P>
<P>
   We see a population of women who come to regular family planning
clinics in Harare. About 30 [percent) to 40 percent are infected.
The rate is much higher, of course, for women in the sex industry.
In the one study, we try to help uninfected women to get their male
partners to use condoms. We've been able to persuade people to use
condoms far more than we originally thought we could. In fact,
we've been able to get more than half the women in this category to
do this.
</P>
<P>
   For those women who aren't successful at that, we try to
encourage them to use female methods of contraception: female
condoms, spermicides, diaphragms. We are also looking at whether or
not women who are using hormonal contraceptives are at increased or
decreased risk of HIV. This study has just begun, so we don't have
any answers yet.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q. The assumption has been that women in Africa and elsewhere
cannot convince men to use condoms. What are you doing
differently? &LR;  A. Some women can't. But for others, it's a question
of teaching them negotiating strategies. We do role-playing. We
present the women with obstacles and have them work out ways to
overcome them. We encourage them to think it's OK to talk about
sexual activity with their partners, that these discussions are
part of a healthy lifestyle.
 &UR; Q. What makes women in southern Africa so much more vulnerable to
AIDS than American women? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A. There is a higher prevalence of other sexually transmitted
diseases there _ as well as a lack of male circumcision, which
turns out to be a factor in the susceptibility of the man to AIDS.
And you know, the rates of infection from parasites, poor
nutrition, all contribute to the problem. In general, if a woman's
immune system is compromised because of other infections and
nutritional factors, that too increases susceptibility to HIV once
she's exposed.
</P>
<P>
   There are some particular cultural factors, too. It is not
uncommon, also, for African men to have multiple partners and still
have their monogamous partner. The practice of ``dry sex,'' which
occurs in certain countries in southern Africa, almost certainly
increases the susceptibility of women to HIV, if their partner is
infected. ``Dry sex'' is when a woman uses a chemical or physical
substance that she puts into herself to dry up the cervical and
vaginal secretions in advance of having sex. Women sometimes engage
in this practice because there's a belief that men prefer it.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q. The Colombian writer Silvana Paternostro claimed that the
biggest AIDS risk factor for a women in many Latin American
countries was to be married. Is that true in southern Africa, too? &LR; 
A. I think that's true in Zimbabwe, where the infection rate is
from 25 [percent) to 30 percent, and where the likelihood that a
husband is infected is quite high. It's not a question of the woman
having multiple partners. Unless they are sex workers, the women
are generally monogamous.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q. To what extent do you think the power imbalance between African
men and women contributes to the spread of AIDS? &LR; 
A. I think the gender imbalance is huge there, and accounts for the
some of the transmission. One of the things I see as helping in
preventing AIDS, are microloan programs for women's economic
development. These are small loans to women to help them start
businesses of their own. In order for women to really negotiate
sexual activity, it's important for them to be economically
empowered.
 &UR; Q. The president of South Africa, Thabo Mbeki, has issued some
rather ambiguous statements on AIDS. He has raised doubts about
whether HIV causes AIDS, declared a need for an African solution to
the epidemic and suggested that researchers should look at poverty
as a root cause. Considering that the South African AIDS rate has
increased 50 percent since his election, what do you believe he's
thinking? &LR; 
A. I don't understand why he said it. I wondered whether he was
confusing two issues. I completely agree that we need indigenous
solutions to indigenous problems. You definitely can't export
American models of behavior changes and expect to implement them in
southern Africa. But to suggest that HIV doesn't cause AIDS when
all the evidence points to the contrary verges on being
irresponsible. It de-legitimizes prevention programs. Most
prevention programs, after all, are geared at preventing someone
from being exposed to HIV. And if HIV is not the issue, then what
are we doing?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q. Is President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe in similar denial?  &LR;  A.
Denial may be too strong a word here. Mugabe has certainly not
dealt strongly with the epidemic. He's not strongly supporting the
national AIDS control program in promoting condoms. Whether that's
denial or avoidance, it's a shame. Because your best chance of
success is if you can engage the local leaders. If the government
isn't behind it, it's much more difficult to have widespread
effective programs throughout the country.
 &UR; Q. How do you deal, emotionally, with the high death rate you are
witnessing in Harare?  &LR;  A. I find it unbelievable, overwhelming.
Among my colleagues at the university, someone I am working with is
always off to a funeral. It's unbelievable. But I feel like I'm
doing something. And that keeps me going. What makes me angry is
when people say that it's all sealed and that it's too late and
that you can't do anything more. Because I feel like even if I do a
little bit, it will make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q. How did the epidemiology of HIV in women become your specialty?
 &LR;  A. I was in graduate school here at Berkeley in the early 1980s.
I had originally wanted to be a psychologist, but fell in love with
epidemiology because it seemed to be a good way to help a lot of
people _ rather than one person at a time.
</P>
<P>
   My graduate adviser, Warren Winkelstein, had a grant to look at
the natural history of AIDS. HIV hadn't been discovered as the
cause yet. So at that point, no graduate student was interested in
working on this. I got the job as his assistant because there were
no other takers. He suggested that I look into the female partners
of bisexual infected men in the group he was studying. That's when
I started getting involved in the heterosexual transmission of
AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, what we found was, at that time, that male-to-female
sexual transmission was a lot more frequent than female to male,
that risk factors for transmission were primarily not using
condoms, anal intercourse and STDs in either partner.
 &UR; Q. You are about to go to India to start an AIDS study there. How
bad is the problem on the subcontinent?  &LR;  A. The infection rate
isn't that high, but the absolute numbers of people who are
infected is huge. Huge. Given the numbers, one can only guess that
the epidemic exists at an early stage. And, of course, all of the
gender issues that we talked about in Zimbabwe are acute there as
well. The women have little say. What I'm discovering as I travel
the world, is that for women, power is an absolute dimension of
physical health. The bottom line, universally is, if you cannot
negotiate what you are doing with your body, you will not be able
to lead a healthy and long life.

LIRA AND FRANCS DELIVERED TO YOUR DOOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, August 27) 
By BETSY WADE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cash may be making a comeback. Two major companies say they have
a brisk business delivering bundles of foreign currency to people
who are preparing to travel overseas. In a study last year American
Express discovered that people on the road in the United States
carry an average of $500. Fat rolls of cash _ how quaint.
</P>
<P>
   Oanda, a company with a Web site that specializes in currency
transactions and international currency quotations, linked up with
Thomas Cook Global and Financial Services this month to offer
overnight or second-day delivery of 100 foreign currencies, or
Thomas Cook traveler's checks in six foreign denominations, on the
basis of orders placed through www.oanda.com. Deliveries are made
on business days.
</P>
<P>
   The other company, Chase Manhattan Bank, which for five years
has had a phone service allowing its customers to request delivery
of currencies of 75 countries, in November began offering
deliveries upon request through www.currencytogo.com to holders of
any MasterCard or Visa card, as well as its own customers. Again
deliveries are made only on business days.
</P>
<P>
   The currency amounts requested on these systems are not today's
equivalent of the $20 tip packs of long ago that travelers bought
at currency-exchange windows. This is hundreds of dollars' worth of
lire, pounds and yen. Timothy Kelly, chairman of Oanda, says its
average request is $400; Amy Friedlander, product manager for Chase
Currency to Go, says $600 to $650 is average.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's American Express study found that 42 percent of
spending by vacationers that did not involve advance purchases
(like air fares) was charged to a credit or debit card, 40 percent
was in cash, and 18 percent in money taken from ATMs, (cash or
traveler's checks).
</P>
<P>
   Overall sales of traveler's checks are shrinking markedly.
Robert A. Fader, managing director of travel payment services for
Citicorp, said that sales of all brands worldwide dropped to $35
billion to $40 billion in 1999, from $50 billion in 1998. American
Express, which sells the leading brand, experienced a drop in 1999
from 1998, although it has increased its sales in the last three
quarters, versus the same period a year earlier. Nancy Muller, a
spokeswoman, said that after a period of decline, the company was
selling the checks very aggressively, with emphasis on United
States travel.
</P>
<P>
   From January through July of this year, American Express was
selling traveler's checks for home delivery at
www.americanexpress.com, and Muller says it will resume at the end
of November. Cardholders can order traveler's checks (in 10
currencies) and cash (in 19 currencies) at (800) 721-9768.
</P>
<P>
   There are changes in modern life that explain why offering
currency on the Web is an idea whose time has come. ATMs are common
and live tellers scarce. Since an ATM at this moment produces only
the currency of the country it is in, getting foreign currency
requires tellers, and that means standing in line.
</P>
<P>
   The upsurge in courier services means that currency can be
delivered without violating the old basic caution against sending
cash by mail. For security purposes, neither Oanda-Thomas Cook nor
Chase will identify its delivery sources (although UPS, Federal
Express and others probably do the job), and both companies deliver
in parcels that do not identify the sender.
</P>
<P>
   One advantage of Web sites with conversion rates highly visible
is that one can comparison-shop. The exchange rates offered by
Oanda-Thomas Cook and Chase on their sites are less favorable than
the bank-to-bank rates quoted on the financial pages (which involve
huge sums), but certainly better than the exchange booths at
airports. ATMs abroad do not charge the $1 or $1.50 fee that banks
charge noncustomers in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Oanda-Thomas Cook Web program, FXDelivery, is available at
the moment only in the United States and only with a Visa or
MasterCard credit or debit card. It can be reached through the
Oanda Web site or through links on AOL, Alta Vista, Swissair and
trip.com. After providing a current quotation in dollars for the
currency being bought, FXDelivery asks for the amount desired, with
a minimum of $200 and a maximum of $1,500. It then seeks name,
address and credit card information: the delivery address must be
the same as the billing address for the card (no post office
boxes). Someone (not necessarily the cardholder) must be at home to
accept delivery, the Web site says. Tracy Hammock, a vice president
at Thomas Cook, said that the money is sent in denominations small
enough for cabdrivers to make change.
</P>
<P>
   If a credit card is used, the cost is handled as a cash advance,
with whatever fees that may involve. The delivery charge is $12 for
next-day delivery, $8 for second-day delivery. Next-day delivery
may not be available if Thomas Cook does not have the specific
currency in stock. Beyond the delivery fee and cash-advance fee,
said Kelly, the Oanda chairman, the service does not involve a
separate fee for Oanda-Thomas Cook. (The reason for this, he said,
is that they get better exchange rates for the money they buy than
for the money they sell.) This service will also sell Thomas Cook
traveler's checks in British, Spanish, German, Dutch, Swiss and
Canadian currencies. The help number is (877) 414-6359. After 3
p.m., one day must be added to the delivery schedule; no weekend
deliveries.
</P>
<P>
   How Much Cash to Carry?
</P>
<P>
   Chase's Currency to Go, at www.currencytogo.com or (888)
242-7384, also requires that the user have a Visa or MasterCard or
a Chase checking or savings account, from which the purchase is
debited. For home delivery, the minimum purchase is $100, the
maximum is $1,000. (Larger deliveries can be made to Chase
branches.) The address for home delivery must be the one on the
Chase account or the card's billing address; it cannot be a post
office box. Orders for next business day delivery may be made as
late as 5 p.m. by phone; Web orders must be placed before 3 p.m.
for the next day. Chase delivers the money free if more than $500
is requested; otherwise the fee is $10. Chase processes the
transaction as a purchase, so credit-card users are not charged the
fee for a cash advance.
</P>
<P>
   Friedlander, who ordered several hundred dollars in lire before
going on her honeymoon in Italy in May, said she did not consider
it too much to carry. When she and her husband got to Venice, she
said, he was sick, and she was glad they could pay for the trip
from the airport, including the water taxi to their hotel, without
having to find an ATM.
</P>
<P>
   Is it an advantage to use these services? Only for the
convenience of not having to stand in line at the bank, or not
having to worry about finding the ATM at the airport when you land,
if you are in a big rush. Financially, there is no gain, and it
could be more costly than using a bank or an ATM, depending on
delivery charges and whether you buy currency as a cash advance on
your credit card, which brings interest fees, or use a debit card,
which does not. But you're sure to be first in the taxi line.

<P>
   ``It's a good thing the sidewalks are cement,'' observed the
stranger as I passed him on Main Street.
</P>
<P>
   I looked at him inquiringly. ``Or they'd be rolled up!'' he
explained, guffawing.
</P>
<P>
   He had a point. Apart from him, his wife and me, only a single
family strolled down the main drag of Baker City, Ore., at six
o'clock on a Sunday evening in July. Possibly all the inhabitants
were at dinner. That didn't prevent me from admiring the dignified
Victorian buildings _ banks, hotels, homes _ that had been erected
in the raw Wild West, and were now flanked by broad leafy streets
and backed by the ragged Blue Mountains. The town of 10,000 in this
northeastern corner of Oregon is quiet now, even bucolic, but it
wasn't always that way.
</P>
<P>
   I was on a three-day exploratory jaunt through the Blue
Mountains, a range so variously defined that even many Oregonians
have never heard of it. Geologically, they are considered to spread
from the snow-capped Wallowas near the Idaho border to the gentle
Ochocos in central Oregon. In popular parlance, they extend simply
from the Washington line south to Baker City, where they are
sometimes called the Elkhorns. This semantic confusion tends to
keep them terra incognita outside the state, which is not all bad.
</P>
<P>
   The first people besides the resident American Indian population
to pass this way in any numbers were the Oregon Trail emigrants,
who must have been relieved to find this watered valley after their
desert crossing. Then gold was discovered in the 1860s. An
enterprising settler built a toll road from the Oregon Trail to the
Powder River running below the mountain range, and Baker City was
born. It grew to serve the miners and the ranchers who followed _
and a rowdy bunch they must have been. The railroad came through in
1884, bringing in the merchants who built dignified monuments to
prosperity on the frontier.
</P>
<P>
   In one of these, the Geiser Grand Hotel, I found my supper. The
Geiser was built in 1889. Sitting prominently on a corner in the
center of town it featured the most modern innovations, including
electricity and even an elevator. The spacious dining room retains
an aura of relaxed elegance, and the menu concentrates on steaks
and Northwestern fish. I had a yen for fish and chips, and theirs
turned out to be pleasantly light, so I followed it with a piece of
chocolate-hazelnut torte.
</P>
<P>
   Replete, I returned to the Grant House Bed-and-Breakfast, which
I'd selected at random (it is currently closed while the owner,
Diane Pearson, is on an extended trip to Russia). Grant House too
dates from the 1880s. Pearson, a school librarian, has brought in
some family heirlooms: a floral wool carpet and her childhood
piano, which with the solid Mission-style furniture and myriad
Russian nesting dolls, or matryoshki, create a calm, welcoming
atmosphere. The three cozy guest rooms upstairs are named after
local mines; Pearson had just returned from Siberia with the dolls
and a Russian exchange student _ gratifying to me as a former
teacher of Russian _ and we all had a jolly conversation over tea.
</P>
<P>
   It was so comfortable I found it hard to leave, but the
mountains were calling; and I did, after a breakfast of fresh fruit
and homemade muffins. First I decided to see the mountains as the
early emigrants would have, from the National Historic Oregon Trail
Interpretive Center just east of town.
</P>
<P>
   The rounded hills east of Baker City are barren and dry,
enlivened only by black rock and sagebrush _ not too different from
the previous several hundred miles the pioneers would already have
endured. Some of the early diarists note their poor impression of
fabled Oregon. The interpretive center, opened in 1992, sits on
Flagstaff Hill just above a section of the old trail, whose ruts
are visible in the sand.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the main exhibits lead the visitor along a path
featuring scenes of life on the 2,000-mile trek. Actual diary
entries and explanatory plaques detail the realities of the
journey, and the hardships. Of these, disease and accidents were
the worst: in some years, 10 percent of emigrants died on the
trail.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, the Blue Mountains rose impressively behind a wagon
encampment, where a volunteer in pioneer costume offered me a
biscuit freshly baked in campfire embers. The old trail was a
pencil line through the sagebrush below.
</P>
<P>
   The sun was already hot, but I decided to walk down along the
four-mile interpretive path loop. Signs advise the visitor to wear
a hat and carry water. Sage thrashers and families of grasshopper
sparrows quarreled in the brush. On the valley floor a replica
covered wagon stood beside a scrap of original trail. One could
imagine thirsty emigrants trudging through, gazing at the
evergreen-clad mountains and goading their oxen on, hoping to make
camp along the cool and leafy Powder River. They would have passed
here in late summer or early fall, when the desert was at its
hottest and driest.
</P>
<P>
   They would have proceeded northwest past the town of La Grande,
aiming for the pass at Blue Mountain Crossing. I, having the luxury
of a car and paved roads, would follow a somewhat different route.

   Two of Oregon's Scenic Byways join to provide a driver's view _
a brief sketch, as it were _ of these mountains. The tour is about
145 miles long, and as it connects with I-84 at either end, it's
possible to do a loop: explore the highlands, then return on the
Interstate to visit the few small cities _ Pendleton, La Grande,
Baker City _ strung on it like beads on a chain.
</P>
<P>
   Starting off, I drove 12 miles north to Haines to catch the
northern end of the Elkhorn Scenic Byway (Forest Service Road 73).
It looped up through farm and meadow and forests of vanilla-scented
ponderosa pine, and soon I was driving through thick, solemn stands
of spruce and fir. The air, decidedly hot down on the plain, was
aromatic and fresh. There was hardly another vehicle on the road.
</P>
<P>
   About 18 miles on I came to Anthony Lake, wrapped in firs and
pine at 7,100 feet. In winter a modest ski resort opens here to
accommodate the cognoscenti familiar with the area's dry powder.
Now, on the Fourth of July weekend, the campground was just opening
for the season. A couple of dozen people lolled about the
pocket-mirror alpine lake _ fishing, picnicking or gently floating
in rubber rafts. Across the water rose the cone of Gunsight
Mountain.
</P>
<P>
   I observed snow melting into rivulets feeding the lake and
decided it was not time for a swim. Some of the picnic tables were
neatly ensconced in snowbanks. Cloudless skies invited a walk on
the graveled milelong circumference trail. Wild violets bloomed
beside the path. I passed quiet children and quieter fishermen; sat
on a rock and watched trout jumping; and on completing the circle,
stretched out lazily in the sun. Driving again, along the
switchbacky mountain road, I skirted the North Fork John Day
Wilderness Area _ 170,000 acres of uninhabited forest, canyon and
lake. Many trails thread through this primitive area, including the
23-mile North Fork John Day River Trail through the canyon, and the
equally long Elkhorn Crest Trail. A few old miners' cabins are
handy in case of inclement weather. I had to come back here, I
decided, cut loose from the car and dive into the magnificent
wilderness.

 &HT;    PIPELINE COMPANY WAS WARNED OF CORROSION PROBLEM
 &HT;    530&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The company that owns the natural gas pipeline that
exploded Saturday, killing 10 campers in New Mexico, was warned by
federal officials three years ago of potential corrosion problems
on the pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, federal inspectors said they found that employees
of El Paso Natural Gas Co. did not know how to accurately judge the
effectiveness of systems designed to protect the pipeline from
corrosion.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the National Transportation Safety Board, which is
investigating the explosion, said it may be months before they will
know what caused the 50-year-old pipeline to rupture six feet
underground. Five adults and five children died when fire from the
pipeline swept up the Pecos River, where members of two families
were camping. Two other persons were in critical condition Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials did not respond Monday to telephone inquiries
about the 1997 warning. There is no reason to assume that the
problem cited in 1997 by federal officials contributed to the
explosion.
</P>
<P>
   Records of the Office of Pipeline Safety, the federal agency
responsible for regulating more than 1.2 million miles of pipelines
through which natural gas and hazardous liquids such as gasoline
and diesel fuel flow in America, show that El Paso Natural Gas has
experienced 40 pipeline ruptures since 1985.
</P>
<P>
   The pipeline carries a significant portion of natural gas used
in Arizona and southern California, said a spokeswoman for the
Office of Pipeline Safety.
</P>
<P>
   In a ``letter of concern'' addressed to El Paso Natural Gas Co.
on March 27, 1997, the Office of Pipeline Safety said it had
learned company technicians had not been given instructions in how
to accurately determine whether a system designed to prevent
corrosion was working.
</P>
<P>
   Corrosion is one of the chief reasons for pipeline failure,
especially in older lines, federal statistics show.
</P>
<P>
   The corrosion-prevention system cited in the letter consists of
an underground wire which carries a weak electric current through
the soil near a pipeline. The current on the wire is supposed to
neutralize natural electrical processes involved in corrosion.
</P>
<P>
   Pipeline companies are required to periodically measure
electrical conditions in the surrounding soil to make sure this
``cathodic protection'' system is working properly. However,
underground probes used to measure the soil's electric charge are
often inserted several feet away from the pipe itself, explained
Donald Deaver, a Houston engineer and pipeline consultant.
</P>
<P>
   The condition of the soil between the probe and the pipe can
affect readings and must be taken into account, Deaver said.
</P>
<P>
   In the letter to El Paso Natural Gas, Office of Pipeline Safety
official James C. Thomas said company technicians had told his
inspectors they were concerned about possible errors caused by
these soil conditions but did not know how to calculate
corrections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the error source is unknown then we must conclude that
the levels of protection on the pipeline are also unknown,'' Thomas
said in the ``Letter of Concern'' to El Paso Natural Gas. ``They
may be too high or too low.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Deaver said that if the current flowing through the cathodic
protection wire is too low, the wire will fail to protect the
pipeline from corrosion. If it is too high, it can cause the
pipeline to start cracking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having an accurate cathodic protection measurement is
extremely important to knowing that you have the proper amount of
current on that wire,'' he said.

Undated: magnificent wilderness.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   My time now was limited. I joined the Blue Mountains Scenic
Byway at Forest Service Road 53 and paused at the Bridge Creek
Wildlife Area. The Forest Service acquired this tract of meadow and
open woods as a winter feeding range for elk (the elk were using it
anyway, annoying the ranchers). Up a short trail, a stand of pines
overlooked hundreds of square miles of the John Day River drainage.
</P>
<P>
   It was late in the afternoon. A bluish haze hung over the
valley. The sun beat down, raising a sweet-oniony smell from the
hundreds of mariposa lilies in bloom. I bent down to sniff one, and
discovered a tiny azure butterfly inside, which was immediately
joined by another. For half an hour I soaked in the sun and
silence.
</P>
<P>
   Presently it dawned on me that, not having brought a tent, I
would have to find a place to sleep. I meandered on a few miles to
the hamlet of Ukiah, population 245. A month earlier the town would
have been ringed with meadows of blue camas flowers, whose roots
were a traditional Indian staple.
</P>
<P>
   Ukiah lies in a saucer-shaped depression between mountains and
looks like the set for an episode of ``Wyatt Earp.'' The short main
street is flanked by low plank buildings _ a couple of general
stores, a cafe, a Mexican restaurant _ and the Antlers Inn. The
sides of the inn were literally covered with antlers of deer, elk,
moose and even caribou, reminding me that here big game is
plentiful and hunters even more so. Rough wooden signs offered
``Rooms'' and ``Drop-In Showers, $5.00.'' It looked intriguing, but
no one answered my knock.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly I followed the rushing Grande Ronde River 35 miles down
on Route 244 to the town of La Grande. On I-84 I turned northwest,
following the approximate route of the emigrants' crossing amid a
wagon train of semis. At the top of the pass, a herd of elk browsed
along the highway _ their summer feeding grounds?
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, as if a curtain had dropped, the panorama of a
blood-red sunset on the vast brown Columbia Plateau opened up _ a
sobering view for weary pioneers. Soon I pulled into the city of
Pendleton and checked into the clean but plain Vagabond Inn (a
motel that has since changed hands and is now called the Economy
Inn).
</P>
<P>
   East of Pendleton on the Umatilla Indian Reservation is the new
Tamastslikt Cultural Institute. The museum, right next to the
Wildhorse Casino Resort, was opened in 1998 by the Cayuse, Walla
Walla and Umatilla tribes. It's the newest of the five Oregon Trail
Centers, and its focus is the culture of the Columbia Plateau
tribes and the Oregon Trail's impact upon them.
</P>
<P>
   Early the next morning I drove out to the reservation. The round
wood-and-stone museum stands on a level plain fronting the
foothills. Within, a temporary exhibition hall contained children's
illustrations _ some on brown paper cut to the shape of a deer hide
_ of Indian folk tales. In the main halls the coyote materializes
as a silhouette on walls and in folk stories emanating from tape
players, running like a spirit guide through the tribes' story.
</P>
<P>
   Replicas of a winter lodge, an early missionary church and a
trading fort anchor the narrative. The history winds through the
introduction of the horse, the trappers and missionaries, then the
huge influx of settlers and confinement to reservations. It was
interesting to trace the changes in tools, dress and ornaments:
from the traditional stone, bone, shell and hide, to glass beads
obtained through trade with the Spanish and English, to woven cloth
and metal goods.
</P>
<P>
   Noteworthy, too, was how these Old World goods were adapted:
beads, for instance, being worked in native and French-influenced
patterns not only for personal adornment but also for decorating
the horses of which the Northwest tribes were so passionately fond.
Exhibits on the present and future of the tribes cover Indian
salmon recovery projects, efforts for economic growth, and hopes
for the future.
</P>
<P>
   Two things made a strong impression on this particular visitor.
First, learning that the horse, so dramatically involved with the
economy, culture and mythology of the tribes, only reached the
Columbia Plateau in the early 1700s. The famous Nez Perce
horse-breeders noted in the journals of Lewis and Clark had had
just a century to hone their skills.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the process by which the original 800-square-mile
Umatilla Reservation was reduced to the present 172,000 acres, or
269 square miles, as the settlers' hunger for farmland grew. First
acreages were whittled away; then came ``allotment,'' in which
tracts were allotted to individual tribal members, and many ended
up sold off to non-Indians.
</P>
<P>
   In the cafe I bought a glass of huckleberry juice, then drove an
hour back up to the mountains for a last look. A large grouse
observed me with nonchalance on the quiet Scenic Byway. A detour
due to repaving was a blessing: along a dirt road, a camas meadow
was in late bloom, like a hyacinth-blue lake.
</P>
<P>
   WHERE TO STOP &QL; 
Getting There
</P>
<P>
   From Portland, take I-84 approximately 150 miles to Heppner
Junction, where the 145-mile Blue Mountains Scenic Byway begins on
State Highway 74. After 45 miles, at Heppner, the exceedingly
well-marked Byway continues along Willow Creek Road and Forest
Service Road 53 to Ukiah and the North Fork John Day campground.
From there take the 106-mile Elkhorn Scenic Byway (Forest Service
Road 73) east to Anthony Lake and Haines, or, on 73 and Route 7,
south to Baker City.
</P>
<P>
   Or, from Boise, take I-84 to Baker City, and follow the route in
reverse.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the high country roads are blocked until mid-June.
Summer and early fall offer fine weather, though nights can be
cool, even cold.

these soil conditions but did not know how to calculate
corrections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the error source is unknown then we must conclude that
the levels of protection on the pipeline are also unknown,'' Thomas
said in the ``Letter of Concern'' to El Paso Natural Gas. ``They
may be too high or too low.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Deaver said that if the current flowing through the cathodic
protection wire is too low, the wire will fail to protect the
pipeline from corrosion. If it is too high, it can cause the
pipeline to start cracking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having an accurate cathodic protection measurement is
extremely important to knowing that you have the proper amount of
current on that wire,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Klinger, a spokeswoman for the Office of Pipeline
Safety, said Monday she did not know how El Paso Natural Gas had
responded to the 1997 warning letter. However, she said that if the
problem was not corrected, the company would be subject to fines.
</P>
<P>
   A pipeline reform organization created in the aftermath of a
gasoline pipeline explosion that killed three persons last year in
Bellingham, Wash., sent condolences to the families of the victims
of Saturday's explosion.
</P>
<P>
   However, the organization, SAFE Bellingham, said its efforts to
get Congress to enact stronger pipeline safety laws had been
opposed by the natural gas industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is tragic and incomprehensible that this industry is
fighting our efforts to improve pipeline safety by spending money
on lobbyists in Washington, D.C. when they should be spending money
to ensure their pipelines do not threaten public safety,'' said
Carl Weimer, executive director or SAFE Bellingham.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics compiled by the Transportation Department's Office of
Pipeline Safety, the agency that regulates the pipeline industry,
show that corrosion has been the most common reason for ruptures in
large, cross-country natural gas transmission lines this year.

COWBOYS AND INDIANS MINGLE AT THE PENDLETON ROUNDUP IN OREGON
</HEADLINE>
 By SUSAN G. HAUSER  
 (for release Sunday, Aug. 27) 
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After singing the national anthem at the opening ceremony of the
Pendleton Round-Up in northeastern Oregon last September, all the
men in the grandstands returned their cowboy hats to their heads
and everybody settled back down into their seats. The rodeo
princesses were introduced over the loudspeaker, and a small herd
of quarter horses streaked out from a far corner, each in full
gallop and bearing a member of the royal court. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Holding the reins in one hand and waving furiously with the
other, the local beauties in matching cowgirl garb, with fringed
leather vests and trousers, tan boots and gloves, managed to keep
their western hats _ and their smiles _ firmly attached while their
horses leaped over a fence and sped around the perimeter of the
large outdoor arena. They came to an abrupt halt in a perfect line
in front of the main grandstand. With not a hair out of place, the
four Round-Up royals continued to smile and wave, acknowledging the
accolades of the crowd. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I figured I was not the only one impressed by the dexterous
performance of the cowgirl court. Over by the chutes, which would
be spewing out snorting bulls and broncs for the next four hours,
the professional cowboys were probably wondering, ``Now, how can I
top that?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, they found a way. Starting with bareback bronc riding,
and then getting bounced and bruised through steer wrestling, bull
riding and other feats of skill and stamina, the more than 500
cowboys who made their way from every corner of the continent to
this Oregon town demonstrated once again that the Pendleton
Round-Up _ with this year's event, Sept. 13 to 16, marking the 90th
year _ is one of the best rodeos around. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's the largest four-day rodeo in the world, though it doesn't
quite compare to the likes of the Calgary Stampede in Alberta,
Canada, or the National Finals in Oklahoma City, 10-day events with
huge prize money. But in Pendleton, with more than $250,000 at
stake, and altogether more than 50,000 fans watching, this is where
many a world record has been made or broken, where successful
cowboys can walk away a lot richer and where unsuccessful cowboys
can walk away a lot more . . . well, experienced. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Pendleton Round-Up began in 1910 as a sort of harvest
festival, scheduled in late September to allow the grain farmers
from the rolling hills around Pendleton to complete their season's
work. The events were much the same as at the previous year's
Fourth of July celebration, where farmers and ranch hands, along
with Indians from the nearby Umatilla Reservation, competed in
bronc riding, horse races, greased-pig catching and sack races, and
enjoyed Indian dancing and feasts. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Setting the Pendleton Round-Up apart from any other rodeo is the
fact that Indians from all over the West fully participate in the
four days of rodeo events, which include the nightly Happy Canyon
pageant and the Friday morning Westward Ho! Parade, when colorfully
dressed cowboys and Indians ride horses or wagons. Indian
participation dates from the very first Round-Up and stems from the
congenial relationship between residents of Pendleton and the
Umatilla reservation, eight miles east of town. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Special Indian events during Round-Up include two beauty
contests, bareback relay races and ceremonial dancing, in full
regalia. The main dancing event is held at 9 a.m. Saturday in the
rodeo arena, with competitions in the war dance, the rabbit dance,
the circle dance and the swan dance.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Every mid-September at Round-Up time, an Indian village springs
up near the arena; the crossed poles and tops of 250 tepees can be
seen from the rodeo grandstands. For a week the village is
populated with Umatilla, Cayuse and Walla Walla Indians from the
reservation, as well as visitors from about a dozen other Western
tribes. Adjacent to the village, extending into Roy Raley Park, is
the Indian arts and crafts fair, where jewelry, beadwork, baskets,
dolls, rugs and pottery are for sale, not to mention delicious
frybread smothered with huckleberry jam. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last September, I attended the official opening day, Wednesday,
when the last event of the day (wild horse racing) is followed by
the post-rodeo barbecue supper in Roy Raley Park, next to the
arena. For $4, I loaded up my plate with a barbecue beef sandwich,
coleslaw and beans, then sat in the shaded grass to eat with
hundreds of other rodeo goers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Except for female Indian dancers, relay racers and the rodeo
royalty, all the participants in the Pendleton Round-Up are men.
(This year, however, women's barrel racing is back for the first
time since 1962.) Between events I visited the Hall of Fame, a tiny
museum under the south grandstand, to admire old photographs of
some of the earlier Round-Up stars, women who could break broncs
and hogtie calves with the best of the cowboys. In fact, in 1914
Bertha Blancett came within 12 points of winning the rodeo's
all-around title. Women's events were removed from the program
after the bronc buster Bonnie McCarroll died in 1929 after getting
bucked onto her head. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Her death was only one of three in the 90 years of the Round-Up.
But the total of broken bones and bruises has never been tallied. I
counted quite a few rough landings during my day at the rodeo, from
cowboys getting ejected from bulls or broncs, to steer wrestlers
leaping from their racing horses onto racing steers and _ oops,
missing. &QL; 
 &QL; 
(MORE) &QL; 
 &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the roughest event of the afternoon was the brahma bull
riding. These hump-necked bulls whirled and twirled and snorted and
stomped. If they couldn't stomp on a felled cowboy, they took off
after any other breathing creature within sight. A one-ton bull
barreling toward the sidelines could always disperse several dozen
cowboys. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But each contestant managed to brush himself off and hurry from
the field, or in some cases get plucked from a furious animal by
the mounted pickup crew.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That afternoon I took a break from the rodeo to cautiously set
foot in the Let 'Er Buck Room, the infamous bar beneath the south
grandstand. The first thing to catch my eye was the sign
prominently displayed behind the bar: ``Keep Your Clothes On.
Indecent Exposure Will Not Be Tolerated. Anyone Involved Will Be
Banned From the Premises.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I quickly learned that until just a few years ago it was
customary for some women at the rowdy bar to remove their upper
garments, often while sitting on a cowboy's shoulders. Now former
college football players, disguised as burly cowboys, wander
through the standing crowd (there are no tables or chairs in the
one-room bar) to head off any possibility of indecent exposure. I
decided not to buy a drink (hard liquor only), thereby avoiding the
need to visit the ``heifer room'' (the men's room simply has a set
of bull horns over the door) and possibly having to pass through
the so-called cowboy gantlet. ``You expect to be groped here,'' a
cheerful young woman told me. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It seems this city of 17,125 has always been wild and woolly,
beginning as a frontier town about 20 years after wagon trains of
the Oregon Trail first passed by. At one time as many as 18
brothels and 32 bars could be found within an eight-block radius.
Until 1912 there was no local sheriff to put a damper on the wild
living. The brothels, particularly popular with airmen at the World
War II-era Army air training base in Pendleton, remained in
operation until outlawed in 1953. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now, more sedate activities abound in Pendleton, where the
buildings are low, the streets are wide and the sun is hot at
Round-Up time. A good way to beat the heat is to take the Pendleton
Underground Tour and traipse through the tunnels and rooms carved
out by Chinese laborers about 130 years ago. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The original purpose of the tunnels was to provide safe and
speedy delivery of merchandise from business to business during a
lawless period, when robberies were frequent. Eventually, the
underground chambers became convenient places for bars, card rooms
and even a few more wholesome enterprises, such as an ice cream
parlor and a laundry. The Chinese laundry doubled as a bathhouse,
where the price of a bath dropped a penny for each bather who had
used the water before you. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Underground Tour is followed by a walk through the Cozy
Rooms brothel, which operated from 1923 to 1953. This part of the
tour is really less about the enterprise than about the madam,
Stella Darby, who was known for her good works and acts of charity.
I happen to know two brothers who Stella raised, rescuing them from
an unhappy family life, and they turned out just fine. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Compared with brothel browsing, the Happy Canyon pageant is
definitely a G-rated entertainment. With a cast of hundreds of
local residents and members of the nearby reservation, the history
of the Old West is depicted nightly in narrated action at an
outdoor arena adjacent to the rodeo arena. The show has changed
only minimally since it was first produced in 1914. In a way, the
same goes for the cast of characters, because roles in the pageant
are passed on to family members from one generation to the next. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The pageant begins with peaceful scenes from Native American
life, later disrupted by a flood of pioneers. The scenes from a
frontier town are mostly slapstick, but work up to the grand
finale, the truly impressive Mounted Quadrille. Four couples on
horseback display intricate equine choreography in a rousing square
dance. Finally, an Indian brave carries the American flag up the
set's mountainside, the band plays the national anthem and the
audience is invited into the dance hall for music and refreshment.
</P>
<P>
   A few miles east of town, on reservation land, is the Wildhorse
Casino, featuring 400 slots, poker, blackjack, live keno, off-track
betting and bingo. It is next to a 100-room hotel and 18-hole golf
course, and it has become a popular destination for travelers
heading east up the long, lonely road from Pendleton into the Blue
Mountains. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But not far to the west is the Round-Up arena, where at 1:15
p.m. for four days in a row the boom of a cannon signals the start
of the rodeo. And over the loudspeaker the announcer stirs up the
expectant crowd by intoning: ``There is a battle cry heard
throughout the world, simply known as `Let 'er buck!'''(BBOX) &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Joe Miller's 15-year dream of carving a piece of paradise out of
East Texas bottomland near Greenville was lost last March to
500,000 gallons of gasoline that poured across fields and down a
creek bed beside his land.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole place smelled like a refinery,'' he said. ``You
could have tossed a match in the creek, and it would have caught
fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the gasoline that spilled from the ruptured, underground
Explorer pipeline can be cleaned up, Miller says, the land is no
longer the rural sanctuary that his family treasured.
</P>
<P>
   Pipelines are safer than trucks, barges and tankers for shipping
oil and gas, but concerns about the aging, infrequently inspected
lines are mounting as the number of major accidents increases.
</P>
<P>
   Urban neighborhoods, ranchers and farmers have organized to
block proposed lines from passing through their land. Congress,
federal regulators and watchdog groups are moving to protect
heavily populated regions and the environment. The federal Office
of Pipeline Safety, an arm of the Transportation Department, has
been sharply criticized as ineffective and vulnerable to pipeline
industry influence.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Hall, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board,
which investigates pipeline accidents, put it bluntly in a speech
last December to the Association of Oil Pipe Lines, a Washington
pipeline trade organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``The products in your lines _ if they escape _ pollute and
kill,'' Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   Ten people, including five children under the age of six,
suffered a fiery death Saturday when a natural gas pipeline
exploded at the Pecos River near Carlsbad, N.M. An 11th person died
on Monday. They had been camping and fishing on the river. The fire
was so intense that sand melted into glass and some concrete on a
nearby bridge turned to powder. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Three people were killed in a Jan. 14 Garland, Texas, house
explosion when natural gas leaked from a cracked 4-inch gas main in
an alley behind the house. The line had been scheduled for repair.
</P>
<P>
   No one was killed or injured in the Greenville accident, but the
outcome was deadly a year ago when 250,000 gallons of gasoline
spilled from a broken pipeline in Bellingham, Wash. After a flicked
cigarette lighter sparked a fire in a gasoline-saturated creek, a
huge fireball swept downstream, killing two 10-year-old boys and a
fisherman and injuring eight others.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   ALWAYS A DANGER
</P>
<P>
   Texas, with 250,000 miles of pipelines, has had more accidents
in the past 15 years than any other state. State officials say that
75 percent of the accidents are a result of contractors
accidentally digging into pipelines. But when Texas adopted a
call-before-you-dig program in 1998, it was the last state in the
continental United States to do so. The program has reduced the
number of pipeline accidents nationally.
</P>
<P>
   The Explorer pipeline is well-marked in the Dallas/Fort Worth
Metroplex, but at least three times in the past 15 years it has
been damaged in construction accidents. The line runs through
Grapevine's business district, following the Cotton Belt rail line
north of Dallas Street to a tank farm in Southlake, across from the
new Grapevine High School stadium on Texas 26. The tank farm has
been a relatively safe facility with few problems.
</P>
<P>
   A branch of the pipeline then heads east, carrying jet fuel to
D/FW Airport, and another branch continues to a tank farm just
north of downtown Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always have to be concerned about the line, but the city
doesn't regulate it,'' Grapevine Mayor William D. Tate said. ``When
you are moving fuel under pressure, there is always a danger.''
</P>
<P>
   Rod Sands, Explorer vice president of operations, says the
company has a good safety record.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a philosophy to maintain the highest levels of safety
and integrity: If in doubt, shut down,'' he said. ``We have had
some third-party damage.''
</P>
<P>
   In Addison north of Dallas on June 19, 1985, a backhoe punctured
the line, sending a geyser of flames 100 feet into the air. Flames
seared the top of an adjacent 12-story office building, and the
fire spread underground. Neighboring shopping malls were evacuated.
One person mowing grass nearby was burned.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 16, 1997, a half-mile north of Grapevine High School on
the Southlake side of Texas 26, a contractor struck the line with a
tree-planting machine. No one was injured and no fire broke out,
but 2,500 gallons of gasoline was spilled.
</P>
<P>
   On July 15, 1999, a contractor working along William D. Tate
Avenue in Grapevine, near a half-dozen fast-food restaurants,
punctured the airport fuel line. About 4,250 gallons of jet fuel
spilled, but without causing injuries or fire.
</P>
<P>
   And in one of the largest environmental disasters to hit North
Texas in decades, the high-pressure 28-inch Explorer pipeline split
open March 9, releasing a half-million gallons of gasoline and
50,000 gallons of the toxic additive MTBE, methyl tertiary-butyl
ether. Pushed by heavy rains, the fuel washed 25 miles to Lake
Tawakoni, which supplies Dallas with as much as 220 million gallons
of drinking water a day during the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned about the MTBE contamination of Tawakoni, Dallas water
officials waited until last week to begin using the lake again.

A TRICKLE, NOT A RUSH, IN TOURISM TO VIETNAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, August 25) 
By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HANOI, Vietnam _ Twenty-five years after the end of the Vietnam
War and a month after the United States completed an historic trade
agreement with its former enemy, tour organizers in both countries
hope that American travelers will finally start to make their way
to Vietnam in large numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The trade pact, which was signed on July 13, is not expected to
have an immediate, direct impact on tourism. It is mainly intended
to expand trade in goods between the two countries, and to open
Vietnam's backward economy to American investment.
</P>
<P>
   Among Vietnamese tourism officials, the hope is that the
agreement will inspire new confidence in this country among
Americans planning to travel to Asia. Although the country boasts
5,000 years of history, cities and countryside of exceptional
beauty, unspoiled palm-fringed beaches and some of the best food in
Asia, many Americans apparently still see Vietnam as a difficult,
even hostile destination.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think Vietnam is like North Korea,'' said Doug Reese, the
Washington-based representative for Vietnam tourism, a government
agency. ``People keep thinking about the war. They think Vietnam is
dangerous, that they won't be welcome.''
</P>
<P>
   As most recent visitors to Vietnam will attest, the country is
eager to welcome foreign travelers, Americans in particular, and
the friendliness of the reception can be overwhelming to any
American who remembers the torment of the war.
</P>
<P>
   During the recent nationwide celebration to mark the 25th
anniversary of the country's reunification _ and the defeat of the
American-backed government of South Vietnam _ the Communist
government offered little of the anti-American propaganda that was
once was its daily fare.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the current Vietnamese population was born after the
war, and Vietnamese youngsters avidly enjoy American music and
fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Since she began organizing tours to Vietnam three years ago,
Lesley Gonzalez of Asian Pacific Adventures in Northridge, Calif.,
said her clients have yet to report a bad experience. ``All of
their expectations,'' she said, ``are surpassed: the hotels, the
food, the hospitality of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Vietnamese officials have been disappointed by the sluggish
growth in tourism from the United States. Of the 64,400 visas
reported issued to Americans last year by the Vietnamese Embassy in
Washington, almost 46,100 of them went to Vietnamese-Americans,
many going to see their families, not to spend money at tourist
sites or in hotels or restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, foreign tourism to Vietnam continues to set records.
The country's tourism authority recorded almost 1.06 million
visitors in the first six months of the year, a jump of 18 percent
from the same period of 1999. China, France, Taiwan, Britain and
Japan sent the largest numbers of tourists last year, in that
order.
</P>
<P>
   The Vietnamese had hoped for _ and planned for _ more dramatic
growth. A building boom in the early 1990s has resulted in a glut
of hotel rooms, notably in Hanoi, the nation's capital, and Ho Chi
Minh City, formerly Saigon. According to government figures, the
country's hotel occupancy rate last year was 43 percent.
</P>
<P>
   One result, for visitors, is that Vietnam can be a bargain.
Comfortable, newly renovated hotel rooms can be had for under $20 a
night in major cities. World-class luxury is a relative bargain as
well.
</P>
<P>
   The newly opened five-star Hilton Hanoi Opera _ not to be
confused with the prison down the street that was known to jailed
American pilots as the Hanoi Hilton _ offers rooms for $94 a night
plus 15 percent tax, a rate that includes breakfast, evening
cocktails, butler service and a full gym.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street is the fabled Metropole Hotel, a lovingly
restored French colonial gem that is now run by Sofitel, the French
hotel chain. A five-course meal in its Vietnamese restaurant costs
less than $20 with wine, and features a floor show of Vietnamese
dance. Rooms begin at $100, plus tax.
</P>
<P>
   The lag in U.S. tourism may be due less to memories of the war
and more to a practical fact: There are no direct flights between
the United States and Vietnam. Tourism officials in both countries
say that an American tourist influx will begin in earnest only when
the two countries establish direct air connections.
</P>
<P>
   Currently Americans are usually required to connect elsewhere in
Asia with flights of Vietnam Airlines or one of several Asian or
European airlines that fly to Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City.
</P>
<P>
   Although Vietnam Airlines has junked most of its old Russian
fleet and replaced it with new Boeing and Airbus jets, tour
operators say American travelers are wary of flying Vietnam's
national carrier. ``It's important for the U.S. carriers to go,''
Reese said. ``The arrival of the American carriers is like the U.S.
government seal of approval for travel to Vietnam.''
</P>
<P>
   United Airlines, Northwest and other American carriers have said
they are eager to obtain landing rights in Vietnam. But
negotiations on an air-rights agreement have repeatedly bogged
down. There is optimism in Washington and Hanoi that the trade
agreement signed last month has established an atmosphere of
cooperation that will extend to the landing-rights talks, which are
resuming this summer.  &QL;

 &HT;    How to make the grade when paying for college
 &HT;    By David McNaughton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - Just in case you haven't noticed, school has begun
again. That's cause for panic among some parents of teens who are
beginning their last year in high school, SmartMoney (September)
notes.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a parent of a high school senior, but you're not
counting on something like Georgia's HOPE scholarship program and
you haven't saved enough to pay for your child's college education,
calm down, the magazine advises.
</P>
<P>
   SmartMoney lays out a host of options to meet the bills,
information on applying for federal help and a suggestion that you
can negotiate aid packages with some colleges.
</P>
<P>
   Another point the magazine makes is that parents should not
assume their income level will keep their offspring from qualifying
for financial need. SmartMoney says the latest available figures
show 25 percent of students whose parents earned at least $100,000
received grants.
</P>
<P>
   Suited for battle
</P>
<P>
   The legal fight between designer Calvin Klein and clothing
manufacturer Linda Wachner is the hottest news out of the fashion
world. Fortune (Sept. 4) offers a runway view of a feud it says
``is as much about personality as it is about business.''
</P>
<P>
   Also in Fortune: A look at how Microsoft is trying to understand
what makes the under-23 crowd tick.
</P>
<P>
   Netting ordinary people
</P>
<P>
   The Internet long ago stopped being the province of the few. So
for its fourth anniversary issue, Yahoo Internet Life (September)
chronicles how ordinary and some-not-so ordinary people use the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Among those profiled are 59-year-old smoke jumper Murray Taylor,
fire eater and sword swallower Keith Nelson, sushi chef Jay
Catapusan and matchmaker Rabbi Shmuley Boteach.
</P>
<P>
   Also in Yahoo Internet Life: An online guide to the Summer
Olympics in Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   And the winner is ...
</P>
<P>
   In case you're curious, Worth (September) subscribers think
Swissair is the best airline, Morningstar Mutual Funds the best
investment newsletter and NetBank, of Alpharetta, the best online
bank. The annual ranking, with 27 categories of products and
services, is based on a survey of Worth subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Bidding for more
</P>
<P>
   ``The inherent biases in big companies are very difficult to
break,'' says Heidi Miller, explaining why she left her job as
chief financial officer at Citigroup earlier this year to join
Priceline.com. At Citigroup, she tells Working Woman (September),
``it was certainly clear to me that I was not, in the foreseeable
future, going to manage any part of the organization directly.''
</P>
<P>
   Worth noting ...
</P>
<P>
   Forbes (Sept. 4) presents its annual survey of closed-end mutual
funds.
</P>
<P>
   eCompany Now (September) offers advice on how to overcome
corporate infighting and other potential problems when a business
tries to add electronic commerce capabilities.

six teenagers were executed in Florida and Georgia. While
proponents say such executions are justified, given the

   BKN-KNICKS-TRADE (Undated) _ In a startling four-team trade that

played for 15 seasons in New York, often with distinction and
always with remarkable effort. But in recent seasons, his injuries
mounted, as did the sense that he was unable to adjust to being a
secondary player in the team's offense. By Mike Wise.
</P>
<P>
   DEBEERS-STRATEGY (London) _ De Beers has had to confront
accusations that the company has links to traffic in diamonds from
Africa's war zones. But it has also had to face a much bigger
challenge: that its huge stockpile of diamonds, used to help
control the supply and keep world prices high, had become a costly
albatross. Now, De Beers is using the controversy over so-called
blood diamonds to advance a strategic switch to address its
commercial problems. The plan is to turn De Beers from a stockpile
manager into a branded, high-value diamond-trader that would keep
diamonds from war zones out of the luxury market. Marketing, not
monopoly, would make sure the company maintained its leadership
position. By seizing the moral high ground, De Beers has already
shown signs that its business is turning around. By Alan Cowell.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-SUBMARINE (Moscow) _ As divers gained entry to the wreck
of the nuclear submarine Kursk and declared it completely flooded
and the 118-member crew dead, Russian Defense Minister Marshal Igor
Sergeyev said in a nationally televised interview Monday that the
military might have made mistakes in how it responded to the
disaster. But he defended the armed forces, saying the institution
had been robbed and stripped in recent years and he disclosed new
information to support the strong suspicion of Russian military and
civilian leaders that the Kursk collided with another submarine
that also suffered severe damage, but managed to escape undetected.

COACHES HOLD HIGH HOPES FOR WILSON IN SYDNEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ When all the tumbling, twisting, and tabulating came to
an end Sunday night, America finally had its top dozen Olympic
gymnasts all in a row, ripped and ready for Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disputed,'' was one of Bela Karolyi's constant refrains
throughout the women's meet, his characterization of the intense
competition. ``Fiery. Colorful.''
</P>
<P>
   The question now is, will there be the glint of gold, silver, or
bronze awaiting the Yanks at Olympus?
</P>
<P>
   From the men's standpoint, head coach Peter Kormann believes his
star athlete, Blaine Wilson, could win the all-around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen him better,'' said Kormann, the '76 Olympic
bronze medalist in floor exercise, who grew up swinging from trees
and tumbling in the backyard sandbox of his home in Braintree, just
outside Boston. ``And I've been watching him since the 10th grade.
</P>
<P>
   The men packed their bags Saturday night with Wilson still in
steel-gripped command of his No. 1 position on the club, a
foundation he cemented with first-place finishes in all four rounds
of the nationals and trials. The 26-year-old Wilson is their
undisputed leader, with none of the other five members _ veteran
returnee John Roethlisberger, Steve McCain, Sean Townsend, and the
Hamm twins (Morgan and Paul) _ able to push him from underneath
with any serious pressure.
</P>
<P>
   When the NBC cameras power up in Sydney, the focus will be on
Wilson, his presence and strength personified with the bold iron
cross he strikes on the rings.
</P>
<P>
   The women lack the same spiritual presence at the top of the
pack. They have Elise Ray as their No. 1 performer, but there is a
difference between ranking and role. Ray, talented and bold, has
Karolyi's backing as the unofficial captain, but she is only 18 and
this will be her first trip to the Land of the Rings.
</P>
<P>
   Amy Chow, back for a second time, and Dominique Dawes, a
three-time Olympian, at first glance would seem the better fits to
take charge of the squad. Chow, runner-up to Ray in the trials, has
the numbers for the job. But once away from the uneven bars,
balance beam, vault, and dance floor, she closes up like a day lily
at sunset. There could still be time for Dawes to be the marshal of
the mat, but her numbers were the weakest of the six. At this stage
of her career, she's more of a stabilizing voice than a bold
leader.
</P>
<P>
   A surprise here could be the 5-foot-3-inch, 83-pound Morgan
White, whose spirit and style bring that infectious quotient that
Karolyi loves. She's the closest thing the Yanks have to the pixie,
the adolescent wunderkind that has all but disappeared from the
Games _ much to Karolyi's chagrin _ with new rules mandating that
athletes must turn at least 16 the year of the Games. White turned
17 in June, and doesn't have a driver's license, but has the focus
and ferocity that just might make her grab the wheel in Sydney if
needed.
</P>
<P>
   Kristen Maloney, knocked out of the No. 2 spot by the charging
Chow, was listing slightly by the end the final round Sunday night.
Jamie Dantzscher, another Olympic first-timer, was for the most
part strong, but she slipped off the balance beam twice in her
final event of the meet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beam's always a little bit of a struggle for me,'' said
Dantzscher, whose place on the team was considered in jeopardy
earlier in the week, with Karolyi sounding as if he favored Vanessa
Atler for her vault skills. ``It had to end on beam, right? But I
figured I did my job on the other three events _ I was hoping
they'd look at that.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more to the point, there was greater focus on the
faltering Atler, whom Karolyi once believed could be the building
block of the team. But in two days of trials the 18-year-old Atler
couldn't post anything higher than a 9.50 (vault in prelims) and
ultimately got kicked to the curb by the dynamic Dawes.
</P>
<P>
   Karolyi sounded heartbroken not to include Atler, but the
decision to go with Dawes was correct. In fact, Alyssa Beckerman
showed some pop on the last day (three scores of 9.55 or better,
fourth overall) that could have justified her being chosen over
Dawes. Beckerman will go as the alternate.
</P>
<P>
   On the men's side, Jamie Natalie, who ranked fifth overall in
the trials, was chosen as the alternate.
</P>
<P>
   The meet's only moment of true melancholy came early Sunday
night when Shannon Miller elected to pull out after she pancaked
her landing on her first vault and stumbled backward on her second.
She left with two jammed knees and one bruised ego, saying she
didn't want to risk injury, in case her name was called for
Olympus.
</P>
<P>
   Two hours later, a sullen Karolyi said Miller's performance
wasn't sufficient even to make her considered for a berth. More
days in the gym might have been a cure. But with the Games fast
approaching, the trials complete, time marched on without Miller.

TIGER UNDER PRESSURE? HE WINS, ANYWAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ When Tiger Woods slammed a 3-wood into the
trees on the par-4 12th hole Saturday at Valhalla Golf Club, then
three-putted for double-bogey, he added a slice of intrigue that
had been missing during this summer of his major championship
domination.
</P>
<P>
   ``You expect him to win,'' said Mark Calcavecchia early Sunday
afternoon, before Woods had teed off with a one-shot lead in the
82d PGA Championship. ``But he's hitting some errant shots and some
double-crosses. If he hits a few of those early, he could be in
trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Calcavecchia is one of Woods's favorite practice partners, a
good friend, and a PGA Tour veteran who was well aware of the
circumstances surrounding Sunday's final round. Unlike the US Open,
when Woods led by 10 shots, or the British Open, when he led by
six, Woods would have pressure on him in the closing round.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure. It had been missing at Pebble Beach and St. Andrews,
observers cried. Woods had not been challenged, and some wondered
what would happen down the stretch if he were. Calcavecchia
wondered, too, but he didn't lose sight of who it was people were
talking about.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not playing as well as he did at the US Open or British
Open,'' said Calcavecchia. ``Then again, he has a knack for being
able to hit the right shot at the right time.''
</P>
<P>
   Some four hours later, Woods produced a flurry of shots that
made Calcavecchia's comment ring true. He had held off relative
unknown Bob May to join Ben Hogan as the only players to win three
major championships in a season, prevailing in a three-hole playoff
after a stirring back-side duel in which each player shot a
sizzling 5-under 31.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, Woods earned his fifth major championship by
draining a 5-foot birdie putt on the 72d hole to force extra holes,
then going birdie-par-par in the playoff to better May's
par-par-par. A memorable punch/counterpunch, to be sure, and it
perhaps is what will be remembered. But not to be overlooked is
what paved the way for such theatrics: Woods's mental toughness,
perhaps his greatest attribute.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have 12 holes and be only two back in a major championship,
you just need to hang around. You know something is going to
happen,'' said Woods, who had bogeyed two of the first six holes to
fall to 11 under, two shots behind his unheralded playing parter.
When he lost a gamble and drove into rough trying to take the
shortcut to the par-5 seventh, eyebrows were raised. Was he feeling
the pressure?
</P>
<P>
   No, said Woods. He was enjoying the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fun,'' said Woods. ``As good as it gets.''
</P>
<P>
   To overcome the deficit, Woods needed to make something happen,
because May _ whose 56 PGA Tour events had produced no wins and
just one top 10 _ wasn't going away. (itals)The right shot at the
right time.(unitals) Woods, embracing the challenge people had
wished upon him, answered the call with a sequence of shots that
came long before the playoff:
</P>
<P>
   --That third shot to the par-5 seventh, a 60-degree sand wedge
that he had practiced earlier in the week. ``You have done it in
practice,'' Woods said to himself. ``Do it again.'' He pitched to a
foot to stop the bleeding and get within one.
</P>
<P>
   --A ``little 7-iron'' at the 166-yard seventh hole and the
12-foot birdie putt that pulled him even.
</P>
<P>
   --The putt on the par-4 12th. Back down by a shot, he was 15
feet below the hole, knowing May had an easy 2-foot birdie putt. If
he missed, Woods would be down a pair. He made it.
</P>
<P>
   --Having watched May nearly jam it into the jar at the 217-yard
14th, Woods slammed a 4-iron to 15 feet to assure matching birdies.
</P>
<P>
   --Arguably the key shot of the battle, a curling 15-foot putt to
save par at the 402-yard 15th. May was tight, perhaps 6-8 feet
away, and Woods knew if he missed, May would birdie and go up by
three shots. ``If I could somehow dig down deep enough to
concentrate and control all my emotions and nerves and bury that
putt, I just felt that it would make his putt a little bit more
interesting,'' said Woods, who had put one of those
``double-crosses'' Calcavecchia talked about onto his approach to
send his ball sailing long of the green. Woods didn't just make the
putt, he willed it into the hole _ a mystical gift that cannot be
seen, touched, or explained, and one that was previously possessed
only by Jack Nicklaus. ``I just stepped up there and buried it.''
May missed and Woods's deficit remained just one.
</P>
<P>
   --A ground-shaking drive at the 17th that hugged the left side
of the fairway, cut gently, and settled in the middle, a mere 94
yards from the pin. It traveled 328 yards with a ferocity that is
uncanny. The 60-degree sand wedge that followed showed a deftness
equally uncanny. It stopped 2 feet from the cup, set up his sixth
birdie in 11 holes, and put him in a tie.
</P>
<P>
   You cannot play defense in golf, so May looked on helplessly,
though part of him couldn't help but admire what he was seeing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, I really got to know Tiger Woods,'' said May, who had
played the course in his sleep Saturday night. ``I woke up and I
was fresh, but I had played golf all night.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no shame, said May, not one ounce of regret.
</P>
<P>
   Not after he made that 15-foot, downhill double-breaker at the
72d hole that forced Woods into a must-make situation that he
naturally made.
</P>
<P>
   Not after he had made par saves from a greenside bunker at the
first playoff hole, the 16th, and from thick rough to the right of
the next green.
</P>
<P>
   And not even after he had failed to take advantage of a Woods
drive that sailed miles left at the third playoff hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never completed my backswing,'' said May, who went left into
thick rough to remove any chance of reaching the par-5 in two, as
he had all week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know where his ball was. We thought it went forward
and deeper into the bushes.''
</P>
<P>
   May played his second shot right of the fairway, into rough,
then his third just right of the pin. It hit the slope and rolled
cruelly right, onto a lower tier 30-35 feet from the pin.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, meanhile, found his drive on hardpan after it had struck
a tree, ricocheted off a cart path, and rolled for many yards, all
the while chased by a marshal who kept the crowd away. A comical
scene to many, but not to the man chasing history.
</P>
<P>
   He, too, had to lay up on a hole he figured to reach in two, but
unlike May, Woods did not put his third shot on the green. Bunkered
in front, he was faced with another one of those ``right shot at
the right time'' moments.
</P>
<P>
   The drama was great, thousands of fans sitting silently in a
golf amphitheater, as Woods disappeared down into the sand, behind
a wall of turf. He had his hands on a sand wedge and his arms
around pressure that has choked many a golfer's skill.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got the easiest bunker shot in golf,'' Woods told
himself, well aware that he had to get it up-and-down. ``Straight
uphill with a lot of green to work with. That is what I had
envisioned and it came out perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   The playoff win didn't come close to matching the magnitude of
his triumphs at Pebble Beach (15-shot win) and St. Andrews (eight),
but it far surpassed them in drama and served as a statement to
those who questioned what he'd do when pressured.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two completely different emotions,'' said Woods. ``(The
others) you just needed to keep your heart going and you'd be all
right. Today, you just knew that you had to execute golf shots and
I knew stepping up on 18 that I had to make birdie to win. Par
wasn't going to get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   He needed the right shots at the right time.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The high-profile court cases over Amazon's patent on its
one-click shopping process and Priceline's patent on its reverse
auctions have propelled the notion of patenting business methods
into the limelight.
</P>
<P>
   It's not, however, a new phenomenon. Businesses have always been
free to patent their methods. Companies have, for instance,
patented the way they sell airline tickets and the way they manage
moneymarket accounts.
</P>
<P>
   But in an information economy, in which entire business models
can be embedded in digital code, attempts to use patents as
competitive weapons have intensified. So have the attendant
controversies.
</P>
<P>
   To shed light on this contentious topic, Q. Todd Dickinson,
director of the U.S. Patent and Trademark office, talks about the
myths and realities of business patents.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What constitutes a patentable business model?
</P>
<P>
   A: We distinguish between a business model, which is a general
vision or strategy, and a business method, which is a specific way
of doing business.
</P>
<P>
   In law, there's a four-part test for patentability of a business
method, as there is for any invention. The way of doing business
has to be useful. It has to be new. It can't be so incremental that
it would be obvious to a skilled practitioner. And in the
application process, disclosure of the innovation has to be so
complete that fellow practitioners can understand it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why are we seeing a rush to patent business methods now?
</P>
<P>
   A: For a couple of reasons. First is the court opinion on State
Street Bank vs. Signature Financial that was handed down about two
years ago, which definitively stated that software that governs
business methods can be patented as long as it produces some
concrete, useful and tangible result. That ruling made companies
much more aware that they could patent software- based business
methods.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, there's been a general rise in software
patents of all types, fueled in part by the burst of innovation
generated by the Internet. That being said, though, let me put it
in context. We issued about 161,000 patents last year. Some 600
were software-related business methods. I expect we'll issue
another 1,000 such patents this year. That's a fairly modest amount
overall.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are you concerned that patenting business methods will
ultimately dampen innovation?
</P>
<P>
   A: This is not the first time that argument has been raised. It
was raised over telephony. It was raised in the chemical industry
when companies applied for patents on various monomers and
copolymers. And it was argued originally in relation to patenting
any kind of software at all. But in all those cases, innovation in
the general industry actually increased.
</P>
<P>
   Patents give their owners rights to their innovations _ for 20
years from the date they file the application, currently. But then
patent owners must make their innovations public, which lets other
people build on them.
</P>
<P>
   Historically _ and I would argue it's no different now _ that
can give small companies and entrepreneurs some parity with large,
powerful business concerns, rather than the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   Q: But what about complaints in some quarters that companies are
getting patents for business methods that aren't really new?
</P>
<P>
   A: The patent office does not issue patents for old business
methods simply made electronic. it is partly our responsibility to
find evidence of existing methods _ what the patent office calls
prior art _ to make sure that doesn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   We have a very good collection of software prior art in a range
of disciplines, including business, and we continue to expand that
collection. We held hearings last year to make sure we were getting
access to prior art that exists outside of the patent process,
particularly as it relates to software.
</P>
<P>
   But people have pointed out that, in the past, when a lot of the
software was released, prior art was not available. And even now,
we don't have a consolidated, comprehensive database _ a one-stop
shop _ of prior art for software that embodies business methods, as
we do in other fields.
</P>
<P>
   In chemistry, for example, there's the Chem Abstracts, and in
medical technology there's Medline. If some party would develop
that, it would be a great help.
</P>
<P>
   But remember, too, that applicants must understand that they are
legally required to disclose all relevant prior art themselves. if
they do not, they risk invalidating their patent.

 c.2000 Harvard Business School Publishing

<TEXT>
<P>
   The possibility that the Earth's surface temperature is rising
caught the public's attention during the brutal summer of 1988. But
it wasn't until December 1997 that global warming began to assume a
prominent position on business executives' agendas. That's when
representatives of 160 nations, convened by the United Nations in
Kyoto, Japan, adopted a plan that would limit the amounts of carbon
dioxide and other so-called greenhouse gases being released into
the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   The Kyoto Protocol was accepted by representatives of the
industrial nations, but in most cases the full legislative bodies
each have to ratify the protocol. If ratified, the Kyoto Protocol
will require industrial nations to dramatically reduce emissions of
those gases by 2012.
</P>
<P>
   Most experts believe that human activity is contributing to an
increase in the Earth's average surface temperature. Scientists
also agree that an increase of as little as 2 degrees Fahrenheit is
likely to cause more severe storms, floods and droughts and to
accelerate the spread of disease.
</P>
<P>
   The Kyoto Protocol also sounded a warning to business leaders.
If large-scale reductions of emissions are mandated by law, many
manufacturers will have to dramatically change the way they
operate. They will also have to contend with shifts in demand, as
energy-efficient products overtake those that have long been
dominant.
</P>
<P>
   Where to begin? A good place to start is to look closely at the
risks _ and the opportunities _ associated with shifts in the
weather, potential regulatory changes and the battle over public
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   BAD WEATHER AHEAD
</P>
<P>
   Most of the extreme effects associated with climate change have
yet to emerge. Nevertheless, companies whose assets are directly
affected by the weather must start planning now.
</P>
<P>
   For example, insurance companies should adapt their predictive
models to ensure that their prices are accurate and to prevent
large financial losses because of payouts after unexpectedly severe
storms.
</P>
<P>
   To value waterfront properties correctly, real estate companies
will have to keep up with the latest thinking on changes in flood
patterns.
</P>
<P>
   For companies that sell seeds, risk management may mean
developing crops that can deliver higher yields in drier
conditions. For timber operations, it may mean spending more on
fire and pest management: Drier conditions increase the risk of
fire and make young trees weaker and more vulnerable to insect
attack.
</P>
<P>
   Over the long term, companies in a variety of industries may
experience shifting demand for their products as climate change
affects more people. For example, if tropical diseases migrate into
more industrialized nations, which is likely as temperatures rise,
pharmaceutical companies may see their markets expand.
</P>
<P>
   ANTICIPATING REGULATIONS
</P>
<P>
   Although it may be decades before people in Munich or
Minneapolis have to worry about tropical diseases, regulations
designed to curb climate change are already being proposed.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, government likely will impose additional taxes on
fossil-fuel consumption and require that cars and appliances use
less energy.
</P>
<P>
   Such regulatory programs will change asset values. Fleets of
trucks that get particularly low gas mileage will suffer. The
programs will also increase the value of goods and services such as
renewable-energy technology, process-control equipment and
telecommunications services _ for example, teleconferences that
substitute for transportation.
</P>
<P>
   As government regulatory schemes take shape, companies should
speak up and support programs that give them flexibility in
deciding how to reduce emissions.
</P>
<P>
   A command-and-control approach _ in which all sources would be
required to make proportional reductions in carbon-dioxide
emissions, regardless of the cost or difficulty _ could cost six
times as much as market-based solutions, according to the White
House Council of Economic Advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Astonishingly, most businesses have not actively promoted market
approaches as an alternative to command and control.
</P>
<P>
   One market approach is to tax emissions of greenhouse gases.
Companies could then decide if it's more efficient to pay the tax
or invest in reducing emissions.
</P>
<P>
   Another solution would be to set up a system of tradable
permits. Under such a system, the government allocates emissions
permits that companies can then buy and sell. Businesses that would
have to pay huge sums to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases
could instead buy permits from companies that are able to make the
required operating changes more cheaply.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever regulatory systems emerge, some companies stand to make
money from the changes. Makers of industrial process controls, such
as Honeywell and ABB, may be among the big winners. They are
already investing in sophisticated thermostats, equipment that
generates electricity more efficiently and other products and
services whose value will increase in a world of higher-cost
energy.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to understand why companies that make energy-efficient
products may support new regulations. But it's less clear why a
company such as General Motors has advocated government policies
that may make driving more expensive.
</P>
<P>
   GM and other large automakers such as Ford see climate change as
an opportunity to gain advantages over their less technologically
sophisticated rivals. That's why they are investing in cars that
run on a combination of gasoline and battery power and in fuel
cells. As the cost of driving conventional automobiles rises, Ford
and GM will dominate a new market and freeze out smaller
competitors for whom the required investments will be too great.
</P>
<P>
   Like automakers, energy companies stand to be hit hard by any
new policies that arise from the anticipation of global climate
change.
</P>
<P>
   BP Amoco has been a leader in supporting international efforts
to slow climate change. It has even announced voluntary cutbacks of
its own carbon dioxide output _ cutbacks similar to those required
under the Kyoto Protocol.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, BP Amoco believes that taking a leadership
position gives it a distinctive identity in the eyes of government
officials, scientists and environmental groups. That may mean
better access to government-controlled oil deposits and more
operating flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the company's experiments with emissions trading
are likely to give it clout at the negotiating table when
international regulatory frameworks are being devised. It will also
stimulate the company's employees to think more imaginatively _
and, in turn, feel valued.
</P>
<P>
   THE CLIMATE OF PUBLIC OPINION
</P>
<P>
   Probably the only thing more unpredictable than the weather is
public opinion. But good publicity can pay big dividends: As the
intensity and level of public interest increase, companies known to
have made early efforts to tackle climate change will have seats at
the negotiating table when regulations are being debated.
</P>
<P>
   For strategic reasons, some companies have chosen to be quiet
about their efforts. Honeywell and ABB would gain advantages from
more stringent emissions regulations, but they've had to be
cautious in their public statements on global warming. Some of
their biggest customers are fossil fuel and electricity companies.
</P>
<P>
   While good PR buzz on preventing or preparing for climate change
has its appeal, smart companies know it's simply bad business
practice to make investments, relocate resources or change
strategies solely for the sake of appearance. That's why David
Allen, who oversees BP Amoco's solar energy investments, is careful
to emphasize that the company's foray into solar ``is not just a
public relations sop. We would not do that. If you just paint
something, then people will in due course see it as paint.''
</P>
<P>
   The ability to think steadily and consistently about a topic as
complicated as climate change is a tough test of management acumen.
Some executives are meeting it head-on. Those who are not should
wonder why they aren't _ and so should their shareholders.

 &HT;    Rapper Zane's `World' widens
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pay attention, because this is how all that screaming major sex
symbol stuff starts: Lil' Zane is standing restlessly at the side
of the Lakewood Amphitheatre stage waiting for his moment. It's
June 17 and hip-hop station Hot 97-5 is marking its fifth year on
the air with a ``Birthday Bash.'' The 18-year-old rapper isn't
scheduled to perform, but he's flashing a row of gleaming teeth and
rocking from side to side nervously like he's the headliner.
</P>
<P>
   Finally the spotlight swings to him, and it happens.
</P>
<P>
   The plain white tank-top is pulled over his head. An hour and a
half each day of running, push-ups and sit-ups is revealed in
rippling fashion below his neck.
</P>
<P>
   The girls lose their minds.
</P>
<P>
   Two months after the bash, Zane blushes with both dimples at the
recollection of his, um, ``moment.'' Though, clearly, he is on the
brink of an even bigger one. His single with Atlanta R&AMP;B quartet
112, ``Callin' Me,'' debuted at No. 1 two months ago and held the
position for five weeks straight. (It's currently No. 2). And his
debut CD, ``Young World: The Future,'' is out today.
</P>
<P>
   At the obviously new Buckhead offices of his Worldwide
Entertainment label, in another white Calvin Klein tank top and
Karl Kani jeans with rhinestones down the side (that he insists no
one has yet), the rapper born Zane Copeland says, ``Staying fit is
important to me... and it is only part of the whole plan to get the
world to know `Z.'''
</P>
<P>
   But yes, he eventually affirms, having a newly chiseled chest
has also generated a nice buzz for R&AMP;B singers D'Angelo and Usher.
So it could work for him.
</P>
<P>
   The thing is, Usher is also an affecting singer who's sold
millions in large part because of the songwriting and production
talents of Atlantan Jermaine Dupri.
</P>
<P>
   Zane arrives with a comparable arsenal. Though the man in his
corner _ Kevin Wales _ doesn't write, the accomplished talent
scout, manager and president of Worldwide Entertainment is still
one of Atlanta's music forces.
</P>
<P>
   Aspiring to be in the business since he was 9, Zane introduced
himself to Wales when he was 11, backstage at a showcase featuring
his short-lived rap group Kronic. ``I was so serious about the
industry, even then, that I was reading liner notes to see who was
managing who and all of the people involved behind the scenes,'' he
recalls. ``And I saw K. Wales' name mentioned in the (preteen rap
act) Another Bad Creation CD and (R&AMP;B quartet) Boyz II Men. So I
just stepped to him.'' And they kept in contact.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, the former Cross Keys High School student made his bow
as featured rapper on the single ``Anywhere'' by the sophisticated
foursome 112 _ another Wales discovery. It hit the R&AMP;B Top 5 and
112 and Lil' Zane hit the road opening for pop superstar Whitney
Houston last year.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's booked as a solo act.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it's all making sense to me why this was the time to come
out,'' says Zane, whose debut is mostly a confidently delivered
party album. ``If I would have come out as a kid, like when I was
with Kronic (its album was never released), it would be hard for me
now. It's hard for people to adjust to kid acts. They don't want
them to grow up. But now I'm coming (out) like a young man.
Somebody the teenage girls who like (teen R&AMP;B singer) Sammie could
like, but mature enough that their moms may look twice, too.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, the women are after him,'' producer Dupri smirks.
</P>
<P>
   But you couldn't tell last Thursday: His college-age and older
female audience was playing it cool outside Buckhead's Plush, the
site of Zane's album release party. A remarkable feat considering
temperatures that day swelled to 99 degrees, and it still felt like
it at 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Around 12:30, when both levels of the club were packed, the
object of their desire appeared. Though two young women wearing the
ubiquitous black miniskirts and black bikini tops had not yet
snagged the orange wrist band that would admit them into the
velvet-roped VIP section, VIP No.1 purposefully headed over to
where they were standing. He thanked the two for coming out and
said he'd appreciate it if they would buy his CD.
</P>
<P>
   They don't scream or swoon, but keep their voices low and say
they're just glad to meet him.
</P>
<P>
   But you know by the way they're squeezing each other's hand when
he turns away, inside they are losing their minds.

 &HT;    Newsweek casts vote for `Survivor' on cover
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Al Gore and George W. Bush are scrambling to see who will be the
next leader of the free world, but the big question on many
Americans' minds is: ``What's going to happen on Wednesday's
`Survivor'?''
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the grand finale, Newsweek ($3.50) features the
final four on its cover (the photo is not only carefully staged;
hair and makeup stylists were brought in) and talks to Richard,
Rudy, Susan and Kelly about life on the island.
</P>
<P>
   Richard, the corporate trainer viewers either love or hate,
reveals that he has been getting marriage proposals ``and wonderful
naked photos of men. I mean, just insane amounts of positive
contact and two _ literally _ letters saying, `You're evil, I hope
you die.'''
</P>
<P>
   The other remaining cast members tell reporter Marc Peyser they
wouldn't have made it this far if they hadn't banded together.
``Besides living with these people, I had to work with them. So I
thought, 'Oh, boy, we're going to need some teamwork here,''' Susan
says. Susan also jokes that she and Kelly don't belong in Playboy
because they have tattoos. ``We belong in Hustler _and I hear Larry
Flynt pays more!''
</P>
<P>
   In Wednesday night's two-hour finale on CBS, the final council
will feature the last two players pleading their cases for the
$1million grand prize before the previous seven people who had been
voted off the island. More than 40 million viewers are expected to
tune in.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Trial and errors: What really happened in the Ray Lewis trial
for the Buckhead stabbings? Yes, we know all the defendants were
acquitted of the murder charges, but Atlanta ($3.50) writer Scott
Freeman has dug deeper to offer a compelling postmortem on the
high-profile case. Not only was the result a stunning defeat for
Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard, CNN legal analyst
compared Howard's performance to that of ``the bumbling Inspector
Clouseau of the Pink Panther movies.'' Lewis' attorney, Ed Garland,
blamed the fiasco on political pressures from the mayor's office _
a charge Mayor Bill Campbell denies. But, as Freeman points out,
the NFL star was arrested even though the lead detective did not
want to charge him. And Fulton County prosecutors apparently made a
crucial error in taking ``a street brawl and trying to turn it into
murder with malice....''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Talking the Talk: Editor Tina Brown seems to be on the right
track with Talk ($3.50). Maybe it's because the magazine is looking
a lot like Vanity Fair. The September issue features a cover story
on the celebrity of the month, Nicole Kidman; profiles of Tipper
Gore and Bush brothers George W. and Jeb; interviews with several
of Bill Clinton's past and present advisers about what the
president is really like; a juicy profile of Darcy Lapier, the
widow of Herbalife mogul Mark Hughes and former wife of Jean-Claude
Van Damme; and a compelling true-crime article about the Mark
Biddle murder-suicide in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Also worth a look is Rebecca Johnson's fascinating piece on the
dilemma of the single woman. Most, like 32-year-old Kristin
Whiting, want to get married, but they are much pickier than their
mothers. More and more women, Johnson writes, are choosing to
remain single rather than settling for a man who doesn't meet all
their requirements.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Unwedded bliss: The same theme of picky single women is
addressed in this week's Time ($3.50) with a cover shot of the
actresses from the TV series, ``Sex and the City.'' As reporter
Tamala M. Edwards notes, 37 years ago 83 percent of women 25 to 55
were married; by 1997 the figure had dropped to 65 percent. Women
no longer see marriage as a matter of survival. ``Let's face it,''
says novelist Melissa Bank. ``You don't just want a man in your
life. You only want a great man in your life.'' A different view is
offered by Walter Kirn, who complains that whatever it is that
women want in men, it changes annually. In previous generations,
Kirn writes, the only thing a man had to do to attract a woman was
to have a good job and use deodorant.

 &HT;    CRITICS DON'T UNDERSTAND AOL MERGER, TIME WARNER CHIEF SAYS
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASPEN, Colo. Time Warner Chairman Gerald M. Levin came out
swinging at his critics Monday, saying they don't understand the
nature of his company's proposed merger with America Online Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators and consumer advocates who worry about the creation
of a new monopoly have ``such (a) misperception about what this is
about,'' Levin said at a high-tech conference here.
</P>
<P>
   The merger is not intended to create a monopoly over what
content consumers can receive, but rather to vastly expand the
choices of programming and to enhance communication, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over time, there won't be any distinction'' between television
and the Internet, he said. ``Because in fact, what we are creating
is really the first Internet-powered media-communications company
of the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   By this fall, federal regulators will understand that and
approve the deal, he said. ``I don't think there are any regulatory
issues,'' he said. ``There are no business overlaps'' that would
put a choke hold on consumers.
</P>
<P>
   At the annual Aspen Summit, Levin spoke on the topic of
``convergence,'' the idea that TV, telephones and the Internet are
coming together. The conference is sponsored by the Progress &AMP;
Freedom Foundation, a non-profit organization that does research on
the digital revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Levin recounted how Time-Warner began experimenting with two-way
television long ago. ``In the early '90s, I was obsessed by the
notion of interactive television,'' he said. Though those early
tests didn't pan out technologically, they ``convinced me that
interactive, digital capability will eventually be what consumers
want.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in January 2000, he saw the chance to move toward
``convergence'' through a merger with AOL, the No.1 Internet
service provider.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very big idea,'' he said, ``a watershed,'' because it
would combine Time Warner's vast media and cable operations with
AOL's 23 million subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Levin will become chief executive of AOL Time Warner Inc. AOL's
leader, Steve Case, will serve as chairman.
</P>
<P>
   When he first evaluated the proposal to have AOL essentially buy
Time Warner, he was befuddled because the online upstart was much
smaller in terms of revenues.
</P>
<P>
   As he studied AOL's high-flying stock price, he said he had to
ask himself: ``Is that a fluke? Is there substance to these
valuations? So I had to take a long walk in the woods to try and
figure this out.''
</P>
<P>
   When he concluded the deal made sense, ``I was affirming the
value, and the sustainability and the growth trajectory that the
Internet was going to provide.''
</P>
<P>
   Levin says he is taking a gamble, but believes he will win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am betting my company _ a very significant company,
everything from Time Magazine to Gone with the Wind _ on this
reality of the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The merged company hopes to put itself at the center of the
convergence revolution with a black box about the size of a
briefcase. The box connects to a TV and a telephone line and allows
subscribers to a new service, called AOLTV, to surf the Internet
with a wireless keyboard write and send e-mail, and flash instant
messages on the same screen where they are watching television.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, AOL has been rolling out the service in eight test
markets from Baltimore to Sacramento. Within four years, nearly a
third of U.S. households will have access to interactive
television, according to projections by Jupiter Communications
Inc., a research firm.
</P>
<P>
   But critics of the merger fear that the future of
next-generation television could get locked up in one company's
hands.
</P>
<P>
   Many ``old media'' competitors, especially the Walt Disney Co.,
NBC Inc. and USA Networks Inc., have been warning the Federal
Communications Commission that AOL Time Warner would be able to use
its cable wires to force AOL TIme Warner services and programming
on captive consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Such arguments don't ``make any sense at all,'' Levin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a lot of commentary that we are going to take
Time Warner content and it's going to be exclusively available on
AOL,'' he said. But that would never happen ``because no one has a
monopoly on creativity. And the consumer is in charge, and the
consumer is going to go where there is the best material.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, AOL would never tie its online services too closely to
Time Warner because it wants to serve all Americans, whether their
neighborhoods are served by Time Warner cable or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``AOL's future, like the past and present of (Time Warner
networks) HBO, CNN, TBS, is to get on every platform possible,
whether that is cable, DSL, fixed wireless or satellite,'' Levin
said.
</P>
<P>
   After his speech, Levin dismissed questions about a recent news
story, appearing on Inside.com, that suggested AOL executives want
to sell off Time Warner's regulated cable operations to focus on
content and services. The story was ``inaccurate,'' he said, adding
that he has ``been in the business 30 years'' and has no plans to
leave cable.
</P>
<P>
   Levin was the architect of the 1990 merger between Time Inc. and
Warner Communications Inc. that created Time Warner, the world's
largest media company. He also was the driving force behind Time
Warner's takeover of Turner Broadcasting System.

 &HT;    Mosquitoes, those most aggravating of critters, are not only a
pest but a huge health threat
 &HT;    By M.A.J. McKenna
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   They're back.
</P>
<P>
   Swat.
</P>
<P>
   And they're hungry.
</P>
<P>
   Thwack.
</P>
<P>
   We were spared for a while, because of this summer's brutal
drought. But the heavy rainstorms that have been reviving local
lawns and gardens have brought back another summer staple:
mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   Whiiiiiiiiiiinnnnnnnnnne. ...
</P>
<P>
   Mosquitoes are much in the news these days, thanks to West Nile
virus, the bug-borne exotic disease that in one year spread from
Massachusetts to Maryland via migrating birds. Authorities say West
Nile hasn't been detected in Georgia and may not arrive until next
summer. Even when it does, the chance of its causing widespread
significant disease is slight: After 13 months in New York, the
nation's most populous city, public health specialists have found
only 65 people infected with it, seven of whom have died.
</P>
<P>
   But mosquitoes are still a problem locally. Here's a primer on
the South's best-known pest, and how to protect yourself.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Individually they're tiny; collectively they're huge.
</P>
<P>
   You do the math: A female house mosquito lives for several
months in warm weather. She lays up to 300 eggs at a time _ usually
on or near standing water _ roughly every third night of her life.
In summer, each egg can reach adulthood within a week and start the
reproductive cycle again. And the next generation isn't likely to
go far: Though some species such as salt marsh mosquitoes can
migrate up to 100 miles, the species most likely to transmit
disease in the South spends its life within 2 miles of its
birthplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a mosquito problem, it's not your neighbor who's
to blame in most cases,'' said Cathy Rebmann, who oversees
mosquito-borne diseases for the Georgia Division of Public Health.
``It's usually in your own yard.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  They're not just pests; they're parents.
</P>
<P>
   Only female mosquitoes bite, and only because they have to: They
need the extra boost of protein to lay eggs. (Male mosquitoes, who
don't need the protein, don't suck blood; they drink plant nectar.)
The bites itch because the mosquito pumps in an anti-coagulant
through her proboscis, the needlelike ``nose'' that she uses to
pierce your skin, to keep the blood flowing until she has finished
her meal.
</P>
<P>
   The eggs hatch within 24 hours into larvae, which spend the
first one to two weeks of their lives in water, breathing through a
siphon and eating microorganisms that float by. As they grow, the
larvae shed their skins; after the fourth molting, they morph into
pupae, tiny comma-shaped organisms that float on the water's
surface. After two days, the pupal skin splits and a damp adult
mosquito emerges. It spreads its wings to dry, finds a mate and, if
it's female, sets off in search of a snack. Males die soon after
mating.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  And you thought West Nile virus was the worst they could come
up with.
</P>
<P>
   West Nile, a Third World pathogen that arrived in New York last
summer, is just one of the disease organisms that hitch- hike in
mosquitoes on their way to infecting humans. Some others: St. Louis
encephalitis, Eastern equine encephalitis and La Crosse
encephalitis, which can cause potentially fatal swelling of the
brain; dengue, once known as ``breakbone fever'' for the severe
skeletal pain it can cause; yellow fever, which disables the liver;
Rift Valley fever, which can develop into encephalitis or
hemorrhagic fever; filariasis, in which millions of microscopic
worms infest the lymph nodes; and malaria, a parasitic disease that
kills more than 1 million people every year. Collectively,
mosquitoes cause more human deaths than any other creature.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  In case that wasn't bad enough ...
</P>
<P>
   There's a chance that mosquitoes can be held responsible for
sickle cell anemia _ and for helping to encourage the slave trade.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of Central Africa, where malaria is endemic, have
evolved a minor genetic mutation that protects them against the
mosquito-borne disease. According to some historians, that built-in
immunity made enslaved Africans particularly attractive to Southern
planters, because until this century malaria was endemic in the
Southern U.S. as well.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the mutation that confers malaria protection also
causes sickle cell trait and sickle cell anemia. In Africa, said
microbiologist Barbara Hanson of Canisius College in Buffalo, N.Y.,
it may save more lives than it takes, because the chance of
potentially fatal malaria infection is so high. In the United
States, where the immunity is unnecessary, we experience only its
negatives: the severe pain, anemia and stroke risk of sickle cell
disease.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  It used to be much worse than it is now.
</P>
<P>
   It's only in the past few decades that Southerners have had the
luxury of considering mosquitoes pests. Before window screens,
central air conditioning and municipal drainage programs, they were
a lethal threat; New Orleans was regularly immobilized by yellow
fever epidemics. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
originally the Communicable Disease Center, was founded in Atlanta
in 1946 largely to deal with mosquito-borne diseases; it replaced a
federal agency called the Office of Malaria Control in War Areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mosquito-transmitted diseases have been a part of our public
health picture from the founding of the country until not that long
ago,'' said Dr. Roger Nash of the CDC. ``It's only in recent years
that the U.S. population has been free of the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Unfortunately, it's going to get worse again.
</P>
<P>
   Public health authorities rely on winter to reduce the risk of
mosquito-borne diseases, because the low temperatures kill most of
the infected mosquitoes. But the likelihood of mosquitoes surviving
winter in the South and becoming a year-round disease threat is
rising as the planet gets warmer. A study done at Maastricht
University in the Netherlands predicts that Georgia's risk of
malaria will increase 1.7 times by 2020.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Can't we just bomb them with pesticides until every last one
of them is dead?
</P>
<P>
   ``It is generally considered bad form to talk about eradicating
another species simply to satisfy our own selfish desires,'' said
Laurence J. Zweibel, an assistant professor of biology at
Vanderbilt University whose laboratory studies the mosquitoes that
transmit malaria. ``They do fill an important niche in the ecology
of a region, but it's hard to get people to focus on the positives
of mosquitoes.''
</P>
<P>
   Mosquitoes are an important food source for bats, some birds _
swallows, purple martins _ and other, larger insects. Besides,
they're hard to get rid of. A complete mosquito control program,
such as the one that New York state is now conducting to rein in
West Nile virus, is expensive and labor-intensive, ranging from
searching out stagnant water where mosquitoes can breed, to
applying chemicals to eliminate larvae, to spraying at ground level
and from the air to destroy adult mosquitoes. And spraying
campaigns, including the one in New York, inevitably raise public
anxieties over pesticide exposure and collateral damage to fish and
birds.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  And the final answer is ... ?
</P>
<P>
   Personal prevention. In Georgia, mosquito control is a county
responsibility, and the amount done by each county varies with
budget and location. Chatham County, on the coast, runs
surveillance programs with sentinel chicken flocks and baited
mosquito traps. Fulton County has a mosquito hotline (404-730-5296)
whose chief mission is to give residents tips for eliminating
mosquitoes on their own.
</P>
<P>
   Advice provided by Fulton County and the Georgia Division of
Public Health boils down to: Don't let them breed, and don't let
them feed.

   PREVENTION TIPS
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Mosquitoes need water to complete their life cycle. Don't let
them have it. Empty any outdoor container that could hold stagnant
water, from a plant saucer to a tree stump. Containers that must
have water in them, such as birdbaths or dog dishes, should be
scrubbed and refilled twice a week. Gutters should be checked to
make sure they don't retain water. Fill low areas in the lawn or
yard where water may collect, and be sure not to allow water to
gather on the cover of a backyayd pool. If you have an ornamental
pond, stock it with fish that will eat mosquito larvae. Get rid of
old tires _ they're the No. 1 breeding habitat for mosquitoes
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Try not to be outside when mosquitoes do the most biting; for
many species, that's between dusk and nightfall. Wear long sleeves
and long pants, if possible, but wear repellent whether you cover
your skin or not. Check the label to be sure whether the repellent
you're using goes on skin or clothing, and whether it should be
used on children at all.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  DEET (N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide) is widely considered the
most effective repellent and is sold in many different
concentrations, in such popular products as Off, Cutter and
SkinTastic, but it is a potent chemical that can dissolve some
plastics, and some individuals develop rashes and headaches after
exposure to it. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency, concentrations of 15 percent or less are safe for children,
but it should not be used on hands or near the eyes or mouth.
Repellents used on children also should not be used under clothing,
and both skin and clothing should be washed with soap and water.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Once bitten, you want medications to prevent inflammation and
infection. To reduce swelling, pharmacists recommend ibuprofen or a
topical cream or ointment containing 1 percent hydrocortisone or 2
percent diphenhydramine hydrochloride. To stop infection, use
Neosporin or other anti-bacterial creams that contain neomycin,
polymyxin B and bacitracin.

<P>
   For the first time in their lives, 14 million members of
Generation Y get to vote this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Most won't.
</P>
<P>
   Election observers expect fewer than one-fourth of the
first-time-eligibles to be counted where it counts most, which is
at the polls.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, the year the voting age was lowered to 18, half of all
18- to 24-year-olds voted.
</P>
<P>
   To Jason Bellini, a 25-year-old Scottsdale Chaparral High School
in Scottsdale, Ariz., and Georgetown grad who currently works as a
correspondent for MTV's Choose or Lose election coverage, the
absentee youth vote will squander potential swing power in what
could be a close presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as 1992, young people were credited with helping
Bill Clinton find the White House.
</P>
<P>
   That year, the youth turnout was 43 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That year, the turnout among 65- to 74-year-olds was 70 percent.
The trend toward electorate shrinkage isn't limited to the young,
of course. In 1960, 63 percent of all eligible voters voted. In
1996, it was 49 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our generation could really be the jump ball in this
race,'' said Bellini, who spent last week at the Democratic
National Convention in Los Angeles and has been steadily
interviewing his demographic peers since the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the older edge of Gen Y and the younger edge of
Gen X won't be much of a factor this year, Bellini said, can't be
blamed on apathy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young people may answer a lot of our questions with, `I don't
know,' but we never hear them say `I don't care,''' he said. ``This
generation genuinely cares about the future of this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Fact: Young adults volunteer for civic and charity causes in
record numbers, making the conspicuous absence of under-30 voters -
a full one-fourth of the electorate - all the more vexing.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe even inexplicable. Still, we'll try.
</P>
<P>
   As an outreach effort, the following freewheeling youth-vote
discussion employs lots of assertive and edgy boldface type - a
typographical flourish with proven youth appeal.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, young people today say that comparing them to the
class of 1972 isn't quite fair.
</P>
<P>
   They had Nixon, the draft, widespread social unrest and
(beginitalic)Brandy (You're a Fine Girl) (enditalic)by Looking
Glass.
</P>
<P>
   Kids today have, what? That Napster deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politics isn't the life-and-death matter it was during the
Vietnam War,'' Bellini said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Well then, perhaps young people can't relate to hot-button
``issues'' of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Bellini has found that his peers can generate personal
passion over many of the issues that drive the presidential scrum,
including health care, abortion, education and gun control.
</P>
<P>
   Even Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Retirement planning would seem to be the furthest thing from a
20-year-old mind, but Nathan Sproul, executive director of the
Arizona Republican Party, said that George W. Bush's Social
Security plan - by which some contributions are freed up for
private investment - seems to be getting some traction with
Generation Dude.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young voters today know what a 401(k) plan is. They're
investing in the stock market,'' said Sproul, 28. ``There's a
different level of consciousness. This is the information age.''

the non-profit Rock the Vote (which encourages voter registration),
said Gens Y and X have come of age in an era of unprecedented
prosperity but also face the burdensome future of unprecedented
college loan debt.
</P>
<P>
   Many young people already have worked a lifetime's worth of
dead-end service jobs and may be dealing with the psychological
trauma of living up to what Byrne Fields (CQ: {ndash} PREFERS BOTH
LAST NAME) describes as ``the myth of the dot-com millionaire at
24.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in their lives, otherwise lived at the
commercial heart of our popular culture, young people are not the
entire focus of every marketer's attention, and they're miffed
about being ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Since the primaries, Rock the Vote had been advocating a
youth-centric debate between the presidential candidates, which
``would be an incredible first step in improving dialog,'' said
Byrne Fields, 30. Such an event seems ``not incredibly likely''
during the current campaign, though Al Gore last week agreed to
participate in an MTV ``town hall'' gabfest.
</P>
<P>
   Fine. To really weigh the campaigns' commitment to youth,
however, follow their money. Specifically, follow the television
advertising dollars, which for this campaign season will flow
primarily to networks that skew 35-plus or older, such as CBS and
CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Gealy, president of Acme Communications, which owns 10
youth-appeal network affiliates around the country - nine WB and
one UPN - would prefer it not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our stations skew 18 to 34,'' he said. ``But the campaigns
over advertise to the 50-plus audience and are totally missing the
younger demographics.''
</P>
<P>
   A demographic, it should be added for irony's sake, that defines
the term ``undecided.'' And, presumably, open to the power of
focused marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Half of the people we talk to won't commit to being a Democrat
or Republican,'' Bellini said. ``They don't want to be
categorized.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Besides, young voters aren't really being ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Though political coverage in the mainstream media may chill
younger news consumers, there's a wealth of resources available to
the demographic most likely to consume such digital data. A couple
of content-rich www-dots that cater exclusively to youngish
would-be voters include www.rockthevote.com and the Choose or Lose
subsite of www.mtv.com.
</P>
<P>
   A Rock the Vote bus, touring the country mixing politics and pop
music, is scheduled to visit Arizona State University on Aug. 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to make this stuff seem kind of fun,'' Byrne Fields
said.
</P>
<P>
   At the local level, the Arizona Secretary of State staffs a
special voter-outreach office that concentrates on wooing young
voters. One tactic: greeting cards, mailed to citizens turning 18,
reminding them that it's time to register. Another: public-service
radio announcements, some of which have run during Howard Stern's
brazen morning show.
</P>
<P>
   Young people haven't been indoctrinated in the ritual of voting.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the Arizona-born Kids Voting program has been
hand-holding today's 18-year-olds for more than a decade. Many
current first-time voters have been exposed to the voting process
through the program, which now encourages kids in 39 states to
visit polling places with their parents.
</P>
<P>
   No Arizona figures are available, but a Kansas study showed that
Kids Voting alums showed a slightly higher propensity to actually
vote once they turned 18 than their peers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Young people may be confused about or intimidated by the simple
mechanics of voting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of questions we get on the Rock the Vote Web site
have to do with process,'' Byrne Fields said. ```How do I go about
registering to vote? How do I get an absentee ballot?' During the
primaries, we were getting phone calls saying, `I want to vote
today, but I didn't register. What do I do?'''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Young people lack charismatic peer-group role models.
</P>
<P>
   They haven't met Lawrence Robinson, a recent graduate of Corona
del Sol High School and, at 19, the youngest Arizona delegate at
last week's Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson will attend Claremont McKenna College in California
this fall, but he departed for LA having done plenty of
interpersonal politicking.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of my friends are registered,'' he said with a laugh,
adding that most of them are registered Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   On a grander scale, the political parties have offered
26-year-old Karenna Gore Schiff and 24-year-old George P. Bush as
ticket touts.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, there is the Rock.
</P>
<P>
   Did any other fortysomething observer wonder, while watching the
Rock make his political debut, how we might've reacted had
Republican strategists offered Baron von Raschke as their youth
ambassador in 1972?
</P>
<P>
   Young people, distracted by rampant consumerism and whatnot,
don't care, period. Plus they're convinced that their one vote
doesn't count for much.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, they volunteer with gusto.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you work for Habitat for Humanity, you see the house being
built,'' Robinson explained.
</P>
<P>
   Added Bellini, ``(Young people) use their energy and optimism
where it will be most effective. For whatever reason, people in our
generation, in large numbers, don't feel that voting is going to
accomplish much.''
</P>
<P>
   There's still time. The registration deadline for the Nov. 7
election is Oct. 9.

<P>
   For the first time in their lives, 14 million members of
Generation Y get to vote this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Most won't.
</P>
<P>
   Election observers expect fewer than one-fourth of the
first-time-eligibles to be counted where it counts most, which is
at the polls.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, the year the voting age was lowered to 18, half of all
18- to 24-year-olds voted.
</P>
<P>
   To Jason Bellini, a 25-year-old Scottsdale Chaparral High School
in Scottsdale, Ariz., and Georgetown grad who currently works as a
correspondent for MTV's Choose or Lose election coverage, the
absentee youth vote will squander potential swing power in what
could be a close presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as 1992, young people were credited with helping
Bill Clinton find the White House.
</P>
<P>
   That year, the youth turnout was 43 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That year, the turnout among 65- to 74-year-olds was 70 percent.
The trend toward electorate shrinkage isn't limited to the young,
of course. In 1960, 63 percent of all eligible voters voted. In
1996, it was 49 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our generation could really be the jump ball in this
race,'' said Bellini, who spent last week at the Democratic
National Convention in Los Angeles and has been steadily
interviewing his demographic peers since the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the older edge of Gen Y and the younger edge of
Gen X won't be much of a factor this year, Bellini said, can't be
blamed on apathy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young people may answer a lot of our questions with, `I don't
know,' but we never hear them say `I don't care,''' he said. ``This
generation genuinely cares about the future of this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Fact: Young adults volunteer for civic and charity causes in
record numbers, making the conspicuous absence of under-30 voters -
a full one-fourth of the electorate - all the more vexing.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe even inexplicable. Still, we'll try.
</P>
<P>
   As an outreach effort, the following freewheeling youth-vote
discussion employs lots of assertive and edgy boldface type - a
typographical flourish with proven youth appeal.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, young people today say that comparing them to the
class of 1972 isn't quite fair.
</P>
<P>
   They had Nixon, the draft, widespread social unrest and
(beginitalic)Brandy (You're a Fine Girl) (enditalic)by Looking
Glass.
</P>
<P>
   Kids today have, what? That Napster deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politics isn't the life-and-death matter it was during the
Vietnam War,'' Bellini said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Well then, perhaps young people can't relate to hot-button
``issues'' of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Bellini has found that his peers can generate personal
passion over many of the issues that drive the presidential scrum,
including health care, abortion, education and gun control.
</P>
<P>
   Even Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Retirement planning would seem to be the furthest thing from a
20-year-old mind, but Nathan Sproul, executive director of the
Arizona Republican Party, said that George W. Bush's Social
Security plan - by which some contributions are freed up for
private investment - seems to be getting some traction with
Generation Dude.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young voters today know what a 401(k) plan is. They're
investing in the stock market,'' said Sproul, 28. ``There's a
different level of consciousness. This is the information age.''
</P>
<P>
   Alison Byrne Fields, creative director and chief strategist for
the non-profit Rock the Vote (which encourages voter registration),
said Gens Y and X have come of age in an era of unprecedented
prosperity but also face the burdensome future of unprecedented
college loan debt.
</P>
<P>
   Many young people already have worked a lifetime's worth of
dead-end service jobs and may be dealing with the psychological
trauma of living up to what Byrne Fields (CQ: {ndash} PREFERS BOTH
LAST NAME) describes as ``the myth of the dot-com millionaire at
24.''

You can turn your den into a tropical Pulau Tiga as easy as
castaway Kelly can balance on a log. Even easier if you already
live in a bug-infested dive.
<TEXT>
<P>
   All the decorating supplies you need can be picked up at two
stops: a hardware store and a novelty shop.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a ``Survivor'' shopping list:
</P>
<P>
   Sand _ If you go for the clean stuff, buy a bag of Play Sand for
$2 and spread it around on the front porch. But have guests leave
their shoes outside. You know how uncomfortable it can be when sand
gets in the wrong places. Just ask Richard.
</P>
<P>
   Mud _ For a more raucous affair, create a mud pit in the back
yard. Your guests can try out last week's Immunity Challenge, in
which the survivors lathered themselves up with mud, then scraped
it off into a bucket to see who could collect the most.
</P>
<P>
   Tiki lamps _ Pick up a pair of these ($4 a piece) just for the
power trip you'll get when you extinguish them at the end of the
night. For a reality check, mutter something like ``Fire represents
life on the island'' to see how stupid host Jeff Probst must feel
week after week.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Probst look-alike _ Surely you know one you can invite. If
not, rent one.
</P>
<P>
   Bone necklaces _ Give them out as party favors. Or better yet,
wear one and tell your guests you have immunity from cleanup duty.
</P>
<P>
   Coconut cups _ After 13 weeks of watching people eat and drink
from coconut shells, try it yourself. These alone are enough to
mentally transport you to the island; and at $3 a piece, a bargain.
But if you want to take the theme further, Southern Imports has
fishing nets, conch shells, plastic fish, artificial palm trees,
bamboo mats and fake rats. Maybe you can recycle some of the stuff
when ``Survivor II'' goes to the Outback.

COMMENTARY: ANSWERS `R' US 
</HEADLINE>
   By GAIL COLLINS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Well, it took a year, but we've finally got those presidential
candidates nominated. And thanks to the conventions, we now
understand that George W. Bush likes nothing better than to hang
around with members of minority groups, that Al Gore likes nothing
better than to hang around with Tipper, and that everybody in the
Reform Party is crazy.
</P>
<P>
   Some of us have been privileged to attend all these interesting
events, and I'm sure you're brimming with questions.
</P>
<P>
   Why do you think the four least likable people on ``Survivor''
made it to the finals? I can't find anybody to root for.
</P>
<P>
   In life as in politics, when people have significant
self-interest in the outcome of a contest, they very seldom worry
about who's the most adorable competitor. But I'm a little
disturbed that whenever I bring up the presidential election, you
start talking about reality-based TV.
</P>
<P>
   I definitely think voters would get more involved in the
presidential race if they knew that whoever loses would get his
torch snuffed out on election night.
</P>
<P>
   Do you know why the Democrats say the average family would only
save 62 cents a day under the Bush tax cut, and the Republicans say
it's thousands of dollars?
</P>
<P>
   I have a feeling you're going to tell me.
</P>
<P>
   It's because there are tons of families toward the bottom who
don't have any income taxes to cut. The Gore people always average
them in.
</P>
<P>
   How much would a typical family save under the Al Gore tax cut?
</P>
<P>
   Lots and lots. We are of course presuming the typical family is
a married couple whose children are ready to go to college and
whose parents are about to die and leave them a farm.
</P>
<P>
   How much would a really, really rich family save under the
George Bush tax cut?
</P>
<P>
   Republicans do not recognize the term ``really, really rich.''
However, successful entrepreneurs would get a pile.
</P>
<P>
   I used to think the way Gore keeps talking about health care was
pandering, but then I noticed that the most dimwitted person on the
``Survivor'' island was Sean the doctor. Don't the medical schools
screen their students anymore?
</P>
<P>
   Next month, you'll probably try to get me to talk about the
Olympics. Let me warn you now, I have trouble regarding
synchronized swimming as a sport.
</P>
<P>
   I already know who I'm going to vote for. Call me when the
leaves fall.
</P>
<P>
   Wait a minute. What about the national dialogue? This is a
community process by which we, the people, direct the course of the
country, not some poll about which roommate you want to see
banished from the on-camera commune.
</P>
<P>
   OK, the issue I'm really worried about is the polar ice cap. Did
you read the story about how it's melted?
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, this campaign reflects the fact that young people
don't vote and old people know that global warming isn't going to
really start hitting home until they're out of the picture. They're
way more worried about being stuck in an HMO where the only
physician on call is Sean from ``Survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm serious. My issue is that I want the North Pole frozen
again.
</P>
<P>
   I think it's safe to assume that deep in his heart, Al Gore is
even more worried about the ice cap than you are.
</P>
<P>
   What about George W. Bush?
</P>
<P>
   Bush thinks the jury is still out on global warming. Not to
mention evolution.
</P>
<P>
   I think the Bush campaign should talk more about the polar ice
cap and less about bringing morality back to the White House.
Everybody knows Al Gore would never do anything to hurt Tipper.
</P>
<P>
   Look, the Republicans believe the immorality started in 1992,
when Bill Clinton stole the election from George Bush with the help
of Ross Perot and big donors with murky Asian connections, then
turned around and stole their issues, and the credit for the
economy. They also blame the Clintons for everything that happened
in the '60s, including Nehru jackets. Obviously, you are not going
to wipe all that out by electing a monogamous Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   So they think Clinton is like Richard the devious corporate
consultant on ``Survivor''?
</P>
<P>
   I think they would be more likely to mention the Antichrist.

 By JESSIE MILLIGAN 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   My name is Jessie M., and I drink too much.
</P>
<P>
   I down a minimum of eight 8-ounce glasses of water a day, three
cups of nonfat milk, three mugs or glasses of green or black tea, a
serving of soy beverage, a glass of purple grape juice or an
occasional glass of red wine, a glass of calcium-fortified orange
juice and, now and then, some pineapple juice for the magnesium.
Plus coffee, although it is dehydrating.
</P>
<P>
   At first I would not admit it. I was in denial. Daily, I would
pour a pitcher full of 64 ounces of water and would not go to sleep
until it was drained. I bought colorful juice containers meant to
fit in lunch boxes and fat bottles of juice that stole most of the
refrigerator shelf space. I had to buy a special iced-tea pitcher
that fit on the refrigerator-door shelf, and nightly I would brew
green tea with a dollop of North Dallas Honey Co. honey and a
squeeze of fresh lemon.
</P>
<P>
   I became a woman obsessed.
</P>
<P>
   It started one day while I was smoking a cigarette and reading
Prevention magazine. Sadly, I am not making this up. While reading,
I suffered a terrible collision of ideas. I had a habit bad for my
health. I wanted to be healthy.
</P>
<P>
   So I arrived at a conclusion: I would start drinking more water.
</P>
<P>
   One drink led to another. I included milk for the calcium, tea
for the phytonutrients, although to this day I'm not sure what a
phytonutrient is. This went on for years. As I aged, I included soy
beverages, believing this would somehow ease me into menopause,
plus fight cancer. Then OJ manufacturers began adding calcium to
their product. I found this irresistible. My bones will thank me.
Magnesium helps absorb calcium, so I started on pineapple juice.
Grape juice or wine helps prevent clogged arteries. I do a little
cranberry now and then as well. You may see where this is heading.
I've had to clench my teeth to stop myself from getting involved
with wheatgrass smoothies. If researchers find one more healthy
thing to drink, I may explode.
</P>
<P>
   One night, I did what thousands of other people around the world
do _ I decided to solve my problem by logging onto the Internet and
searching for my own solution.
</P>
<P>
   I checked an Internet search engine for the phrase ``eight
glasses a day.'' I received 92,400 responses, which roughly
compares with the number of times I visit the bathroom in a given
week. A good portion of those trips are in the middle of the night.
</P>
<P>
   I searched and searched on Web sites. As night fell and the
house grew dark, I hunched before the glowing computer screen.
Then, finally, insight flashed while I peered at www.mayohealth.org
and the health page at www.msn.com.
</P>
<P>
   Now I have a new plan.
</P>
<P>
   Milk, juices and other beverages are about 90 percent water. So
those drinks don't have to be added on top of my 64 fluid ounces of
water. Those healthy beverages can be included, along with clear
water, as part of my daily fluid consumption. Aha!
</P>
<P>
   Plain water must be part of the diet. It is the best thing to
drink because our bodies are about half water. We are not half Diet
Coke, nor are we half Dr Pepper, although we may feel related. We
need to get plain water into our watery selves, but not to the
point that we slosh when we walk.
</P>
<P>
   I can substitute solid food for my calcium and magnesium, and
add more veggies and fruit to my diet to make up for the loss of
green tea.
</P>
<P>
   I understand that I cannot include coffee or alcohol when I add
up the fluid ounces I consume because both are dehydrating. I
understand I cannot include heavily sweetened tea, nor can I
include sodas or any other beverage that would not be nourishing.
</P>
<P>
   I will drink a glass of OJ, a glass of water and a cup of coffee
before work, if I get up early enough. I will drink two 16-ounce
bottles of water at work. I will drink a glass of water when I get
home in the evening, then have a cool glass of tea or a warm mug of
milk.
</P>
<P>
   On my days off, when I'm at home, what the heck, I'll add
another bottle of water or two.
</P>

 &HT;    Slocum chooses Farris to start at QB against Notre Dame
 &HT;    By Randy Riggs
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas - Texas A&AMP;M made it official on Monday. Sophomore
Mark Farris might not have Colby Freeman's feet or Vance Smith's
arm, but he does have something the other two don't, at least for
now: the Aggies' starting quarterback job.
</P>
<P>
   Surprised? Didn't think so.
</P>
<P>
   Coach R.C. Slocum, already busy putting out fires although the
football season is still about two weeks away, played it safe in
naming Farris as the starter for the Sept. 2 opener at Notre Dame.
Not that there's anything wrong with that.
</P>
<P>
   The 25-year-old Farris might not be blessed with the physical
skills of the other two, but Slocum is counting on Farris' maturity
to help steady A&AMP;M. The last thing the Aggies need when they open
on the Irish's hallowed ground is for the rifle-armed Smith to
launch one that only Touchdown Jesus could catch, or for Freeman, a
redshirt freshman, to suffer extreme fright on a stage a tad bit
larger than the one on which he starred at Brownwood.
</P>
<P>
   So Slocum made it official Monday. There were several reasons
for doing so, not the least of which is the Aggies already have
been beset by several major injuries. Those injuries include one to
projected starting offensive guard Billy Yates, expected to miss
some of the season after breaking his lower leg in a scrimmage
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The injuries have made it hard for continuity,'' Slocum said.
``That's something we can't do anything about. On top of that, we
were playing three quarterbacks, and that's something I can do
something about.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to solidify things so one guy could get all the
repetitions with the first-team offense,'' he added. ``It's really
hard to rotate all three to get equal reps, and I didn't want to
wait until game week and all the distractions of that. I didn't
want to be standing on the sideline with three guys anxious to see
who's going out on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the best time to get the air cleared and the offense
oiled up so when we go to Notre Dame there'll be no question as to
who's our starting quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   In naming Farris the starter, the Aggies have entrusted the
offense to a player who was rated one of the state's top
quarterback prospects as a senior at Angleton High School. Of
course, that was in 1993, before he opted for a pro baseball career
that reached the Double-A level in the Pittsburgh Pirates'
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to A&AMP;M last season, he completed just six of 16 passes
in five brief appearances _ hardly impressive, but similar to
Smith's resume (five of 14 in five games) and more than Freeman's.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job is still the same,'' Farris said. ``I do the very best
I can on the field and let the coaches decide who starts, and who
gets to play. I have to keep working hard and doing my best.''
</P>
<P>
   Slocum said Smith and Freeman will split time at No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Slocum certainly needs someone to step up. The Aggie faithful
are hopeful, as always, but restless after last year's four-loss
season, including three defeats by a cumulative score of 112-6. A&AMP;M
also is unranked in The Associated Press preseason poll, a rarity
during Slocum's 12-year tenure as head coach.
</P>
<P>
   The veteran coach says he named Farris not because he's the safe
choice, but because he's the best choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We picked Mark because of overall performance in the spring
and summer,'' Slocum said. ``With all the things we like to do with
our offense, he gives us the best chance. It was very close ...
very close.''
</P>
<P>
   But also very predictable.
</P>
<P>
   His worst nightmare
</P>
<P>
   Coach Kevin Steele's first year at Baylor hasn't exactly been a
picnic, but nothing has compared to what occurred in practice Aug.
12.
</P>
<P>
   During an inside run drill, defensive tackle Brandon Thompson
crumpled to the ground with a neck injury. He was paralyzed from
the waist down for 15 or 20 minutes, Steele said.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, a senior from Arlington Heights, was released from a
Waco hospital Wednesday after tests determined he suffered no
structural damage to his spinal cord. Further tests await, and
whether the former tight end plays again is uncertain, Steele said,
although he has returned to practice as an observer.
</P>
<P>
   Steele said seeing Thompson on his feet again, however, is one
of the best sights he's seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one of the most amazing things I've ever been
through,'' he said. ``I've never felt that way as a coach. No loss
or mistake has ever made me feel like that. It's very frightening,
because it's not in your hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Not-so-solid Gold(en)
</P>
<P>
   An Oklahoma State product made the highlight films last week _
much to Bob Simmons' chagrin.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' coach didn't know whether to be amused or bemused
by the play of former OSU linebacker Jack Golden. A free-agent
rookie for the New York Giants, Golden got his 15 seconds of fame
on Aug. 11 against Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   With the Giants trying to preserve a three-point lead with time
running out, Golden tackled teammate Fred Lewis in the end zone to
prevent him from running out an interception as time expired. The
hit forced a fumble, though, which the Jaguars recovered in the end
zone for a 16-13 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I thought it was, uh, different,'' said Simmons, trying
to be diplomatic. ``I understand what he was trying to do. Jack's a
very emotional player, but you just don't do that sort of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Simmons said he hasn't discussed the play with Golden _ yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when he comes down here, it will be a topic of
conversation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That might be awhile. Golden has impressed the Giants with his
special-teams play and is expected to make the roster. Lewis,
ironically, was cut Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Leach: I'm staying
</P>
<P>
   Texas Tech Coach Mike Leach, a Brigham Young graduate, said he
was so stunned by BYU Coach LaVell Edwards' announcement that he'll
retire after this season that it didn't occur to him that he might
be considered a candidate to replace the 69-year-old legend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked by it,'' he said. ``It caught me by surprise to
the extent that I didn't even think of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rest easy, Red Raider fans. Tech's first-year coach says he
won't see Lubbock in his rear-view mirror.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in a great situation here and I plan to stay here,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M fans attending road games at Notre Dame, Iowa State and
Oklahoma State, where there are no local affiliates on the radio
network, will be able to hear the Aggie broadcast at the lower end
of the FM band thanks to a low-wattage transmitter at the stadiums.
... Colorado co-defensive coordinator Tom McMahon, 51, has a
malignant tumor on his trachea but has missed only one practice
since the Buffs reported for fall drills despite undergoing
chemotherapy and radiation treatments. ... Top-ranked Nebraska is
blessed with a sizeable stable of I-backs including Dan Alexander
and Correll Buckhalter, but attracting considerable media attention
is junior-college transfer Thunder Collins. ``I think part of that
comes from his name,'' Coach Frank Solich speculated. ``I think the
media is enthralled by that.'' And yes, that's his real first name.

 &HT;    SLATER, AIRLINES VOW TO RELIEVE AIR TRAVEL CHOKE POINTS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Transportation Secretary Rodney E. Slater announced
plans Monday to relieve some of the nation's air traffic choke
points and to give passengers better information about flight
delays and cancellations.
</P>
<P>
   Slater, speaking after an emergency meeting with top airline
executives, called for an ``airline quality'' task force to come up
with a more comprehensive report within 90 days.
</P>
<P>
   As for the immediate problems at the nation's overtaxed
airports, Slater said that the greatest hope for relief is the
coming end of the vacation season, which has jammed flights and
helped raise the passenger total toward an expected record of 670
million this year.
</P>
<P>
   Amid unusually high numbers of electrical storms and labor
problems at United Airlines, the carriers cancelled or delayed
thousands of flights this summer, including 44,000 just last month.
</P>
<P>
   Slater also acknowledged problems with the air traffic system,
saying, ``We don't say everything works well when the weather is
clear.'' He made repeated appeals for more money to modernize
airports, add runways and improve the control system.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Slater hailed what he called a ``cooperative
spirit'' from the emergency meeting. American Airlines, Delta Air
Lines, US Airways, Alaska Air Lines, America West, and Trans World
Airlines all sent their chief executive officers.
</P>
<P>
   United, Southwest and Northwest airlines also sent
representatives, as did top airline worker unions. Slater has more
meetings scheduled this week with consumers and smaller air
carriers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about a collective response,'' Slater said after the
closed session, which lasted nearly an hour longer than the two
hours scheduled. He declined to criticize the industry, which more
than six months ago volunteered to make major improvements in
customer service in order to head off a movement in Congress to
impose a mandatory passenger rights bill.
</P>
<P>
   Slater said that results so far have been ``mixed'' in the
voluntary effort. Airline officials repeated their earlier promises
to share more details about flights with the customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can do a better job,'' acknowledged American Airlines chief
Donald J. Carty, who said that information about flight delays
often does not reach the employees who deal with passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Aviation Administration head Jane Garvey outlined a plan
for using air space more efficiently in the most crowded areas of
the Eastern United States, including the ``choke points'' around
Atlanta, Boston, New York, New Jersey, Washington's Dulles airport
and Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would use varying altitudes and angles for landing and
takeoff in these zones, she said. About half the air space
management changes could be immediate, with others planned for the
future.
</P>
<P>
   Garvey said there has been ``enormous progress'' in modernizing
the computerized air traffic control system, which has long been
called antiquated. However, she said she could not estimate when
most of the overhaul would be complete.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, the president of the American Automobile
Association became the latest leader in the travel industry to
suggest privatizing the air traffic control system.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to the Atlanta Rotary Club, Robert L. Darbelnet called
for privatizing the air traffic control system and urged Congress
to fully fund aviation improvements, the Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about that plan, Slater said he preferred reorganizing the
federal government's system to make it more businesslike.

 &HT;    Handling of sub crisis imperil's Putin's political standing,
expert says
 &HT;    By Don Melvin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - Vladimir Putin was elected president of Russia in
March largely because of his reputation as a decisive and competent
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   But that reputation _ and Putin's political standing _ are at
risk following the president's handling of the crisis surrounding
the sinking of the Kursk nuclear submarine, an Emory University
expert said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Putin is coming under ``intense criticism for not coming back
from vacation to handle the crisis personally,'' and for being slow
to accept international help in trying to rescue the sub's crew,
said Tom Remington, an Emory political science professor and an
expert on Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's reputation may be damaged further because it appears
that some of the information Russian authorities disseminated after
the accident was false, Remington said.
</P>
<P>
   Russian spokesmen initially said the sub sank as the result of a
collision, but Western experts said explosions were detected in the
area. And Russian spokesmen also said that tapping had been heard
coming from inside the sub, an assertion equally doubted by Western
experts, who say no such tapping would have been audible.
</P>
<P>
   Remington said the situation is analogous to that faced in 1986
by former President Mikhail Gorbachev, who was fed misleading
information after a nuclear reactor at Chernobyl exploded.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly possible that the military was not giving Putin
correct information,'' Remington said.
</P>
<P>
   But that would not get the president off the hook, Remington
said, because it would show that, ``not only did he make the wrong
call, but it indicates that he is not fully in command of his own
military.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin's reputation for decisiveness and competence was built on
his firm prosecution of the war in the breakaway republic of
Chechnya when he was prime minister under President Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   But even that seeming success now appears in danger. Russia's
military has not won the complete victory that was promised, and
bands of Chechen rebels regularly ambush Russian troops.
</P>
<P>
   Putin was elected to a four-year term in March, and he still has
time to recover. For one thing, Remington said, he could use the
poor handling of the submarine crisis as a reason to once again act
decisively _ by firing people and asserting control over the
military.
</P>
<P>
   Remington's guess is that heads will roll.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has to distance himself from the chain of incompetence and
cover-ups,'' Remington said.
</P>
<P>
   And Putin is expected to launch an economic initiative this fall
aimed at reforming an economy badly in need of it. Success in that
endeavor could inspire confidence, Remington said, while this or
other failures of leadership could make cooperation harder to come
by and future successes harder to achieve.
</P>
<P>
   Enough time remains in Putin's term for either trend to develop.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could still have major policy successes _ or failures,''
Remington said.

   Bodies of water
</P>
<P>
   The human body is, on the average, 50 percent water. Parts of us
are made up of even more water.
</P>
<P>
   Brain, 85 percent water
</P>
<P>
   Lean muscle, 80 percent water
</P>
<P>
   Blood, 80 percent water
</P>
<P>
   Fat, 25 percent water
</P>
<P>
   Bone, 22 percent water

<P>
   Water works
</P>
<P>
   Water
</P>
<P>
   _ regulates body temperature
</P>
<P>
   _ removes wastes
</P>
<P>
   _ carries nutrients and oxygen to cells
</P>
<P>
   _ cushions joints
</P>
<P>
   _ lessens the burden on kidneys and liver
</P>
<P>
   Water may prevent certain diseases. It can prevent kidney
stones, and one study has shown that women who drank more than five
glasses of water a day had a risk of colon cancer that was 45
percent less than those who drank two or fewer glasses a day.
</P>
<P>
   The International Bottled Water Association says its surveys
show Americans who don't drink enough water complain of at least
one of the following symptoms: frequent tiredness, dry or itchy
skin, headaches, indigestion or lapses in concentration.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   How much to drink?
</P>
<P>
   Divide your weight in half. The answer is the approximate
minimum number of fluid ounces you should drink daily.
</P>
<P>
   The common ``eight glasses of day'' or 64 fluid ounces is the
minimum amount a person who weighs 128 pounds should drink. Weigh
more, drink more.
</P>
<P>
   Why so much? The ``average'' person loses about 10 cups of water
a day to body functions.
</P>
<P>
   Three to four cups of water are derived each day from solid
foods. Because that's such a rough estimate, dietitians say it is
better to count only fluids when figuring your daily intake.
</P>
<P>
   When counting fluids, don't include coffee, caffeinated
beverages or alcohol. They are dehydrating. Milk, juice and a
low-caffeine tea, such as green tea, are about 90 percent water, so
they can be included in a calculation of daily fluid intake.
Nonetheless, daily fluids should include plain water.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   When to drink more?
</P>
<P>
   Increase water intake when it is hot, humid or cold, or when you
are visiting a higher altitude. Water is a regulator that helps our
bodies adjust to climatic change.
</P>
<P>
   Increase water intake as physical activity increases. Drink
water before, during and after exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Sports drinks usually aren't necessary unless you are working
very hard for 90 minutes straight or, if it is particularly hot,
for 60 minutes straight. Otherwise, you may be taking in more
sodium than you need.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   What time of day?
</P>
<P>
   If you are thirsty, you've already started to dehydrate.
Dietitians say it's best to keep the body regularly rehydrated
throughout the day. That means a glass of water upon rising,
several throughout the day, and one before you go to bed so that
cellular function continues properly throughout the night.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Easy ice water
</P>
<P>
   Fill a water bottle half full of water. Place it in the freezer
overnight. In the morning, top it off with fresh water. You'll have
ice water, and it's a lot easier than trying to get ice cubes into
the bottle!
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Why we don't drink enough water
</P>
<P>
   More than half of Americans say they don't drink eight glasses
of water a day, according to a survey by the International Bottled
Water Association.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons they gave:
</P>
<P>
   Too busy _ 21 percent
</P>
<P>
   Don't like the taste _ 13 percent
</P>
<P>
   Prefer other beverages _ 12 percent
</P>
<P>
   Forgot _ 10 percent
</P>
<P>
   Not feeling thirsty _ 8 percent
</P>
<P>
   No bottled water available _ 4 percent
</P>
<P>
   Can't leave their desks for a ``hydration break'' _ 4 percent
</P>
<P>
   Worry about too many restroom breaks _ 2 percent
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Water safety
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration regulates bottled water.
Nonetheless, the Natural Resources Defense Council studied 103
brands of bottled water, and in March 1999 announced that a third
of those contained at least one sample of bacteria or a chemical
that exceeded the industry guidelines, although none so harmful as
to cause a recall.
</P>
<P>
   Also, we can contaminate bottled water ourselves. The Mayo
Clinic says every time you drink from a bottle of water, the
bacteria in your mouth contaminates the water in the bottle. Wash
water bottles in hot, soapy water or run them through the
dishwasher before using them again, the clinic advises.
</P>
<P>
   The Environmental Protection Agency regulates the purity and
safety of tap water. It requires public suppliers to notify
residents if tap water is unsafe.
</P>
<P>
   Yet breakouts of water-borne disease occur now and then. The
worst in this country was in 1993 in Milwaukee, where 100 people
died and 403,000 were reported sickened with intestinal disease
when the parasite cryptosporidium got into the city's water supply.
The parasite is resistant to chlorine and ordinary filters.
</P>
<P>
   Cryptosporidium is a parasite from the intestines of
warm-blooded animals. Milwaukee's outbreak is believed to have been
caused from runoff from slaughterhouses into a lake that holds the
city water supply.

 By ROBERT J. VICKERS

<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ When a presidential candidate comes campaigning to
your town, it's an opportunity for people to wave flags, cheer
speeches and show their support.
</P>
<P>
   Advance notice of a presidential candidate's campaign stop _
sometimes as little as 24 hours _ rarely leaves local organizers
much time to prepare. They have to show extreme flexibility,
resourcefulness and patience in arranging a rally, plant tour or
fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   When Cuyahoga Democratic Chairman Jimmy Dimora convinced Al
Gore's campaign last month that the vice president had not spent
enough time campaigning in northeast Ohio, the Gore campaign
quickly scheduled a trip to Cleveland, starting a familiar domino
effect for Ohio Democratic Party Executive Director Cindy
Marizette.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first response is to hang up the phone and swear really
loud,'' Marizette said. ``I drop everything I'm doing. It doesn't
matter if the election is tomorrow or two months from now, whatever
I'm working on is put on hold until the visit is completed.''
</P>
<P>
   Both parties use the same game plan. Each campaign stop usually
targets a particular voting group _ such as senior citizens,
minorities or veterans _ to emphasize a proposal or political
position.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to find a location that dovetails with the message,''
said Robert Paduchik, Ohio campaign manager for Texas Gov. George
W. Bush's presidential campaign. ``That's a challenge sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   National campaign managers both suggest and solicit campaign
stop locations, which must meet a variety of space and safety
requirements set by campaign advance teams and the Secret Service.
</P>
<P>
   Once the site passes inspection for capacity and security,
arrangements have to be made for volunteers, food, signs, lighting
and staging. Glitches are inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Marizette had to integrate a surprise visit from
the vice president into a Democratic celebration that had been
planned before Gore decided to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to figure out how to get his group in and out before our
regular guests arrived,'' she said. ``Changes are just something I
expect to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign can be the source of more nerve-racking
complications.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the problems when President Bush made a campaign stop
in September 1992 at the Lake County Fairgrounds and the theme of
his speech changed four times.
</P>
<P>
   The changes had little impact on the public face of the
campaign, but it sent local campaign workers into a tizzy.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign needed an audience of 500 plus, and it was up to
Jim Trakas, Bush's 1992 Cuyahoga County campaign coordinator, to
make sure the cameras saw faces that matched the message.
</P>
<P>
   ``First it was education, so we had to get school kids for the
crowd,'' said Trakas. Calls went out to principals, superintendents
and Republican mayors to help find children, because school wasn't
in session.
</P>
<P>
   They were still trying to round up a young audience when
campaign strategists changed the topic to military policy. That
meant Trakas had to locate veterans while telling the school kids
they were no longer needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you tell people they're going to meet the president and
the next day call back and say they're not, they're not happy,''
Trakas said.
</P>
<P>
   No sooner were the vets invited than Trakas learned he would
have to disappoint them as well. Now the theme was higher
education, and college students were the audience of choice. New
calls to GOP clubs at John Carroll and Cleveland State universities
collected the necessary bodies, but their role was doomed as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally they decided on job creation,'' Trakas said, and
people involved in job training programs were rounded up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were pretty good soldiers,'' he said of the changes local
party workers went through. ``We were honored just to have the
president coming, so we didn't mention any of our frustration.''
</P>
<P>
   Any organizer, Democrat or Republican, can tell similar tales in
any state where a bunch of electoral votes are up for grabs. The
ability to make last-minute arrangements will be at a premium for
both parties.
</P>
<P>
   While locals work out local details, a national campaign advance
team solves other problems, like determining how long it takes to
drive from the airport to the rally site.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's eight-member team usually arrives as much as a week
before the event. Gore's team usually spends about four days in the
host area.
</P>
<P>
   The advance teams work out of the local party offices and often
stay in downtown hotels, but sometimes the local supporters place
national campaign workers in the homes of strangers willing to
house them to save money.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   Both the candidate and the local volunteers are hoping for good
publicity from a campaign stop, but that doesn't always happen.
Sometimes, rallies are ``stepped on by a bigger story,'' or
complicated by delays, Paduchik said. ``You can't control that
stuff at all. You just have to be able to roll with the punches.''
</P>
<P>
   Last November mechanical problems delayed Gov. Bush's plane on a
flight from Michigan. Paduchik's job had been to get a crowd to
Cleveland Hopkins International Airport. Now he had to keep them
from leaving.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   By the time a candidate arrives and starts working the crowd,
local organizers can relax a little and look on like coaches
watching the execution of their prize plays. But life doesn't
return to normal until the candidate is off to the next stop on the
campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am so relieved to see him taking off,'' Marizette said of
Gore. ``It usually takes me a day or two to recover mentally behind
a visit like that. It's a stressful experience, but it's rewarding
because I know it's been successful and I've done my job.''

 ATTENTION EDITORS: With four photos, of Angel Padilla (NNS1), Maria

 By MICHELE M. MELENDEZ

<TEXT>
<P>
   LORAIN, Ohio _ Angel and Maria Padilla live through the words of
their children.
</P>
<P>
   At ages 13 and 10, their boys speak on their parents' behalf
with doctors and lawyers. They read the mail and answer the phone.
They translate the television news and bottles of prescription
medication. They are their parents' link to the world, because
their parents don't speak English.
</P>
<P>
   Those scenes play across the country among families in which
parents haven't learned English. The adults rely on their children.
In effect, the children run the household, and the arrangement can
leave parents in despair, children in conflict and family roles in
shambles.
</P>
<P>
   ``A really wide cultural gap is developing between the first
generation immigrants and their children,'' said Jason Felch, youth
program director at the International Institute of San Francisco.
``Young people come in and pick up the language and learn the
culture faster than their parents do. Then, you end up having
(children) put into the position of negotiating with the landlord,
answering the door, opening the mail, translating.''
</P>
<P>
   The Padillas have lived in the United States off and on since
1991. In 1996, they moved from their native Puerto Rico to this
city of 70,000 about 30 miles west of Cleveland. Maria, 45, and
Angel, 65, have medical problems and said they were in search of a
place where they could obtain better treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly one in 10 people in the United States was born elsewhere,
according to census estimates for 1998, the latest available.
</P>
<P>
   The 1990 census offers the most recent figures on language
spoken at home. That year, the primary language of about 14 percent
of the country's population was something other than English. The
children were more likely able to speak English _ 86 percent,
compared with 77 percent of adults.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that children have natural advantages over their
parents in learning a second language.
</P>
<P>
   Even adults who truly want to learn English, and who enroll in
classes to do so, have a tough time because they often revert to
their native language at home and avoid situations where they would
be forced to speak English, said Bonnie Mizenko, director of the
Virginia Beach Adult Learning Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a matter of practice and exposure,'' she said. ``The
young are still impressionable. They are truly bilingual. The
adults have a choice about what they speak, and they tend to
isolate themselves. It's about being anxious about making mistakes
and feeling comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   The Padillas' sons, Felix Antonio Rollet, 13, and Felix Juan
Rollet, 10, are Maria's from a prior relationship, but consider
Angel Padilla their father. They speak English as well as American
boys their age, and said they're used to their interpreting duties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought translating for my parents was such a big
deal,'' Felix Juan said.
</P>
<P>
   That's because they do it every day, even on the roughest days.
</P>
<P>
   When Angel severely injured his back in an automobile crash,
needing 46 stitches and four metal disks, his sons had to
translate. When the family hired a lawyer to settle an insurance
claim, the boys tried to decipher the legal terminology. When the
younger son was failing in school, the older son did the talking
with his teacher. They had no choice, the Padillas said, because
the hospital, the lawyer's office and the school could not provide
professional translators.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking through an interpreter, both parents expressed sorrow
for depending on their boys so much.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me feel bad, because there are things children
shouldn't know about or be involved with,'' Angel Padilla said.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, he said, he doesn't always get all the information he
needs to make informed decisions, because the children can't
translate concepts they don't understand.
</P>
<P>
   It's a strange position for both children and parents, a bizarre
role reversal. At a young age, children are forced to learn adult
responsibilities; their parents' authority wavers as they become
dependent on their young children.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an issue that happens with every family we see,'' said
Jane Cook, director of Refugee and Immigration Services of the
Catholic Diocese of Virginia in Norfolk. ``We tell them this is
something that will happen, so that when it does happen they don't
get that upset and they can take steps to prepare for it, such as
telling their children, `You still have to do your chores,' `You
still have to go to school.'''
</P>
<P>
   Angel Padilla said he already gets flak from his older son when
it comes to helping clean the house: ``He says, `I've been helping
you all day (by translating). Isn't that enough?'''
</P>
<P>
   Some adults who depend on children to translate can end up
struggling for control of the family. Children growing up in this
country might favor American independence and self-reliance over
the cultural values of their parents emphasizing family honor and
unity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids, even though they're young, they feel strong,'' said
Ngy Hul, director of the Refugee Federation Service Center in
Seattle. ``They are the head of the household. When the parents
want to discipline the children, the children say, `Hey, you depend
on me. What do YOU know?'''
</P>
<P>
   Hul said a Cambodian man dependent on his 12-year-old grandson's
English skills sought help from the center, because the boy had
pulled a gun on him. The man had called the police on his grandson.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me he wanted his grandson to die, because if he died,
he'd cry for a month. But if (the grandson) lived, he'd suffer
forever,'' Hul said.
</P>
<P>
   The family dynamic _ the way family members relate to each other
_ shifts when the children are so involved with the adult
responsibilities, said Thanh Son (Lisa) Nguyen, director at the
Center for Multicultural and Multigenerational Mental Health
Services in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The children might lose respect for the parents, and the
parents feel like they're powerless,'' she said. ``They feel the
family is destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen, a clinical psychologist, holds separate group
discussions with foreign-born parents and their children. She
invites parents to communicate openly and freely with their
children and to remember their parental duties. She tells the
children to understand the difficult position their parents are in
and not to lose respect for them.
</P>
<P>
   Even with all the influence they wield in the family, some
children know who's the boss.
</P>
<P>
   At 17, Burma native Kim Fwan Wong of San Francisco said he
admires his 42-year-old mother, who works long hours at two
clerical jobs. Even though his mother had been in this country for
two years before Kim joined her in September 1999, Kim has picked
up more English. He said he doesn't resent having to translate for
his mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``I respect her very much,'' he said. ``It's very difficult for
her here. She wanted me to have a better education.''
</P>
<P>
   Betty Ruano of Hialeah, Fla., a Miami suburb, said that even
though she has answered the phone, spoken to visitors at the door
and distinguished junk mail from bills for her Cuban immigrant
parents since she was a girl, she always knew who was in charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was never an issue,'' said the 24-year-old. ``It was
always, `You're helping out,' not, `You're running the show.' If I
did something wrong, I got punished for it. It never once crossed
my mind that I shouldn't be.''
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   And even though Ruano works full time, she has remained with her
parents, ages 58 and 56, because she's worried that they won't be
able to manage.
</P>
<P>
   The family fled Cuba in 1980. But while Ruano's parents have
lived in this country for 20 years, they still can't speak English.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents didn't have time to learn the language,'' Ruano
said. ``They were busy trying to make a living, trying to
survive.''
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   Those who help parents who don't speak English stress that
parental authority in this country hinges on their knowing the
language.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, parents who do not speak English can miss out on
their children's education. If they cannot communicate during
parent-teacher conferences, they must depend on their children to
be honest about their grades.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   Some school districts recognize a language barrier can shut out
some parents from following their children's education. The Los
Angeles Unified School District and other ethnically diverse
districts print report cards in several languages. In L.A., this
includes Armenian, Chinese and Spanish. Even areas where immigrants
and refugees don't comprise much of the population, such as Newton
High School in Newton, Kansas, host bilingual meetings.
</P>
<P>
   But translated documents and special meetings don't target a
deep-seated fear of authority among immigrants and refugees, said
Roger Rice, co-director of the Boston-area Multicultural Education,
Training and Advocacy organization.
</P>
<P>
   He said that parents who don't speak English might not know they
can investigate their child's school. Where English-speaking
parents might confront a teacher, school board member or district
superintendent, Rice said, parents who know neither the language
nor the culture often think, ``The teacher knows best. The school
knows best. Who am I to even ask any questions?''
</P>
<P>
   With that attitude, Rice said, parents who don't speak English
don't learn how school systems work, and their kids ``don't have
that parent advocate who knows what the expectations are, who asks
questions, who helps with the homework.''
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen, of the Chicago mental health center, said that although
some government and social service agencies offer interpreters, the
need is greater than the availability. As a result, parents who
don't learn English continue to lean on their children, she said,
but ``they can't depend on their children forever.''
</P>

   The Padillas said they don't want to put stress on their boys,
but that it has been extremely hard to learn English. They have
devoted themselves to Our Savior/Nuestro Salvador Lutheran Church,
a bilingual church close to their home where they practice English
in a non-threatening environment.
</P>
<P>
   The church's pastor, the Rev. Steve Behr, said many children in
his congregation translate for their parents. He said that although
the situation ``forces some kids to be more adult than they should
be at their age,'' the experience can end up benefiting them in a
marketplace hungry for bilingual employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kicker is _ it's giving the kids some adult skills at an
early age,'' he said. ``It unfortunately makes a role reversal
where they end up being the parents and their parents end up being
children, many times. And they feel that very painfully.''

A DOCTOR'S DISCOVERY REVISES THE HISTORY OF MEDICAL IMAGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
 By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A medical doctor with a scholarly interest in pre-Columbian art
appears to have pushed back the date of the earliest scientific
medical illustration by several centuries with his study of bizarre
two-faced ancient Mexican figurines known to art historians as the
``pretty ladies of Tlatilco.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gordon Bendersky, a visiting scholar in the department of
history at the University of Pennsylvania, made the discovery a
couple of years ago when leafing through journals and textbooks on
pre-Columbian art. He noticed pictures of figurines unearthed since
1942 in Tlatilco, which is now part of Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   Standing 3 inches to 12 inches tall, the figurines, which were
created over a period of 500 years beginning in 1200 B.C., have
short flipperlike arms, flaring thighs, small breasts, wasplike
waists and a somewhat whimsical hairdo.
</P>
<P>
   A few dozen of the figurines have an even more grotesque feature
_ two faces on a single head. Some have two heads on one neck and
some have two heads on two necks.
</P>
<P>
   Art historians have long considered the two faces to be a
representation of mythical beings. But, as Bendersky scanned the
pages of the documents before him, he was suddenly struck by the
similarities between the monstrous pretty ladies of Tlatilco and a
rare congenital aberration called diprosopus that he had come
across while a medical student.
</P>
<P>
   Bendersky's initial suspicion caused him to embark on what
proved to be a two-year program of research to learn whether or not
his guess could be correct.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he says, he is convinced that he has identified ``the
oldest scientifically medical images in world history.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tremendously exciting to think that the Tlatilco
artists appeared to be the very first to marry art with medical
science,'' said Bendersky, who retired this year as professor of
internal medicine at the MCP Hahnemann University School of
Medicine in Philadelphia..
</P>
<P>
   He is not alone in his enthusiasm. Dr. Robert Perlman, editor of
the journal Perspectives in Biology and Medicine in which
Bendersky's article on the figurines will appear in early
September, said he and his peer-review panel found Bendersky's
argument ``throughly convincing.''
</P>
<P>
   Perlman added: ``I think it was the Nobel prize-winner Albert
Szent-Gyorgyi who said that discovery consists of seeing what
everybody has seen and thinking what nobody has thought. That's
Gordon Bendersky. Lots of people had seen these figurines before,
but he was the first to think that they might represent human
congenital anomalies.''
</P>
<P>
   Diprosopus is an exceedingly rare  &UR; -------------------- &LR;  birth
defect, with only about 85 cases reported since 1642. The
condition, which invariably results in stillbirth, is caused by
abnormal splitting of primitive fetal organs. It can result in
facial duplication, heart abnor- malities and duplication or
complete absence of a brain. Scientists suspect that excess
embroyologic tissue L plays a role, and that both genetic factors
and environmental stresses early in development of the embryo could
be at work.
</P>
<P>
   After tracking down and examining hundreds of ceramic figurines
and comparing them to photographic illustrations of two-faced
Siamese twins, he concluded that the sculptors of ancient Tlatilco
must have studied cases of diprosopus ``very thoroughly,'' as he
later wrote. The sculptors, he explained, had not let their
imaginations run wild with the creation of figurines with three or
five faces or with faces stacked on top of one another. Instead,
they had strictly limited their ceramic models to naturally
occurring diprosopus _ two faces side by side.
</P>
<P>
   In order to determine whether or not the Tlatilco figurines are
in fact the world's oldest, Bendersky studied other ancient
representations of human deformities, including the morbidly obese
Paleolithic statuette, Venus of Willendorf, a six-toed statue from
Ain Ghazal in Jordan, and a representation of the ancient Egyptian
dwarf Seneb.
</P>
<P>
   Although older than the Tlatilco figurines, these objects fail
to qualify as medical illustrations, Bendersky concluded. In
addition to being crudely schematic rather than drawn from nature,
they are portrayals of a particular deity or person who happens by
chance to have an abnormality rather than being representative of a
disease or deformity so as to provide diagnostic value.
</P>
<P>
   The result, he was able to say, was that the degree of accuracy
in documenting anatomical and pathological features in a human head
does not appear after the Tlatilco figurines for another 2,000
years or more until the 16th century works of Hans Baldung Grien
and Andreas Vesalius, who both did anatomical drawings based in
dissected corpses.
</P>
<P>
   But as far as Bendersky has gone to explain the pretty ladies of
Tlatilco, he has not been able to fathom their cultural meaning.
What could explain the fascination of the early Mesoamericans with
two-facedness? How was it possible that a prehistoric civilization
that had yet to develop the wheel, metal tools, the domestication
of animals and a sophisticated written language could have
developed an extraordinarily acute power of scientific observation?
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know the answer to that,'' said Bendersky. ``The only
way we might understand it would be to discover a written language
used by these ancient peoples and that, I'm afraid, doesn't seem
likely.''

<P>
   CLEVELAND _ When a presidential candidate comes campaigning to
your town, it's an opportunity for people to wave flags, cheer
speeches and show their support.
</P>
<P>
   Advance notice of a presidential candidate's campaign stop _
sometimes as little as 24 hours _ rarely leaves local organizers
much time to prepare. They have to show extreme flexibility,
resourcefulness and patience in arranging a rally, plant tour or
fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   When Cuyahoga Democratic Chairman Jimmy Dimora convinced Al
Gore's campaign last month that the vice president had not spent
enough time campaigning in northeast Ohio, the Gore campaign
quickly scheduled a trip to Cleveland, starting a familiar domino
effect for Ohio Democratic Party Executive Director Cindy
Marizette.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first response is to hang up the phone and swear really
loud,'' Marizette said. ``I drop everything I'm doing. It doesn't
matter if the election is tomorrow or two months from now, whatever
I'm working on is put on hold until the visit is completed.''
</P>
<P>
   Both parties use the same game plan. Each campaign stop usually
targets a particular voting group _ such as senior citizens,
minorities or veterans _ to emphasize a proposal or political
position.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to find a location that dovetails with the message,''
said Robert Paduchik, Ohio campaign manager for Texas Gov. George
W. Bush's presidential campaign. ``That's a challenge sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   National campaign managers both suggest and solicit campaign
stop locations, which must meet a variety of space and safety
requirements set by campaign advance teams and the Secret Service.
</P>
<P>
   Once the site passes inspection for capacity and security,
arrangements have to be made for volunteers, food, signs, lighting
and staging. Glitches are inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Marizette had to integrate a surprise visit from
the vice president into a Democratic celebration that had been
planned before Gore decided to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to figure out how to get his group in and out before our
regular guests arrived,'' she said. ``Changes are just something I
expect to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign can be the source of more nerve-racking
complications.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the problems when President Bush made a campaign stop
in September 1992 at the Lake County Fairgrounds and the theme of
his speech changed four times.
</P>
<P>
   The changes had little impact on the public face of the
campaign, but it sent local campaign workers into a tizzy.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign needed an audience of 500 plus, and it was up to
Jim Trakas, Bush's 1992 Cuyahoga County campaign coordinator, to
make sure the cameras saw faces that matched the message.
</P>
<P>
   ``First it was education, so we had to get school kids for the
crowd,'' said Trakas. Calls went out to principals, superintendents
and Republican mayors to help find children, because school wasn't
in session.
</P>
<P>
   They were still trying to round up a young audience when
campaign strategists changed the topic to military policy. That
meant Trakas had to locate veterans while telling the school kids
they were no longer needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you tell people they're going to meet the president and
the next day call back and say they're not, they're not happy,''
Trakas said.
</P>
<P>
   No sooner were the vets invited than Trakas learned he would
have to disappoint them as well. Now the theme was higher
education, and college students were the audience of choice. New
calls to GOP clubs at John Carroll and Cleveland State universities
collected the necessary bodies, but their role was doomed as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally they decided on job creation,'' Trakas said, and
people involved in job training programs were rounded up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were pretty good soldiers,'' he said of the changes local
party workers went through. ``We were honored just to have the
president coming, so we didn't mention any of our frustration.''
</P>
<P>
   Any organizer, Democrat or Republican, can tell similar tales in
any state where a bunch of electoral votes are up for grabs. The
ability to make last-minute arrangements will be at a premium for
both parties.
</P>
<P>
   While locals work out local details, a national campaign advance
team solves other problems, like determining how long it takes to
drive from the airport to the rally site.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's eight-member team usually arrives as much as a week
before the event. Gore's team usually spends about four days in the
host area.
</P>
<P>
   The advance teams work out of the local party offices and often
stay in downtown hotels, but sometimes the local supporters place
national campaign workers in the homes of strangers willing to
house them to save money.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   Both the candidate and the local volunteers are hoping for good
publicity from a campaign stop, but that doesn't always happen.
Sometimes, rallies are ``stepped on by a bigger story,'' or
complicated by delays, Paduchik said. ``You can't control that
stuff at all. You just have to be able to roll with the punches.''
</P>
<P>
   Last November mechanical problems delayed Gov. Bush's plane on a
flight from Michigan. Paduchik's job had been to get a crowd to
Cleveland Hopkins International Airport. Now he had to keep them
from leaving.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   By the time a candidate arrives and starts working the crowd,
local organizers can relax a little and look on like coaches
watching the execution of their prize plays. But life doesn't
return to normal until the candidate is off to the next stop on the
campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am so relieved to see him taking off,'' Marizette said of
Gore. ``It usually takes me a day or two to recover mentally behind
a visit like that. It's a stressful experience, but it's rewarding
because I know it's been successful and I've done my job.''

 ATTENTION EDITORS: With four photos, of Angel Padilla (NNS1), Maria
Padilla (NNS2), Felix Antonio Rollet (NNS3) and Felix Juan Rollet
(NNS4). 
 By MICHELE M. MELENDEZ  
 c.2000 Newhouse News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LORAIN, Ohio _ Angel and Maria Padilla live through the words of
their children.
</P>
<P>
   At ages 13 and 10, their boys speak on their parents' behalf
with doctors and lawyers. They read the mail and answer the phone.
They translate the television news and bottles of prescription
medication. They are their parents' link to the world, because
their parents don't speak English.
</P>
<P>
   Those scenes play across the country among families in which
parents haven't learned English. The adults rely on their children.
In effect, the children run the household, and the arrangement can
leave parents in despair, children in conflict and family roles in
shambles.
</P>
<P>
   ``A really wide cultural gap is developing between the first
generation immigrants and their children,'' said Jason Felch, youth
program director at the International Institute of San Francisco.
``Young people come in and pick up the language and learn the
culture faster than their parents do. Then, you end up having
(children) put into the position of negotiating with the landlord,
answering the door, opening the mail, translating.''
</P>
<P>
   The Padillas have lived in the United States off and on since
1991. In 1996, they moved from their native Puerto Rico to this
city of 70,000 about 30 miles west of Cleveland. Maria, 45, and
Angel, 65, have medical problems and said they were in search of a
place where they could obtain better treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly one in 10 people in the United States was born elsewhere,
according to census estimates for 1998, the latest available.
</P>
<P>
   The 1990 census offers the most recent figures on language
spoken at home. That year, the primary language of about 14 percent
of the country's population was something other than English. The
children were more likely able to speak English _ 86 percent,
compared with 77 percent of adults.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that children have natural advantages over their
parents in learning a second language.
</P>
<P>
   Even adults who truly want to learn English, and who enroll in
classes to do so, have a tough time because they often revert to
their native language at home and avoid situations where they would
be forced to speak English, said Bonnie Mizenko, director of the
Virginia Beach Adult Learning Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a matter of practice and exposure,'' she said. ``The
young are still impressionable. They are truly bilingual. The
adults have a choice about what they speak, and they tend to
isolate themselves. It's about being anxious about making mistakes
and feeling comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   The Padillas' sons, Felix Antonio Rollet, 13, and Felix Juan
Rollet, 10, are Maria's from a prior relationship, but consider
Angel Padilla their father. They speak English as well as American
boys their age, and said they're used to their interpreting duties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought translating for my parents was such a big
deal,'' Felix Juan said.
</P>
<P>
   That's because they do it every day, even on the roughest days.
</P>
<P>
   When Angel severely injured his back in an automobile crash,
needing 46 stitches and four metal disks, his sons had to
translate. When the family hired a lawyer to settle an insurance
claim, the boys tried to decipher the legal terminology. When the
younger son was failing in school, the older son did the talking
with his teacher. They had no choice, the Padillas said, because
the hospital, the lawyer's office and the school could not provide
professional translators.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking through an interpreter, both parents expressed sorrow
for depending on their boys so much.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me feel bad, because there are things children
shouldn't know about or be involved with,'' Angel Padilla said.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, he said, he doesn't always get all the information he
needs to make informed decisions, because the children can't
translate concepts they don't understand.
</P>
<P>
   It's a strange position for both children and parents, a bizarre
role reversal. At a young age, children are forced to learn adult
responsibilities; their parents' authority wavers as they become
dependent on their young children.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an issue that happens with every family we see,'' said
Jane Cook, director of Refugee and Immigration Services of the
Catholic Diocese of Virginia in Norfolk. ``We tell them this is
something that will happen, so that when it does happen they don't
get that upset and they can take steps to prepare for it, such as
telling their children, `You still have to do your chores,' `You
still have to go to school.'''
</P>
<P>
   Angel Padilla said he already gets flak from his older son when
it comes to helping clean the house: ``He says, `I've been helping
you all day (by translating). Isn't that enough?'''
</P>
<P>
   Some adults who depend on children to translate can end up
struggling for control of the family. Children growing up in this
country might favor American independence and self-reliance over
the cultural values of their parents emphasizing family honor and
unity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids, even though they're young, they feel strong,'' said
Ngy Hul, director of the Refugee Federation Service Center in
Seattle. ``They are the head of the household. When the parents
want to discipline the children, the children say, `Hey, you depend
on me. What do YOU know?'''
</P>
<P>
   Hul said a Cambodian man dependent on his 12-year-old grandson's
English skills sought help from the center, because the boy had
pulled a gun on him. The man had called the police on his grandson.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me he wanted his grandson to die, because if he died,
he'd cry for a month. But if (the grandson) lived, he'd suffer
forever,'' Hul said.
</P>
<P>
   The family dynamic _ the way family members relate to each other
_ shifts when the children are so involved with the adult
responsibilities, said Thanh Son (Lisa) Nguyen, director at the
Center for Multicultural and Multigenerational Mental Health
Services in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The children might lose respect for the parents, and the
parents feel like they're powerless,'' she said. ``They feel the
family is destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen, a clinical psychologist, holds separate group
discussions with foreign-born parents and their children. She
invites parents to communicate openly and freely with their
children and to remember their parental duties. She tells the
children to understand the difficult position their parents are in
and not to lose respect for them.
</P>
<P>
   Even with all the influence they wield in the family, some
children know who's the boss.
</P>
<P>
   At 17, Burma native Kim Fwan Wong of San Francisco said he
admires his 42-year-old mother, who works long hours at two
clerical jobs. Even though his mother had been in this country for
two years before Kim joined her in September 1999, Kim has picked
up more English. He said he doesn't resent having to translate for
his mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``I respect her very much,'' he said. ``It's very difficult for
her here. She wanted me to have a better education.''
</P>
<P>
   Betty Ruano of Hialeah, Fla., a Miami suburb, said that even
though she has answered the phone, spoken to visitors at the door
and distinguished junk mail from bills for her Cuban immigrant
parents since she was a girl, she always knew who was in charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was never an issue,'' said the 24-year-old. ``It was
always, `You're helping out,' not, `You're running the show.' If I
did something wrong, I got punished for it. It never once crossed
my mind that I shouldn't be.''
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   And even though Ruano works full time, she has remained with her
parents, ages 58 and 56, because she's worried that they won't be
able to manage.
</P>
<P>
   The family fled Cuba in 1980. But while Ruano's parents have
lived in this country for 20 years, they still can't speak English.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents didn't have time to learn the language,'' Ruano
said. ``They were busy trying to make a living, trying to
survive.''
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   Those who help parents who don't speak English stress that
parental authority in this country hinges on their knowing the
language.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, parents who do not speak English can miss out on
their children's education. If they cannot communicate during
parent-teacher conferences, they must depend on their children to
be honest about their grades.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   Some school districts recognize a language barrier can shut out
some parents from following their children's education. The Los
Angeles Unified School District and other ethnically diverse
districts print report cards in several languages. In L.A., this
includes Armenian, Chinese and Spanish. Even areas where immigrants
and refugees don't comprise much of the population, such as Newton
High School in Newton, Kansas, host bilingual meetings.
</P>
<P>
   But translated documents and special meetings don't target a
deep-seated fear of authority among immigrants and refugees, said
Roger Rice, co-director of the Boston-areaMulticultural Education,
Training and Advocacy organization.
</P>
<P>
   He said that parents who don't speak English might not know they
can investigate their child's school. Where English-speaking
parents might confront a teacher, school board member or district
superintendent, Rice said, parents who know neither the language
nor the culture often think, ``The teacher knows best. The school
knows best. Who am I to even ask any questions?''
</P>
<P>
   With that attitude, Rice said, parents who don't speak English
don't learn how school systems work, and their kids ``don't have
that parent advocate who knows what the expectations are, who asks
questions, who helps with the homework.''
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen, of the Chicago mental health center, said that although
some government and social service agencies offer interpreters, the
need is greater than the availability. As a result, parents who
don't learn English continue to lean on their children, she said,
but ``they can't depend on their children forever.''
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   The Padillas said they don't want to put stress on their boys,
but that it has been extremely hard to learn English. They have
devoted themselves to Our Savior/Nuestro Salvador Lutheran Church,
a bilingual church close to their home where they practice English
in a non-threatening environment.
</P>
<P>
   The church's pastor, the Rev. Steve Behr, said many children in
his congregation translate for their parents. He said that although
the situation ``forces some kids to be more adult than they should
be at their age,'' the experience can end up benefiting them in a
marketplace hungry for bilingual employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kicker is _ it's giving the kids some adult skills at an
early age,'' he said. ``It unfortunately makes a role reversal
where they end up being the parents and their parents end up being
children, many times. And they feel that very painfully.''

AUCTIONING SECOND-HAND DOMAINS GIVES RISE TO ANOTHER INTERNET
MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
   By SABRA CHARTRAND   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Internet address www.flu.com is for sale, and its sellers
think it is worth $1.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   The address does not lead to a World Wide Web site, and it never
has. Its estimated value seems to arise mostly because such an
easy-to-remember destination is available for sale at all.
</P>
<P>
   Because flu.com and virtually all of the other catchy Web
addresses ending in ``.com'' have already been claimed, the value
of such unused names has risen sharply. Into this speculative field
have come a growing number of companies that have built businesses
just by helping owners resell the names they no longer want or
need.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole market is shifting; it's now all about the secondary
market,'' said Jeff Tinsley, chief executive of GreatDomains.com, a
Los Angeles company that is one of the largest resellers of names.
``All the best names are bought up.''
</P>
<P>
   Original domain name registrations once all cost $35 a year.
That lasted, for the most part, until this year, when Network
Solutions Inc., which had a monopoly on registrations, lost its
government contract. Now, more than 50 companies compete to
register addresses, new and old, and the rivalry has driven prices
as low as $8.
</P>
<P>
   But for the best generic and catchy domain names, prices are
soaring. Early this year, several domain names sold for
astronomical amounts _ business.com for $7.5 million, loans.com for
$3 million and beauty.com for $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   The appraisers of flu.com evidently considered those sales when
setting their asking price June 28. Since 1995, the address has
belonged to Procter &AMP; Gamble Inc., which registered hundreds of
similar generic names like beautiful.com and scent.com. After five
years, the company has realized that it does not need so many
generic domain names. So it decided to sell them, using
GreatDomains.com to supervise the transactions.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we acquired these names, we acted to procure anything
that was potentially useful for Procter &AMP; Gamble,'' explained Terri
Carrick, a spokeswoman for the company, which is keeping domains
for its brand-name products, like Crest.com and Pringles.com. Now,
though, company officials realize that these unneeded names can be
worth money.
</P>
<P>
   GreatDomains has more than 1 million domain names for resale on
its site. The other leading reseller, Afternic.com, based in New
York, has just more than 250,000. Most sales are for ``com'' domain
names, but ``net'' and ``org'' names are also available, and some
companies are auctioning names with two-letter country codes, like
.tv for the tiny nation of Tuvalu.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Network Solutions, the one-time monopoly, launched
its own forum for reselling domain names. The company says it will
not charge either buyers or sellers a handling fee or a commission.
It hopes instead that the traffic the forum brings to the site will
generate customers for its other services, like domain-name
appraisals and Internet starter kits that include Web site design
and e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years ago, registering a name was plenty,'' said
Christopher Clough, a vice president of communications for Network
Solutions. ``It was enough to fulfill demand. It was fresh, novel
and important. But that was two years ago. Today, it is literally
not enough, because there is a very interesting dynamic happening
in the market.''
</P>
<P>
   That dynamic is the rise of resellers like GreatDomains.com and
Afternic.com, which both charge a commission. At GreatDomains,
where 25 domain names have asking prices of more than $1 million,
that could mean substantial fees once the company takes 7 percent
to 10 percent from sellers. Afternic charges 5 percent to buyers.
</P>
<P>
   GreatDomains says its average auction brings in $10,000;
Afternic says its average is closer to $3,000.
</P>
<P>
   Like any other arena, the domain-name broker industry includes
companies of varying size. Many smaller companies have auctioned
domain names for years. YahooAuction, owned by Yahoo, and eBay have
together listed between 10,000 to 15,000 domain names. Other sites
carry hundreds or a few thousand names, like (domain4auction/.com),
(hitdomain.com), (listadomain/.com), (dngcom.com) and
(domainmart/.com), (where www.peoplewhodontpaytheirbills.com was
for sale recently).
</P>
<P>
   Register.com, a New York company, also plans to add auctions to
its site.
</P>
<P>
   Tinsley, of GreatDomains.com, said he thinks his company has
built enough of a reputation to withstand new competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the fortunate position to be the clear leader in the
secondary market,'' he said. ``We've figured out what it takes to
get the names sold.''
</P>
<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble, meanwhile, is in no hurry to sell flu.com. The
company says it has had several inquiries, but predicted the
auction could take three to six months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're waiting for the right customer,'' Carrick said, meaning
one who could pay $1.4 million. ``We've had these names appraised.
The listing price is reflective of the estimated value. It's like
finding valuable artwork in the attic of a 163-year-old house.''

CHARGES AGAINST PHILIPPINE `LOVE BUG' SUSPECT ARE DROPPED 
</HEADLINE>
  By WAYNE ARNOLD    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SINGAPORE _ Philippine authorities dismissed all charges Monday
against Onel A. de Guzman, the 24-year-old college dropout whom
investigators had accused of being responsibile for a destructive
computer e-mail program that wreaked billions of dollars in damage
on companies worldwide in May.
</P>
<P>
   The Philippine justice department said the evidence against de
Guzman did not substantiate the charges filed against him by the
National Bureau of Investigation. Late in June, the bureau charged
de Guzman with theft and with violating a law intended to deal with
credit card fraud after investigators traced the destructive
computer program _ known popularly as the ``I love you'' virus _ to
his Manila apartment.
</P>
<P>
   The case, which emphasized that complex computer networks are
vulnerable to relatively unsophisticated security breaches, also
exposed the inadequacy of Philippine laws to handle instances of
computer hacking. The Philippine Congress subsequently passed
legislation dealing specifically with computer-related crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The justice department said that since the destructive e-mail
program _ variously called a virus or a worm in news reports _ had
been introduced before the new law was passed, de Guzman could not
be charged with violating it.
</P>
<P>
   And Fernando D. Contreras, vice president of the Philippine
Internet Service Organization, a trade group that promotes use of
the Internet, remarked, ``It was like the Pearl Harbor that caught
us sleeping.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the computer program's creator might never face justice,
Contreras said Internet users saw the case as a success if only
because it had ensured speedy passage of the new law and inspired
Internet service providers to take greater precautions against
similar abuses.
</P>
<P>
   De Guzman acknowledged that he might have inadvertently released
the e-mail program, though he did not admit creating it. The
program, which experts said was surprisingly simple, infected
computers with an e-mail message that, when opened, created
numerous copies of itself and then forwarded itself to every entry
in the recipient's list of e-mail addresses.
</P>
<P>
   Though ostensibly intended to collect Internet access passwords
and send them back to its originator, the program ended up
overloading computer networks from the Pentagon to the British
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators were able to trace the virus to a ramshackle
inner-city apartment where de Guzman was living with his sister and
her boyfriend while attending a local computer college. After first
charging the boyfriend, investigators turned to de Guzman when
teachers at the college notified them of similarities between the
``I love you'' program and one designed to steal Internet passwords
that de Guzman had submitted as a course thesis. The college
rejected the thesis and de Guzman did not graduate.
</P>
<P>
   His subsequent notoriety does not appear to have dimmed his
prospects. Several computer companies have reportedly offered to
hire de Guzman, though he is said to have turned them down.
</P>
<P>
   Philippine officials have also sought to use the publicity
surrounding the case to advertise their country's inexpensive
computing talent to high-technology companies abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Philippine president, Joseph Estrada, traveled
to the United States to meet with President Clinton and to seek
high-technology investment. Last week, Callahan Broadband Wireless
said it would invest 3.15 billion pesos, or $70 million, in a
Philippine company providing high-speed Internet services to
businesses in the country.

AT RECORD LEVEL NOW, SCHOOL ENROLLMENT EXPECTED TO GROW THROUGH
CENTURY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Nev., Tenn., N.C.)   By JACQUES STEINBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The federal government says the nation's elementary and
secondary schools will enroll a record 53 million students this
fall, continuing a decade-long rise, and officials expect that
number to jump to 94 million by the end of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   The enrollment figure, released Monday by the Secretary of
Education, Richard W. Riley, includes both private and public
schools and represents an increase of 200,000 students, or 0.4
percent, since last the beginning of last term, and an increase of
6.6 million, or 14.2 percent, since 1990. School enrollment is
expected to continue to rise slightly through 2005, to 53.5
million, and then level off through 2010.
</P>
<P>
   But in contrast to the baby boom _ which was followed, beginning
in the late 1950s, by a plunge in school enrollment that lasted
almost uninterrupted for nearly two decades _ the school population
is expected to grow without any letup throughout the rest of the
21st century. Enrollment will swell steadily because of rising
births and an unabated flood of immigrants, the report said, citing
census projections.
</P>
<P>
   As graduation rates continue to climb, some colleges will be
swamped by the overflow, at least in applications; college
enrollment is expected to grow by 19 percent, or 2.4 million
students, over the next decade alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a century of growth ahead of us, a crescendo of
children,'' Riley said. ``America's challenge as we begin the 21st
century is to make good choices now, so that we won't be
overwhelmed later.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Riley issues an annual enrollment report at the end of
each summer, his emphasis on the long view was aimed, at least in
part, at the Republican Congress, which has consistently blocked
President Clinton's efforts to make available $25 billion in
interest-free bonds to enable districts to build and renovate
schools. The Republicans have said such responsibility lies with
school districts themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Riley made clear that public school districts, urban and rural,
are already coping with extraordinary growth. In Las Vegas, where
Riley released the report, the Clark County School District has
almost doubled in size over the last 10 years, growing to 208,777
from 105,054. (One of the newest schools, Irwin and Susan Molasky
Junior High School, was named, appropriately, for a builder.) The
Chattanooga, Tenn., schools grew at a similar rate, to 42,292
students from 20,425. And in Greensboro, N.C., enrollment rose by
156 percent, to 61,154 from 23,851.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has estimated the cost of renovating
and repairing existing schools alone at $127 billion.
</P>
<P>
   While every section of the country is expected to be affected by
the growth over the next century, Riley said that western and
southern states would feel such increases acutely. Over the next 10
years, public schools in Texas are projected to grow by 219,000
students, an increase of 5.4 percent; California is expected to add
278,000 students, an increase of 4.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   As overwhelming as the projected growth in school enrollment
appears over the 21st century, it is, by percentage, smaller than
that over the last 100 years: the nation's public and private
schools grew by 31.5 million students, or 147 percent, from 1900
through 2000, as compared with a projection of 41 million
additional students, or 77 percent, from now to 2100.

FOOD FOR THE SURVIVOR PARTY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RENEE KIENTZ 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
Vittles for a ``Survivor'' party take ingenuity and planning.
Anybody can set out Ritz crackers and cream cheese swimming in
jalapeno jelly, but where's the adventure in that?
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since the series finale airs Wednesday, you hardly have time to
lay in a store of rat, the obvious entree, unless you've thought
ahead. (We hear rodent freezes well; just thaw and roast, a la
Ramona.)
</P>
<P>
   Squirrel, known in Cajun country as ``the other white meat,''
makes a good substitute and is more readily available. Squirrels
frolic in the light of day and, more naive than their furtive
cousins, are easily attracted to backyard feeders.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Directions for Squirrels a la King, from ``More White Trash
Cooking'' by Trisha Mickler (Ten Speed Press, $19.95), suggest
soaking dressed squirrel in saltwater overnight.
</P>
<P>
   An hour or two before dinner, wash them rascals (the soaked
squirrels) in two changes of cool water. Throw 'em in a kettle with
enough water to cover. Add two halves of an onion, some celery,
salt, and pepper; then bring to a boil. Skim the surface foam from
the bubbling stew, and let it simmer until done. Drain and dry the
squirrels. Then split them down the back and brown the four halves
in a buttered skillet until golden brown. This is best served with
cabbage.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; To serve: Don't just let everybody eat. Make them earn the
privilege. Divide guests into two tribes and issue a challenge.
First tribe to guess the number of calories in a 3.6-ounce portion
of squirrel meat, as determined by the U.S. Department of
Agriculture, wins. The other tribe? Let them eat rat-a-touille.

BOSTON SCIENTIFIC GETS REPRIMAND FROM SEC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NAOMI AOKI  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The US Securities and Exchange Commission has issued a cease and
desist order against Boston Scientific Corp., effectively slapping
the company's wrists after its Japanese unit faked sales of $75
million in 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC action did not include a fine. It ended a 2-year-old
scandal that began when the company's finance department uncovered
the fraudulent sales, which involved more than 40 employees,
including the president of Boston Scientific Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Scientific, a Natick, Mass. maker of medical devices,
consented to the order without formally admitting or denying the
commission's findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The order does not find any intentional or reckless conduct on
the part of Boston Scientific, and it acknowledges the company's
prompt remedial acts and cooperation,'' the company said in a
statement Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's order does, however, accuse the company of
failing to maintain an adequate system of controls. It states that
poor tracking of accounts and inventory made it possible for its
Japanese employees to record false sales and boost revenue figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Boston Scientific had appropriate controls in place, they
would have discovered this sooner or prevented it in the first
place,'' said James B. Adelman, the SEC's associate district
administrator.
</P>
<P>
   Between January 1997 and June 1998 more than 40 employees of
Boston Scientific Japan and 143 independent distributors became
involved in the scheme, according to the SEC.
</P>
<P>
   The employees would record sales to distributors who agreed to
participate in the scheme, the SEC said. In some cases, products
were sent to the distributor. In others, they were sent to a
warehouse leased by the company.
</P>
<P>
   The distributors never paid for the merchandise, knowing that
their accounts would later be credited for the amount that was
owed. If asked, however, the distributors confirmed buying and
owing money for the products.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the distributors weren't even in the medical products
business, the SEC said.
</P>
<P>
   Adelman said the SEC decided against levying a fine because the
company took the appropriate steps to remedy the problem and
because it was limited to a single subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Scientific discovered the fraud when installing a new
information management system at the Japanese unit and immediately
reported the fraudulent activity to the SEC.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1998, the company publicly announced that it had
improperly booked more than $40 million in sales in the first nine
months of that year. And in February 1999, it issued corrected
financial statements.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to installing the new information management system,
the company has taken a number of steps to strengthen its internal
financial controls, said Paul Donovan, a company spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Securities analysts called the trouble ``old news,'' saying
investors responded when it was announced two years ago and
wouldn't likely have much reaction to the SEC sanction.
</P>
<P>
   They were far more interested Monday in the company's
discussions to buy Medinol Ltd. of Israel, its major supplier of
cardiovascular stents, small tubes used to prop open once-clogged
arteries. Difficulties with Medinol have caused Boston Scientific's
cardiovascular stent revenues to slip.
</P>
<P>
   TheMarker.com, a Hebrew language business Web site, was
reporting Monday that the two companies had come to an agreement.
But Boston Scientific denied the report, saying the discussions are
continuing.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Scientific shares closed Monday at $17.81, up $1.44 from
Friday. The company's stock was trading as high as $46 a share two
years ago, before news of the fraudulent sales and the problems
with Medinol began.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sanction is just the final chapter on an obviously
disappointing part of the Boston Scientific story,'' said Dan
Lemaitre, medical technology analyst with Merrill Lynch Global
Securities. ``But there's nothing to affect earnings going forward
_ no fine, no changed financial statements _ and the company is
bound and determined not to let anything like that happen again.''

<P>
   DALLAS _ Elizabeth Freese didn't mean to end up in Dallas. For
one thing, she's from a long line of Fort Worth natives. For
another, she was on a quest _ a spiritual journey that took her
places where people who need to contemplate, and can afford the
time to do it, often go: Santa Fe, N.M.; Boulder, Colo.; San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The Metroplex wasn't really on her radar.
</P>
<P>
   But fate has a funny way of putting people where they belong,
and, in Freese's case, it was back home in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In June, the 31-year-old Freese launched greentexas.com, a
clearinghouse for North Texas environmental information. The site
centralizes and organizes local environmental activities, news and
resources, providing lists of nonprofit groups and ``green''
businesses locally and nationally. And it links to dozens of other
sites focused on air quality, recycling, green architecture,
sustainable industry, even religion-based environmentalism.
</P>
<P>
   Freese runs the site, an arm of the nonprofit Greater Dallas
Planning Council, as part of her job as an account executive for
the public relations firm Read-Poland. But greentexas.com was her
concept, and the Web site, which has received generally positive
reviews from local activists, has been her project from the
beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Freese's budding environmental career was both unforeseen and
prophesied. She grew up in the privileged enclave of Westover
Hills, in a ``Republican to the core'' culture, she says, where
social activism was not part of the picture _ or, at least, not
during Freese's childhood.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say she didn't grow up with an appreciation of
nature _ her grandparents were avid naturalists and her father's
family owns cabins in Red River, N.M. But it wasn't until college
that Freese fully realized that her family _ specifically her
great-grandmother _ had an environmental legacy to boast of.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, Hallie Read Hardwicke, founder of the Planned
Parenthood Association of Fort Worth and president of the local
Audubon Society, was among a small group of activists who
encouraged city leaders to set aside a 360-acre wildlife preserve
near Lake Worth. The Fort Worth Nature Center and Refuge has grown
tenfold since then and in 1970 named its new Interpretive Center
for Hallie and Robert Hardwicke.
</P>
<P>
   (The revelation that an environmental gene ran in the family
came as somewhat of a relief to Freese, who thought ``OK. I'm not
insane. I didn't just make this up out of nowhere.'')
</P>
<P>
   In January 1966, Hallie Hardwicke gave a speech at the Fort
Worth Club, one that her great-granddaughter might have written
today, Freese says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conservation of our natural resources _ land, air, woods,
water and the wildlife dependent upon these resources _ is our
objective,'' Hallie told her audience, ``and our weapons are simple
ones: informing ourselves as to the grandiose plans of government
agencies and the often shortsighted schemes of many private
investors, then participating at every level of government through
our citizenship.''
</P>
<P>
   Freese's interest in environmental work grew slowly. She recalls
standing outside a supermarket in Connecticut, as a freshman at
Trinity College, asking shoppers to sign a petition (she vaguely
remembers it having something to do with the cleanup of a Superfund
site).
</P>
<P>
   When she transferred to Barnard College in New York City, the
same school her great-grandmother had attended, her focus drifted
to abortion rights and coordinating student involvement in two
Washington, D.C., pro-choice marches.
</P>
<P>
   Her insulated upbringing, she says, simply hadn't prepared her
for the diversity of ideas she encountered during college. ``It was
all just mind-blowing,'' Freese explains. ``There were so many
dimensions of our cultural or societal reality of which I was just
flat unaware and had just never experienced.''
</P>
<P>
   She graduated in 1991, having rejected the corporate path many
of her classmates chose, and set out to explore both the world and
herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was living on a trust fund for three years, writing,
painting, doing yoga,'' Freese says. She moved to Santa Fe for a
time and then to San Francisco to study Eastern philosophy. There,
she found herself drawn to the Chinese philosophy of Taoism and its
emphasis on the union of nature and humanity.
</P>
<P>
   Freese's parents have usually supported her decisions, and she's
close to both (talking daily to her mother in Fort Worth), ``but we
definitely get into some fairly heated debates,'' she says. ``We
agree to disagree a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   During those three post-college years of drifting, her folks
``were just hoping I would come out of it,'' she says, laughing.
But the spiritual search was a difficult time for Freese, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was working through a lot of anger,'' she says. The culture
of her youth had consisted of what she calls ``an overemphasis to
the nth degree on getting wealth and social status to the detriment
of everything else. There wasn't much room for what's really
fulfilling ... I felt like it had cheated me of a deeper spiritual
sense.''
</P>
<P>
   After a year each in Santa Fe and San Francisco, Freese settled
in Boulder, where a younger brother was attending college. Shortly
thereafter she followed an old boyfriend to Fayetteville, Ark.,
where her environmental work began in earnest.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, local environmentalists were urging the U.S. Forest
Service to revamp the management plan for the national forest,
including reducing the amount of logging. Freese joined the Sierra
Club and the Newton County Wildlife Association, soon becoming the
latter's de facto spokesperson. She spoke on radio shows and to
Earth Day audiences; she wrote editorials for the newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   But her activism, she says, was coming from a place of hope, not
hostility. ``I was focused on the positive messages, on the
possibilities,'' she says. ``I didn't get up there to talk about
evil loggers.''
</P>
<P>
   Freese's style doesn't always sit well with some activists. She
has made a conscious decision to work within the system pursuing
change, choosing encouragement more than condemnation. But she sees
both tactics as necessary. ``I think that anger is a very
legitimate, appropriate response to environmental wrongs,'' she
says. ``But it can really burn you out, and I don't think it's
effective ultimately.''
</P>
<P>
   Freese eventually received a master's degree in environmental
communication from the University of Arkansas, dropped the ex-beau
and became engaged to a man whose job search brought them, of all
places, back to the Metroplex. Now she and husband Talley Summerlin
have neighboring offices at Read-Poland, where until recently both
spent about a third of their work week on greentexas.com.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Freese reduced her hours to part time. She'll still
be coordinating greentexas.com, and plans for it to become an
independent nonprofit one day. But she's also starting theology
school with hopes of practicing ``environmental ministry,'' a
movement addressing the moral and spiritual dimensions of saving
the planet.
</P>
<P>
   Her own spiritual moorings, Freese says, are a little more
secure these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so weird, but roots have become more and more important _
being around friends and family no matter how much we disagree on
various things,'' she admits. ``I don't feel like I quite belong
anywhere else.''

ARTS ABROAD: FOR JONI MITCHELL, ARTIST, SINGING WAS NOT ENOUGH 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES BROOKE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SASKATOON, Saskatchewan _ In a report card note to the parents
of Roberta Joan Anderson a few decades back, the sixth grade
teacher at Queen Elizabeth School here offered this starchy
recommendation: ``Joan should pay attention to other subjects than
art.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost half a century later, Joni Mitchell has come home to this
city in the Canadian prairies where she grew up and where her
parents still live. And she has brought her art with her.
</P>
<P>
   From 500 paintings, drawings and photographs made over the last
three decades, Gilles Hebert, director of the Mendel Art Gallery, a
public museum, has selected 87 pieces for Mitchell's first
retrospective show, called ``voices: Joni Mitchell.'' As recordings
of her folk, jazz and rock songs echo gently through the boxy teak
galleries here, visitors explore an artistic side to the singer
only hinted at in the album covers she has painted over the years.
</P>
<P>
   The show includes prairie landscapes, photo montages in which
Mitchell's flaxen hair blends into wheat fields, and cubist oils.
There are abstract paintings that at first were hung upside down at
the gallery, brightly colored pop portraits in the Peter Max style,
a portrait of Georgia O'Keeffe with a Southwestern feel and an
erotically charged oil showing a man's hand on a woman's
black-stockinged knee.
</P>
<P>
   The show opened on June 30, attracting such crowds to the
museum, which overlooks the South Sasketchewan River, that streets
were blocked to traffic. With some fans making 1,000-mile
pilgrimages, the Mendel expects to double its normal attendance
during the show, which runs through Sept. 17. ``We are averaging
one thousand people a day,'' Hebert said. ``That is amazing to me
in a city of 210,000 people.''
</P>
<P>
   The show is here because this unpretentious prairie city is home
to her parents and to her boyfriend, Donald Freed, also a
singer-songwriter. It is rare because Mitchell, who has plenty of
wealth and fame from her music, paints for herself, occasionally
giving a work to a friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sing my sorrow,'' she likes to say, ``and I paint my joy.''
``When you are writing, you need to have a kind of chaotic mind for
stimulation,'' Mitchell said in a telephone interview after
returning to her Bel Air mansion in Los Angeles from the opening
here. ``Painting is a completely different mental process. It
completely clears my mind until I get to the point where I have no
thoughts. I get the same charge from juxtaposition of colors as I
do from juxtaposition of chords.''
</P>
<P>
   Hebert, the show's curator, described long conversations with
Mitchell about art and music. ``You never really know which
discipline she is talking about,'' he said. ``She slides from one
to the other. She will talk about colors chiming or about how
tension built up because of discord in her choice of colors. She
talks about harmony, she talks about resonance: these are the terms
she uses to describe her art.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, now 56, started drawing at age 10 when she was
bedridden with polio. She calls her songs audio paintings.
</P>
<P>
   In ``A Case of You,'' she wrote and sang, ``Oh I am a lonely
painter/I live in a box of paints.''
</P>
<P>
   Generally, Mitchell's painting style has shifted and evolved in
tandem with her music. Referring to late 1960s portraits of Neil
Young, a fellow musician and longtime friend from the Canadian
prairies, she remarked, ``Those line drawings were done at the time
when my first records were basically music and guitar. At the time,
I started overdubbing my music. I added color to the line drawings,
sometimes after the fact. Then as my music got jazzier, I painted
abstractly. Now that I am going through a neo-classical style, the
painting goes through a neo-classical style.''
</P>
<P>
   In a review last month in The Globe and Mail, edited in Toronto,
Robert Enright, a curator, arts editor and television critic,
described Mitchell as a ``worldly version of a naive artist,
indifferent to art trends and the positioning that has so much to
do with contemporary art.''
</P>
<P>
   While her name will draw people to the museum, he wrote, ``her
genuine aspiration to be an artist is what will keep them there
long after the novelty wears off of a pop icon who paints.''
</P>
<P>
   In the telephone interview, Mitchell recalled always having had
a love for art. She remembers seeing her first Picassos and
Matisses at the house of Frederick S. Mendel, a classmate's
grandfather, who in 1964 started the museum where her show is now
running. Her formal art training lasted only one year, at an art
school in Calgary, Alberta, in the early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turbulent Indigo,'' one of the 20 album covers she has painted
over the last 32 years, graces the exhibition's poster and the
cover of its catalog. A self-portrait in blue tones, it shows
Mitchell wearing a bandage over her right ear in a reference to van
Gogh's 1889 self-portrait. Mitchell painted it in 1995, a period
when she felt that the music industry was ignoring her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of all the painters I felt most kindred to, I felt most
touched by van Gogh,'' she said. ``Van Gogh was impulsive. For him,
art was like sex on the kitchen table.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell readily acknowledges that she is vulnerable to charges
of dilettantism. After addressing an artists' conference in 1993 on
one of her frequent visits home, she read an article in The Star
Phoenix, Saskatoon's daily newspaper, in which local painter was
quoted as saying that he didn't need a rich rock star telling him
that she was a serious artist.
</P>
<P>
   In her defense, she said she devoted herself obsessively to her
paintings, sometimes neglecting her music to stay up all night to
rework a painting in her home studio. Of one oil, she said: ``That
piece wouldn't let me eat, sleep, go to the bathroom. It was
completely compelling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The art world has a problem with my day job,'' she continued.
``The main trouble with showing my work is that people have a hard
time, knowing that I am a musician. They say I am a folkie, a
rocker, whatever. This is not a renaissance culture. This is a
culture of specialists.''
</P>
<P>
   The show opens with what she calls her cubist works, montages of
brightly colored scenes representing different views of a
California beach.
</P>
<P>
   Although she has lived in California since 1968, she prefers
Canadian scenes, often painted from snapshots taken during visits
here. ``I go home for renewal,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She has drawn particular praise from some critics for ``40 Below
0,'' a 1995 oil depicting an untracked winter road cutting across a
snowy landscape while a warm sun sinks over a farm horizon.
</P>
<P>
   She described the jeep ride with Freed that inspired the work.
``We were driving on what might be considered the bleakest stretch
of road, on the bleakest time of year,'' Mitchell said. ``When I
got out, crystals formed all over the inside of the windshield.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were the prairies, the stretch of the wind, the movement
of the clouds, the skies, all lilac-y and yellow. The windbreak was
burgundy, the snow was pink with the sun going down. It was such a
rush of color. To be so cold it could kill you in 15 minutes, and
yet to look so warm. I felt like a salmon smelling its native
stream.''

A DOCTOR'S DISCOVERY REVISES THE HISTORY OF MEDICAL IMAGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
 By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A medical doctor with a scholarly interest in pre-Columbian art
appears to have pushed back the date of the earliest scientific
medical illustration by several centuries with his study of bizarre
two-faced ancient Mexican figurines known to art historians as the
``pretty ladies of Tlatilco.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gordon Bendersky, a visiting scholar in the department of
history at the University of Pennsylvania, made the discovery a
couple of years ago when leafing through journals and textbooks on
pre-Columbian art. He noticed pictures of figurines unearthed since
1942 in Tlatilco, which is now part of Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   Standing 3 inches to 12 inches tall, the figurines, which were
created over a period of 500 years beginning in 1200 B.C., have
short flipperlike arms, flaring thighs, small breasts, wasplike
waists and a somewhat whimsical hairdo.
</P>
<P>
   A few dozen of the figurines have an even more grotesque feature
_ two faces on a single head. Some have two heads on one neck and
some have two heads on two necks.
</P>
<P>
   Art historians have long considered the two faces to be a
representation of mythical beings. But, as Bendersky scanned the
pages of the documents before him, he was suddenly struck by the
similarities between the monstrous pretty ladies of Tlatilco and a
rare congenital aberration called diprosopus that he had come
across while a medical student.
</P>
<P>
   Bendersky's initial suspicion caused him to embark on what
proved to be a two-year program of research to learn whether or not
his guess could be correct.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he says, he is convinced that he has identified ``the
oldest scientifically medical images in world history.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tremendously exciting to think that the Tlatilco
artists appeared to be the very first to marry art with medical
science,'' said Bendersky, who retired this year as professor of
internal medicine at the MCP Hahnemann University School of
Medicine in Philadelphia..
</P>
<P>
   He is not alone in his enthusiasm. Dr. Robert Perlman, editor of
the journal Perspectives in Biology and Medicine in which
Bendersky's article on the figurines will appear in early
September, said he and his peer-review panel found Bendersky's
argument ``throughly convincing.''
</P>
<P>
   Perlman added: ``I think it was the Nobel prize-winner Albert
Szent-Gyorgyi who said that discovery consists of seeing what
everybody has seen and thinking what nobody has thought. That's
Gordon Bendersky. Lots of people had seen these figurines before,
but he was the first to think that they might represent human
congenital anomalies.''
</P>
<P>
   Diprosopus is an exceedingly rare  &UR; -------------------- &LR;  birth
defect, with only about 85 cases reported since 1642. The
condition, which invariably results in stillbirth, is caused by
abnormal splitting of primitive fetal organs. It can result in
facial duplication, heart abnor- malities and duplication or
complete absence of a brain. Scientists suspect that excess
embroyologic tissue L plays a role, and that both genetic factors
and environmental stresses early in development of the embryo could
be at work.
</P>
<P>
   After tracking down and examining hundreds of ceramic figurines
and comparing them to photographic illustrations of two-faced
Siamese twins, he concluded that the sculptors of ancient Tlatilco
must have studied cases of diprosopus ``very thoroughly,'' as he
later wrote. The sculptors, he explained, had not let their
imaginations run wild with the creation of figurines with three or
five faces or with faces stacked on top of one another. Instead,
they had strictly limited their ceramic models to naturally
occurring diprosopus _ two faces side by side.
</P>
<P>
   In order to determine whether or not the Tlatilco figurines are
in fact the world's oldest, Bendersky studied other ancient
representations of human deformities, including the morbidly obese
Paleolithic statuette, Venus of Willendorf, a six-toed statue from
Ain Ghazal in Jordan, and a representation of the ancient Egyptian
dwarf Seneb.
</P>
<P>
   Although older than the Tlatilco figurines, these objects fail
to qualify as medical illustrations, Bendersky concluded. In
addition to being crudely schematic rather than drawn from nature,
they are portrayals of a particular deity or person who happens by
chance to have an abnormality rather than being representative of a
disease or deformity so as to provide diagnostic value.
</P>
<P>
   The result, he was able to say, was that the degree of accuracy
in documenting anatomical and pathological features in a human head
does not appear after the Tlatilco figurines for another 2,000
years or more until the 16th century works of Hans Baldung Grien
and Andreas Vesalius, who both did anatomical drawings based in
dissected corpses.
</P>
<P>
   But as far as Bendersky has gone to explain the pretty ladies of
Tlatilco, he has not been able to fathom their cultural meaning.
What could explain the fascination of the early Mesoamericans with
two-facedness? How was it possible that a prehistoric civilization
that had yet to develop the wheel, metal tools, the domestication
of animals and a sophisticated written language could have
developed an extraordinarily acute power of scientific observation?
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know the answer to that,'' said Bendersky. ``The only
way we might understand it would be to discover a written language
used by these ancient peoples and that, I'm afraid, doesn't seem
likely.''

`MOMENTS' FOR MILK FINDS UBIQUITOUS `SURVIVORS' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ill., Calif.)   By PATRICIA WINTERS LAURO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The creators of the long-running ``milk mustache'' campaign saw
a natural connection between the need to drink milk and the hit CBS
television show ``Survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We always like to have a fun twist on the nutritional value of
milk and the whole idea of `Survivor' fits,'' said Kurt Graetzer,
chief executive of the Milk Processor Education Program, which
represents milk processors and sponsors the campaign with Dairy
Management Inc., representing dairy farmers.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the four remaining survivors of the show will don
milk mustaches in a specially made print ad appearing Wednesday,
the day the final episode of ``Survivor'' is broadcast. The
headline is ``What the last remaining survivor dreams of wearing
tomorrow.'' The winning survivor then is to appear alone in a full
page ad on Thursday in USA Today, and in newspapers and some weekly
magazines over the next week or more, said Sal Taibi, account
services director at Bozell New York, the True North Communications
unit that created the milk mustache campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Like others, ranging from Reebok International to Playboy
magazine, who have sought out the ``Survivor'' cast, the producer
of the milk ads is trying to capitalize on the cast members' 15
minutes of fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's relevant to everyone because they are in the news, and it
helps us to cut through the clutter,'' said Craig Plymesser, vice
president of milk marketing at Dairy Management Inc. ``We are
picking up on their instant celebrityship, if you will, and using
them to carry the message of milk and the calcium crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the overall estimated $50 million milk mustache print
campaign is intended to piggyback on celebrity and change the image
of milk from wholesome to hip. Some 100 celebrities have worn
mustaches in the campaign since it was introduced in 1995, Taibi
said.
</P>
<P>
   But to keep the campaign fresh, Bozell often uses celebrities of
the moment. This year Bozell ran an ad of the tennis champions and
sisters Venus and Serena Williams. The ad ran the day after Venus
Williams won Wimbledon, and was headlined ``Make ours doubles.''
The Dixie Chicks appeared with mustaches the day after winning a
Grammy Award in March. And a milk mustache ad of the winning
quarterback the day after the Super Bowl is now almost a standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We find it really works, it's a way, for a moment, of truly
getting a blip on the awareness meter, and then what happens is
that over time, people begin to recognize that milk is a drink for
today's lifestyle,'' Graetzer said. The ads may be short-lived, but
their immediacy and novelty outweigh any drawbacks, Taibi said.
``On the morning after, when everyone is talking about it, we'll
already have that person in an ad endorsing milk. And everyone's
wondering how we did that.''
</P>
<P>
   And that conversation is valuable. According to BSMG, Chicago,
the True North Communications unit that handles publicity for the
milk campaign, some 250 television stations, The New York Times and
The Associated Press did reports about the Super Bowl milk mustache
ads in January. BSMG calculated that the coverage accounted for 29
million viewers or readers, based on circulation and ratings
information.
</P>
<P>
   The publicity is all part of the program, of course. For the
Super Bowl, the milk campaign typically runs an ad of the opposing
quarterbacks of the big game on the day of the bowl, followed by an
ad of the winning quarterback. BSMG interviews the quarterbacks
about the advertising shoot, and then releases the interviews to TV
stations to use during their pre- and postgame coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The ads, which Bozell has dubbed its ``moments'' campaign, came
about after the campaign garnered a huge windfall of publicity over
an ad that featured President Clinton and his Republican opponent,
Bob Dole, on the eve of the 1996 presidential election. Coverage of
that single ad led to 189 print news articles and 36 television
reports, accounting for 107 million viewer-readers, according to
BSMG.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Bozell has a staff of three people whose jobs resemble
those of reporters more than ad people as they track the daily news
for up-and-coming celebrities, and for a dramatic story like that
of the Williams sisters who trained their whole lives together and
then had to compete against each other at Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   While a typical celebrity ad for the milk mustache campaign
could take months, from lining up a celebrity to scheduling the
photo shoot, the moment's ads are turned around in a few days.
Logistics are key and the entire process is lined up in advance and
staged, Taibi said.
</P>
<P>
   For the ``Survivors'' ads, the four remaining survivors were
photographed, together and separately, on a beach in Malibu on
Friday. The group was paid an undisclosed standard group fee.
Individuals are paid a standard $25,000 fee for a few hours work.
As in sporting events, Bozell does not know who the final survivor
will be, and must wait to release the proper ad for publication
immediately after the show is broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   One big advantage of milk's ``moment'' ads is that often Bozell
is catching the star on the rise. That usually means the celebrity
is not yet overexposed and also less likely to turn them down.
Though the mustache campaign is now so much part of the culture
that Taibi says many celebrities consider being part of the
campaign a validation of their status in the pop culture, stars do
turn down the campaign. But so far, Bozell has never been rejected
for a ``moments'' ad, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the moment ads do have an element of risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always have a generic ad in our back pocket, and if one of
the people we have doesn't win, we'd just run that generic ad and
no one would know the difference,'' he said.

A Nice Possibility For a Very Long Stroll  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The opening of the American Discovery Trail, the United States'
first coast-to-coast, nonmotorized trail, will be celebrated on
September 2 in San Francisco, at Crissy Field in the Presidio. The
six-hour event will begin at 11 a.m., with an opening ceremony at 1
p.m. The event will include booths with trail information and the
latest outdoor gear, and appearances by people who have navigated
all or part of the trail. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 6,356-mile trail runs from Cape Henlopen State Park in
Delaware to Limantour Beach in Point Reyes National Seashore, about
45 miles north of San Francisco. In the Midwest, it splits into two
branches _ a northern route through Indiana, Illinois, Iowa and
Nebraska, and a southern route through Indiana, Illinois, Missouri
and Kansas. All told, it traverses 15 states and the District of
Columbia. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Along its route, the trail passes through hundreds of small
towns and urban centers like Kansas City, Denver and Cincinnati,
and it leads to 14 national parks, 16 national forests and 10,000
sites of historic, cultural and natural significance. The diverse
terrain includes back-country footpaths, city streets and canal
towpaths. The entire length of the trail can be walked, and many
segments are open to bicycles and horses as well. According to the
American Discovery Trail Society, the nonprofit group coordinating
local efforts to maintain the trail, it is expected that people
living near the Discovery Trail rather than long-distance
backpackers will be the most frequent users. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The trail's opening culminates an 11-year effort to select a
route in consultation with local, state and federal land managers,
to create links between existing trails, and to place signs in the
states through which it passes. For information about the trail and
available guidebooks and maps, call the American Discovery Trail
Society at (800) 663-2387, or go to www.discoverytrail.org.

   AUTO TRAIN HOPING TO QUICKEN DELIVERY  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Amtrak Auto Train, which carries automobiles and passengers
between the Washington area and the Orlando area, has opened a new
station at its northern terminal, in Lorton, Va. Its platform is
now long enough to accommodate the entire train rather than half,
which was the case previously, and is expected to reduce the time
needed by Auto Train staff to unload vehicles. New waiting areas
with 450 seats, food service and bigger restrooms are also part of
the building.
</P>
<P>
   The Auto Train operates once a day in each direction, leaving
Lorton and Sanford, Fla., at 4 p.m. and arriving at 8:30 a.m. the
next day. Lorton is 25 miles south of the capital; Sanford is on
the outskirts of Orlando. Each train can handle about 270 vehicles
and has 16 cars for passengers, including three dining cars. The
fare for the 855-mile trip includes a dinner and Continental
breakfast; sleeping car berths cost extra.
</P>
<P>
   The southbound peak season is from mid-October to mid-January,
when an advance-purchase fare for a car or sports utility vehicle,
a driver and one passenger might cost $466 one way. The peak season
northbound is from mid-March to mid-May. Amtrak adjusts fares
depending on demand and the length of advance booking. Auto Train:

COSTA RICA GIVES HOTELS ENVIRONMENTAL RATINGS
</P>
<P>
   The Costa Rican Tourism Institute, which oversees the national
tourist board, has created a Web site with a listing of hotels that
have been rated for their efforts to improve the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Each hotel that applies for a voluntary Certificate of
Sustainable Tourism from the institute undergoes a two-day
inspection. In addition to the hotel's ecological effects, the
inspection looks at the impact of the hotel on the quality of life
and the cultural heritage of its community.
</P>
<P>
   The certification program considers the interaction between the
hotel and its habitat; its water, energy and product management
systems; the relationship between the hotel and the local community
and culture, and to what extent its guests are invited to
participate in the hotel's efforts. The hotel is rated from 1 to 5,
with 1 the lowest rating in any category, and each hotel receives
an overall rating.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site, www.turismo-sostenible.co.cr/EN/home.shtml,
available in English and Spanish, provides a directory searchable
by province, number of rooms, the hotel's setting and its level of
certification. None of the 46 certified hotels has achieved a 5
over all, but three have earned a 4: Observatorio Volcan Arenal in
Alajuela Province, near the country's most active volcano; Heredura
Hotel, a resort and conference center in Heredia Province; and the
Rosa Blanca Country Inn, also in Heredia.

   The Frederik Meijer Gardens and Sculpture Park, opened five
years ago on the eastern edge of Grand Rapids, Mich., is more than
doubling its indoor space with a 65,000-square-foot expansion. With
the Sept. 15 opening of the two-story addition, the 118-acre
botanical garden and sculpture park will be complemented by three
indoor sculpture galleries, an 850-seat lecture hall with modern
audio-visual equipment, classrooms, a garden shop and a cafe.
</P>
<P>
   The new sculpture complex will open with ``Richard Hunt:
American Visionary,'' exhibiting work by the Chicago artist who is
creating a 25-foot-tall winged column for the Meijer's permanent
collection. That collection includes Nina Akamu's 24-foot-high
``Leonardo da Vinci's Horse,'' the duplicate of her sculpture based
on Leonardo's plans that was donated to Milan last year, and works
by prominent artists such as Alexander Calder (``Polychrome
Lures''), Deborah Butterfield and Marshall Fredericks.
</P>
<P>
   The Frederik Meijer Gardens, 1000 East Beltline Northeast, Grand
Rapids, (888) 957-1580, www.meijergardens.org, are off I-96. Hours
are 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily, except noon to 5 on Sunday. Admission
is $5, $4 65 or older, and $2 ages 5 to 13. A guided tram tour is
$1. All areas are wheelchair accessible.

   AT HARVARD, A SPOTLIGHT ON THE ROMANESQUE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Before and After the End of Time: Architecture and the Year
1000,'' an exhibition that was scheduled to open August 26 at the
Fogg Museum at Harvard University, is an overview of Romanesque
architecture, which preceded the Gothic cathedrals in Europe.
Romanesque was a rediscovery of the masonry techniques of the Roman
empire, characterized by rounded arches, domed vaults and cut-stone
masonry that emphasize the power of mass, space and gravity, rather
than the more ethereal vertical aspirations of the Gothic.
</P>
<P>
   Included in the exhibition are 12 gemstones representing the
ones from which the foundations of the new Jerusalem of John's Book
of Revelation were to be made; they present a striking contrast to
the massive buildings of the Romanesque. The exhibition is
punctuated with examples of expressive, humanistic 12th-century
sculpture from France and Spain. Renderings by the Harvard art
historian Kenneth J. Conant on the 11th century transformation of
the Benedictine abbey at Cluny, France, are being shown to the
public for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely-seen architectural photography by the architect Henry
Hobson Richardson, whose late 19th century Romanesque Revival style
was particularly influential in the United States, is also on
display.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition will be at the Fogg Museum, 32 Quincy Street,
Cambridge, Mass., through Jan. 21. The Fogg is open Monday through
Saturday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., and Sunday 1 to 5 p.m.; closed
holidays. Admission is $5; $4 for ages 61 and above; $3 for college
students; free for children under 18 and for everyone on Wednesdays
and Saturdays until noon; (617) 495-9400.

CITIES, COUNTIES CHALLENGE VIRGINIA LAW RESTRICTING HOW RESIDENTS
ARE COUNTED IN CENSUS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Houston and San Antonio are joining 13 other U.S.
cities and counties in challenging a Virginia law that restricts
how state residents can be counted in the national census.
</P>
<P>
   Their argument is that federal funding for welfare programs
would be unfairly slashed if Texas adopted a similar restriction.
</P>
<P>
   The Virginia statute, now before a federal court, requires that
sampling not be used in the state to supplement the direct count of
individuals. Virginia enacted the law in response to President
Clinton's plan to use sampling to account for citizens, primarily
minorities, who are historically missed by census takers. Sampling
uses a mathematical formula to account for those who were missed.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas cities and other jurisdictions challenging the law
argue that using sampling methods is necessary for a true
population count, which is critical for a fair and accurate
distribution of federal funds for social welfare programs.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Census Bureau data indicate that Texas missed out on $1
billion in federal assistance following the 1990 Census, which
failed to count 66,745 people in Houston, primarily minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Notwithstanding the patent discriminatory impact and inequity
that result from using inaccurate census data for redistricting
purposes, (Virginia) has enacted a law that requires the use of
less accurate unadjusted data for such purposes,'' argued Brian
Currey of Los Angeles and Karen Wahle of Washington, attorneys for
the local governments.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the cities joining the lawsuit are Los Angeles: San
Francisco; Oakland and Denver. The Virginia chapter of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People also has filed
papers with the U.S. District Court in Washington challenging the
state law.
</P>
<P>
   But Virginia Attorney General Mark Earley said a head count is
the only way to get a true population figure, adding that
supplementing the result with mathematical formulas would cause
inaccuracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Numbers, rather than guesses, have been, and should continue
to be, used to redraw political boundaries,'' Earley spokesman
Randy Davis said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In the court case, Virginia is trying to head off a Justice
Department challenge to the state's new law by getting the federal
court's approval of the statute. The cities, counties and local
NAACP are supporting the Justice Department's opposition to the
law.
</P>
<P>
   Under the federal Voting Rights Act, Virginia, like Texas, must
get the approval of the Justice Department or a federal court
before the state can put in place a law that affects the political
representation of minorities. Virginia, suspecting that Clinton's
Justice Department would not approve of the new law, has opted to
go to court.
</P>
<P>
   The three-judge panel that will hear the case has not scheduled
arguments.
</P>
<P>
   Houston and other proponents of sampling were dealt a blow last
year when the Supreme Court struck down Clinton's plans to use the
method for the count that is used in the federal apportionment of
the 435 House seats among the 50 states.
</P>
<P>
   After the court's ruling, the president said he would use
statistics to conduct what will effectively be a second census
count, to calculate population patterns for the doling out of
federal funds.
</P>
<P>
   But many Republican lawmakers fear Democratic state legislators
will manipulate the statistical result to redraw state district
lines to include more minorities, a traditionally strong voting
bloc for Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The 1990 Census, conducted by traditional head count, missed 8
million people, including 66,745 in Houston, according to the
Census Bureau. The 1990 Census in Texas undercounted Hispanics by
5.4 percent compared with 3.9 percent for blacks and 2.6 percent
for Non-Hispanic whites and Asians, the bureau reported.
</P>
<P>
   Houston's total estimated undercount of 3.9 percent that year
was the highest of any major city, while Texas' 2.8 percent was
second to New Mexico's.

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  The nonfiction lists for October are dominated by biographies and
memoirs.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three memoirists pick up where they left off.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Liars' Club,'' Mary Karr chronicled her harrowing and
hilarious working-class childhood in East Texas and Colorado.
``Cherry'' (Viking, $24) describes her junior high and high school
years, leading up to her decision to light out for California.
</P>
<P>
   Homer Hickam grew up half a continent away, in Coalwood, W.Va.
His new ``The Coalwood Way'' (Delacorte, $23.95) continues the
portrait of small-town life the future NASA engineer began in
1998's ``Rocket Boys.''
</P>
<P>
   And Malachy McCourt, who regaled us with stories of his
misbegotten youth in ``A Monk Swimming,'' describes his career in
radio, television and movies and his battles with the bottle and
cancer in ``Singing My Him Song'' (HarperCollins, $25).
</P>
<P>
   The big biographies of the season certainly include James Atlas'
``Bellow'' (Random House, $35). Written with Bellow's cooperation,
it is a candid, detailed and eminently readable life of the Nobel
Prize winner widely considered the finest living American novelist.
</P>
<P>
   Another American icon is treated in journalist Richard Ben
Cramer's long-awaited ``Joe DiMaggio: The Hero's Life'' (Simon &AMP;
Schuster, $30).
</P>
<P>
   Lewis' ``W.E.B. DuBois'' (Henry Holt, $35) carries the black
leader's life from World War I until his death in 1963. The first
volume, published in 1994, won the Bancroft, Parkman and Pulitzer
prizes, making it one of the most-honored biographies of the last
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe is always interesting, although his new book doesn't look
to be a major addition to his oeuvre. ``Hooking Up'' (Farrar,
Straus &AMP; Giroux, $25) combines reportage on subjects ranging from
the sexual mores of teens to television magazine-show stings with
Wolfe's novella ``Ambush at Fort Bragg'' and a short story.
</P>
<P>
   Anna Deavere Smith, best known for her one-woman plays based on
interviews with people from communities in crisis went to
Washington, D.C., to observe how politicians speak. The result is
``Talk to Me: Listening Between the Lines'' (Random House, $24.95).
</P>
<P>
   Political specimens more impressive, perhaps, can be found in
this pair of biographies. In ``Founding Brothers: The Revolutionary
Generation'' (Knopf, $26) Joseph J. Ellis, winner of the National
Book Award for his biography of Thomas Jefferson, explores the
intertwined lives of John Adams, Alexander Hamilton, George
Washington and the rest of the let's-start-a-nation gang.
Meanwhile, Texas A&AMP;M professor H.M. Brand takes the measure of
polymath Ben Franklin in ``The First American'' (Doubleday, $35).
</P>
<P>
   Franklin experimented with lightning, but for real sparks you
can't beat opera diva Maria Callas and tycoon Aristotle Onassis.
Nicholas Gage claims access to new information in ``Greek Fire''
(Knopf, $26).
</P>
<P>
   Kingsolver, McMurtry and John Updike have fiction due in
November.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Poisonwood Bible,'' Kingsolver's 1998 novel, has sold more
than a million copies in hardcover and paperback and made her the
hottest name in literary fiction (the book is still on the
paperback best-seller list). Set in southern Appalachia, ``Prodigal
Summer'' (HarperCollins, $26) weaves together three sets of
characters who ``find their connections to one another and to the
flora and fauna with whom they share a place,'' says the publisher.
</P>
<P>
   McMurtry keeps threatening to quit writing fiction, but
fortunately for us that's all talk so far. His last, ``Duane's
Depressed,'' was his best in years. For the new one, ``Boone's
Lick'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $26), he returns to the 19th-century
American West. The story involves an extended family's trek from
Missouri to Wyoming and climaxes with the notorious 1866 Fetterman
Massacre, in which Plains Indians slaughtered some 80 U.S. soldiers
near Fort Phil Kearny in a fight that prefigured the Battle of the
Little Bighorn.
</P>
<P>
   Updike's ``Licks of Love'' (Knopf, $25) collects a dozen short
stories to which the author has appended a novella-length piece
titled ``Rabbit Remembered,'' a sequel to his quartet of novels
about Harry ``Rabbit'' Angstrom. The dead man's survivors
``fitfully entertain his memory while pursuing their own happiness
over the edge of the millennium,'' says the publisher.
</P>
<P>
   England's Beryl Bainbridge fictionalizes the complex
relationship between 18th-century man of letters Samuel Johnson and
his benefactress, Hester Thrale, in ``According to Queeney''
(Carroll &AMP; Graf, $22).
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the irrepressible sleuth Kay Scarpetta returns for
another go at the bad guys in Patricia Cornwell's ``The Last
Precinct'' (Putnam, $26.95).
</P>
<P>
   Nonfiction titles include the first volume of Arthur M.
Schlesinger Jr.'s memoirs. ``A Life in the Twentieth Century''
(Houghton Mifflin, $27) carries the renowned public intellectual's
story from his birth in 1917 to 1950.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Boom'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $25) journalist Bob Woodward
tries to explain how our present economic happy days came about.
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan figures in that story, of
course. He moves front and center in Justin Martin's ``Citizen
Greenspan: The Man Behind the Money'' (Perseus, $27.50), which
explores the private man as well as the public life.
</P>
<P>
   Debora Silverman looks afresh at the relationship between two
fountainheads of 20th-century painting in ``Van Gogh and Gauguin:
The Search for Sacred Art'' (Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, $50), while
Gary Giddens, much praised for his ``Visions of Jazz,'' examines
the early career of a great American crooner in ``Bing Crosby: A
Pocketful of Dreams _ The Early Years, 1903-1940'' (Little, Brown,
$27.95).

A FALL HARVEST: PUBLISHERS PROMISE BUMPER CROP OF TITLES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By FRITZ LANHAM 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
Admittedly, there's not even a hint of autumnal nip in the air. But
look at the calendar: August is melting away. School has already
started. As far as American publishers are concerned, fall is upon
us.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The weeks between now and Christmas have traditionally seen the
bulk of the A-list books for the year _ the novels by big names,
the controversy-provoking polemics, the fat and formidable
biographies.
</P>
<P>
   This year's crop looks fairly impressive:
</P>
<P>
   We'll see novels by Barbara Kingsolver, Gore Vidal, Carlos
Fuentes, Margaret Atwood, Alice Walker and Larry McMurtry (who,
bless him, has spared us another prequel/sequel).
</P>
<P>
   The nonfiction offerings include a new collection by Tom Wolfe
featuring both journalism and short fiction. Also look for a major
biography of literary lion Saul Bellow, part two of David Levering
Lewis' Pulitzer Prize-winning life of civil rights activist W.E.B.
DuBois and Port Arthur native Mary Karr's sequel to her acclaimed
memoir ``The Liars' Club.''
</P>
<P>
   So here's a rundown of titles arriving in stores beginning in
September.
</P>
<P>
   For whatever reason, historical novels seem the rage. Of course,
they have never disappeared, but their number and quality seem to
be on the rise. This may say more about our own dull times than
anything else.
</P>
<P>
   From Doubleday comes Vidal's ``Golden Age'' ($27.50), in which
he continues the fictional chronicle of American history begun in
1973 with ``Burr.'' The new book covers the years from 1939 to 1954
_ World War II and the beginnings of the Cold War _ and mixes
fictional characters with such real-life actors as Franklin and
Eleanor Roosevelt, newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst and
Vidal himself.
</P>
<P>
   From the catalog description the plot of Atwood's ``The Blind
Assassin`` (Doubleday, $26) is impossible to fathom _ something
about a woman who drives her car off a bridge in 1945 and a
novel-within-the-novel. But the publisher promises a book that
unfolds ``layer by astonishing layer'' and an ending ``at once
shockingly unexpected and wonderfully satisfying.'' Atwood almost
never disappoints.
</P>
<P>
   The lives of 19th-century composer Robert Schumann and his
pianist-wife, Clara, get fictional treatment in J.D. Landis'
``Longing'' (Harcourt, $26). Landis, whose previous novel was the
well-received ``Lying in Bed,'' claims to have kept closely to the
facts in his reading of one of history's great love affairs.
</P>
<P>
   From England's Kazuo Ishiguro comes ``When We Were Orphans''
(Knopf, $25). The publisher is at pains to assure us that this
novel harkens back in its accessibility to the author's beloved
``Remains of the Day'' rather than to his last book, the dense and
disappointing ``Unconsoled.''
</P>
<P>
   Set in the 1930s, the story involves an English detective who
returns to Shanghai, the city of his birth, to investigate the
mystery of his parents' disappearance years before.
</P>
<P>
   Jumping from the past to the future presents us with two novels
from familiar figures. Ursula K. Le Guin, doyenne of literate
sci-fi fiction, has another in her Hainish cycle. In ``The
Telling'' (Harcourt, $24) an observer from Earth lands in a world
where a monolithic state has abolished the past and reduced every
citizen to a consumer-producer. Think China of the Cultural
Revolution, says the publisher.
</P>
<P>
   Caleb Carr, whose best-selling ``Alienist'' and less-selling
``Angel of Darkness'' were set in late-19th-century New York, sets
``Killing Time'' (Random House, $25.95) in that city in the year
2023. America's female president has been assassinated, and someone
has doctored the video footage of the event. New-millen-nium
criminologist Dr. Gideon Wolfe is on the case.
</P>
<P>
   Turning to September nonfiction, we find a political biography
already making news _ historian Herbert Bix's ambitious and
extensively researched ``Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan''
(HarperCollins, $35). Bix portrays Hirohito as a dynamic emperor
who exerted considerable influence on events of the war years yet
succeeded in projecting an image of passivity.
</P>
<P>
   Hirohito's wartime ally is the subject of Ian Kershaw's
``Hitler: 1937-1945: Nemesis'' (Norton, $35). The first volume of
this biography was widely praised, and the completed work promises
to be the best treatment of Hitler's life in English.
</P>
<P>
   What more could there be to say about Richard Nixon? Biographer
Anthony Summers (``Official and Confidential: The Secret Life of J.
Edgar Hoover'') claims to have dug into the man's public and
private life and produced ``compelling evidence of Nixon's
addiction to intrigue and to money,'' in the words of his
publisher. The book is ``Arrogance of Power: The Secret World of
Richard Nixon'' (Viking, $34.95).
</P>
<P>
   Stephen E. Ambrose, probably the most popular historian working
today, tells the story of the men who built the transcontinental
railroad in ``Nothing Like It in the World'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster,
$28).
</P>
<P>
   Ted Koppel writes about personalities (Slobodan Milosevic),
politics (the Clinton impeachment), personal matters (his boyhood
in England) and more in ``Off Camera: Private Thoughts Made
Public'' (Knopf, $25).
</P>
<P>
   Cartoons aren't just for kids anymore. Cultural critic Ilan
Stavans and illustrator Lalo Alcaraz have combined for the witty
yet ultimately serious ``Latino USA: A Cartoon History'' (Basic
Books, $19.95).
</P>
<P>
   In the medical field ``Waging the War'' (Random House, $25.95)
by Robert Cooke promises to be big. It's the story of the
revolutionary theories of cancer researcher Dr. Judah Folkman.
Former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop wrote the foreword.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there's ``Arming America: The Origins of a National Gun
Culture'' (Knopf, $30). Historian Michael A. Bellesiles punctures
the myth that gun ownership was widespread in early America. Not
until the Civil War era did guns become commonplace, he argues.
</P>
<P>
   October brings new fiction from established literary figures and
relatively new faces.
</P>
<P>
   Among the former: Alice Walker (``The Color of Purple'') has a
collection of stories based on her life. ``The Way Forward Is With
a Broken Heart'' (Random House, $23.95) is the title.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Fuentes, who, like Walker, could use a hit. ``The Years of
Laura Diaz'' (Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, $26) begins, like Fuentes'
masterpiece ``The Death of Artemio Cruz,'' in the state of Veracruz
early in the century. Through the life of Diaz _ artist, political
activist, mother, lover of great men _ Fuentes explores the
troubled history of modern Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Armistead Maupin (``Tales of the City,'' ``Further Tales of the
City'') returns after an eight-year absence with ``The Night
Listener'' (HarperCollins, $26), about a writer for a cult-hit
radio show and a 13-year-old boy sexually abused by his parents.
Sounds like heavy stuff.
</P>
<P>
   From Ha Jin, the young Chinese-American writer who won a
National Book Award last year for his novel ``Waiting,'' comes a
collection of stories, ``The Bridegroom'' (Pantheon, $22).
</P>
<P>
   Jane Hamilton, whose first-rate novels (``The Book of Ruth,''
``A Map of the World'') won a much wider audience when Oprah
sprinkled her fairy dust over them, returns with ``Disobedience''
(Doubleday, $24.95), about a 17-year-old youth who stumbles onto
his mother's e-mail affair with a violin-maker.
</P>
<P>
   And for Anne Rice fans there's ``Merrick'' (Knopf, $26.95), a
ragout of witches and vampires set in New Orleans and the world
beyond.

would have made this fire season less devastating. One
controversial measure, known as forest thinning, allows more
logging in places where forests have become too dense. But in many
places around the country, environmentalists have successfully

unions, which makes provisions on these issues and many more, has

accusations that the company has links to traffic in diamonds from
Africa's war zones. But it has also had to face a much bigger
challenge: that its huge stockpile of diamonds, used to help
control the supply and keep world prices high, had become a costly
albatross. Now, De Beers is using the controversy over so-called
blood diamonds to advance a strategic switch to address its
commercial problems. The plan is to turn De Beers from a stockpile
manager into a branded, high-value diamond-trader that would keep
diamonds from war zones out of the luxury market. Marketing, not
monopoly, would make sure the company maintained its leadership
position. By seizing the moral high ground, De Beers has already
shown signs that its business is turning around. By Alan Cowell.

   RUSSIA-SUBMARINE (Moscow) _ As divers gained entry to the wreck
of the nuclear submarine Kursk and declared it completely flooded
and the 118-member crew dead, Russian Defense Minister Marshal Igor
Sergeyev said in a nationally televised interview Monday that the
military might have made mistakes in how it responded to the
disaster. But he defended the armed forces, saying the institution
had been robbed and stripped in recent years and he disclosed new
information to support the strong suspicion of Russian military and

that also suffered severe damage, but managed to escape undetected.

``working families.'' Neophyte candidates in obscure congressional

appearances; the party's platform championed their needs; and the
presidential nominee himself took up their cause and continued to

   SCI-CHINA-RICE (Undated) _ In a stunning result from what has
become one of the largest agricultural experiments ever, thousands
of rice farmers in China have doubled the yields of their most
valuable crop and nearly eliminated its most devastating disease _
without using chemical treatments or spending a single extra penny.
Under the direction of an international team of scientists, farmers
in China's Yunnan province implemented a simple change in their
rice paddies. Instead of planting the large stands of a single type
of rice, as they typically have done, the farmers planted a mixture
of two different rices. With this one change, growers were able to
radically restrict the incidence of rice blast _ the most important
disease of this most important staple in the world. Within just two
years, farmers were able to abandon the chemical fungicides
previously widely used to fight the disease. By Carol Kaesuk Yoon.

   SCI-RACE-GENES (Undated) _ Scientists have long suspected that
the racial categories recognized by society are not reflected on
the genetic level. But the more closely that researchers examine
the human genome _ the complement of genetic material encased in
the heart of almost every cell of the body _ the more most of them
are convinced that the standard labels used to distinguish people
by ``race'' have little or no biological meaning. They say that
while it may seem easy to tell at a glance whether a person is
Caucasian, African or Asian, the ease dissolves when one probes
beneath surface characteristics and scans the genome for DNA
hallmarks of ``race.'' By Natalie Angier.

   ZAGREB, Croatia _ The chaotic lands of the Balkans have become
the latest gateway to Western Europe for tens of thousands of
illegal immigrants from China, South Asia and Middle Eastern
countries like Iran and Iraq, according to Western diplomats, local
officials and the increasing number of refugees caught &UR;  &LR; making the
journey.
</P>
<P>
   President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia, in particular, has
opened the gates to thousands of Chinese intent on reaching Western
Europe. Under Milosevic, Yugoslavia has cultivated strong ties with
China, which was Belgrade's ally during the war over Kosovo last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav consulates in China freely grant tourist visas to
Chinese, and the legal passage to Yugoslavia eases the way for
illegal entry to the rest of Europe. Typically, the Chinese arrive
by plane in Belgrade, then travel to Bosnia and here to Croatia.
Then they head for the Adriatic coast and hope to reach Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Bosnia has its own flow of illegal immigrants from Iran, Iraq
and other countries with which the Muslim-led government in
Sarajevo maintains strong ties out of gratitude for the support of
Iran and Arab nations during the 1992-95 Bosnian war.
</P>
<P>
   But Croatia is experiencing a staggering increase in human
traffic. Barely a week goes by without a new report of dozens of
Chinese or other migrants being caught on the coast or inland.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities here have caught 10,000 illegal immigrants
trying to cross into Croatia in the first half of this year,
compared with 8,000 in all of 1999. On Aug. 12, for instance, 52
illegal immigrants were sent back to Bosnia, with which Croatia
shares a 1,200-mile, largely mountainous and unpatrolled border. A
few days later, 36 more were caught in the town of Varazdin, close
to the border with Hungary and Slovenia, said Miroslav Cindori, the
head of a detention center outside Zagreb.
</P>
<P>
   In Cindori's center, a converted motel, young men in track suits
and plastic sandals wander around, using sign language to beg for
cigarettes through the wire fence. Mostly Chinese, these men are
illegal immigrants caught by the Croatian authorities, and they now
await deportation. They represent a minuscule part of Europe's
latest headache caused by Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The 85 men and two women detained here have mostly come through
in groups, organized by a shadowy but extensive criminal network of
human traffickers, who are suddenly using the Balkans for access to
Europe, said Duc Tran of the International Organization for
Migration, in Zagreb.
</P>
<P>
   None of the Chinese detainees wanted to talk or be photographed.
But other detainees, from Bangladesh, Tunisia and Iraq, were eager
to talk and urgently asked for help. ``We took the wrong road,''
Shahabuddin, from Dhaka, Bangladesh, explained sheepishly. ``We
wanted to go to Italy, and they stopped us and said, `No, this is
Croatia.'''
</P>
<P>
   Their stories appear to confirm the growing alarm among Western
diplomats and migration officials that a sophisticated and
far-reaching network of human traffickers from Asia has switched
its attention from the United States and is now looking to Europe.
The traffickers have found that the troubled and unruly countries
of the former Yugoslavia, with porous borders and a lack of
immigration laws and agreements, are an ideal gateway to the West.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Croatia recently signed an agreement with Bosnia in
an effort to halt the human flow, but they lack the diplomatic
contacts needed to reach a similar agreement with Milosevic's
government in Belgrade.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (MORE)  &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Chinese gangs have switched the focus of their activities toward
Europe, Tran said. ``There has been a change in the final
destination since the clampdown by the U.S. government, which has
cut down illegal immigration to the United States,'' he said.
``Europe is now the specific destination of the Chinese.''
</P>
<P>
   In past years, Tran has dealt with waves of illegal immigrants
from China who passed through Central America in an attempt to get
to North America. It is estimated that as many as 500,000 Chinese
tried to emigrate last year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A large number of these people are now coming to Europe, taking
advantage of the new Yugoslav route.
</P>
<P>
   ``What triggered it was the granting of visas by Belgrade,''
Tran said. ``Two DC-10's come in a week to Belgrade. You pay $500
to $900 for a ticket, and you are in Belgrade.''
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian capital has a sizable Chinese community and an
entire Chinese section in the vast open-air market that grew up in
Belgrade over the last decade to circumvent sanctions and enable
people in Belgrade to buy smuggled consumer goods. The groups of
Chinese arriving by plane ``are not going to Serbia for business,''
Tran said. ``They may do some trade, but their final destination is
Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   The lucky immigrants who make it through Bosnia and Croatia head
for Italy by boat. Once there, they can travel freely within the
block of European Union countries that are bound by the Schengen
agreement and have abolished passport checks.
</P>
<P>
   Belgrade is almost certainly making money out of the scheme,
said Dr. Thomas O'Rourke, acting chief of mission in Zagreb for the
International Office of Migration. Besides the visa and ticket
sales, there is talk that the Chinese can buy residency permits in
Serbia for a few thousand dollars, Tran said.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats and immigration officials add that Milosevic, already
indicted on charges of war crimes and widely viewed as an
international pariah, may enjoy causing another problem for his
foes. ``He's irritating the West and making money at the same
time,'' said a European diplomat in Zagreb.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the real concern is that the movement of illegal immigrants
appears to be highly organized and run by international criminal
rings who have realized that smuggling people for high fees is more
profitable and less risky than trafficking drugs, Tran said.
</P>
<P>
   The traffic in Chinese migrants in Western Europe came to light
in June when the bodies of 58 Chinese were found in an airtight
container on a truck in Dover, England.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese travel in groups, and are often shipped to
prearranged employers, who then recoup the cost from the
immigrants' wages in sweatshops or restaurants or in the sex trade.
Passage to the West can cost up to $60,000, O'Rourke said. In some
cases, a whole village will join together to send the young men
abroad so they can then support the village with their foreign
earnings, said Cindori of the immigrant detention center.
</P>
<P>
   The latest group of 35 Chinese men in his center were arrested
in the coastal port of Sibenik after they were returned from Italy.
They had no passports and said very little when they arrived,
Cindori said, but after a few days a phone call was made.
</P>
<P>
   Then, he said, their passports started arriving in the mail,
some from Belgrade, some from Sarajevo and some from Zagreb. All
the men are from the same place in China, the coastal province of
Zhejiang. They received tourist visas at the Yugoslav consulate in
nearby Shanghai and flew into Belgrade, Cindori said.
</P>
<P>
   The Muslims who come through Bosnia arrive on flights from
Istanbul and Tehran. A plane arrives from Iran every week and
returns empty, Tran said. ``As soon as they get off the plane,
there are buses waiting outside, and they are gone,'' he said.

   The police said British troops will return to the streets of
Belfast for the first time since September 1998 after the shooting
deaths of two men in violence ascribed to rivalries between
Protestant paramilitary units. The men were crossing a road when a
gunman opened fire, a police spokesman said. Although loyalist

</P>
<P>
   Guerrillas staged dozens of attacks in a bid to disrupt voting
for the region's representative in Russia's parliament, but killed
nine of their own by stumbling into a minefield, the Kremlin said.
The region's president, Aslan Maskhadov, said guerrillas made 73
attacks; the Kremlin counted 47, which killed three Russian

turned out; the rights group Memorial said wartime conditions made
the vote pointless.

Serbia bloc, would get 35 percent of the vote and Milosevic 23
percent. The institute interviewed 1,700 respondents from Serbia,
excluding Kosovo. A survey by the Medium polling agency found 30

PATRIOTS' OFFENSIVE LINE FACES HURDLES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ You've got a left guard (Jason Andersen)
snapping the ball and a center (Damien Woody) playing left guard.
You've got a veteran lineman (Bruce Armstrong) who just got his
first dose of action at left tackle. You're using this guy here and
there. You've got free agents like Grant Williams and Lance Scott
just returning after missing all of training camp with injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Your top draft pick, Adrian Klemm, is still not able to
practice, and veteran right guard Todd Rucci has yet to see the
field.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots' offensive line problems won't be solved before
Thursday's final exhibition game, against Carolina. In an area
where there must be some stability, there is very little, with the
regular season less than two weeks off. Is this unsettling for Drew
Bledsoe? He would never say so publicly. But a quarterback needs to
know that the guys in front will protect him, and right now,
Bledsoe can't feel very confident of that.
</P>
<P>
   While there were better things seen from the offensive line in
Sunday's 31-21 loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, there were also
bad things. For every great block, like the one Max Lane made to
spring Kevin Faulk for a 58-yard touchdown, there was a penalty
committed. Lane even broke his left thumb, though the injury
doesn't appear serious enough to keep him out of action.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a couple of guys who played last night and saw
their first action and it wasn't that extensive, so we'll have to
give more time to those players, and I'm not sure if we'll make a
full evaluation based on what we saw last night,'' said coach Bill
Belichick. ``It's hard to say who fits on the offensive line.
That's the way it's going to be in this league. There'll be times
this season when things won't be perfect and you have to make
adjustments based on that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll do what's best for the team. What's worked in our favor
is the versatility and flexibility.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots are slowly getting their main offensive linemen
back. Armstrong played just one quarter, Williams played about a
quarter, and Scott got in some long snapping and some time at
guard.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick has said he may go with as few as eight offensive
linemen when the final 53-man roster is set by Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   You would have to think that all five linemen who started in the
Tampa Bay game are locks: Armstrong, Andersen, Woody, Lane, and
rookie Greg Robinson-Randall, who has been a stalwart at right
tackle. Belichick also has spoken well of Derrick Fletcher, who had
been playing left guard and then switched to right tackle vs. Tampa
Bay. If you also give the nod to the comebacking Williams and
Scott, that gives you eight.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Rucci has been recovering from arthroscopic knee surgery
and is beginning to run, though he has yet to practice. Rucci was
the starter at right guard, but has he been replaced? Brent Warren
and Ryan Tujague were cut Monday, but still around are impressive
long snapper Loni Paxton, free agent guard Aaron Davis, and guard
Rob Gatrell. Because Scott can play guard and center, it would
appear that Paxton won't survive.
</P>
<P>
   Davis and Gatrell could be put on the practice squad. Klemm, who
also is beginning to run after knee surgery, could be put on the
physically unable to perform list until Week 6 of the season and
wouldn't count against the roster. That goes for Rucci as well.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe wasn't sacked Sunday, which is a sign of progress, but
he was chased out of the pocket and ran for his life a time or two.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what his line looks like right now:
</P>
<P>
   LEFT TACKLE: Armstrong. Got his feet wet and held his own
against Steve White, the right end for Tampa Bay. He may play up to
a half Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   LEFT GUARD: Andersen. Versatility is his strength. Belichick
likes that. Moving him to center to snap in the shotgun formation
is unorthodox and funky. Coaches normally don't like unorthodox and
funky, particularly on the offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   CENTER: Woody. He could be one of the better centers in the
league if he could only solve this problem with the shotgun. Some
scouts thought Woody would be a terrific guard as well as a center.
Maybe he'll move to guard, with Andersen playing center full time,
if the poor snapping continues.
</P>
<P>
   RIGHT GUARD: Lane. Another versatile player. He started his
career as a right tackle but moved to left guard, then left tackle
earlier in the preseason, and now he's in Rucci's right guard spot.
He may be moved again before all is said and done.
</P>
<P>
   RIGHT TACKLE: Robinson-Randall. He made his reputation shutting
down Courtney Brown in a Michigan State-Penn State game last
season. He hasn't been mistake-free in the preseason, but the
Patriots are strong in their conviction that they will come out of
the draft with a top lineman, and Randall appears to be it.
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher looked strong at left guard while he was the starter.
The Patriots want him to be more versatile, which is why he's being
used as a tackle. He's also been used as a defensive tackle in
practice.
</P>
<P>
   Versatility is the word Belichick often uses in describing his
linemen. But at some point he needs to use words like
``outstanding,'' ``terrific,'' and ``superb.'' He seems a long way
from using those superlatives.

PARTY MUSIC THAT'S WORTHY OF SURVIVAL
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MICHAEL D. CLARK 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
Even real-life television must cut to commercials to pay the bills,
but the party of attrition doesn't have to end. Fill those spaces
with a little complementary theme music. Sure, Gloria Gaynor's ``I
Will Survive'' is a nice appetizer, and the ``Gilligan's Island''
theme is cute but obvious.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here are a few other options for the host looking to enhance the
at-home island ritual:
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to the Jungle,'' Guns n' Roses _ A nice first break
just to get everyone into the spirit of Darwinism. The hair-metal
classic is the ``Survivor'' equivalent of Hank Williams Jr.'s
``Monday Night Football'' anthem. ``Are you ready for the Immunity
Challenge?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Two Tribes,'' Frankie Goes to Hollywood _ The 1984 new-wave
song was originally about the Cold War, but it might as well have
forecast the coming of ``Survivor.'' It also should remind people
that while the show's Tagi and Pagong tribes have now
disintegrated, alliances and loyalties are still precious and
fleeting among those remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``Naked Guy,'' Randy Newman _ David Letterman said it best a few
weeks ago: ``What's with that naked fat guy on `Survivor'?'' Thank
you for sharing, Richard.
</P>
<P>
   Anything by the '80s pop band Survivor _ The preference would be
the ``Rocky III'' anthem ``Eye of the Tiger,'' but ``Burning
Heart'' and ``The Moment of Truth'' would all work well and be just
as relevant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rats,'' Pearl Jam _ Ten years from now, will anyone remember
much about ``Survivor'' except that a bunch of people ate rodents
and only one of them got paid for it? Pearl Jam also has a song
called ``Bugs,'' should anyone care to reminisce about the creepy
crawlers living in the sores on Colleen's legs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lord of the Flies,'' Iron Maiden _ A perfect bit of British
heavy metal tension to underscore the walk to the final tribal

start learning the melody to this new-age obscurity.

for his game-show theme music one will never know, but it's an
ideal way to top off a ``Survivor'' celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winner Takes It All,'' ABBA _ A perfect dramatic slice of
fluff to play over the end credits. If the folks at ``Survivor''
piece together a retrospective clip package to end the show, it
would be even more effective cheese.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why Can't We Be Friends?,'' War _ A song of reconciliation
that should make a nice accompanying theme to the reunion special
following the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Land Down Under,'' Men At Work _ Don't forget next season. A
reminder that next season ``Survivor'' will take place on the
Aussie Outback. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   There is no doubt that the Clinton-Gore administration's
proudest economic accomplishment is achievement of a balanced
federal budget. Al Gore would like voters to see him as the
guardian of that legacy and of the budget surplus that has replaced
the deficits of the 1980s and early 1990s. Hence, in his campaign
statements, he makes much of his plans to use more of projected
future surpluses for paying down the national debt than would
George W. Bush. Gore also talks a great deal about the ``cost'' of
Bush's proposed tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   But there is also a cost to Gore's new spending proposals. One
estimate, by the National Taxpayers Union, puts the dollar size of
Gore's new spending at more than $2 trillion over 10 years _ enough
to take up the entire non-Social Security surplus without anything
leftover for tax cuts. (Both candidates rule out spending the
portion of the surplus attributable to Social Security.) Even the
lowest estimates in the press put the figure at well over $1
trillion, with Gore's tax cuts reducing the surplus by an
additional $500 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Gore's initiatives are of a kind that could all too
easily lead to a return of deficits if the budget surpluses don't
materialize as planned. He makes more proposals than Bush for
entitlements _ programs that continue without annual
appropriations. Bush's $1.6 trillion tax cut would also be written
into law as continuing indefinitely. But history shows that
presidents and Congresses are more willing to raise taxes in the
event of a revenue shortfall than they are to cut entitlements.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Gore's and Bush's plans would reduce the surplus by
an equivalent amount, assuming that they both got their way with
Congress and kept all of their promises _ something that is of
course unlikely. Because presidents cannot enact programs on their
own, voters know they must look at the candidates' proposals not
only at face value, but also as an indication of their differing
philosophies of government. In this respect, there is a clear
difference between Gore and Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Gore clearly believes that government should direct and control
the use of the surplus that is not allocated to debt reduction,
whether on the tax side or the spending side. He would increase
government spending substantially more than Bush, would cut taxes
less, and would aim more of his tax cuts to specific taxpayer
behavior _ giving parents a tax credit to pay for their children's
after-school programs, for example. It is fair to characterize most
of Gore's proposed tax cuts as this kind of ``tax expenditures,''
little different substantively from direct spending, except that
they go through the tax code rather than the appropriations
process.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Bush would ``spend'' more of the surplus on
across-the-board tax cuts cuts. Moreover, most of his tax cuts, in
contrast to Gore's, would not depend on taxpayer behavior, but
would be given to all taxpayers in the form of tax rate reductions.
Cutting taxes allows taxpayers to keep more of their money, so that
they, rather than the government, is deciding how to apportion it.
Some may invest their tax savings, and some may spend it, but
either way it will be the taxpayer's decision, not the
government's.
</P>
<P>
   And since the economic stimulus from tax rate reductions is
greater than that from new spending or targeted tax cuts, the net
budgetary cost of Bush's proposals would likely be considerably
less than the gross figure Gore alludes to.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the cost of a presidential candidate's program cannot
be measured solely in terms of its impact on the budget. Many
initiatives could impose large costs on the private sector in the
form of regulations. In this area, too, Gore would seem the
costlier of the candidates. His plans regarding global warming and
health maintenance organizations, for example, would have
substantial costs for private businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The question of whose program costs more is important, but the
``costs'' of federal policies go beyond direct revenue lost or
money spent. The effect on the economy as a whole (and with it,
future tax collections) can be profound, and that is where the deep
philosophical differences of Gore and Bush come seriously into
play.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ When Norwegian divers opened the emergency escape hatch
on the sunken Russian submarine on Sunday, they had done in a day
what Russian rescue workers had not managed in a week. The tragic
story of the Kursk is only the latest evidence that Russia can no
longer afford to maintain the technology created in the Soviet
Union.
</P>
<P>
   The Kursk was a quintessential Soviet creation, huge as the
superpower's ambition, equipped to destroy entire groups of vessels
many times its own size _ and, of course, top-secret. But we now
know that for years the sub has been going to sea without even the
required emergency food and water supplies on board.
</P>
<P>
   The help of Norwegian deep-sea divers was needed because Russia
has none of its own. Some say this is because the country has not
developed the sophisticated equipment necessary for deep-sea
diving, while others claim that ships on which divers would
normally be based have been written off for lack of maintenance. In
other words, the Kursk and nine other huge nuclear submarines could
function only as long as they could avoid accidents.
</P>
<P>
   But the Kursk tragedy has two main protagonists: the submarine
itself and Vladimir Putin, who is facing the first emergency of his
presidency. Like the submarine, Putin is a quintessential product
of the Soviet era. The Communist state's ultimate ambition was to
create a new type of man, and the robot-like qualities of Putin may
be the predictable result.
</P>
<P>
   In the rare interviews when he has discussed his own background,
he has gone to great lengths to define himself as a man average in
every way, taken along by the system and a remarkable fate that
landed him in the country's highest office. There seemed to be a
great discrepancy between his background and his high position _
and now it seems that, like the Kursk and its fleet, Putin lacked
the resources to cope with an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's statements about the Kursk have been meager. At first he
said nothing and refused even to cut short his vacation. Then he
made a brief statement that seemed to indicate that he considered
salvaging the equipment on board Kursk more important than rescuing
the crew.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, on the seventh day since the sinking, when
criticism had reached a deafening pitch, Putin finally decided to
fly back to Moscow. Cornered in Yalta, he defended his decision not
to fly immediately to the area near the disaster. ``I think I did
the right thing,'' Putin said, ``because the arrival of
nonspecialists from any field, the presence of high-placed
officials in the disaster area would not help and more often would
hamper work. Everyone should keep to his place.''
</P>
<P>
   The phrasing was telling. The words for ``highly placed
officials'' literally mean ``top-level bureaucrats.'' Putin could
have said ``executives'' or ``leaders,'' but instead chose words
suggesting that he sees himself as a bureaucrat who should keep to
his place, not a leader who should go where the trouble is.
</P>
<P>
   It was leadership that the people trying to save the Kursk crew
needed most. They needed a leader who, placing human life above
all, would seek foreign assistance from the start, instead of
refusing offers of help until after signs of life stopped coming
from the sub. They needed a leader who would order the names of
sailors on the sub made public immediately, instead of letting
relatives remain in suspense until Day Six, when some journalists
succeeded in buying the information from the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   They needed a leader who would order that relatives of crew
members be granted free vouchers to fly to the rescue site _
instead of forcing relatives to take up a collection to buy the
cheapest available train tickets and undertake a two-day journey.
They needed a leader who would break through the military's natural
urge to err on the side of caution, which compelled the border
control to delay foreign rescue ships for an additional six hours
after they arrived in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has indicated that he knew from the start that most of the
crew were dead and this was why he failed to shift into an
emergency mode. If more people had been alive immediately after the
accident, he seemed to imply, more would have been done sooner.
This kind of mathematics betrays a perfectly Soviet disregard for
the individual.
</P>
<P>
   It is no surprise, ultimately, that at a time of crisis Putin
demonstrated the cog-in-the-wheel mentality on which he was reared.
But the Kursk disaster shows that Russia can no more afford a
Soviet-era ``top-level bureaucrat'' in charge than it can afford to
maintain its Soviet-era nuclear submarines.

<TEXT>
<P>
   President Clinton recently announced a $50 million research
program to advance the early diagnosis and investigate the possible
prevention of Alzheimer's, a disease that now afflicts more than
four million people in our nation. One of them is my father and,
like others who have seen their parents' mental faculties assaulted
by this illness, I was grateful for the president's decision,
wishing only that my father still were young enough to benefit.
</P>
<P>
   In my father's case, there is a poignant irony in his
affliction. He is a neurologist, a specialist in diagnosing
cerebral impairment. For nearly 50 years, he taught neurology at
Harvard Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   He diagnosed himself to a remarkable degree, at least in the
initial stage. Even after moving to a nursing home four years ago,
he still had flashes of apparent recognition of the nature of his
illness. One night in 1996, when I questioned him about the
selectivity of his confusions, he spoke of the degeneration of
brain tissue and alluded to the function of a ``neuron'' and tried
to explain why recent memories were inaccessible while others _
memories of older doctors he had known at Harvard in the 1930s, for
example _ were as fresh and vivid as if these were people he'd just
seen.
</P>
<P>
   When he couldn't find a word he needed to develop an idea, he
didn't seem disturbed, but ``interested,'' like a scientist, to
recognize a symptom of the very chemistry he was describing. I
could imagine him in 1939 leading the interns on grand rounds at
Boston City Hospital, stopping at one bed, then another, to discuss
each case, and then arriving at a patient who presented the most
perfect case of all to illustrate a point that he was making, even
though the patient in this instance was himself.
</P>
<P>
   The lessons on brain chemistry came to an end three years ago.
Today, at 94, my father thinks it is 1912. He speaks about his
grade-school playmates as if I know them. ``Have you seen Ma?''
he'll ask. He always called my mother by her name but called his
mother ``Ma.'' I know that, at these moments, he believes I am his
brother.
</P>
<P>
   Moments of lucidity recur, but with a jagged and perplexing
unpredictability. When I came into the nursing home one night last
winter, he did not appear to know at first exactly who I was, but
then surprised me when a doctor came into the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I've introduced you to my son,'' he said in a
congenial voice, as if the two of us were at the Harvard Club for
lunch and one of his physician friends had stopped by at our table.
</P>
<P>
   Another night, a woman visiting a patient suddenly collapsed. My
father got down on the floor and took her hand and pressed his
fingers to her wrist to find her pulse, then moved his fingers
slightly in the practiced way that doctors do until he'd found
exactly the right spot. Reassured, he stayed there at her side
until a nurse arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, as I was just about to leave his room, he
took my arm and spoke to me in Yiddish, which I hadn't heard him
speak in 40 years. I asked him, ``Daddy, can you say your name in
Yiddish still?''
</P>
<P>
   He thought for a moment, then said, ``Hershel Leben'' _ Harry
Leo _ and then put his arms around me and began to cry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a good trip, hasn't it?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   When I visit now, I try to bring my dog because her presence
makes my father utterly serene. She has known my father since she
was a puppy. She runs right up to him, wagging her tail, and sits
in front of him and waits to be acknowledged. If he doesn't speak
to her she makes her feelings known by squealing softly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, there she is again,'' he'll say and reach his hand to
stroke her head. I don't know why he says ``again.'' Perhaps he
actually remembers her. On the other hand, he's always been
extremely good at bluffing gracefully. He hasn't lost that skill.
</P>
<P>
   ``So how's it been?'' he'll sometimes ask when I come in. If I
tell him I've been in New York, he'll say something that sounds
capaciously appropriate about the reason I was there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you get it all done?'' he might inquire. Or, on one
occasion recently, he asked: ``How are they treating you down
there?''
</P>
<P>
   On rare occasions, he says my name. More frequently, he'll
simply press my arm and hold me there in front of him and look hard
in my eyes. His hand's still strong, his grasp still firm. The
nurses tell me that his recognition of my face is now the only bond
that still connects him to the life he had lived.
</P>
<P>
   I have been blessed to have these final moments with my father
without suffering the grave financial worries that most children of
Alzheimer's patients undergo. My father's savings were sufficient
to support the cost of the superb care he receives (more than
$100,000 a year) and to allow my mother, who is 96 years old, to
live with dignity in her own home. Most families facing this
dilemma aren't so fortunate.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare, the federally supported program for the elderly,
cannot be used to pay for long-term care beyond a tightly
stipulated period (about 100 days) and only in the aftermath of
medical emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   Medicaid, which is means-tested, cannot underwrite the costs of
chronic care in nursing homes unless a family first exhausts its
savings. A wife still capable of living independently, as in my
mother's case, is not denied the right to stay within her home but
must deplete all other assets and, essentially, reduce herself to
indigence before her husband qualifies for government assistance.
The sadness of Alzheimer's should not be compounded by the added
injury of mandatory destitution.
</P>
<P>
   My father's journey, as he nears its end, retains a certain
tenderness and beauty. My mother meanwhile has the help of kindly
home attendants who have come to be close friends to her and join
her in the evenings as she follows news events, cheers on her
favorite baseball team and celebrates a Red Sox victory with tea
and biscuits before sleep.
</P>
<P>
   All our parents and grandparents ought to be allowed this
modicum of sweetness in their final years. Until the riddle of
Alzheimer's has been solved, the rules that govern Medicare and
Medicaid should be revised to cover long-term care for all who
suffer from this illness without penalizing a surviving spouse by
adding indigence to grief, and fear to loneliness.

   EDs: Here are a package of stories from a special fall fashion
section from the Dayton Daily News:FALLSTYLE -MAKEUP _ In an
ever-changing digital age, connoisseurs of style seem to be
reminiscing about things timeless and enduring. Perhaps that's why
hair and makeup stylists have abandoned the sleek minimalism that
ruled the late '90s and are revisiting classic femininity. (Dayton
Daily News). 8.

   FALLSTYLE-DINNERPARTY _ You're invited to someone's home for
dinner or a party and have no idea what to wear. Think about
``dressing like a lady'' and you'll be on the right fashion track.
Women won't go wrong this season if they pair a pretty sweater in a
yummy color with a suede or leather skirt or pant. (Dayton Daily

   FALLSTYLE-MEN _ Men's fashions will complement their ladylike
counterparts. Designers have dipped into fashion's pool of
timeless, traditional pieces, and updated them with crisp tailoring
and high-tech fabrics. The classic, polished look that emerges
bridges the gap between formal business dress and casual
sportswear: Men will look smart and sophisticated around the clock.

items will have you looking fashionable for fall. Must-haves for
fall. (Dayton Daily News). 13.
</P>
<P>
   FALLSTYLE-NOSTALGIA _ For some, fashion's nod to the past is
nostalgic. It reminds us of favorite outfits we _ or our mothers
and grandmothers _ wore long ago. For younger folks attracted to
old Hollywood films and vintage shops, it's a chance to get into
the act. This passion for ``dressing up'' is fun _ with an emphasis
on elegance, shine and glamour. (Dayton Daily News). 7.

   FALLSTYLE-ETIQUETTE _ The good news, says manners maven Peggy
Post, is the definite resurgence of interest in etiquette. And
while specific guidelines may change through the years, she says
the underlying principles of etiquette always remain the same.

<P>
   FALLSTYLE-TEENS _ Who says prim and proper can't be fun? Now
that baggy jeans and chunky shoes are out of style, polished, more
sophisticated looks have taken center stage. For teens and
collegians, that means this season's filled with blouses, skirts
and slacks. Though shapes are classic, they're anything but boring.

CABLETRON ACQUIRES INDUS RIVER NETWORKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT BERNARD NELSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cabletron Systems Inc. bought little-known Indus River Networks
of Acton, Mass. Monday in a $170 million deal designed to round out
its largest division's product line before a planned public
offering in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Cabletron, based in Rochester, N.H., agreed to hand over 4.1
million of its own shares and roughly 1 percent of the convertible
stock in its division, Enterasys Networks, which it plans to spin
off in 2001 or 2002. The deal is based on Friday's closing price
for Cabletron shares, valuing them at $142.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Indus River is a privately held company.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as these things go, it's about a middle-of-the-pack
deal,'' said Martin Pyykkonen, an analyst who follows Cabletron for
CIBC World Markets in San Francisco. ``Enterasys is just filling
out a product hole, buying a smaller company rather than taking the
time and money to fill it in-house.''
</P>
<P>
   Indus River makes virtual private network _ or VPN _ computer
hardware. That technology allows companies to securely share
information between a main corporate office and branch offices. It
also lets employees traveling outside the home office gain secure
access to the corporate network through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Banks and their sprawling network of branch offices, for
example, are big clients of VPN systems.
</P>
<P>
   Enterasys develops routers and switches for VPNs and should
benefit from adding Indus River to the mix, Pyykkonen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Smartsearch router is Enterasys' flagship product, but it
would have had to outsource the rest of the VPN process or possibly
lose the business to a competitor,'' he said. ``Now, it will be
able to take VPN orders seamlessly as part of the overall
package.''
</P>
<P>
   Enterasys has 2,200 employees and accounted for about half of
Cabletron's $1.4 billion in sales last year. It reported
first-quarter revenue of $177.1 million, up 5 percent from the
quarter before.
</P>
<P>
   Indus River, tiny in contrast, has 60 employees and posted just
$2 million in sales a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   In three rounds of financing, venture capitalists gave Indus
River $28 million in start-up capital between 1997 and 1999. The
MCI WorldCom Venture fund and Novell Inc. were among seven
investors that pledged the final $14 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   Its new parent, Enterasys, is one of four units Cabletron formed
in February, reportedly to boost share prices in an effort to keep
pace with rival Cisco Systems Inc. Cabletron said it hopes to take
all four units public and spin them off within two years.
</P>
<P>
   Cabletron shares rose $1 after the announcement Monday, closing
at $35.75 on the New York Stock Exchange. Year to date, they have
risen 38 percent.

Dordogne's Caves
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Q. I'd like to visit the prehistoric caves near Les
Eyzies-de-Tayac, France. Can you provide me with information on how
to get a guide? _ Lawrence W. Hitt, New York, N.Y. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A. The caves and rock dwellings surrounding the town of Les
Eyzies-de-Tayac, in the Dordogne department, in southwestern
France, contain some outstanding prehistoric remains, many from the
Upper Paleolithic period, which began about 35,000 years ago.
During that period, early man made great strides in hunting,
tool-making and the drawing and carving of figures, especially
animals, which appear on the walls of many of the region's caves.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the sites are within 12 miles north and east of Les
Eyzies. The caves at Font-de-Gaume, Rouffignac and Bernifal are
known for their paintings of bison, horses and mammoths. There are
wall carvings at Combarelles, Bara-Bahau and St.-Cirq. Cap Blanc,
with its 15,000-year-old animal frieze, and Abri du Poisson, which
features the carving of a salmon, are also worth a stop, as is Abri
de Cro-Magnon and Le Moustier.
</P>
<P>
   Admission to the sites varies, but is usually $5.60. Hours are
generally from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., closed on Monday or Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Call the Tourist Office of Les Eyzies for details: (33 5)
53.06.97.05.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most famous cave in the area _ Lascaux, about 15
miles northeast of Les Eyzies _ is not open to the public, because
its carved and painted figures, dating from about 20,000 years ago,
are considered too delicate to withstand the carbon dioxide exhaled
by visitors. But you may visit Lascaux II, a faithful replica, some
200 yards from the original cave. Lascaux II is open every day
except Mondays from 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; until 7 p.m. in July and
August. Admission is $7 ( at 7.17 francs to the dollar), $3.50 for
children under 16.
</P>
<P>
   The Tourist Office of Les Eyzies has a list of English-speaking
guides. A full day costs about $165, excluding entrance fees. Among
the guides are Desdemaine Hugon, (33-5) 53.07.26.04 and Bruno
Eluer, (33-5) 53.51.59.12. Both have their own cars.
</P>
<P>
   A four-hour guided canoe trip down the Vezere River for a
minimum of 15 people is available on Thursdays, Saturdays and
Sundays. The trips, which cost $27, are led by a guide from the
National Prehistoric Museum. Information: (33-5) 53.05.10.11.
</P>
<P>
   The museum, housed in a 16th-century chateau on a cliff
overlooking Les Eyzies, displays weapons, tools and sculptural
blocks. It is open from 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m., and until 7 p.m.
during the summer. Admission is $3; free for those under 18.
Information: (33-5) 53.06.45.45.

   STAYING IN A SCOTTISH CASTLE
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q. I'd like to find some agencies that offer accommodations in
Scottish castles. Can you help? _ Wendy Berilman, Milwaukee  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A. Scotts Castle Holidays represents several bed-and-breakfasts,
hotels and vacation rentals that are housed in castles. Among them
is Culcreuch Castle at Fintry, near Stirling. Built in 1296 and set
on 1,600 wooded acres, the hotel has 13 guest rooms and costs from
$90 to $114 a person for bed and breakfast. The 16th-century
Ballencrieff Castle at Aberlady, near Edinburgh, is a bed and
breakfast, with four guest rooms, starting at $102 per person.
Information: (44-131) 229 7111, fax (44-131) 229 1777, or visit
www.scottscastles.com.
</P>
<P>
   For groups of six or more, Loyd &AMP; Townsend-Rose represents 25
castles, most of them charging about $300 a person, including
breakfast, dinner and drinks. One of their properties, Myres
Castle, in Fife, is a 16th-century castle with nine guest rooms.
Another, the Tower of Lethendy, in Perthshire, built in 1570 with
additions in 1885, has seven bedrooms. Information: (44-1835) 870
706, www.ltr.co.uk.
</P>
<P>
   Among the properties managed by the National Trust of Scotland
is Brodick Castle on the Isle of Arran, with two apartments
available for rent, primarily on a weekly basis. Dating back to the
13th century, the castle overlooks Brodick Bay. Prices for an
apartment accommodating four people range from $568 a week to $680
during the summer; the cost is $680 and $833 for the larger
apartment, which sleep six.
</P>
<P>
   The East Wing Flat at the 16th-century Castle Fraser, 16 miles
west of Aberdeen, sleeps five and has a spiral stone staircase
leading to a small turret bedroom. The castle is set in extensive
grounds with formal gardens and trails. Prices range from $424 to
$545, depending on season. Information: (44-131) 243 9331;

   TOURS OF BELIZE
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q. My wife and I would like to sign up for an educational tour
of Belize, if possible with a side trip to Tikal in Guatemala. Do
you have suggestions? _ Martin L. Tingay, Sarasota, Fla. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A. Smithsonian Study Tours is offering a nine-day tour called
Undiscovered Belize: Walks in the Land of the Maya starting Jan.
20. The tour includes treks in the tropical forests of the Maya

ospreys, green herons and frigate birds. You'll also visit several
Mayan sites, including Che Chem Hah, a ceremonial site on the upper
Macal River; Chumpiate Cave, where you climb wooden ladders to see
a secret, storehouse of Maya pottery, which has been left in its
original location; and, in the foothills of the Maya Mountains, the
Mayflower Archeological Reserve, a classical Mayan site, known for
its carved stele. The cost is $3,325 per person, double occupancy,
excluding air fare. Information: (877) 338-8687.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts Audubon Society offers Belize, the Barrier
Reef and Tikal, an eight-day tour, half of which is spent aboard
the Panorama, a 44-passenger yacht. The trip includes a visit to
the Mayan sites of Caracol _ an ancient grouping of palaces, plazas
and pyramids in Belize that are still being recovered from the
jungle _ and Tikal, with its carved stele, ceremonial platforms and
temple pyramids, in Guatemala. The cruise departs from Belize City
on the third day of the tour, and visits several islands off
Belize's Caribbean coast, including Laughing Bird Cay, Half Moon
Cay and Goff's Cay. Snorkeling, bird-watching and a cruise up
Monkey River are among the highlights of the tour. Prices range
from $2,995 to $3,995 a person, double occupancy, excluding air
fare. Information: (800) 289-9504.

GORE CRITICAL OF BUSH ON DEBATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HANNIBAL, Mo. _ Vice President Al Gore accused his opponent
George W. Bush Monday of trying to ``stiff'' the Commission on
Presidential Debates by failing to commit to national debates, and
suggested that Bush was reluctant to discuss the issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why he would want to duck that,'' Gore, cruising
on the Mark Twain riverboat down the Mississippi River, told
reporters. ``I hope that he will reconsider it. I think, actually,
in the end he'll have to consider it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is unprecedented in modern times for a major party
candidate to try to stiff the primetime commission debate,'' Gore
continued. ``I think that he's probably engaging in what will turn
out to be a vain effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, in Milwaukee for a speech before the Veterans of Foreign
Wars, promised that ``there'll be debates,'' but he did not say
when or where.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what I'd like to do is have debates that are, you
know, where people get a sense of what we both believe, and
structured so both of us share our ideas in a way that people will
listen to,'' the Texas governor said.
</P>
<P>
   Finishing his four-day, Midwest campaign trip down the
Mississippi, Gore said he had ``immediately accepted'' the
recommendation for three national debates sponsored by the
commission, which has been hosting presidential and vice
presidential debates since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has suggested five debates: three between Bush and Gore,
and two between Bush's running-mate, Dick Cheney, and Gore's vice
presidential pick, Joseph I. Lieberman. But the Texas governor has
not specifically committed to the commission debates, which would
be shown nationally, and has said he is reviewing other forums and
venues.
</P>
<P>
   ``My opponent ... apparently wants to see if he can get away
with some Sunday morning talk show when nobody is watching much,
and substituting that for what the American people have a right to
expect: namely, one-on-one debates in prime time when everybody can
hear a good detailed discussion of the issues,'' Gore added.
</P>
<P>
   But while Gore is needling Bush to commit to the commission
debates, his campaign aides aren't counting on a clear Gore win in
the debates. They feel confident that Gore has a solid command of
issues, but worry that Bush will provoke Gore into an attack mode,
making the vice president look negative in comparison to an affable
Governor Bush.
</P>
<P>
   They are also concerned that the public and the press corps have
higher expectations of Gore as a debater, making the bar a tougher
one for the vice president to clear.
</P>
<P>
   Aides have been consulting on debate strategy with former Texas
Governor Ann Richards, who lost to Bush in 1994. Richards, a Gore
aide said, recalled how Bush cleverly made his her look like a
bully, warning voters in advance that she would go negative.
</P>
<P>
   That is why, the aide said, both Gore and Lieberman have taken
pains to refer to Bush and Cheney as ``decent,'' and ``nice'' men;
they don't want to give the Republicans ammunition to accuse the
Democratic ticket of negative campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's weapon in the debates will be sympathy, not
confrontation, the aide said. For example, Gore will question Bush
on Social Security or prescription drug coverage by saying
something like, ``What if I were a senior citizen, and my Social
Security check doesn't cover my precription drugs? What would you
say to me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going for a `Hail Mary' pass that will skewer Bush
in the debates,'' the aide said. ``We're going for three yards in
the dust.''
</P>
<P>
   In his post-Democratic convention campaign swing, the Gore
campaign has been trying to paint the vice president as a man of
substance, and to suggest without directly saying so that Bush
lacks political maturity and seriousness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people have a right in this day and time to be
respected with an adult, intelligent discussion of what the major
issues are, in a give-and-take without the slick image-makers
intervening,'' Gore said aboard the Mark Twain.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore, too, has been honing his image. His four-day riverboat
cruise _ which was actually three days on the river, and one day on
a bus to move the campaign _ has been engineered in part by
Hollywood producer Mort Engelberg.
</P>
<P>
   And Gore has been holding well-publicized policy chats on the
riverboat, bringing selected citizens on board for discussions on
health care and a middle-class tax cut.
</P>

<P>
   Despite those banner advertisements on Web sites for, say, $7
stock trades, the Internet's greatest gift to investors is not
online trading but the wealth of information it offers people who
are researching a company or a mutual fund before investing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet has empowered people,'' said Robert N. Gordon,
the president of the Twenty-First Securities Corp., an investment
management firm in Manhattan that specializes in risk-reduction
strategies. ``Investors used to be hostage to their brokers; if
they wanted stock quotes, they had to call their brokers, and only
the brokers had access to research reports. The Internet has broken
down the information wall. Now investors can eliminate the
middleman.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Kochis, the president of Kochis Fitz, a San Francisco
money-management firm, called online investing ``fast, reliable and
convenient, a great thing.'' But referring to the popular image of
the get-rich-quick day trader, he warned that online investing
``can be abused by the user.''
</P>
<P>
   Financial professionals have long warned against trading
impulsively on supposedly hot tips, saying many people cannot
resist buying shares of what will surely be the next Microsoft the
minute they hear about it from the guy in the office down the hall.
And with Internet chat rooms creating even more hype, people with
poor impulse control can lose money even faster.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, first-class information is also available; it
can be used profitably whether one is trading online or through a
traditional broker, is an active investor or just rethinks
strategies at tax time. All the leading brokerage firms, both
full-service and discount, have secure, accessible Web sites, as do
service organizations such as Morningstar and Bloomberg.
</P>
<P>
   Tracey E. Curvey, the executive vice president of online
brokerage for Fidelity Personal Investments, compares this more
thoughtful approach to the Internet to patients' use of the Web to
research health problems before visiting a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Many investors are also moving from research to trading. Assets
in online brokerage accounts grew 23.5 percent in the first quarter
of this year, to more than $1 trillion, US Bancorp Piper Jaffray
reported last month. And online trading volume rose 69 percent over
the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Kochis cautioned, ``stock picking is not for the casual,
lay investor,'' although a handful of his clients who have spent
substantial time and effort on research have been successful in
fairly aggressive online trading. Many more prefer to have the firm
manage their investments.
</P>
<P>
   Neither approach is right or wrong, Kochis added, but is a
matter of personality and individual choice. Some people are
entrepreneurial, while others like to delegate.
</P>
<P>
   With the information available on the Internet, people who feel
insecure about making investments can learn the basics of investing
and personal finance before they trade. Online trading is the easy
part _ with a few mouse clicks, you can buy or sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can do it on your own time,'' Curvey pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   But prudent investors do not trade until they have researched a
security's fundamentals and considered how it fits into their
financial plan and their tolerance of risk. One approach is to put
the money you're investing into a money-market account. You can use
the resources on your brokerage firm's Web site to learn about the
market, then set up a dummy portfolio, research stocks or mutual
funds and simulate trades.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you feel comfortable, go ahead and make a transaction,''
Curvey said.
</P>
<P>
   Many consumers are smarter about their future than their
predecessors 20 years ago, having gained experience with their
401(k) plans. Many young people, too, have grown up using
computers, so online research and trading seems natural. The leap
to online trading is undoubtedly easier for self-directed customers
of a discount broker, such as Fidelity, than for those working with
traditional brokers. In return for the higher commissions, the
full-service firms offer clients guidance as well as execute
transactions, but even these brokers are pressured to offer online
trading and resources.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch, for example, offers a lot of information at
www.mlol.ml.com. There are financial calculators, asset allocation
models, courses on financial planning and understanding risk,
mutual fund and stock scanners and detailed reports from the firm's
analysts, as well as access to news and one's own account
performance.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to trading, Merrill Lynch clients can deal with a
financial consultant, as they have traditionally; choose a managed
account; trade online through Merrill Lynch Direct at $29.95 a
transaction; or use some of each by linking accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Joel S. Isaacson, a certified public accountant and certified
financial planner who is the president of his own firm in
Manhattan, said that online trading could be ``good for
do-it-yourselfers, provided they do the research, buy good stuff
and hold it'' rather than trading in and out. Even so, he added,
``most people are better off using some advice or buying index
funds.''
</P>
<P>
   People who open an account where cheap trades are advertised may
lose more through poor executions than they gain on low
commissions, Isaacson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're just executing a trade, you can sometimes negotiate
low commissions with a full-service broker,'' he said, especially
when a block of stock is involved.
</P>
<P>
   For people who do want to invest online, the quality of
information on a broker's site can be more important than the
charge for each transaction. But it is good in any case to remember
that the Internet does not offer investors a superhighway around
the market's ups and downs. People who speed ahead may well crash.
</P>
<P>
   OPTIONAL SIDEBAR: DANGER SIGNS FOR TRADERS
</P>
<P>
   Investing online does not condemn an investor to becoming a
crazed day trader any more than enjoying a glass of wine at dinner
leads inexorably to alcoholism. Still, for certain people, online
investing, like taking a drink, can lead to trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you had a bad day at work or with your family, go to the
gym, not the computer,'' said Linda Barbanel, a Manhattan
psychotherapist and the author of ``Sex, Money &AMP; Power.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people who think that they have stumbled or have not been
appreciated in one area try to prove themselves in another, she
explained. In the last couple of years, that other area has often
been the stock market, where people take unwarranted risks in the
quest to make a killing and impress their spouse, boss or friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many alcoholics who give up alcohol take up other compulsions
_ shopping, spending and now online trading,'' Barbanel said.
``Gamblers and day traders tend to be compulsive. They can't tear
themselves away when trading, because when they are doing it, they
do not have to think about their frustration, anger and
depression.''
</P>
<P>
   For people who follow prudent financial practices and research
their investments carefully, online trading can be remunerative,
Barbanel added, but compulsive traders often skip that part of the
process.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think of it as a game, but it is a treacherous one,'' she
said, citing these warning signs:
</P>
<P>
   _ If you feel it is important to make trades every day.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you see online trading as a way to get rich quick, even
quitting a job to devote more time it.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you are borrowing money, running up credit-card debt or
taking a second mortgage on your house to trade, you are in serious
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   People who do well at online trading tend to be entrepreneurial,
Barbanel said, adding: ``They want to be captain of their own ship.
They like to make their own decisions. They are risk-takers to
begin with.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wish to be powerful, respected and in control,'' she
noted, even when it would be smarter to get help.

<P>
   For a long time, the image of the typical Internet user was a
heterosexual white male younger than 40. Although this
characterization was mostly true, the Web is now becoming a
thriving marketplace for a wider range of people.
</P>
<P>
   As the economic and political influence of Asian-Americans,
Hispanics, African-Americans and gay men and lesbians increases, so
does their presence on the Web. Technology is also allowing
millions of people with disabilities to go online. Not
surprisingly, a growing number of sites are serving these
communities as they contour the Web to their own needs.
</P>
<P>
   The Asian-American community is wired, with a full 69 percent of
Asian-American households connected to the Internet. This is
reflected in the many sites aimed at this community, including
www.aonline.com, a site focusing on culture and lifestyle for
Asian-Americans, produced by A Magazine. Another site,
www.Click2Asia.com, links to shopping, business and travel in the
United States, Japan, Taiwan and Korea.
</P>
<P>
   For the Hispanic market, the site www.zonafinanciera.com
provides banking, insurance, auto and real estate services in
English, Spanish and Portuguese in 21 countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many Hispanics are looking for convenient ways to send money
home, secure a loan for a family member in Latin America or buy
stock or property there,'' said Greg Keough, a co-founder of the
site.
</P>
<P>
   The site www.starmedia.com is a huge portal that includes
shopping in Spanish, travel services, news from the Americas,
classified advertising and chat rooms.
</P>
<P>
   African-Americans are the fastest-growing group online. ``Blacks
are always on the tail end of technology, and we need to get on the
front end,'' said Harry Alford, the president and chief executive
of the National Black Chamber of Commerce. Its site,
www.nationalbcc.com, offers members discounts from major
corporations and other benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Other sites, like www.blackplanet.com, will soon offer college
databases, financial tools and technology classes, said Omar Wasow,
the executive director.
</P>
<P>
   For people with disabilities, the Internet offers perhaps the
greatest promise. With www.wemedia.com, ``for the first time, a
homebound individual can visit the grocery store, stop at the bank
and pick up a new shirt,'' said Mikki Lam, a senior vice president
of WEmedia Inc. The site also offers health assistance and
information about finances, education and sports.
</P>
<P>
   For gay men and lesbians, two large portals, www.gay.com and
www.planetout.com, offer chat, personal ads, shopping, information
on living with HIV, investment tools, news and links to gay-owned
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gay commerce takes a different angle online,'' said Megan
Smith, Planetout's chief executive. ``We're a large community with
specific needs. It's a completely underserved market.''

DIVERS OPEN HATCH, DISCOVER RUSSIAN SUB FLOODED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Norwegian deep-sea divers finally wrested open an
escape hatch on a sunken Russian nuclear submarine Monday only to
find that the badly damaged Kursk was completely flooded.
</P>
<P>
   There was no sign that any of the 118 crew had survived long
after the still-unexplained accident that sent the submarine to the
bottom of the Barents Sea, trapping the crew on board.
</P>
<P>
   Nine agonizing days after the submarine went down, the rescue
became a recovery. But first, it was time for Russia to grieve.
</P>
<P>
   In a somber broadcast, state television finally broadcast the
names of the crew, which had been withheld by the navy. Defense
Minister Igor Sergyev offered condolences to victims' families, and
acknowledged what his angry countrymen have been saying for days,
that the Russian rescue effort had been flawed.
</P>
<P>
   In the port city of Murmansk, home of the Northern Fleet where
the Kursk was based, relatives overcome with grief collapsed and
wailed as navy officials tried in vain to comfort them. And navy
officers rued the implicit humiliation of Russia's once great fleet
as Norwegian divers accomplished in one day what the Russian
rescuers were unable to do in a week.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, privately owned NTV television showed footage of the
Kursk going to sea, accompanied by the music of the late songwriter
Vladimir Vysotsky, ``Save Our Souls,'' a heartrending ballad about
the desperate last minutes on a dying submarine.
</P>
<P>
   Norwegian officials said the divers' grim discovery meant the
rescue operation would be abandoned, but that Russia had asked for
help in recovering the sailors' bodies. Russian television said one
body had already been found near an escape hatch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The military council of the Northern Fleet is deeply sorrowed
and offers its sympathy to the relatives of the dead,'' said a
statement from the fleet's commander, Admiral Vyacheslav Popov.
``The memory of our comrades in arms will live forever in our
hearts and in the history of the Russian navy.''
</P>
<P>
   Popov and other officials faced growing criticism of their
handling of the crisis after the head of the Norwegian team
complained of excessive Russian bureaucracy, and Russian
politicians accused the Northern Fleet of not properly assessing
the disaster.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian media and many ordinary people have criticized
Russian President Vladimir Putin for not responding more quickly to
the loss of the submarine on August 12. Russian officials did not
ackknowledge the disaster until August 14, and played down the
seriousness of the damage to the vessel. Putin, who chose not to
interrupt a vacation on the Black Sea, waited until last Wednesday
to speak about the rescue operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Kursk had sunk in the Black Sea, where would Putin have
spent his vacation?,'' chided the Moscow daily Moskovsky
Komsomolets in a banner headline. Indicating that the navy knew the
crew was doomed long ago, the paper reported that navy officials in
Northern Fleet headquarters on the Kola Penninsula had ordered 120
coffins last week, when spokesmen were still saying that the crew
could be saved.
</P>
<P>
   Gennady Seleznyov, the speaker of the lower house of the Russian
parliament, said military leaders had dawdled in reporting the
disaster to Putin, wasting time that could have been spent rescuing
any surivors.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Minister Sergeyev appeared to confirm that charge. He
said he had received word that the Kursk had missed a scheduled
communication with shore on the evening of August 12, but that he
waited 12 hours, until the morning of August 13, to inform Putin.
But Sergeyev put much of the blame for the failed rescue effort on
a lack of funding that left the navy short of divers and equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, NTV televsion reported that officers in Murmansk were
upset about their navy's performance, and that some of them were
ready to quit if Norwegian salvage workers, instead of Russians,
were given the task of raising the Kursk.
</P>
<P>
   But officials indicated that there was no rush to raise the
Kursk. That task would be complicated by the presence of two
nuclear reactors, which have been shut down but are still
radioactive. Russian navy officials now say that the Kursk has
sustained so much damage _ one report compared the vessel to a body
that has fallen 20 stories, with multiple fractures in every bone _
that it might break up in an attempt to raise it.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials say they want to raise the Kursk to determine
what happened to it. Until they know what caused the disaster, the
Russian navy has said other submarines of the Kursk's class will
not be sent to sea. Some have said that an explosion could have
occurred on board during a misfire of a new torpedo being tested,
setting off a larger blast as other ordnance exploded. Norwegian
seismic readings registered two blasts, the first smaller than the
second, late in the morning of August 12. But Igor Sergeyev,
Russia's defense minister, Monday said Russian monitors registered
three explosions.
</P>
<P>
   Some Russian officials are holding to the theory that the Kursk
was hit by a runaway torpedo of its own or by one fired by a
foreign submarine, possibly an American vessel, a theory that
Washington denies and no one in Moscow has been able to confirm.
Putin and President Clinton spoke at length by phone on Wednesday,
but both sides said the conversation was about the rescue effort.
Russia turned down US offers of help.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts here have suggested that military officials wanted
to avoid having the Kursk, one of Russia's most advanced subs,
examined by anyone from the West. The newspaper Moskovsky
Komsomolets went a step further, accusing the navy of making sure
that everyone on board died to cover up the cause of the accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is, what was the big secret they were trying to
hide?'' said the paper's defense analyst, Viktor Sokirko.
</P>
<P>
   Hope had been fading for the crew since Saturday, when a navy
admiral said most of the men on board were feared dead. On Sunday,
the Svir hospital ship, which had been set to treat survivors, was
moved into the Kursk's berth in Murmansk harbor, which people in
the port city called a bad omen. At a memorial service at a Russian
Orthodox Church in Murmansk on Sunday, the congregation prayed for
the sailors' souls _ not their survival.
</P>
<P>
   Some names of the victims are still unknown _ for example, the
senior Northern Fleet staff officers and admirals who, analysts
say, must have been on the Kursk to help direct the fleet exercises
in which it was taking part.
</P>
<P>
   The navy has provided relatives with food and a place to stay at
the naval base. Monday, a spokesman said a few psychotherapists
would be brought in to counsel family members. The government also
announced it would provide aid to family members travelling to
Murmansk from around Russia. Until now, most relatives have had to
travel at their own expense.
</P>
<P>
   Family members appeared bitter at the government's response.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've said nothing, except for Putin's statement, and what
good did that do, our sons are still down there,'' Vladimir
Bryazhin, whose son is aboard the Kursk, told NTV.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will probably be tears for two or three days, there will
probably be great distress, it will probably be difficult,'' said
Vladimir Navrotsky, chief spokesman of the Northern Fleet, at a
news conference Monday. ``And then they will probably start getting
back to normal . . . and will probably leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Norway offered to send a robot camera into the submarine to film
the wreck for details that might help future efforts to recover the
bodies or salvage the vessel. A spokesman for Stolt Offshore, the
company that provided the divers, said to send divers in safely,
salvage teams would have to cut a larger entrance, which could be
cause for concern on a badly damaged vessel with nuclear reactors
on board.
</P>
<P>
   Another issue is whether the Russian military would allow
foreign divers to go in a submarine filled with what Moscow
considers top-secret technology.
</P>
<P>
   If the robot camera is used, said Norwegian military spokesman
Lieutenant Colonel John Espen Lien, ``We will hand the video to the
Russian authorities.''

ANTIGENICS TO ACQUIRE AQUILA BIOPHARMACEUTICALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NAOMI AOKI  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Antigenics Inc., a biotechnology company specializing in
personalized cancer ``vaccines,'' has agreed to acquire Aquila
Biopharmaceuticals Inc. for about $40 million.
</P>
<P>
   Antigenics will pay $4.67 for each of Aquila's roughly 8.5
million outstanding shares, a 5 percent premium over the stock's
closing price Monday of $4.4375 a share.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase of Aquila strengthens Antigenics's foothold in the
field of infectious diseases and complements its efforts to fight
cancer, the parties said.
</P>
<P>
   Aquila, a Framingham, Mass. company, develops products to boost
the body's immune response. It is testing more than a dozen drugs
to fight infectious and degenerative diseases and some cancers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our combined technologies will allow us to use many, many
tools in the process of combatting these diseases that have not
been dealt with well traditionally,'' said Garo H. Armen, the
Antigenics chairman and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   Antigenics is based in New York but has a biomanufacturing and
research operation in Woburn, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The company's lead cancer product is in late-stage clinical
trials for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma. It also has drugs
in earlier stages of testing for other forms of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition, expected to be completed in the fourth quarter
of this year, brings with it Aquila's partnerships with some of the
world's leading pharmaceutical companies, including SmithKline
Beecham, Elan Corp. and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. The deal has been
approved by the boards of both companies but is subject to
regulatory approval.
</P>
<P>
   Alison Taunton-Rigby, president and chief executive of Aquila,
said the company has long been undervalued by Wall Street. She
thinks merging with a larger company will bring it the attention it
needs to advance its research and drug development efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The combined company will be one of the powerhouses of the
whole field,'' she said. ``I think it will be good for both our
shareholders.''

BIAS PANEL UPHOLDS $300,000 AWARD TO MUSLIM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD HIGGINS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In a significant ruling on religious freedom in the
workplace, the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination has
upheld a 1996 decision awarding $300,000 to a Muslim man who was
forced to stop praying at work.
</P>
<P>
   Lule Said of Quincy quit his job as a security guard for
Northeast Security Inc. of Brookline in 1991 after he said he was
ridiculed and harassed by fellow employees, one of whom trampled on
his prayer rug and kicked it into a corner.
</P>
<P>
   Said, who then lived in Boston, was also ordered by company
management not to pray during his 16-hour work shifts, even though
Muslims are required to pray five times per day.
</P>
<P>
   As the nation's work force has become more diverse, disputes
over religious liberty on the job have increased 15 percent to 20
percent in the past five years, according to the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission, the federal agency charged with
investigating bias.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Muslims, one of the country's fastest-growing
religious groups, have filed numerous complaints in the courts and
with government anti-bias agencies against employers for failing to
accommodate their practices.
</P>
<P>
   In Said's case, Northeast Security had appealed the 1996 ruling
by Commissioner Charles E. Walker to the full three-member
commission. The commission asked Walker to review the damage award
and to consider a 1997 state law requiring employers to accommodate
the religious beliefs of employees. A new hearing was held April
26.
</P>
<P>
   In a ruling issued on Aug. 14, Walker upheld his original
findings but allocated the award differently. He reduced damages
for emotional distress caused by harassment and a ``hostile work
environment'' from $300,000 to $250,000, but ordered the company to
pay $50,000 in new damages for failing to accommodate Said's
religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case uniquely demonstrates . . . the debilitating impact
discrimination has on an individual's well-being,'' including a
decline in self-worth, Walker wrote in his decision. ``The
resulting fear and demoralization of the employee, who is singled
out, ridiculed, harassed, and ostracized . . . is exacerbated by
management's complicity.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard Brown, the attorney who represented Northeast Security
Inc., said he was disappointed by Walker's latest ruling and said
he had filed papers to appeal it again to the full commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``My client is distressed by this ruling, which we think is
wrong legally and factually,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Said, a native of Somalia, was a student at Boston University
when he began working as a security guard in 1991, pulling two
16-hour shifts and one 8-hour shift at Franciscan Childrens'
Hospital in Brighton.
</P>
<P>
   As a practicing Muslim, he routinely prayed five times daily for
three to five minutes, facing the Islamic holy city of Mecca.
According to his complaint, Said used a dressing room behind the
hospital's security desk to pray three times during his 16-hour
shifts.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint allleged that another Northeast security guard
threatened him and made disparaging remarks about Said's Somali
origin and religion, saying he hated Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   After the co-worker wiped his feet on Said's prayer rug and
kicked it into a corner, Said complained to his supervisor but the
coworker continued to harass him, according to the complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Said, who said the company did nothing to stop the harassment,
was told by the supervisor to stop praying or quit his job. He
ultimately agreed to give up his prayers because he was afraid to
lose his job. Nevertheless, he was demoted to a part-time position,
the complaint stated.
</P>
<P>
   Said, who could not be reached for comment Monday, quit
Northeast and went to work as an accounts manager at State Street
Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Walker, in his ruling, said that the religious accommodation
Said requested _ three five-minute breaks to pray during a 16-hour
shift _ was ``reasonable and not overly burdensome'' on Northeast
Security.
</P>
<P>
   He also found that the company failed to meet Said's second
request, ``to be free from unlawful harassment and the elimination
of the religion-based hostile environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker also said that Said, who now lives in Quincy, was
entitled to damages as a result of ``irreverent insults to his
dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   Fred Welensky, the Boston attorney who represented Said in his
case before the MCAD, called the ruling ``excellent, right on the
money.'' He also said he hoped the ruling would increase awareness
of the need to respect people's faith traditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people in this country don't understand what Islamic
practice means to most Muslims,'' he said. ``For my client, it was
really the single most important thing in his life.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``bullying'' by fellow workers was bad enough, Welensky
said, but was ``made worse by the employer's failure to take any
corrective action.''

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Cousin Bubba strikes again
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ I was all set to go to the Democratic National
Convention in Los Angeles last week, but had to cancel at the last
minute.
</P>
<P>
   Blame it on my cousin Bubba.
</P>
<P>
   He's the one who hit me in the eye with a rock.
</P>
<P>
   We were playing on a dirt road between his house and mine. I
don't know how we came up with the particular game, but the idea
was to see how close we could throw at one another without actually
hitting each other.
</P>
<P>
   This may have been the only chunking contest I ever won against
Bubba.
</P>
<P>
   I was bending over, in the process of selecting a choice stone.
It was when I looked up that I spied exactly what I was looking
for, a smooth river rock perfect for throwing.
</P>
<P>
   For a fact, that's exactly what Bubba had done with it -- threw
it in my direction.
</P>
<P>
   I raised my head just in time to see it coming but too late to
dodge. It smacked me directly in my left eye.
</P>
<P>
   I saw stars. I was stunned. For a moment I didn't know what to
do.
</P>
<P>
   Then I saw Bubba screaming bloody murder and running toward my
house, and I knew exactly what to do.
</P>
<P>
   I started screaming bloody murder and running after Bubba toward
the house.
</P>
<P>
   My mother met us at the back door. Bubba was crying, saying he
didn't mean to do it. I was crying, saying Bubba was the one who
did it.
</P>
<P>
   Bubba was sent home. I was taken to the doctor. The eye was
throbbing something awful, but otherwise seemed to have suffered no
permanent damage.
</P>
<P>
   So the doctor said.
</P>
<P>
   But to be on the safe side, he tested my eyesight.
</P>
<P>
   I just knew I was going to be blind in one eye. I was half
right. It turned out I was about half blind in both eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The eye test showed I was nearsighted, same as my daddy. That's
when I had to start wearing glasses.
</P>
<P>
   I was in the sixth grade. Things have never been the same since.
</P>
<P>
   I was the only kid in the class with glasses. At first, the
other students treated me with great sympathy, as if I had suffered
some terrible tragedy, almost on a par with the loss of a parent.
</P>
<P>
   I remember one of the pretty girls said she liked the way I
looked in glasses. Funny what you don't forget.
</P>
<P>
   I remember, too, it wasn't until recess that I heard, for the
first time, ``four eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   My cousin Bubba never called me four eyes. My cousin Bubba never
got over feeling that it was somehow his fault that I wear glasses.
</P>
<P>
   And for good reason -- I never let him.
</P>
<P>
   My left eye has always been my bad eye.
</P>
<P>
   When I had to have cataract surgery several years ago, it was
because of the left eye.
</P>
<P>
   And when I couldn't go to the Democratic convention in Los
Angeles last week, it was because I had a bad case of the pink eye.
</P>
<P>
   Don't ask me in which eye.
</P>
<P>
   Ask my cousin Bubba.

<P>
   The creators of the long-running ``milk mustache'' campaign saw
a natural connection between the need to drink milk and the hit CBS
television show ``Survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We always like to have a fun twist on the nutritional value of
milk and the whole idea of `Survivor' fits,'' said Kurt Graetzer,
chief executive of the Milk Processor Education Program, which
represents milk processors and sponsors the campaign with Dairy
Management Inc., representing dairy farmers.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the four remaining survivors of the show will don
milk mustaches in a specially made print ad appearing Wednesday,
the day the final episode of ``Survivor'' is broadcast. The
headline is ``What the last remaining survivor dreams of wearing
tomorrow.'' The winning survivor then is to appear alone in a full
page ad on Thursday in USA Today, and in newspapers and some weekly
magazines over the next week or more, said Sal Taibi, account
services director at Bozell New York, the True North Communications
unit that created the milk mustache campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Like others, ranging from Reebok International to Playboy
magazine, who have sought out the ``Survivor'' cast, the producer
of the milk ads is trying to capitalize on the cast members' 15
minutes of fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's relevant to everyone because they are in the news, and it
helps us to cut through the clutter,'' said Craig Plymesser, vice
president of milk marketing at Dairy Management Inc. ``We are
picking up on their instant celebrityship, if you will, and using
them to carry the message of milk and the calcium crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the overall estimated $50 million milk mustache print
campaign is intended to piggyback on celebrity and change the image
of milk from wholesome to hip. Some 100 celebrities have worn
mustaches in the campaign since it was introduced in 1995, Taibi
said.
</P>
<P>
   But to keep the campaign fresh, Bozell often uses celebrities of
the moment. This year Bozell ran an ad of the tennis champions and
sisters Venus and Serena Williams. The ad ran the day after Venus
Williams won Wimbledon, and was headlined ``Make ours doubles.''
The Dixie Chicks appeared with mustaches the day after winning a
Grammy Award in March. And a milk mustache ad of the winning
quarterback the day after the Super Bowl is now almost a standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We find it really works, it's a way, for a moment, of truly
getting a blip on the awareness meter, and then what happens is
that over time, people begin to recognize that milk is a drink for
today's lifestyle,'' Graetzer said. The ads may be short-lived, but
their immediacy and novelty outweigh any drawbacks, Taibi said.
``On the morning after, when everyone is talking about it, we'll
already have that person in an ad endorsing milk. And everyone's
wondering how we did that.''
</P>
<P>
   And that conversation is valuable. According to BSMG, Chicago,
the True North Communications unit that handles publicity for the
milk campaign, some 250 television stations, The New York Times and
The Associated Press did reports about the Super Bowl milk mustache
ads in January. BSMG calculated that the coverage accounted for 29
million viewers or readers, based on circulation and ratings
information.
</P>
<P>
   The publicity is all part of the program, of course. For the
Super Bowl, the milk campaign typically runs an ad of the opposing
quarterbacks of the big game on the day of the bowl, followed by an
ad of the winning quarterback. BSMG interviews the quarterbacks
about the advertising shoot, and then releases the interviews to TV
stations to use during their pre- and postgame coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The ads, which Bozell has dubbed its ``moments'' campaign, came
about after the campaign garnered a huge windfall of publicity over
an ad that featured President Clinton and his Republican opponent,
Bob Dole, on the eve of the 1996 presidential election. Coverage of
that single ad led to 189 print news articles and 36 television
reports, accounting for 107 million viewer-readers, according to
BSMG.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Bozell has a staff of three people whose jobs resemble
those of reporters more than ad people as they track the daily news
for up-and-coming celebrities, and for a dramatic story like that
of the Williams sisters who trained their whole lives together and
then had to compete against each other at Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   While a typical celebrity ad for the milk mustache campaign
could take months, from lining up a celebrity to scheduling the
photo shoot, the moment's ads are turned around in a few days.
Logistics are key and the entire process is lined up in advance and
staged, Taibi said.
</P>
<P>
   For the ``Survivors'' ads, the four remaining survivors were
photographed, together and separately, on a beach in Malibu on
Friday. The group was paid an undisclosed standard group fee.
Individuals are paid a standard $25,000 fee for a few hours work.
As in sporting events, Bozell does not know who the final survivor
will be, and must wait to release the proper ad for publication
immediately after the show is broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   One big advantage of milk's ``moment'' ads is that often Bozell
is catching the star on the rise. That usually means the celebrity
is not yet overexposed and also less likely to turn them down.
Though the mustache campaign is now so much part of the culture
that Taibi says many celebrities consider being part of the
campaign a validation of their status in the pop culture, stars do
turn down the campaign. But so far, Bozell has never been rejected
for a ``moments'' ad, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the moment ads do have an element of risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always have a generic ad in our back pocket, and if one of
the people we have doesn't win, we'd just run that generic ad and
no one would know the difference,'' he said.

<P>
   LONDON _ A little over a year ago, De Beers, the mining colossus
straddling the world's diamond trade, confronted double jeopardy.
Human rights groups were accusing it of buying illicit diamonds
from African rebels and rulers who used the proceeds to help pay
for their wars. The essential mystique of its product, nurtured
over decades of artful image-building and brawny cartel management,
seemed threatened by association with these so-called blood
diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, De Beers faced an even bigger challenge: the
company's huge accumulation of raw gems, used to help control the
supply and keep world diamond prices high, had become a costly
albatross. De Beers' shrinking share of the diamond market was
making it harder to support prices by sopping up gems itself.
</P>
<P>
   Then, De Beers hit upon a way to use the controversy over blood
diamonds to address its commercial problems. It recast and began
promoting itself as the squeaky-clean crusader for guarantees
across the industry that ``conflict diamonds,'' as they are also
called, be kept out of the world of luxury goods.
</P>
<P>
   ``De Beers as a company could not afford to even indirectly come
anywhere near diamonds which can be termed conflict diamonds,''
Gary Ralfe, the company's managing director, said. ``Like Caesar's
wife, we have to be above reproach.''
</P>
<P>
   Far from damaging the company, the controversy over diamonds of
questionable origin helped De Beers draw a line between the
legitimate trade, which the company still dominates, and the
unlawful traffic in diamonds among African rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as Edward Jay Epstein, author of a 1982 book about De
Beers, ``The Rise and Fall of Diamonds,'' explained, by supporting
various U.N. embargoes on illicit diamond sales in Angola and
Sierra Leone, the company has effectively enlisted the United
Nations as a policeman to do the job that dictators and mercenaries
once did in keeping more desperate competitors from dumping cheaper
stones onto the market. ``Another brilliant coup, in my opinion,''
Epstein said.
</P>
<P>
   As it seeks to improve its image, De Beers is focused on turning
itself into what it calls the ``supplier of choice'' _ a branded,
high-value diamond trader looking to marketing to replace its old
monopoly status and to maintain its leadership of the global market
for uncut diamonds worth $7 billion to $8 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   And with that shift, using the moral high ground for a
dollars-and-cents strategy, De Beers, by its own account, may well
be starting to turn a corner. Buoyed in part by a millennial buying
spree, its rough diamond sales reached a record $5.2 billion last
year and $3.4 billion in the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
   The sales surge, De Beers announced last week, allowed it to
reduce its stockpile to $2.7 billion as of the middle of the year
from a $4.8 billion inventory in 1998. And the influx of cash from
sales and corporate restructuring spurred a $1 billion buying spree
aimed at mining interests in South Africa and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a sense, this whole issue of conflict diamonds and the way
they have handled it has fallen in their favor,'' said Bobby Craig,
an industry analyst for Merrill Lynch, who is based in South
Africa. ``They have been able to distance themselves in a very
short period.''
</P>
<P>
   De Beers executives have certainly acknowledged the pragmatism
behind their decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the moral imperative and also the fear of what might
happen to the diamond industry,'' Nicholas F. Oppenheimer, the
chairman, said in an interview published last month in the Rapaport
Diamond Report, an industry newsletter. ``When you look at the
volume of conflict diamonds which are less than 4 percent of the
world production compared to the 96 percent plus that come from
good areas, it is obviously in all our interests to drive this 4
percent away. Why should any of us put our business at risk for
peanuts like this? That's crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is more to this picture.
</P>
<P>
   For a variety of commercial, rather than ethical, reasons, the
De Beers stake in many parts of the African diamond trade had been
shrinking even before the United Nations and advocacy groups like
the London-based Global Witness succeeded in pushing conflict
diamonds into the public arena in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Investors, meanwhile, were clamoring for more nimble, more
profitable and more accountable corporate behavior from a company
that in South Africa's apartheid era had been a particularly
secretive bastion of the white-run economy.
</P>
<P>
   Its stock price sagged as the company's growth lagged that of
other purveyors of luxury goods, like LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis
Vuitton and Gucci Group.
</P>
<P>
   Even before that, the De Beers share of the world diamond market
was falling as new rivals, notably in Australia, marketed their own
stones. In the early 1980s, De Beers controlled roughly 85 percent
of both production and global sales of rough diamonds. Today, the
company says, its mines in southern Africa account for around 40
percent of production; marketing deals with Russia and Canada bring
its share of sales to around two-thirds of the market.
</P>
<P>
   The end of apartheid in its South African home base had also
forced the company into a long and complicated unraveling of its
ties with its sister mining conglomerate, the London-based Anglo
American Corp. Each company still holds more than 30 percent of the
other's stock.
</P>
<P>
   By the time conflict diamonds were becoming a worrisome issue
for De Beers, the company had already hired management consultants
from the Boston-based Bain &AMP; Co. to chart a new way of doing
business.
</P>
<P>
   What De Beers wanted to do, Oppenheimer said recently, was ``to
move from being custodian of the market, which was never a very
satisfactory position, to being the leader of the industry'' with
its own product.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There was another, long-range motive: a more open and
competitive image would help the company convince U.S. regulators,
who have accused De Beers of fixing the prices of industrial
diamonds, that it no longer runs afoul of antitrust laws. Until it
does, De Beers cannot set up operations in the United States to
exploit fully its brand name in the world's biggest retail market
for polished stones.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the short to medium term,'' Craig of Merrill Lynch said,
``the chance of them entering the retail market in any meaningful
way will be very dependent on whether they can resolve the
antitrust problem in the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   The results of the upheaval are clear. In the last few months,
De Beers has been actively seeking to regain ground among the
world's producers with hostile bids for diamond mines in Australia
and Canada, even as it is girding for a fight in Russia to renew
its marketing contract there. All these moves are intended to
bolster its position as the industry leader.
</P>
<P>
   De Beers has also sought to transform the marketplace itself.
</P>
<P>
   The company's power lies in an arcane system of selling
exclusively to 125 ``sightholders'' _ diamond merchants from the
world's leading diamond-cutting centers who gather 10 times a year
in London to buy stones from De Beers' exclusive sales unit, long
called the Central Selling Organization and now renamed the Diamond
Trading Co. as part of the company's rebranding exercise.
</P>
<P>
   The sightholders are a crucial link in the chain of brokers,
cutters and wholesalers that eventually produces the engagement
rings and other glittery jewelry of the world's fragmented $56
billion diamond retail trade, around half of which takes place in
American jewelry stores.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than regulate the price, the company hopes to use its
influence to force a revolution in the supply chain, obliging its
sightholders to espouse a new marketing ethic that would make their
continued access to De Beers gems dependent on their ability to
market and advertise diamonds as luxury goods. De Beers even
introduced a new logo, the ``forevermark,'' to differentiate
diamonds from its Diamond Trading Co. from other stones.
</P>
<P>
   As managers and consultants wrestled with the company's
make-over, the drum beat from critics assailing its oft-denied ties
to Angolan rebels was growing louder.
</P>
<P>
   ``De Beers came under a huge amount of pressure,'' said Charmian
Gooch, a diamond industry expert at Global Witness, the group that
led the charge against De Beers. ``They have only moved because
they have been hit on the head repeatedly.''
</P>
<P>
   Managers, said Stephen Lussier, De Beers' director of consumer
marketing, were focusing on ``the pedestrian performance of the
diamond industry against the competition'' in the broader luxury
goods market in the last half of the 1990s. The concern, he said,
was that ``we weren't generating the demand for the world's
production; the process was built around creating more demand to
reduce the stockpile.''
</P>
<P>
   What soon became apparent, though, was that the conflict diamond
issue was not going to go away and needed, somehow, to be
dovetailed into the new corporate identity. ``As the process went
on,'' Lussier said, the issue of conflict diamonds ``fitted into
the code of practice'' already under way ``along with other things
we felt we needed to have in a modern, 21st-century industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Introduced last month, the code offers a guarantee that conflict
diamonds will not be sold by De Beers or its associates.
</P>
<P>
   Some company executives boast privately that De Beers
leap-frogged ahead of its critics by embracing even stronger
measures than its adversaries had been demanding.
</P>
<P>
   Since last October, De Beers has suspended all buying of
diamonds outside of its own proprietary stones and its contractual
purchases. In March, it announced plans to certify all diamonds
sold to its sightholders as nonconflict stones. Since then it has
urged a variety of measures, including the creation of a chain of
warranties reaching throughout the business as rough stones are
sold to wholesalers, cut, polished and eventually appear in stores.
And, perhaps most significantly, it has told its 125 sightholders
that they will lose their access to De Beers stones if they deal in
blood diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the De Beers executives now acknowledge, the company
was reluctant to respond to its critics. ``We felt we were the
wrong target,'' said Bill Lear, director of corporate affairs.
Since then, he said, ``we have come to realize that our leadership
position means we must drive the illegitimate diamonds out of the
legitimate sector.''

 &HT;    GORE, BUOYED BY POLLS, PUSHES BUSH ON DEBATES, TAX PROPOSALS
 &HT;    650&AMP;adds
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HANNIBAL, Mo. _ Vice President Al Gore's campaign riverboat
arrived in Mark Twain's boyhood home Monday night, completing a
400-mile trip down the Mississippi River and demonstrating that
news of the death of Gore's White House bid has been greatly
exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   The Mark Twain riverboat, named after the 19th century author of
``Huckleberry Finn'' and ``Tom Sawyer,'' pulled into this village
on the banks of the Mississippi for a climactic but rain-soaked
rally in which the vice president promoted his tax cut proposals,
targeted to middle class families.
</P>
<P>
   Gore cautioned against ``going back to the old ways of the
past'' _ of tax cuts for the wealthy that he said contributed to
record budget deficits in the 1980s and early 1990s. ``We need to
do the right thing for our kids,'' he said, promising tax relief
``to the people who need it the most.''
</P>
<P>
   The end of Gore's four-day trip with running mate Joe Lieberman
and their wives coincided with:
</P>
<P>
   _ Yet another round of polls showing Gore having closed the gap
with Texas Gov. George W. Bush, his Republican rival for the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   _ A suggestion from Gore that Bush is ``procrastinating'' in
accepting the three debates organized by the bipartisan Commission
on Presidential Debates, possibly in order to avoid them
altogether. Bush communications director Karen P. Hughes said the
governor was simply giving himself time to consider more than 40
debate invitations from an array of potential sponsors. ``Governor
Bush is committed to debating,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   _ A complaint from Gore that Bush is trying to ``conceal'' the
details of his plan to privatize a portion of Social Security in
order to avoid any political fallout before the election.
</P>
<P>
   _ A response from the Gore campaign to Bush's charge that U.S.
military forces are ``in decline'' as a result of Clinton
administration policies: Bush's proposed tax cuts would drain money
from a Pentagon budget that has been increasing gradually since
Bill Clinton took office in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   A CBS poll of 954 registered voters over the weekend following
the Democratic national convention had Gore at 45 percent, Bush at
44 percent. A similar poll after the Republican convention gave
Bush 50 percent and Gore 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The poll had a margin of error of 3 points, meaning the horse
race between Gore and Bush is a statistical dead heat as the two
head toward Labor Day, the traditional beginning of the fall
presidential contest.
</P>
<P>
   Post-convention polls by Newsweek and CNN/USA Today/Gallup
showed similar gains for Gore in the days immediately after his
acceptance of the Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Gore told reporters traveling with him aboard the riverboat
Monday that he suspected his rise in the polls is due to the
public's response to his acceptance speech. ``It wasn't negative
and it focused on the issues,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's voyage down the Mississippi since accepting his party's
nomination in Los Angeles last week has generated a lot of
excitement, something his White House bid has rarely seen this
year.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge now is to sustain what former President George
Bush, the father of Gore's Republican rival, used to call ``the big
mo'' _ the momentum every successful presidential candidate must
catch at some point in their campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign strategists believe the voters are eager for a
discussion of the bread-and-butter issues that the vice president
has talked about in detail throughout the riverboat trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore is talking about issues that affect the lives of
working families, and we believe it's going to have some shelf
life,'' Gore spokesman Chris Lehane said. ``Governor Bush's
approach is cotton candy _ it tastes good but lacks substance.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL ADDS FOLLOW)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gore has had ``the big mo'' before, only to lose it.
</P>
<P>
   After forcefully driving Bill Bradley out of the Democratic
primaries last spring, Gore saw Bush gradually pull ahead in the
White House contest by successfully marketing a limited number of
ideas: cutting federal income taxes, privatizing Social Security
and making public education more accountable with competition
through vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   Gore countered with long laundry lists of initiatives and
aggressively attacked the record Bush had compiled in six years as
governor of Texas. But his strategy backfired: It reinforced
voters's negative views of Gore as a politician who is willing to
do and say anything to get elected.
</P>
<P>
   Gore acknowledged as much to reporters shortly after sunrise
Monday on the Mark Twain.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether his harsh sounding criticism of Bush earlier this
summer hurt him politically, Gore said, ``Yeah, I think it probably
did.'' Asked why, he replied, ``Because I think people want a
really undiluted focus on the issues. That's what I'm going to give
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said the reaction he's gotten from the crowds at his
rallies along the Mississippi River the last four days indicated to
him that ``the risk I took in talking about specifics has paid off
because people appreciate the effort to lift the tone of the
campaign to substance and not just soundbites.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, with a laugh, he added, ``Although that in itself is a
soundbite.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the status of the scheduled debates with Bush, Gore
said the alternative proposals advanced by the GOP nominee's
campaign for debates sponsored by other organizations rather than
the debate commission were puzzling.
</P>
<P>
   ``My opponent ... apparently wants to see if he can get away
with some Sunday morning talk show when nobody is watching much and
substituting that for what the American people have a right to
expect, namely, one-on-one debates in prime time when everybody can
hear a good detailed discussion of the issues,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore supports the commission's plan to limit the debates to the
Democratic and Republican nominees and any third party candidate
who has at least 15 percent in the major polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why he would want to duck that,'' Gore said. ``I
hope that he will reconsider it. I think, actually, that in the end
he'll have to reconsider it. He can save everybody a lot of time by
just going ahead and saying yes, he'll accept the commission
debate.''
</P>
<P>
   When reporters asked whether Bush is trying to duck him, the
vice president replied, with an audible sigh, ``I'm not going to
use that word. `` Pressed, he laughingly said, ``I think he's
procrastinating and that he's just taking longer than is necessary
to come to what will soon look like an obvious conclusion _ that
the American people do indeed have a right to prime time
commission-sponsored debates.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL ADD FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When reporters suggested to Gore that Bush may not have provided
enough specifics about his major proposals to make a debate
worthwhile, he suggested in turn that his rival is deliberately
avoiding such details in order to forestall any political
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   As a prime example, he cited Bush's proposal to allow Americans
to invest a portion of their Social Security in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who proposed a major privatization of Social Security
in an approach that appears to have a $1 trillion price tag over
the next 10 years is, I think, going to have a hard time making it
to Election Day with the statement that no details will be given
until after the election,'' he said. ``The option of concealing it,
or trying to conceal it until after the election, I expect, will
turn out to be difficult for them to pull off.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also criticized Bush's proposal for a sweeping cut in
federal income taxes, contending that for every $10 it would give
wealthy families, it would provide middle class wage earners a dime
and low income families a penny.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that people begrudge tax cuts for the wealthy,'' he
said. ``It's just that it's not fair to put our economy back into
deficits after we worked so hard to balance the budget.''
</P>
<P>
   Responding to Bush's speech to the VFW convention in Milwaukee
on Monday, in which Bush said the U.S. military is in decline,''
Gore running mate Joe Lieberman offered a rival view.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, a senator from Connecticut, told rallies here and
earlier in Quincy, Ill., that Gore has spent his eight years as
vice president ``fighting to keep America's military and make it,
frankly, the best-equipped, best-trained, most powerful fighting
force in the history of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign also issued a press release noting that this
year the administration signed a 4.8 percent military pay hike, the
largest in 20 years, and suggesting that Bush's tax cuts would cut
into the Pentagon's budget.
</P>
<P>
   Said Gore spokesman Lehane: ``Bush talks tough, but he doesn't
have a real plan to keep our military strong. By using up the
entire surplus on a tax cut for the rich, he leaves nothing to
invest in military pay or readiness.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, a member of the VFW by virtue of his service in Vietnam,
is scheduled to address the organization Tuesday.

   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ Top military commanders have won a skirmish
in Parliament to slow their retreat from political influence. At
the same time, they seem to be losing control of many of their
troops in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Since the forced resignation in May 1998 of President Suharto,
who used the army to enforce his dictatorship, the military has
given ground steadily to an overwhelming nationwide demand for its
withdrawal from politics.
</P>
<P>
   But without the strong control of Suharto, military experts _ as
well as Defense Minister Juwono Sudarsono _ warn that in some
places the chain of command has broken down. As a result, some
rogue units are fighting their own small wars and pursuing their
own economic interests.
</P>
<P>
   With the close of a special parliamentary session last week,
attention focused on a back-room maneuver by the military's
legislative bloc that allowed it to hang on to a few of its
allotted seats for an extra five years, until 2009.
</P>
<P>
   The concession drew an outcry from critics for whom the
political withdrawal of the military is important to ending the
abuses of Suharto's 32-year rule.
</P>
<P>
   But military experts said the concession seemed a mostly token
move, probably amounting to a dozen or so seats _ down from the
military's current 38 seats and from the 75 they held under Suharto
in the 700-seat legislature.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, military influence throughout Indonesia has already
been sharply reduced. Serving officers can no longer hold the
political and administrative positions through which they virtually
ran much of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from some renegades and influential retired generals, for
most officers the main dispute now is whether to seek rapid or
gradual reform, the experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, said Salim Said, a political scientist who studies the
armed forces, many officers, particularly in the younger
generation, oppose the extension of the military's role in
Parliament and continue to lobby against it.
</P>
<P>
   More worrisome, the experts said, the weakening of central
control has contributed to military abuses in the religious
fighting in the Maluku islands, the separatist wars in the
provinces of Aceh and Irian Jaya, the continuing tensions along the
border of East Timor and a number of other places.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no chain of command in Ambon,'' a Western diplomat
said, referring to the main city in the Malukus. ``In a way, the
president does not have control of the military. We are almost
seeing the beginnings of a breakdown in the state if this were to
happen in many places. The same thing is happening in West Timor.''
</P>
<P>
   It was unsettling to many people last month to see President
Abdurrahman Wahid reminding a military gathering of the
fundamentals of their duty: ``You must obey your commanders and
your commanders have to obey the supreme commander, and that is the
president.''
</P>
<P>
   The breakdown in the chain of command in the Malukus ``is one of
the most serious problems we are facing,'' said Juwono, the defense
minister. ``We have problems with ambiguous loyalty at various
levels of the police and the military, simply because they have
been there too long and have become participants.''
</P>
<P>
   Military reform has two aspects, said Harold Crouch, an
Australian expert on the Indonesian military.
</P>
<P>
   ``One, withdrawing from politics, is going reasonably well,'' he
said. ``The second is professionalization of the armed forces, and
that is a different picture. What Indonesia desperately needs is a
professional force especially trained for dealing with ethnic,
religious and that sort of violence, and that is precisely what
they don't have.''
</P>
<P>
   The problems are in military training and in poor pay and
supplies, he and other analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   The Maluku islands are a clear example, where military units
have taken sides in the conflict and in some cases are fighting
each other. According to current estimates, more than 4,000 people
have died since January 1999 in a local war between Christians and
Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem there is that the military is not well equipped
and the commanders cannot control their troops if they cannot
provide for them properly,'' said Said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of their low pay and poor supplies, Crouch said, the
military in the Malukus has been broken into small units that are
billeted with local residents. ``If the Christian side attacks a
village and some Muslim troops are there, naturally they'll fight,
and vice versa,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the problem runs deeper, to the low pay that has caused the
Indonesian military to live off the land as it carries out its
nationwide political and security roles. Local commanders run
businesses and protection schemes and are deeply involved in
illegal logging, mining and other activities.
</P>
<P>
   Individual soldiers hire themselves out in all sorts of jobs,
Crouch said _ ``illegal, semi-legal, a-legal and occasionally some
legal jobs like bodyguards.''
</P>
<P>
   Now with conflict erupting around Indonesia's archipelago, the
military is being called on increasingly to act as a peacekeeping
force.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you send them into a real battle zone and they are just not
prepared for that sort of thing,'' Crouch said. ``They are still
thinking, `How can I make more money? I'll sell my bullets to
people, or something.' When you send in peacekeeping troops and
they go selling their arms to the combatants, what do you do?''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond selling weapons, the military continues to be involved in
abuses around the country, partly, he said, because it is the only
way they know of asserting their authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the first 30 years of Suharto, they didn't care,'' he said.
``If there was a problem, shoot them up, beat them up, torture
them, kill them, it didn't matter. There was no investigation. It
even goes back to Dutch colonial times. If one of your people gets
shot, you go to the nearby villages and burn a few houses and shoot
a few people.''
</P>
<P>
   This has given rise to one of the strangest elements of military
jargon to be found here, ``emotion'' as it refers to military
activities.
</P>
<P>
   In East Timor, in Aceh and in the Maluku islands, when troops
have run amok, their commanders have shrugged their shoulders at
the strange ways of fighting men and explained, ``Oh, they have
become emotional.''
</P>
<P>
   To Crouch that is one of the most telling signs of the lack of
professionalism in the Indonesian military, from top to bottom.
``Professional troops might have emotions,'' he said, ``but they
keep them inside. That is the job of professional troops, not to
become emotional.''
</P>
<P>
   What is most troubling, he said, is that their senior commanders
seem to find the emotions of their men a satisfactory military
explanation for mayhem.

BUSH SAYS MILITARY ALLOWED TO DWINDLE UNDER CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GLEN JOHNSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES _ The next president will ``inherit a military in
decline,'' Republican nominee George W. Bush charged Monday,
blaming the Clinton administration for readiness and morale
problems within the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to more than 5,000 people in Milwaukee at the national
convention of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Texas governor
cited a litany of concerns and faulted the current
commander-in-chief, President Clinton, and the Democratic
presidential nominee, Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Among the complaints: soldiers qualifying for food stamps, a
shortage of cruise missiles for the Navy, enlistment shortfalls for
the Army, and a decline in Air Force readiness from 85 percent of
combat units when Clinton took office in 1993 to 65 percent as of
Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Bush repeated a vow to add $1 billion in new military pay and
unveiled another proposal to spend $310 million improving 20 school
districts on or near military bases. The bulk are in California and
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The facts are stark and the facts are real,'' said Bush, whose
father, former President Bush, led the Persian Gulf War and passed
stewardship of the armed forces to Clinton. ``The current
administration inherited a military ready for the dangers and
challenges facing our nation. The next president will inherit a
military in decline.''
</P>
<P>
   He then drew applause from his audience of mostly graying
veterans wearing caps of their local VFW post by sounding a battle
cry for him and his running mate, who is a former defense
secretary. ``Dick Cheney and I have a simple message for our men
and women in uniform, their parents, their loved ones, their
supporters: Help is on the way,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is scheduled to address the VFW meeting Tuesday. His
spokesman said Bush could not afford to rebuild the military
because his proposed 10-year, $1.3 trillion tax cut would consume
projected budget surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Chris Lehane, referring to General Henry Shelton,
chairman of Joint Chiefs, and Defense Secretary William Cohen,
said: ``First of all, General Shelton has a different view. The
former Republican senator and current secretary of defense has a
different view. . . . We have the best-trained, best-equipped
military in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Cutbacks in military spending did not begin under Clinton but in
1986 under President Reagan, a Republican, as the Cold War drew to
a close. Under President Bush, military spending steadily declined
from $292 billion annually in fiscal 1989 to $265 billion by fiscal
1991.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's criticism is part of a post-convention retooling of his
stump speech to sharpen the focus on education, tax cuts,
religious-based welfare programs, Medicare and Social Security
reform, and military readiness.
</P>
<P>
   His comments came as two polls showed Gore ahead for the first
time in months after last week's Democratic National Convention in
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   An ABC News-Washington Post poll released Monday showed Gore
leading Bush 50 percent to 45 percent. A CBS News poll showed that
Gore had picked up 10 points to essentially tie the race, 43-42
percent, in a four-way race including Green Party candidate Ralph
Nader at 5 percent and Reform Party candidate Patrick J. Buchanan
at 1 percent. A CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll released Sunday had Gore
at 47 percent and Bush at 46 percent.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush's staff has crowed in the past several months about
the durability of his lead over Gore, Bush played down the latest
surveys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Polls will be up and down and that,'' he told reporters on his
campaign plane. ``I like my chances, but I know I have a lot of
work to do. It's going to be a close race.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican pollster Frank Luntz cautioned that Gore's rise may
be a temporary blip, since Gore's convention speech ``exceeded
expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is so much fluidity ... because there is no intensity,''
Luntz said about the polls. ``You can see the public switch from
week to week because they don't feel strongly about the election.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore is an Army veteran who served in Vietnam, and Bush served
stateside as a pilot in the Texas Air National Guard. Even during
the Republican primaries against Senator John S. McCain of Arizona,
a decorated Navy veteran and former Vietnam prisoner of war, Bush
complained about a loss of morale in the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   The criticism played particularly well in South Carolina, home
to a large concentration of military bases and military retirees.
It was there that Bush rebounded from his New Hampshire primary
loss to McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Bush was greeted at the VFW meeting by a lone protester
dressed as Jesus Christ. He held a cross inscribed with ``WWJD,''
short for ``What would Jesus do?'' Written on the horizontal arm of
the cross was: ``Vote Democrat.''
</P>
<P>
   In citing his concerns to the veterans, Bush said: ``I don't
care what's said in a political campaign. These are signs of a
military in decline and we must do something about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, President Clinton signed into law a bill
providing $75.8 billion in military pay increases. Bush has already
said he would add another $1 billion annually.
</P>
<P>
   His $310 million school-repair proposal was similar to one he
made last week. In New Mexico, Bush proposed spending $802 million
to repair schools on Indian reservations and another $126 million
to replace the six worst schools.
</P>
<P>
   While the federal government controls less than 7 percent of all
school spending, Bush aides said the governor's proposals addressed
the two areas directly under federal control, military dependant
and Indian reservation schooling.
</P>
<P>
   After his two-hour stop in Wisconsin, the governor flew to Iowa
to visit the Downtown School, a charter school started in 1993 by
parents who work downtown and want to be close to their children.
It has an enrollment of 160 pupils and a waiting list of over 500.
</P>
<P>
   He also attended two fund-raisers for the Iowa Republican Party,
one for donors who contributed a total of $350,000 and another
expected to raise $210,000.
</P>
<P>
   Bush will travel to Peoria, Ill., Tuesday for a school visit
before flying to St. Louis to stop at another school and attend
three private fund-raisers on behalf of the state and national
Republican parties, as well as for Senator John Ashcroft of
Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is planning to take Wednesday off and has a three-day
weekend scheduled, but he bristled when asked if he is conducting a
leisurely campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we've had a pretty active schedule and are
continuing to have an active schedule. I like the pace that I'm
on,'' he told reporters.

ZDTV RENAMING ITSELF TO TECHTV 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ ZDTV, sold to Paul Allen's Vulcan Ventures
investment company last year, is shedding the last vestiges of its
Ziff-Davis heritage and going mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco-based cable channel, founded in 1998 as part
of the Framingham, Mass.-based Ziff-Davis Inc. media empire, Monday
said it is renaming itself Techtv.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ZD part of our name was no longer appropriate, since
Ziff-Davis no longer owns us,'' said Larry Wangberg, the channel's
chief executive. ``We wanted a more descriptive, more intuitive
name, and we think we've found it.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the name change, the channel is positioning its
programs for a wider audience yearning to live the ``digital
lifestyle.''
</P>
<P>
   To prove that it's not just for dweebs anymore, Techtv will add
shows such as Cybercrime (a techie version of the ``Cops''
television show), Internet Tonight (featuring Entertainment
Tonight-style programming), AudioFile (for digital music lovers)
and Money Machine (how to invest in technology stocks).
</P>
<P>
   Within a year-and-a-half, the channel will offer nine hours of
original programming a day, up from the current six hours, said Joe
Gillespie, Techtv's chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be to technology what MTV is to music,'' said
Gillespie.
</P>
<P>
   About 19 million households have access to Techtv through cable
or satellite television. It is also broadcast over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   To help the channel reach more viewers, Techtv is forging deals
with Time Warner Cable, AT&AMP;T, and Charter Communications. Wangberg
estimates those relationships will add 4 million viewers by the end
of the year.

LAST JAILED IN DAY CARE ABUSE CASE TO GET HEARING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SACHA PFEIFFER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Fourteen years after he was convicted of molesting
children at his family's Malden day care center, Gerald ``Tooky''
Amirault will appear next month before the state's Advisory Board
of Pardons, which has taken the unusual step of scheduling a public
hearing on Amirault's request that his sentence be commuted.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing raises the possibility that Amirault, the last
member of his family to remain imprisoned for convictions stemming
from the infamous Fells Acres child sex abuse case, could be freed
after spending nearly 15 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   A commutation, which would need to be approved by the governor
and the Governor's Council, is the only way Amirault could be freed
any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   Since being sentenced in 1986, Amirault, 46, has lost three
appeals of his conviction, once in Middlesex Superior Court and
twice before the state Supreme Judicial Court. He is not eligible
for parole until 2006.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Violet Amirault, and sister, Cheryl LeFave, were
convicted in 1987 and sentenced to 8 to 20 years, but were freed on
appeal in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The Advisory Board of Pardons, which comprises the same members
as the state Parole Board, released a statement Monday saying that
the hearing had been scheduled ``in the interest of fairness and in
light of the treatment of the petitioner's co-defendants within the
judicial system.''
</P>
<P>
   Parole Board spokeswoman Alberta Cook declined to comment
further, saying that, ``The statement speaks for itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Violet Amirault died of cancer three years ago. And last year,
after the SJC reinstated her conviction, both LeFave's attorneys
and the Middlesex District Attorney's office, which had prosecuted
the case, agreed that she would not be returned to prison and was
freed.
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference, Gerald Amirault's attorney, James L.
Sultan, called the board's decision to schedule a hearing ``an
incredibly important step on this long journey to rectify this
grievous injustice.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Middlesex District Attorney's office, which called
Amirault's conviction and sentence ``appropriate,'' said it would
oppose commutation.
</P>
<P>
   ``When there are endless appeals and other proceedings, the
wounds are constantly reopened,'' Middlesex District Attorney
Martha Coakley said in a statement. ``There have been many such
occasions during the pendancy of this case. As a result, the trauma
suffered by the victims...may never go away.''
</P>
<P>
   The Amirault family was thrust into the public eye in 1984, when
Violet Amirault, her son, Gerald, and daughter, Cheryl, were
charged with raping and assaulting children at Fells Acres Day
School, the child care center they ran in suburban Malden.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting trials, during which child witnesses described
talking robots and the public torture of animals, contributed to a
national debate about the reliability of child testimony and the
prosecution of child sex abuse crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Sultan said he will make three main arguments for the
commutation of Gerald Amirault's sentence: that his conviction
amounted to a ``grave injustice'' because testimony by child
witnesses was tainted by overly-suggestive questioning by
investigators; that his 30- to-40-year sentence is ``way off the
map'' when compared to convictions for similar offenses, which
Sultan said average 4 to 10 years; and that Amirault is a
``terrific parent, a terrific husband, and a model prisoner.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the Advisory Board of Pardons hears Amirault's petition, it
will make a written recommendation to Governor Paul Cellucci, who
has the power to grant or deny commutation. Cellucci's
recommendation must then be ratified by the Governor's Council.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Cellucci said the governor ``will give the
request proper consideration once it reaches his desk.''
</P>
<P>
   Accompanying Sultan at the press conference were Gerald
Amirault's wife, Patty, his daughters Katie, 20, and Gerrilyn, 21,
his sister, Cheryl, and several other family members. Amirault also
has a 15-year-old son, P.J., who was not present at the press
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Patty Amirault acknowledged that a commutation would not clear
her husband's name but said, ``At this point, we'll take him home
any way we can.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know he's innocent and we want him home with us so we can
pick up and move on with our lives,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   But while family members expressed optimism, clemency remains a
long shot.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 250 commutation petitions received by the Advisory Board
of Pardons in the last ten years, only 29 hearings were granted and
only 13 favorable recommendations were made to the Governor.
Ultimately, only seven commutations were granted.
</P>
<P>
   Sultan said that Amirault underwent a ``sexual dangerousness
evaluation'' this spring that found that he is ``perfectly normal
and his release would not be a danger to anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Sultan also said that while the Supreme Judicial Court had
``slammed the door in our face every time,'' Amirault's pursuit of
freedom is ``winning in the court of public opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   The general public, Sultan said, acknowledges that there is
``something just rotten to the core about this case and these
convictions.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Back in what now seems like another era of the Internet Age,
going to work for a dot-com company for peanuts in cash _ but piles
of stock options _ was widely seen as the quick route to
millionairehood.
</P>
<P>
   But a survey released Tuesday by PricewaterhouseCoopers
indicates that the collapse in Net and dot-com stocks seems to be
pushing companies to pay their executives more like old-economy
companies, with a somewhat bigger emphasis on salaries and cash
bonuses tied to company results.
</P>
<P>
   And in the short term, the trend is healthy for both the
companies and their stockholders, according to top analysts
with &UR;  &LR; PricewaterhouseCoopers' Unifi Network, which studies
executive compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to a year earlier, the most recent survey of 123
Internet companies found that the value of stock options awarded to
top company executives basically held steady, but salaries have
increased on average 9 percent and bonuses 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Generally speaking, the average Net chief executive officer is
making an average of $175,000 to $275,000 in salary, more at
companies with bigger market valuations, and a cash bonus of
$40,000 to $110,000. Cash pay still lags behind pay in long-term
stock options worth $250,000 to $3.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   However, the data suggest that Net companies are starting to act
a little more like their ``old economy'' cousins by increasing
their emphasis on cash pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies are starting to get it: Even if you are a dot-com or
an Internet company, you've got to start acting more like a
business,'' said Edward J. Speidel, a Unifi Network director.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, shareholder advocates have decried
multimillion-dollar pay packages for executives, especially in
cases where the company's shares delivered anemic returns.
</P>
<P>
   Many have successfully pressed companies large and small to make
more executive pay in the form of stock options whose value is
directly tied to company stock performance. A typical option
package would allow an executive to buy company stock in five to 10
years at the closing price last Dec. 31, so that the more the stock
goes up, the more profit the executive can reap.
</P>
<P>
   But Internet and dot-com companies may have overdone it, the
Unifi study suggests, and begun gradually scaling back an excessive
emphasis on options.
</P>
<P>
   Since the March tech-sector rout on Wall Street, many of those
companies' stocks are ``underwater,'' or trading well below levels
at which executives can make money by exercising options to buy
stock.
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, Speidel and his colleague say, a bonus of
something like $250,000 in cash tied to specific financial results
may be a much stronger incentive for Net company executives to whip
their businesses into shape than another 10,000 stock options whose
value is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bonuses have gotten much larger, and that's a function of the
pressure that they're feeling from shareholders to get closer to
profitability,'' Speidel said. ``If anything, from a shareholder
perspective, that's a positive sign.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides creating stronger incentives to improve company
financial performance _ hard cash instead of more uncertainly
valued stock options _ the trend could also mitigate growing
problems of ``overhang,'' or big troves of unexercised executive
stock options threatening shareholder value.
</P>
<P>
   The 123 companies include a cross-section of ``access and
infrastructure'' gear makers, companies selling Net software,
Internet content sites, and business-to-business and
business-to-consumer e-commerce sites.
</P>
<P>
   Across all companies, there was a median 23 percent stock
overhang, calculated as authorized and unexercised stock options as
a percent of total shares trading.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies reported ``overhang'' rates as high as 64
percent. A typical comparable number for a non-technology, Fortune
200 company would be in the range of 10 percent to 12 percent,
Speidel said.
</P>
<P>
   The reason this is of concern to shareholders is that, in the
case of a company with a 25 percent overhang rate, if executives
exercised all those stock options, people who now own shares would
see their effective share of ownership in the company drop by 20
percent, which presumably would drop the share price.
</P>
<P>
   No numbers for individual corporations were provided. But the
highest overhang rates, over 23 percent, were reported in
``Internet tools'' companies such as multimedia and e-mail software
and ``B-to-B'' sites.
</P>
<P>
   Across the board, compared to last year, Internet companies also
slightly increased the rate at which they gave away ownership of
the company to executives through options packages, with a median
of 8.4 percent compared to 7.3 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were a shareholder, I'd pull out my company 10-K''
earnings report ``and proxy statement and figure out what level of
dilution might be coming from these options programs, and compare
that to the revenue growth of the company,'' Speidel said.

HEDGE FUND MANAGERS APOLOGIZE AND TRY AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 By DANNY HAKIM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Meriwether is ready to apologize, but not ready to quit.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, high-risk strategies drove his hedge fund empire,
Long-Term Capital, to the brink of collapse and unsettled world
financial markets. Now Meriwether, 52, is struggling to raise money
for a new fund and making an attempt to repair his reputation by
apologizing for failed strategies. In interviews appearing Monday
in The Wall Street Journal and The Financial Times, Meriwether
conceded that his strategy had not worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our whole approach was fundamentally flawed,'' Meriwether was
quoted as saying in the Journal. ``I feel enormous remorse.''
</P>
<P>
   Eric Rosenfeld, one of his past and current partners, said
Monday, ``I wish we had recognized the faults.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked why they were speaking out now, Rosenfeld said:
``Frankly, we thought it might be a good time to tell our story _
one that we have been telling a long time to investors. It's a
point where everything has been taken care of with Long-Term and
everyone paid off. Our new attitude is being more open.''
</P>
<P>
   The public contrition, after two years of mostly silence, comes
a few weeks before the publication of a new book about Long-Term
Capital by Roger Lowenstein, a journalist, titled ``When Genius
Failed: The Rise and Fall of Long-Term Capital Management.''
</P>
<P>
   Long-Term Capital, with several Wall Street legends and two
Nobel laureates among its advisers, had $7.5 billion in assets in
1997. But bets on the direction of global bond prices went against
them, draining $4 billion from the fund in nine months in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The unraveling of Long-Term was spurred in part by Russia's
default on its debt payments, and by the fund's heavy use of
leverage, or borrowed money, which accelerated the fund's troubles.
Ultimately, it took a consortium of 14 Wall Street firms to bail
out the firm.
</P>
<P>
   Lowenstein describes how Meriwether and his partners wrangled
with the Wall Street firms trying to rescue Long-Term Capital and
how the partners, ``motivated by insatiable greed,'' ultimately
lost the bulk of their personal fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   Lowenstein's book follows another, ``Inventing Money: The Story
of Long-Term Capital Management and the Legends Behind it,'' by
Nicholas Dunbar, which came out earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Stavis, one of Meriwether's successors as head of Salomon
Brothers' arbitrage group and an investor in the fund, said, ``It's
been an interesting question why they haven't said anything for two
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Meriwether and Rosenfeld, and several other partners, are
operating as JWM Partners from Long-Term Capital's old offices in
Greenwich, Conn. The Relative Value Opportunity Portfolio, as the
new fund is called, is billed as a conservative version of the
former fund.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative, of course, is in the eye of the beholder. The
fund's managers say they will use less leverage, borrowing about
$10 for every $1 invested, as opposed to the nearly $30 to $1
leverage that Long-Term Capital sometimes reached. The new fund
also aims for returns of 15 percent a year, half the 30 percent a
year sought by Long-Term Capital.
</P>
<P>
   The firm says it has raised $350 million to $400 million since
its inception last December, well short of the $1 billion it would
like. Institutional investors, some of whom were burned by
Long-Term Capital, have largely stayed away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, he's the poster child for all that's perceived
wrong with hedge funds _ volatility, risk, exposure,'' said Barry
Colvin, chief operating officer for Tremont Advisors, a consulting
firm for the hedge fund industry, referring to Meriwether.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very hard allocation for anybody to make. If you're
right, you're eking out 15 percent to 20 percent returns. If you're
wrong, how stupid are you? There's a whole lot of downside.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, that Meriwether and Rosenfeld have raised several hundred
million dollars at all is testament to either faith or folly. Many
of the investors are former associates of Meriwether from the days
when he ran the bond arbitrage group at Salomon Bros., now a unit
of Citigroup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave them real money because I believe in what they're
doing,'' said Stavis, now a partner at the venture capital firm
Bessemer Venture Partners. He believes there might be more
opportunity for their strategies now that other firms as well as
Long-Term have abandoned it. Basically, the new fund, like
Long-Term, makes sophisticated bets mostly on the convergence of
the yields of similar bonds around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenfeld said that the Long-Term partners believed that they
were well diversified because they were using different strategies
in different markets around the world, but realized too late that
``there was a thread that ran through all of these trades,''
namely, that during a market crisis too many investors fled from
positions they viewed as illiquid, regardless of their relative
value.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, there is still some confidence. JWM charges a higher
fee than the normal 1 percent flat fee and 20 percent performance
fee charged by most hedge funds. JWM, like Long-Term, charges a 2
percent annual fee and a performance fee of 20 percent of profits.
Since its beginning in December, the fund is up about 7.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Despite modest returns so far, a July letter to investors said,
``All in all, the prospects for our style of market neutral,
relative value investing remain attractive going forward.''
</P>
<P>
   As to the steep losses at Long-Term Capital, ``We're not blaming
the markets,'' Rosenfeld said. ``Markets do what they do. In
hindsight, we missed this, and we're paid not to miss these
things.''

OBSTACLES TO LONDON-FRANKFURT EXCHANGE MERGER STILL REMAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  By ALAN COWELL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Only weeks before shareholders vote on a planned merger
of the London and Frankfurt stock exchanges, British and German
regulators said on Monday that the two bourses had not yet devised
adequate rules to guarantee the financial transparency of what
would be Europe's dominant, transnational stock market by far.
</P>
<P>
   The unusual joint comment by Britain's Financial Services
Authority and Germany's Federal Securities Trading Security
Authority seemed to add to the questions piling up around the
merger, according to British traders who had already questioned the
framework of the proposed new exchange. Many have been skeptical
since reading the initial agreement, which was vaguely worded.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a preliminary document saying here are some of the issues
which we need to work out,'' said Brian Mairs, a spokesman for the
Association of Private Client Stock Brokers and Investment
Managers, the representative body of British private client
brokers, who control about one-third of the shares in the London
Stock Exchange. ``It's evidently not enough to sort out all the
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Mairs, said, some assurances from the regulators were
encouraging. ``The more transparency the better; we're very
pleased,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The London shareholders are set to vote on Sept. 14 to approve
or reject the merger. Approval needs a 75 percent majority.
</P>
<P>
   In their seven-page document released on Monday, the British and
German supervisory authorities singled out the marked differences
in both the legal and practical approaches to disclosure on the
London and Frankfurt exchanges, which mean, for instance, that
start-ups in Germany face different listing requirements on
Germany's Neue Markt than on Britain's Alternative Investment
Market. Additionally, most large trades in Britain must be reported
to the exchange immediately while many large trades in Frankfurt
are not subject to the same requirement, according to British
traders.
</P>
<P>
   The British and German regulators said, however, in the merged
exchange, all trades would be reported to both regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the proposed merger, London would handle
mostly blue-chip transactions while start-ups and high-growth
company stocks would be concentrated in Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The authorities note that the legal and regulatory
requirements governing the scope and level of their transparency
arrangements needs further consideration in consultation with
market participants,'' the document said.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time the regulators had commented publicly on
the planned merger, announced last May. The merger is part of a
Europe-wide scramble for alliances as traditional exchanges are
challenged both by Internet-based electronic trading systems and by
investors' demands for a single bourse that reflects the growing
perception of Europe as a single market. The new, merged exchange
is to be called iX, for international exchange, with corporate
headquarters in London.
</P>
<P>
   The regulators' statement said: ``The development of iX needs to
take full account of requirements of market integrity _ in
particular the prevention of insider dealing and market abuse _ and
of market transparency and the protection of investors.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard Davies, the chairman of Britain's Financial Services
authority watchdog, also said the ``overriding objective'' of
British and German regulators was ``to ensure that iX's proposals
take full account of our requirements for market integrity,
investor protection and the prevention of market abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   The combined exchange would far outstrip other European
exchanges with a combined market value of $4.3 trillion, making it
the world's fourth largest after the New York Stock Exchange, the
Nasdaq and the Tokyo stock exchange. Plans for a separate European
transnational exchange, called Euronext, would group the Paris,
Amsterdam and Brussels bourses, trading stocks with a market value
of about $2.2 trillion.

DOGFISH CATCH CURTAILED ALONG EASTERN US 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH DALEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Fishermen from Maine to Florida will be prohibited for
at least six months from catching the spiny dogfish that millions
of Britons munch in fish and chips _ a move that probably signals
the implementation of a strict quota system for the overfished
shark.
</P>
<P>
   The unanimous decision by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries
Commission was more symbolic than hard-hitting because most
fishermen have already caught their quota of dogfish this year.
Commission members, however, said their vote Monday sent a message
that yet another fishing stock is quickly declining and in need of
rescue.
</P>
<P>
   But for Massachusetts, which allows fishermen to catch 11 times
the federal dogfish quota within the 3 nautical miles from the
coast that make up state waters, the move could severely damage its
prominence as the nation's largest dogfish hauler.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts joined in the commission vote Monday, in large
part because the state's quota was met last week. But state
officials and fishermen say there are plenty of dogfish and they do
not support stricter quotas on their catch. Some want to allow
fishermen to haul in even more of the shark.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're closing our fishery this Friday,'' said David Pierce,
acting assistant director for the state Division of Marine
Fisheries and a commission member. ``But this is the one species
where there is just a great difference of opinion over what to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   The spiny dogfish, which can grow three feet in length, were for
years disdained by fisherman because they clogged nets meant to
catch precious cod or other fish considered more valuable. But the
``trash fish'' gained new popularity in the last 10 years as other
fisheries were depleted. Now, dogfish are heavily fished in state
waters and often make up the majority of fish hauled into seacoast
towns like Scituate.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 55 percent of the 49 million pounds of dogfish landed in
the United States comes from Massachusetts. There are three
processing plants in the state, and in Plymouth, spiny dogfish
account for 96 percent of all fish landings.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlantic States commission's decision takes effect in
mid-October and will carry through to the end of April 2001. The
commission plans to meet in February to start hashing out how many
dogfish will be caught in the future. Such a plan could take a year
or more to develop. The commission sets fishing practices in state
waters.
</P>
<P>
   While an outright ban is unlikely, the commission has usually
followed closely what the federal government imposes in its waters.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists were quick to praise the commission, but said
a management plan that protects the fish needs to be developed
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a temporary plan,'' said Sonja Fordham, Fisheries
Project Manager for the Center for Marine Conservation. ``If we
don't act quickly, this will be a huge, shameful waste.''

&HT;     U.S. PLANS TO RELIEVE AIR TRAFFIC CONGESTION IN THE EAST 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In an effort to reduce airline travel delays,
Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater announced Monday that the
federal government will ease takeoff and landing rules in the
eastern United States by the end of October.
</P>
<P>
   Slater said the goal is to ease the air traffic flow at ``choke
points,'' the nation's most congested air spaces, which are located
over a triangle bounded by Boston, Washington, D.C. and Chicago. A
major choke point in that triangle is the space over the
metropolitan New York City area.
</P>
<P>
   The government plans to improve the traffic flow to and from
those congested corridors in part by allowing pilots to fly at
lower altitudes. Airlines historically have resisted lower flight
paths because jets flying in them are less efficient and burn up
more fuel. But the government is asking the airlines to cooperate
in order to cut congestion on these flight paths in time for the
Thanksgiving holiday rush.
</P>
<P>
   Slater announced the plan at a news conference after discussing
travel problems with airline, airport and labor representatives. He
called the meeting ``a necessary first step in resolving some
</P>
<P>
   of the challenges'' faced by the industry.
</P>
<P>
   He also said his department will create a task force to monitor
airline service and report its findings to him within 90 days.
</P>
<P>
   June was the worst month ever for flight delays, according to
the Federal Aviation Administration. In that month alone, there
were nearly 50,000 delays of 15 minutes or more. Delays were 18
percent lower in June 1999 and 58 percent lower in June 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Slater blamed bad weather for part of the problem. He said June
had 19 severe weather days, 12 of which were consecutive. June of
1999 had five such days, the FAA said.
</P>
<P>
   This spring generally had a higher number of delays. The FAA
tally of delays for April through June is 6 percent higher than for
the same period last year and 37 percent higher than for the same
period in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Transportation Association, which represents airlines,
has said another factor in the delays is an aging air traffic
control system.
</P>
<P>
   But the FAA and air traffic controllers have said the airlines
may be scheduling too many flights. Citing the growth in the number
of flights, the agency said there were 22,000 flights daily in the
United States last year, about a quarter more than in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Slater said Monday that the aviation system is nearing full
capacity, and that ``we are beginning to tax the system.''

OFFICIALS CONSIDER THINNING SMALL TREES TO HELP STOP BIG FIRES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ariz., Mont., Idaho, Wash.)   By DOUGLAS JEHL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. _ In a major new foray into wildfire
prevention, the Clinton administration will try to put into broad
effect an experimental effort under way here that is intended to
leave public lands far less prone to the kind of blazes that have
scorched millions of acres of Western forests this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The approach contemplated would aim to reduce future dangers by
thinning small trees from forests and leaving the largest, most
fire-resistant ones. One draft, being circulated by the Forest
Service as enormous fires in Montana and other states continue to
burn, calls for thinning, over 15 years, most or all of the 40
million acres of national forest now deemed at high risk of
catastrophic fire.
</P>
<P>
   The estimated cost of the plan would total $825 million a year,
said an administration official, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has been criticized in recent days by
conservatives for not doing more sooner to combat the fire threat
in the West through emergency logging measures advocated by the
timber industry.
</P>
<P>
   At least a partial version of that approach could be made public
as early as next month, when Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt and
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman are due to report to President
Clinton with a reassessment prompted by the current fire season,
which is on track to become the most devastating in decades.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials have declined to say specifically what
may be in the works but they have clearly signaled an intention to
expand significantly the kinds of thinning efforts already under
way here. They expressed open admiration for the experiment being
attempted in the dense Ponderosa pine forests outside Flagstaff,
where a broad coalition of government, industry and environmental
leaders has joined forces behind a costly approach that involves
the removal of many small trees while larger, more commercially
valuable trees are left behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really need to scale this up to a significant level,''
Babbitt said in an interview when asked about the Flagstaff plan,
which was initiated in 1998 with federal support but is so far
being carried out on a very small scale.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials have dismissed criticisms of inaction
as politically motivated, but they appear now to be moving toward
adoption of a Flagstaff-style alternative in the hope that it may
prove acceptable to the timber industry and environmental groups.
</P>
<P>
   As evidence of the plan's promise, its architects point to what
did and did not happen in June, when one of this year's big blazes,
known as the Pumpkin fire, swept through dense stands of Ponderosa
pine in a section of the Kaibab National Forest not far from this
mountain town.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the experiment, a stand of Ponderosa pines had
previously been thinned to about 10 percent of its former density,
with the largest and most fire-resistant trees among those that
were left behind. And as the architects had hoped, that small
island was mostly spared as flames that had been leaping
uncontrollably from treetop to treetop dropped to ground level as
they reached the test zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have seen from results that are on the ground, if
we can reduce the density of trees, we can have a better chance of
controlling the wildfires,'' said Jim Golden, a forest supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as it has unfolded here, the Flagstaff initiative has
illustrated the formidable hurdles that may yet lie in the way of a
plan that has yet to satisfy fully either side in a bitter debate
and would require that a formula be found to make possible the
harvest of unprecedented quantities of low-quality wood.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the most powerful opponents include environmental groups
that regard the effort as little more than a veil for commercial
logging efforts, which they say should have no place in national
forests.
</P>
<P>
   Though a broad coalition assembled in support of the plan
includes a number of environmental groups, among them the Nature
Conservancy and the Grand Canyon Trust, the opponents have
succeeded in preventing the initiative from being carried out on
anything more than a tiny scale.
</P>
<P>
   ``We strongly oppose the project as it now stands and will
litigate again to stop it,'' said Bryan Bird, executive director of
the Forest Conservation Council of Santa Fe, N.M., one of several
organizations that are seeking to block the next step in the plan.
That step would widen the experiment zone from 300 to more than
5,000 acres.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt, fire experts say, that most Western forests
have become dangerously overgrown, and thinning them could reduce
the risk of a repeat of the current fire season.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, federal officials said that the total amount of land
burned by wildfires this year was already well in excess of 5
million acres, with many blazes in hard-hit states like Montana and
Idaho not likely to be extinguished until the first snows.
</P>
<P>
   But questions about the scope and potential cost of such
projects remain the source of bitter divisions that are likely to
surface even more visibly this fall, as Congress holds hearings
about this summer's fires and begins to weigh any administration
plan.
</P>
<P>
   Among the critics who have attacked the administration is Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas. In an Aug. 12 interview with The Seattle
Times, he said that policies that had restricted logging and
thinning of underbrush had ``made the forests much more dangerous
to fire.'' But in an interview, Babbitt said the administration
stood fully behind the thinning approach, and blamed the lack of
progress on legal and administrative maneuvering by the opponents.
``The problem is that we keep getting jammed up, and we've just got
to bust that barrier,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As presented in the draft Forest Service plan, a ``projected
treatment schedule'' calls for the thinning of 3 million acres of
Western forests each year by 2004, when the program would take full
effect. Over its proposed 15-year span, the total cost of the
program could top $12 billion, administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   While that price tag is substantial, the officials said it
should be compared to the cost of fighting this summer's fires,
which is expected to exceed $1 billion, and to the risk of leaving
Western forests in their current fire-prone condition.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In large measure, that condition is an outgrowth of what most
fire experts now agree were decades of mistaken policy, in which
until very recently, forest managers sought to extinguish virtually
every wildfire. That approach has spared most public lands of the
natural cleansing that a low-intensity fire can provide, while
leaving the dense forests that have resulted increasingly prone to
the kind of intense, fast-moving fires that have burned so much
land this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Future generations are going to damn us if we don't get on
this in a hurry,'' W. Wallace Covington, a professor of forest
ecology at the University of Northern Arizona and a main architect
of the Flagstaff plan, said of what he called an urgent need for
widespread forest thinning.
</P>
<P>
   Covington's approach, which has led to the thinning of some
experimental tracts by as much as 90 percent, aims to restore a
more natural and less-fire-prone condition that scholars say
existed in Western forests before the time of European settlement
in the late 1800s.
</P>
<P>
   But others argue say that the extent of scientific knowledge
does not yet justify such an aggressive overhaul of existing
woodlands.
</P>
<P>
   ``This approach is extreme and untested,'' said Sharon
Galbreath, who heads the local chapter of the Sierra Club, which
has expressed deep reservations about the plan. ``This should not
be billed as `If you do this, you save the forests of the West.' If
you do this, you might set back the forests of the West by 100
years.''
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the debate over thinning in Flagstaff have been
arguments over how much wood should be removed and how much should
be left behind. Those factors strongly affect the cost of any
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   No project can come anywhere close to breaking even unless
loggers are permitted to harvest large, commercially valuable
trees, as timber industry officials and their allies point out. The
industry argues that its ordinary practices are adequate to produce
healthy forests, and would allow thinning to be carried out at a
cost far less than is apparently being envisioned by the
administration.
</P>
<P>
   But other experts note that many of this summer's largest fires
are burning in areas that have previously been logged, and they
strongly defend the Flagstaff-style approach, of paying loggers
several hundred dollars an acre to subsidize what little they can
earn from selling the low-quality wood they are permitted to
harvest.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're doing is the opposite of logging, in that you leave
the best trees behind,'' said Brad Ack, executive director of the
Grand Canyon Partnership, the coalition group behind the Flagstaff
plan. ``What we need to do now is to invest in our forests.''

RUSSIA'S THEORY ON SUBMARINE INCIDENT HAS A COLD WAR RING 
</HEADLINE>
  (With RUSSIA-SUBMARINE) 
By   CHRISTOPHER DREW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Russian officials' assertions on Monday that the Kursk sank
after a collision, most likely with a foreign submarine, echoed the
kind of suspicions that were common during the Cold War, when on
more than a dozen occasions, Russian and Western submarines banged
into one another.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians have long resented the fact that many of the
collisions occurred in or near their waters and, in their view,
amounted to hit-and-run jobs, as American and British spy subs
quickly fled to safety. One Russian submarine was so badly damaged
after colliding with an American boat in 1970 that it almost sank,
the Russian navy contends.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials have repeatedly denied that any American
submarine collided with the Kursk, which plunged to the seabed on
Aug. 12. An intense rescue operation ended on Monday when the
Russians concluded that all 118 sailors had died in the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have said that two American submarines were in
the Barents Sea to monitor a Russian naval exercise that included
the Kursk. But they have said that neither submarine was close to
the Russian vessel. British officials also denied any involvement
on Monday, saying they had no submarines in the Barents Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Cold War ended, the tenor of the cat-and-mouse game,
in which the submarines chased one another to test the other side's
capabilities, has grown less aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   American officials even called Russian leaders to apologize
shortly after each of the last two collisions occurred, in the
early 1990s. And given the West's efforts to support democracy in
Russia, some naval experts said they could not conceive of a
situation in which American or British officials would attempt to
cover up a tragic accident now.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Friedman, an independent navy expert in New York, said
that he believes the Russian naval officials were trying to deflect
the blame for their own mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the evidence that has surfaced so far, he said it
seemed ``incredibly unlikely'' that the Kursk had suffered a
collision, especially with a foreign submarine. ``There are so many
other possibilities that you would have to rule out before you
focused on something as strange as that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   American navy officials and several experts like Friedman have
said that it was more likely that the Kursk sank after one of its
weapons, like a torpedo, exploded on board.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last week, Russian navy leaders also have cited the
possibility of a torpedo accident. There also was a chance, they
said, that the Kursk could have struck a floating mine left over
from World War II.
</P>
<P>
   But time after time, several Russian officials have brought up
the idea of a collision with a Western sub. And the Russian defense
minister, Igor Sergeyev, said on Monday that a commission of
experienced navy officials had endorsed this view.
</P>
<P>
   He said that after the Kursk shot a buoy to the surface to warn
that it was in trouble, men on two Russian ships detected signs of
a large underwater object ``equivalent in size'' to the Kursk. But
he said a ship designed to survey the seabed could not find this
object later.
</P>
<P>
   Former submariners say that many of the collisions have occurred
because submarines have to navigate by interpreting sounds filtered
through their sonar equipment. When two boats get close to each
other, even a small mistake by one in plotting the other's course
can cause them to collide.
</P>
<P>
   In most of the collisions during the Cold War, the Western and
Russian subs sustained only minor damage, like scratched hulls. The
Western subs generally were under orders to remain undetected, so
they never surfaced to try to aid the Soviet vessels.
</P>
<P>
   In the most serious incident, the Tautog, a nuclear-powered
attack submarine, collided in 1970 with a Soviet submarine close to
Russia's Pacific coast.
</P>
<P>
   The Soviet vessel, which was also operating under nuclear power,
sustained so much damage, former American officials have said, that
it was reported to President Nixon that the submarine had sunk. It
was only in recent years that enough information became available
in Russia to determine that while the submarine was severely
damaged, it had limped back to port.
</P>
<P>
   The last collisions between American and Russian subs occurred
in 1992 and 1993. In a break from Cold War secrecy, both the Bush
and Clinton administrations disclosed the accidents publicly.
</P>
<P>
   Both presidents also reduced the frequency of the reconnaissance
missions off Russia and ordered American subs to maintain greater
distances from Russian vessels.

GORE ACCUSES BUSH OF PROCRASTINATING ON PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HANNIBAL, Mo. _ As he concluded a four-day boat and bus trip
along the Mississippi River, Al Gore on Monday accused George W.
Bush of procrastinating on presidential debates and suggested his
Republican opponent does not want to face off in prime time.
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead to the final fall stretch of the campaign, Gore
has agreed to three presidential and two vice-presidential debates,
structured by the Commission on Presidential Debates.
</P>
<P>
   The Commission, a nonpartisan, nonprofit corporation that has
sponsored the general election presidential debates since 1988, has
proposed prime time encounters involving only the two major party
candidates and their running mates.
</P>
<P>
   Gore strategists believe their candidate, a skillful debater,
would best Bush in a series of head-on encounters. But they are not
eager to give national television exposure to Green Party nominee
Ralph Nader, who could hurt Gore with some Democrats if he went
after Gore in a debate.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has not ruled out including third party candidates. Last
week, Bush campaign officials proposed a series of three
presidential and two vice-presidential debates, but said they
wanted to shop around for other sponsors and formats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he is procrastinating,'' Gore said. ``It is
unprecedented in modern times for the major party candidate to try
and stiff the prime time debate commission.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, campaigning in Wisconsin, responded to Gore's attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``There'll be debates. We said we're going to look at all
options and that's what's taking place,'' he said. When pressed as
to how he wanted debates structured Bush remained vague, saying
``I'm comfortable in almost any format.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what I'd like to do is to have debates ... where
people get a sense for what we believe, that's structured so that
both of us are to share our ideas in a way that people will listen
to,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore suggested that his Republican rival may be trying to avoid
a direct verbal match at a time when most voters can tune in.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said his opponent ``apparently wants to see if he can get
away with some Sunday morning talk show when nobody is watching
much and substituting that for what the American people have a
right to expect, namely, one-on-one debates in prime time when
everybody can hear a detailed discussion of the issues. I don't
know why he wants to duck that.''
</P>
<P>
   In past election years, the debate commission has overseen
forums that included the candidates being questioned by each other,
by a panel of journalists and by voters in the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Gore predicted Bush eventually will agree to the Commission's
rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people have a right in this day and time to be
respected with an adult intelligent discussion of what the major
issues are in a give and take without the slick image makers
intervening,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's latest broadside comes at a time when he has largely
ignored Bush and let his running mate, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, lob
the partisan barbs.
</P>
<P>
   The skirmishing over debates came as the Gores and Liebermans
completed their post-convention swing through four key Midwestern
states.
</P>
<P>
   Cruising down the Mississippi on the Mark Twain Riverboat, the
candidates and their wives held their final riverside rally at the
birthplace of the boat's namesake, the 19th century author who
penned the popular tales of boyhood adventure, ``Tom Sawyer'' and
``Huckleberry Finn.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the past four days, Gore has made his way down 400 miles of
the famed river, holding rallies in small cities and towns in
Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois and Missouri. These are all states that
President Clinton won in 1992 and 1996 but which so far Gore has
failed to nail down.
</P>
<P>
   A batch of new polls out Tuesday provided more evidence that
Gore enjoyed a bounce from the Democratic convention in Los
Angeles. In a Reuters Zogby poll, Gore inched ahead of Bush 44
percent to 41 percent, strengthening his support among Democrats
and women, two crucial demographic groups where he was showing
weaknesses earlier this summer. Just before the Democratic
convention the same poll had Gore down by three points.
</P>
<P>
   The survey of likely voters, conducted Friday through Sunday,
found independent voters, who had favored Bush, now split between
Gore and Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But Andy Kohut, who directs polling for the Pew Center for the
People and the Press, warned that post-convention surges are
usually ``ephemeral.''
</P>
<P>
   Kohut, who expects to conduct a poll in a few weeks, said Gore
got the same kind of bump that Bush did after his convention in
Philadelphia.

 &HT;    In Godsey they trust
 &HT;    By Norman Arey
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - Just who is George Godsey, the man whom George O'Leary
has handed the quarterback reins for 2000?
</P>
<P>
   Most Georgia Tech fans know him as the blond guy who signaled in
the plays to Joe Hamilton the past three seasons; the guy holding
the clipboard; the guy standing beside offensive coordinator Ralph
Friedgen; the guy with No. 11 on his back.
</P>
<P>
   A few might even remember Godsey on the field, although they'd
have had to look fast. He attempted 13 passes last season and 19 in
1998. His longest run from scrimmage has been 11 yards and his
longest pass has been 24. He never has scored a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Tampa native's one shining moment came on a busted
play. Against Georgia last season, he recovered Luke Manget's
blocked field-goal attempt on third down in overtime, which allowed
Tech to kick the game-winner on the next play.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, the 6-foot-2, 207-pound Godsey will be the Yellow
Jackets' starting quarterback against Virginia Tech on national
television in packed Lane Stadium in Blacksburg.
</P>
<P>
   For good or for bad, as Godsey goes, so goes Tech.
</P>
<P>
   Godsey is the second-youngest of five children in a family that
achieves. His oldest sister is a lawyer after attending Florida
State and Florida. His oldest brother played football at the Air
Force Academy and is a lawyer in Atlanta. His next sister is in
graduate school at Purdue. His youngest brother, Gary, is the
backup quarterback at Notre Dame. His mother is a teacher and his
father is an entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess you could say he's an entrepreneur,'' Godsey said
about his father, John, who played football at Alabama. The father
started in the restaurant business, went into liquor sales _ his
product was something called an Island Squeeze _ then tried the
clothing business, then owned a restaurant named the Game Day
Grill, with a television at every table. Now, he's selling
satellites.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's who George is. Kind of an entrepreneurial
quarterback. He's not a great runner, his arm isn't the strongest
on the team, and he doesn't have the greatest speed. He lives by
guile and cunning and understands Friedgen's complicated offense
better than anyone else. Maybe he comes by it naturally.
</P>
<P>
   The word on Godsey is he won't lose the game for you, but the
question is whether he can win it?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been getting ready for games, just like Joe did, for
three years,'' Godsey said. ``We took the same number of reps in
practice. It's normal for people to think that a quarterback is
going to make or break a team. But if an offensive lineman misses
an assignment, the play is done. If a receiver runs the wrong
route, the play's done.''
</P>
<P>
   Godsey won the starting job in the spring by the narrowest of
margins. All O'Leary would say was that Godsey earned the starting
job, but only for the first snap of fall practice. From there, it
was anybody's to take.
</P>
<P>
   But Godsey seized the moment over the summer. He worked at
losing weight, dropping from 219 to 207. He worked on his running
and can run two miles in 12 minutes. He ran the 6.2 mile Peachtree
Road Race, the first time he had run more than three miles, in 47
minutes. He lifted weights with his offensive line. He threw and
threw and threw to his receivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``George has distanced himself with the others big time,''
O'Leary pronounced about this quarterbacks after one week of fall
practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``This summer was big for me,'' Godsey said. ``If the team
developed a leader, it would be at that time. We all worked out
together. I started urging them on. I was telling people what route
to run. People started to look at me as somebody who knew what was
going on. The summer was a maturing process for me. And I really
started throwing the ball well.''
</P>
<P>
   Godsey says he's heard all the questions, the criticism of his
style, the open wondering if he's the right man for the job. ``It
doesn't hurt my feelings,'' he said. ``I don't take those things
like they're engraved in granite. I've seen worse things written
about other people. I'm fine with all that.''
</P>
<P>
   Friedgen has faith that Godsey can do the job. ``We haven't
changed a thing with our offense,'' Godsey said. ``It's very
similar to every year that I've been here. There's the same ratio
of pass to run. Are we going to run the option? Sure we are. Am I
going to roll out? Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   The quarterback says he's comfortable with his mates. ``This
team is closer,'' he said. ``Starting the season, things are going
to go wrong at times, but you won't see this team ducking its
head.''
</P>
<P>
   The Florida native agrees that he has inherited a team much
richer and deeper in talent than Hamilton did four years ago when
he began his run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got so many good athletes around me, I just want to get
them involved in the offense, let them do their thing,'' he said.
``I'm not going to go out and beat Virginia Tech by myself.''

 &HT;    Right end major question for hyped Texas' defense
 &HT;    By Olin Buchanan
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas -It's all a matter of weight and see.
</P>
<P>
   That's always been the case for Texas Longhorns defensive end
Jermain Anderson, but the meaning has changed somewhat this year.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike in Anderson's two previous football seasons, the main
question about his weight isn't how much it is, but whether he can
pull it as part of an improving defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a great opportunity,'' Anderson said after a recent
practice. ``I've had a great summer. I worked out really hard. I'm
happy, and I'm injury free.''
</P>
<P>
   He is not, however, free from the scrutiny and doubt of UT
followers that view right end with concern instead of confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Defense is expected to carry Texas _ at least in the early part
of the season _ and with good reason.
</P>
<P>
   Casey Hampton and Shaun Rogers might be the best set of tackles
in the nation. The linebackers are proven, the secondary is
experienced and left end Cory Redding has All-America potential.
</P>
<P>
   But right end is a bald tire on Texas' shining new Cadillac _
inspiring held breath and crossed fingers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pray about the ends,'' Texas free safety Greg Brown said.
``I know Cory had a lot of playing time last year and Jermain did a
phenomenal job his freshman year, but this is another season. I
hope they keep showing what they've been showing because we could
be a sight to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson showed enough as a freshman to grab a fair share of
attention.
</P>
<P>
   In 10 games he recorded 18 tackles _ four for losses _ and
recorded a sack, two quarterback pressures, an interception, three
deflected passes and a forced fumble. He had a sack and two tackles
for losses against No. 5 Kansas State.
</P>
<P>
   But how well he played was overshadowed by how little he
weighed.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson was listed as weighing less than 220 pounds, but he
said he often played at less than 210, which is almost emaciated
for a major college lineman.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson played in only five games last season and managed just
one tackle.
</P>
<P>
   Several factors contributed to that decline in productivity.
</P>
<P>
   He was constantly nagged by a wrist injury, personal problems
from his home in Texas City were a distraction and because of his
slight build, Cedric Woodard, more than 70 pounds heavier, was a
more attractive fit at end.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said he did everything he could to rectify those
situations.
</P>
<P>
   The wrist, he said, is fine. The problems at home are solved.
The weight?
</P>
<P>
   Well, Anderson is nowhere close to Woodard's 295 pounds, but he
was able to bulk up to 232 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gorged myself,'' Anderson said. ``I ate hamburgers, rolls,
drank a couple of protein shakes every day. I'd eat three times a
day. Back in high school I only ate once or twice a day and I was
playing basketball all the time. I cut down on the basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Anderson has been able to maintain his speed and
quickness, his greatest attributes, he still is small for a
defensive end and figures to have problems against powerful running
teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is when (opponents) use two tight ends and put one
on him and smash him,'' Texas defensive coordinator Carl Reese
said. ``You've got to see how he does against the run.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing Anderson has going for him in that respect is the
schedule, which is infested with pass-oriented opponents. Perhaps
stopping the run won't be that big of an issue after all.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll play teams that will spread out and throw the football
with three wides or four wide (receivers), so you're not having to
stop that run as much,'' Reese said. ``That helps. But to be really
good we have to find someone that can stop the run, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that responsibility won't fall on Anderson alone.
</P>
<P>
   Sophomores Cole Pittman and Adam McConathy, both boasting
considerably more bulk than Anderson, figure to be involved in a
rotation at right end. And like Woodard a year ago, a tackle could
shift outside against running teams. Or perhaps a newcomer like
freshman Kalen Thornton will make an impact.
</P>
<P>
   Those are all viable options, but if Anderson remains the
Longhorns' first option at defensive end, at least his teammates
have confidence in him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jermain will come out scratching and clawing to do whatever he
has to do,'' Redding said.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Everick Rawls, Anderson's teammate at Texas City High
School, is also optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``People talk about Jermain being a weak link because he's too
small,'' Rawls said. ``He has a big heart. I know he can do it
despite his size.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson is optimistic, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to go out and compete my best with whoever is in
front of me,'' he said. ``I'll give it everything I've got.''

DEMOCRATS FIND `WORKING FAMILIES' A PHRASE THAT CONNECTS WITH
VOTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The phrase is suddenly everywhere. In his
acceptance speech last Thursday, Vice President Al Gore mentioned
``working families'' nine times. Party officials told other
speakers to use the phrase, and they did, over and over. Now the
Gore campaign is printing up signs with it and repeating it time
and again on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the name of all the working families who are the strength
and soul of America, I accept your nomination for president of the
United States,'' Gore declared half-way through his 52-minute
speech in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about fighting for working families!'' said agriculture
secretary Daniel Glickman earlier in the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine how strong we're going to be when we help our working
families with affordable college educations and affordable health
care,'' said the housing secretary, Andrew Cuomo.
</P>
<P>
   While Democrats have been speaking to ``working families'' for
years, the Gore campaign has recently latched on to the theme as
way of appealing to women voters. But unlike the past two
elections, when suburban ``soccer moms'' were so eagerly courted,
the target of Gore's appeal is the ``waitress mom,'' the working
woman who not only juggles family and a job but also looks to the
government for help in meeting the needs of her family.
</P>
<P>
   So as his campaign has steamed through the populist heartland in
recent days, Gore has talked less about gun control and abortion
rights, topics more likely to appeal to the more affluent ``soccer
moms'' and more about bread-and-butter economic issues like adding
a benefit to Medicare to pay for prescription drugs and shoring up
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, the son of a populist Southern senator, used the ``working
families'' phrase in his 1988 campaign for president. And it became
popular among Democrats after the Republicans swept the Congress in
1994, and the party of the little guy needed to regroup its base.
</P>
<P>
   But as Gore formally launched his campaign more than a year ago,
he seemed more focused on busy, relatively upscale suburban parents
who were snagged in traffic jams and could say good night to their
children only by cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   Gore tried out the concept of ``working families'' late last
year with the slogan ``Change that works for working families.'' It
was noticeable for its double-barreled emphasis on work. But by
that time, the threat from former Sen. Bill Bradley was growing and
this theme did not reflect what Gore was saying on the campaign
trail. Besides, it was too clunky. The slogan, along with others
like ``practical idealism,'' vanished as quickly as it appeared, as
Gore slipped more naturally into combat mode with the phrase ``Stay
and Fight!''
</P>
<P>
   Then about two months ago, as Gore began drafting his speech for
the convention, the phrase ``working families'' re-emerged. It came
up in the normal course of the focus groups that most campaigns
conduct with likely voters, and advisers said it was tested with a
so-called ``people meter,'' an advertising device that measures
consumer reaction to products or, in this case, voter reaction to
political language, through a hand-held meter with dials.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not new words in the dictionary,'' a top Gore
strategist said. ``You hear things that the candidate says, you
expose people to it, there are some things that resonate more than
others, you get feedback from crowds and in the course of that, the
language of the campaign begins to take shape. There was no
epiphany on these two words, but there was a consensus developing
in recent weeks, not just on this term but that the whole program
was a powerful way of speaking to the needs and concerns of the
people who will decide this election.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind the phrase lies an entire political strategy. The phrase,
along with Gore's pronounced populist ferver, marks a broad,
thematic shift, intended to energize the party's base, which polls
had shown to be less enthusiastic in their support of Gore than the
Republican base was in supporting Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Brown, 34, a school teacher who attended the opening rally
for Gore's boat ride down the Mississippi in LaCrosse, Wis., said
she responded to the phrase because ``we know what he's talking
about.'' Brown attended the rally with her two-month-old daughter
and her 55-year-old mother, who has lung cancer, and said she
especially appreciated the Democrats' support of the Family and
Medical Leave Act. ``It lets you be at home with your family as
long as possible,'' she said, adding that she was leaning toward
Gore for this reason.
</P>
<P>
   A top Gore adviser said: ``Working women in general encompass
one of the largest elements of persuadable voters in this election.
One of the great accomplishments of our convention was to soften up
Bush's vote and expand our scope of opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   There was some evidence Monday that Gore's approach was having
some effect. Several polls showed Gore's standing among voters
improved after the convention, largely because of stronger support
from women. A CNN poll showed Gore beating Gov. George W. Bush, his
Republican rival, by 20 percent among them. It also showed Bush
beating Gore by 20 percent among men.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign believes that getting the ear of these women is a
crucial first step toward getting their vote, and that as Gore wins
over lower-income voters, he can advance up the economic ladder to
win higher-income voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are a large bloc of voters who are anxious to see who
will be their champion,'' said the Gore strategist. ``As the vice
president gains more standing with more voters, others will come _
like blue collar men _ and he'll have the capacity to talk to other
groups higher up in income scale, like the wired workers.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's tax cuts are aimed specifically at working families _ tax
credits for college tuition, day care, after-school programs,
long-term health care, retirement and investments. He is offering a
total of $500 billion in tax cuts and credits over 10 years, which
seems a lot for someone who has criticized Gov. George W. Bush's
proposed $1.3 trillion tax cut, but as Gore said Monday on the last
leg of his boat trip, his own tax cuts ``will go to the right
people.''
</P>
<P>
   A Gore adviser who helped coax the phrase ``working families''
from the focus-group stage to the candidate's lips explained its
purpose this way: ``It implies we're talking about the people who
really need government to be on their side, particularly the
federal government, where so many programs from retirement,
security and health emanate, and the federal government would be a
real partner in terms of education.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of getting help for education costs spoke directly to
Lou Cook, 48, a mother of three, who showed up at a rally Saturday
for Gore in Dubuque. She said that her local property taxes, which
pay for her public schools, were so high that she needed help.
``All of us who work for a living have to send our kids to school,
pay taxes and mortgages, and we know the only way our kids are
going to benefit themselves is through education,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Cook and her husband both have good jobs _ she licenses
day-care centers and is studying toward her master's degree in
therapy, while her husband is a lawyer _ she said she considered
herself working class, and that she liked the phrase ``working
families.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore advisers said they were not worried that the phrase sent a
subliminal message, as Bush has charged, that ``working families''
was code for class warfare. They said that this tact by the Bush
campaign could help Gore because it changes the conversation from
whether Bush is more likeable than Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Bush says `class warfare,' that's a sign he's moving to
our terrain,'' said one Gore aide. ``Bush wins if we talk on his
terrain about `affability,' but if we move the argument from
`Kumbaya' to `fighting for working families,' Gore wins.''

WASHINGTON MUTUAL BUYS BANK UNITED OF HOUSTON  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BILL VIRGIN  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Washington Mutual Inc., looking to make itself as much
a major player in Texas banking as it is in Washington and
California, said Monday it will buy a Houston-based company in a
$1.5 billion stock deal.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle-based Washington Mutual will acquire Bank United Corp.,
the largest publicly traded Texas-based financial institution.
</P>
<P>
   Texas was something of an incidental market Washington Mutual
picked up in its 1998 acquisition of H.F. Ahmanson &AMP; Co.; while the
real prize in the Ahmanson deal was its huge share of the market in
California, it also had 48 branches in Texas, primarily in Houston
and Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be successful, we needed substantially more,'' said Kerry
Killinger, Washington Mutual's chairman and chief executive
officer.
</P>
<P>
   Bank United will provide that, with 155 branches, including 66
in Houston, 77 in Dallas-Fort Worth and a handful in Midland,
Austin and San Antonio. Greater size means Washington Mutual's
marketing dollars will be more effective in driving business to its
branches; the combined banks would be third in deposit share in
Houston, fourth in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   After doing three huge deals, each of which about doubled the
company in size, Killinger had said Washington Mutual would take a
breather, doing less with acquisitions and more with internal
growth. One facet of that internal growth strategy is to roll out
dozens of branches, designed more like a retail store than a
traditional bank, at once. Washington Mutual is doing that in
Southern Nevada, and plans to do so in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Killinger said he considered whether to use the same approach in
Texas, but decided instead to make an acquisition and leverage that
with more branches. Bank United was attractive mainly because, with
the Texas landscape dominated by such out-of-state behemoths as
Chase Manhattan, Bank America, Wells Fargo and Bank One, it was
``the only franchise to buy there,'' said Jay Tejera, banking
analyst with Ragen MacKenzie Inc. in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Bank United, like Washington Mutual, also has built a consumer
banking presence with free checking accounts. ``We're in a sense
the Washington Mutual clone in Texas,'' said Bank United President
Barry Burkholder. Too, Bank United is the largest Small Business
Administration lender in Texas and fourth in the nation. Its
portfolio of business loans will help Washington Mutual in its
drive to reduce its balance-sheet dependence on residential
mortgages.
</P>
<P>
   Washington Mutual is also getting some geographic
diversification from California, into a growing state economy that
is far less oil-dependent than two decades ago. Burkholder said the
proof of that was that when oil prices slumped to nearly $10 a
barrel, ``there was virtually no blip on the landscape.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not dissimilar from the Seattle area diversifying out of
aerospace,'' Killinger added.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Washington Mutual has gotten so big, at $185.8 billion
in assets, Tejera said, that it can do a deal for Bank United
($18.2 billion in assets) that helps its position in a specific
market but isn't a bet-the-company proposition like the Ahmanson,
Great Western and American Savings deals. ``It's a comfortable hors
d'oeuvre-sized meal rather than an all-you-can eat buffet,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of the two companies seemed so obvious and was
considered such a ``wonderful fit, the real issue was whether
(Washington Mutual) was going to overpay for it,'' Tejera said. He
believes it didn't, with a purchase price of less than 1.7 times
Bank United's book value and just slightly over its current trading
price. Washington Mutual said the deal will immediately add to cash
earnings per share.
</P>
<P>
   Washington Mutual will pay 1.3 shares of its stock for every
Bank United share. Washington Mutual's stock closed at $32.06 a
share Monday, down 75 cents; Bank United's closed at $40.88, down
$1.50.
</P>
<P>
   Washington Mutual said it expects to cut up to 650 jobs in the
deal _ due to close late this year or early next _ but most Bank
United employees will be offered jobs.

 &HT;    Allergy sufferers can find solutions, but first make sure
pollution isn't the real problem
 &HT;    By Diane Lore
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - If the pollution doesn't get you, the ragweed will.
</P>
<P>
   While nicer plants, like your baskets of impatiens and ferns,
have all wilted away in the drought, ragweed continues to thrive.
And even worse, as heat and pollution get worse, it gets more
prolific.
</P>
<P>
   The plants thrive on carbon dioxide and, like other weeds, are
heartier than many plants that wilt in hot and dry conditions, said
Dr. Linda B. Ford, an Omaha allergist with the American Academy of
Allergy, Asthma &AMP; Immunology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ragweed is actually a more vigorous plant next to highways and
throughout urban areas,'' she said. And, because it's so happy in
its smoggy environment, it will produce more pollen _ and ``it
won't take as much to make you miserable.''
</P>
<P>
   But as smog alerts continue and the plants release their pollen,
it's hard to distinguish which one is making you miserable. Many of
the symptoms are the same, from itchy eyes to stuffy noses to sore
throats.
</P>
<P>
   However, how you treat the problem can make a big difference.
Trying to treat pollution symptoms with allergy medications _
especially some over-the-counter products _ could leave you, well,
sleepy.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, allergy specialists recommend you try to determine
exactly what you're suffering from. It's probably an allergy if you
have no fever, mucous secretions are clear and runny, sneezes occur
in rapid sequence and there's itchiness in the nose, ears and
throat _ especially the roof of the mouth.
</P>
<P>
   But if you've been experiencing problems like itchy eyes or
irritated lungs for the past month, the problem is probably
pollution. Ragweed season has only just begun, with the Atlanta
Allergy &AMP; Asthma Clinic starting its official pollen count Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Also, note the time of day you feel miserable: Ragweed is worse
in the morning and pollution is worse at night.
</P>
<P>
   If you believe the problem is pollution, then treat the symptoms
with eye drops and saline nasal spray. A decongestant might help.
But there is no clear solution, doctors point out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like being in a house with cigarette smoke,'' said Dr.
Kathleen Sheerin, an Atlanta allergist. ``You can take some steps
to alleviate the irritation but you just can't treat it like you
can with allergies.''
</P>
<P>
   If it is an allergy problem, there's a bevy of treatments that
patients can try.
</P>
<P>
   Mild symptoms can be treated with over-the-counter medications.
The most common are antihistamines and decongestants.
Antihistamines, which often contain chlorpheniramine, work by
blocking a substance produced by the body called histamine _ which
causes many of the allergy symptoms such as itching, sneezing and
runny nose. Decongestants, which often contain phenylpropanolamine
or phenylephrine and pseudophedrine, produce a narrowing of blood
vessels, which leads to the clearning of nasal congestion.
</P>
<P>
   However, be careful when you're using over-the-counter products
with children. Doctors report parents and teachers often complain
that such medications can wind kids up or make them moody or
groggy. In some cases prescription medicines _ such as Claritin,
Zyrtec and Allegra _ may be better alternatives. All come in pill
form for adults, but can also be administered to children in liquid
form. Zyrtec even tastes sweet.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, if you're truly sick of all these medications _ or
you can't tolerate the side effects _ doctors recommend patients
try allergy shots. If used consistently over three to five years,
they can permanently stop the allergies.

NEW TEAM OF U.N. ARMS INSPECTORS SETS SIGHTS ON IRAQ 
</HEADLINE>
  (Exclusive) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE and STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The United Nations has assembled a new team of arms inspectors
that is ready to enter Iraq within weeks, raising the prospect of
another confrontation with President Saddam Hussein over his
weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   The creation of the new inspection team comes more than two
years after Saddam halted cooperation with a previous group of
inspectors, provoking a diplomatic crisis that culminated in four
nights of American and British airstrikes in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has repeatedly said it will not cooperate with the new
weapons commission, which the Security Council ordered nine months
ago in the hope that it would resolve some objections that the
Iraqis, as well as the Russians and French, had about the previous
commission.
</P>
<P>
   One of the chief Iraqi complaints about the previous commission,
headed by Richard Butler, an Australian arms control expert, was
that there were too many inspectors from the United States and
Britain, who, the Iraqis asserted, were really spies.
</P>
<P>
   The new team, with members from 19 countries, is meant to be
more accountable to the U.N. secretary-general, Kofi Annan. All the
members work directly for the United Nations, not for their own
countries, as before.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Hans Blix, the leader of the new team, is to discuss
the need for access to Iraq with a panel of international weapons
experts who serve as the commission's directors. By Sept. 1 he is
expected to report to the Security Council that the inspectors are
ready to begin work and to tell them that _ barring a change in
Iraq's position _ the Iraqis have continued to reject new
inspections.
</P>
<P>
   But it remains far from clear what the United States or other
members of the Security Council will do if Iraq refuses to
cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear how forcefully the Security Council will push
the new inspections, especially since its 15 members are sharply
divided over Iraq and the economic sanctions imposed on it. The
position of each member is not likely to be clear until debates in
the council begin sometime in September.
</P>
<P>
   The broad economic sanctions were imposed after Iraq invaded
Kuwait in 1990. They are to remain in place until Iraq is certified
as free of prohibited weapons _ chemical, biological and nuclear
arms as well as long-range missiles. Last December, the Security
Council said it would suspend the sanctions if Iraq cooperated with
the new team of arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   If Saddam refuses, the council will have no alternative but to
keep the sanctions in place. It is unlikely the council would call
for the use of force, but in previous confrontations, the United
States and Britain have argued that existing resolutions authorize
military action.
</P>
<P>
   If a confrontation developed, it would focus new attention on
the Clinton administration's policy toward Iraq in the middle of
the presidential election. That policy has come under sharp attack
from Republicans and even some Democrats in Washington, who
complain that President Clinton has not acted forcefully enough to
force Saddam's government to accept the inspections.
</P>
<P>
   If Saddam refuses to cooperate, the administration will be under
political pressure to act forcefully. If the Iraqi leader reverses
course, Clinton's successor could be confronted with the
politically difficult decision of whether to go along with a
suspension of sanctions, which the Security Council has offered as
an incentive to the Iraqis if they demonstrate cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats and other officials at the United Nations said they
believe that during this year's election campaign, the Clinton
administration is not likely to press for strong action, even if
Iraq remains defiant.
</P>
<P>
   But a senior administration official said that the Iraqis or
anyone else would be foolish to assume that. Although the
administration has not indicated how it would answer new Iraqi
defiance, the official refused to rule out the possibility of an
``October surprise'' of American military action at the height of a
campaign, should the Iraqis provoke it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will be making a severe mistake if they think an election
campaign will affect how we carry out our foreign policy,'' the
official said.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, administration officials said they would insist
that Iraq comply with the resolution that created Blix's team or
face an indefinite extension of sanctions. ``It's a mandatory
resolution,'' Thomas R. Pickering, the undersecretary of state,
said in a telephone interview. ``If the Iraqis don't comply, the
sanctions will stay in place.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the resolution that created Blix's team, those sanctions
can be suspended six months after the Iraqis fulfill a list of
``key'' requirements set by the inspectors and, ultimately, be
lifted once the inspectors conclude that Iraq has come clean and
dismantled its prohibited weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   The previous commission had a more comprehensive standard for
declaring Iraq free of weapons before sanctions could be lifted,
offering no interim steps like a suspension for meeting some
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   The new inspection organization, officially known as the United
Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission, is led
by Blix, a Swedish arms control expert who previously served as
director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency in
Vienna, Austria.
</P>
<P>
   This month, Blix completed recruiting and training the 44 arms
inspectors from countries both friendly and not so friendly to the
Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
   Blix said his first step was to find out what happened to
several hundred sites inspected by the last commission in 1998 _
which could take at least several months.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis have said they believe the United States would never
agree to a suspension of sanctions but rather find another reason
to keep them in place, making cooperation, in their view,
fruitless.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials have long argued that resuming
inspections inside Iraq _ rather than resorting to force _ is the
most effective way to combat Saddam's efforts to hold on to
nuclear, chemical or biological weapons, as well as long-range
missiles that could deliver them.
</P>
<P>
   Within the Pentagon and the American intelligence agencies,
however, there is growing concern that Saddam has used the
prolonged absence of inspectors to continue those efforts. The CIA
sent a report to Congress this month warning that Iraq had already
rebuilt missile and chemical weapons factories since the airstrikes
in 1998.

   AUSTIN, Texas - In its quarterly financial report Monday,
Austin-based drkoop.com Inc. revealed details of secret
negotiations that could soon lead to its rescue, but also
acknowledged that it is the subject of an inquiry by the Securities
and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Drkoop.com's cash needs are well-known: the company has said
since April that it only has enough cash on hand to make it through
the summer and since then has raised only small sums meant to act
as bridges to permanent funding. But its legal woes, coupled with
its poor financial performance recently, may be also leading it to
negotiate a private placement of stock at fire-sale prices.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for drkoop.com declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC is investigating allegations of violations of federal
securities laws made in seven shareholder lawsuits filed against
the company this summer. The allegations relate to, among other
things, large sales of stock by company officers and directors in
February and March, shortly before a pessimistic auditors' report
sent shares plummeting.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC has requested information from drkoop.com about the
circumstances surrounding the allegations but said that the inquiry
``should not be construed as an indication by the SEC that any
violation of the federal securities laws has occurred,'' according
to the document. The company also said it is facing a legal claim
for $208,000 from the holder of one of its promissory notes.
</P>
<P>
   Since June, drkoop.com has been operating on a $1.5 million
bridge loan and a $3 million bridge line of credit from
Commonwealth Associates, the merchant bank that is helping the
company find permanent financing. On August 14, drkoop.com dipped
into that line of credit for $400,000, according to the document.
</P>
<P>
   ``Substantially all of the company's assets are pledged against
the notes,'' the filing stated.
</P>
<P>
   The company is seeking to raise as much as $27.5 million from a
private group of investors, offering new stock in drkoop.com priced
at 35 cents a share, a large discount over the current price.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in drkoop.com, which have never traded below 65 cents a
share, have risen sharply since late last week as rumors of a
buyout have resurfaced. They closed at $1.34 Monday, up 9 cents.
</P>
<P>
   If drkoop.com can raise the full amount it is seeking, the new
shareholders would own 78.6 million shares, or more than twice the
amount owned by current shareholders. In addition, the new
shareholders, the placement agent and Commonwealth Associates would
receive warrants to buy another 40.7 million shares at 35 cents a
share, diluting current shareholders' stake even further. These
investors would also receive a majority of seats on the board of
directors.
</P>
<P>
   ``As of the filing of this report, the transaction described
above is being negotiated but is not completed and we cannot assure
you that it will be completed,'' the filing stated.
</P>
<P>
   The company received a waiver from the Nasdaq stock market
allowing it to seek stockholder approval for the deal by mail
rather than in person, which it did. An updated notice is being
mailed to them, the filing stated.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, drkoop.com lost $40.6 million, or $1.18 a share,
during the three months that ended June 30, compared to a loss of
$24.8 million, or 80 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Second-quarter revenues fell to $2.5 million from $4.7 million
in the first quarter.

most important voice since  &UR; Bob Dylan &LR; .'' Boy George says John may
be using reverse psychology. ``Cool singers or bands hate being

 UNDATED: in 1998. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The issue of weapons inspections is only one area in which the
international standoff with Saddam appears headed for a new period
of confrontation, a decade after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait led to
the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Saddam has taken steps to ease his diplomatic
isolation, receiving a visit from President Hugo Chavez of
Venezuela. A thriving black market is reportedly eroding the
sanctions, while Russia, supported by China, is challenging the
American and British patrols of the ``no flight'' zones in northern
and southern Iraq, established to protect minority populations from
Saddam's government.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of these challenges, diplomats at the United Nations
and even some American officials say, the administration's policy
has been left to drift. The American ambassador to the United
Nations, Richard C. Holbrooke, has not involved himself in the
issue. Holbrooke says that he has been too busy on other matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt things are on autopilot,'' said one official
in Washington. ``And it might be an autopilot with a 10-degree
downward tilt.''
</P>
<P>
   Several diplomats, including some from nations on the Security
Council, said the administration had undermined its influence by
openly calling for the removal of Saddam from power. This has given
the Iraqis an excuse for dismissing the Security Council's pledge
to suspend sanctions if Saddam cooperates with new inspectors, the
diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   The administration may find itself even further isolated on the
Security Council, since three countries supportive of the United
States and Britain _ Argentina, Canada and the Netherlands _ will
be among the five countries relinquishing their rotating council
seats.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials say they have succeeded in containing
Iraq, enforcing the sanctions. They say they have also continued to
enforce the ``no flight'' zones, despite repeated Iraqi
provocations that have resulted in hundreds of limited airstrikes
since 1998.
</P>
<P>
   When American and British warplanes and missiles launched a much
larger attack 20 months ago, administration officials acknowledged
that the attack would make it difficult to resume weapons
inspections. But they argued that with Saddam refusing to
cooperate, there was no other way to prevent Iraq from acquiring
chemical or biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark my words,'' Clinton said of Saddam at the time, ``he will
develop weapons of mass destruction. He will deploy them, and he
will use them. Because we're acting today, it is less likely that
we will face these dangers in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen and others
also warned that the United States was prepared to use force again
if there was evidence that Iraq had resumed its chemical or
biological weapons programs _ or if Iraq threatened its neighbors
or attacked the Kurds in the north.
</P>
<P>
   James M. Bodner, the principal deputy undersecretary of defense
for policy and a longtime aide to Cohen, said in an interview that
the United States remained ready to respond if Iraq crossed any of
those ``red lines.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said they had no concrete evidence that
Iraq has restarted its weapons programs. But in addition to
repairing the damage done in 1998, Iraq has resumed testing its
shorter-range missiles. Officials fear that those tests, while not
explicitly prohibited under the U.N. resolutions, have allowed Iraq
to perfect longer-range missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that, the administration's warnings about Iraq's weapons
have lost much of their urgency. In the fall of 1997, Cohen held up
a bag of sugar on television and ominously warned that an
equivalent amount of the biological agent anthrax, which Iraq is
believed to possess, would destroy half the population of
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, administration officials have made no such
dire warnings, even though there have been no effective inspections
in two years. At the same time, Americans have done little publicly
to press Blix to accelerate the formation of his inspection team,
which has proceeded slowly.
</P>
<P>
   ``At no time have we been dragging our feet,'' Blix said in an
interview last Wednesday, adding that he had met all of the
Security Council's deadlines. ``We are working at full speed on a
lot of issues here.''
</P>
<P>
   Blix began interviewing weapons experts in May, and those
selected have completed a four-week training program. While Iraq
has vowed not to recognize the commission, Blix said there were
signs that Iraq was thinking over its next moves.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis recently presented a legalistic analysis of the new
inspection plan to governments of Islamic nations meeting in Kuala
Lumpur. The eight-page memorandum asks many, often accusatory,
questions, suggesting that the Iraqis still nurture hopes that the
resolution creating the inspection commission could be rewritten.
</P>
<P>
   Some diplomats say that Iraq may have calculated that it could
bide its time, hoping for a better deal in the future. Russia has
already called for changes in the resolution, but U.N. and American
officials have adamantly ruled out the possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Others say Saddam will stop short of any actions that would
invite American retaliation, while trying to build support for an
unconditional lifting of the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, he thinks things are going his way,'' an American
defense official said. ``He's outlasted the Clinton administration.
He outlasted the Bush administration. I think his perception is he
can outlast them all.''

NEWS ANALYSIS: LABOR DEAL'S IMPACT ON CUSTOMERS AND COMPANY
</HEADLINE>
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If a phone circuit goes dead and no one is on the line, does it
really stop carrying sound?
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, a similar question could be asked about the
effective end to the strike against Verizon Communications. While
the strike is important for Verizon, the walkout and Sunday's
agreement with two-thirds of the union membership on strike
probably will not have much bearing on the rest of the
telecommunications industry. Even for consumers, the strike's
effect can fairly be described only as minimal.
</P>
<P>
   As for Verizon itself, the company will continue to be penalized
to the tune of billions of dollars of market value for the strength
of its unions.
</P>
<P>
   When autoworkers go on strike, cars stop rolling off assembly
lines. When pilots go on strike, planes stop flying. But when phone
workers go on strike, life pretty much goes on.
</P>
<P>
   That is because modern networks are largely automated. Vandals,
like the two striking workers who were nearly electrocuted on Long
Island last week as they tried to slice a phone line, cut service
to a few thousand customers here and there. But in a backhanded
testament to the power of the machines, those figures paled beside
the hundreds of thousands of Verizon customers who lost
long-distance phone service last week when an obscure piece of
equipment failed in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   By Sunday, Verizon had a backlog of about 92,000 outstanding
requests for repairs. That figure was perhaps twice normal,
implying that about 46,000 of Verizon's 25 million customers in the
strike region were suffering problems that they would not have
otherwise had.
</P>
<P>
   That works out to fewer than two out of every 1,000 customers.
Of course, for each of those customers one problem was one far too
many, and those figures do not include the thousands of people who
were stymied in attempts to sign up for or change phone service.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon's success in serving almost all of its customers during
the strike does not mean that people are unimportant in modern
communications. Without the thousands of managers who filled in for
the strikers, the extent of the service failures would have been
far greater. A network as extensive as Verizon's requires extensive
maintenance, and that requires many people.
</P>
<P>
   Largely, however, lower-level employees are needed at a company
like Verizon because customers want to talk to people. Most
customers do not want to sign up for new phone service online.
Customers with billing questions want a live person on the line
right now, not an e-mail response tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   During the strike, Verizon's directory assistance has been
largely disabled because people meant to answer calls were on
picket lines. If voice-recognition software is ever ready for prime
time, Verizon will surely prefer to lay off thousands of operators.
But while Verizon's unions would certainly block such a move,
consumers would probably complain as well. As it has been, during
the strike many consumers have borne the inconvenience of using a
phone book, the mark of an old economy if ever there were one.
</P>
<P>
   In the big scheme of things, the effect on consumers of the
strike and its partial settlement was and will be quite small.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the unions have appeared to win almost everything
they asked for, much the same could be said of the deal's effect on
the rest of the communications industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think it means much for the rest of the industry,''
said Eric W. Rabe, a Verizon spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, while the wrangling over the unionization of
Verizon's wireless unit was viewed as a referendum on unions' power
in newer industries, the deal that was reached in the end was not
all that different from those already in place at some other major
wireless operators.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of wireless, it seems as though what they're talking
about in terms of union organizing might be similar to AT&AMP;T,'' said
Burke Stinson, an AT&AMP;T spokesman. Rabe of Verizon even ventured
that his company had made a better wireless deal than has SBC
Communications Inc., the No. 2 local phone company.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wireless deal that we made, from the union point of view,
is more restrictive than the deal SBC already had in place,'' Rabe
said.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot is that the expedited organizing process that Verizon
agreed to covers only about a quarter of the wireless unit's
employees.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the main reason that the Verizon deal is not a
harbinger for the rest of the industry is that Verizon's unions are
stronger, and might just be a lot stronger, than those at any other
phone company in the nation, largely because of Verizon's
Northeastern geography.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that Verizon has the toughest unions, so it's very
difficult to extrapolate from what happens here to the rest of the
industry, because Verizon is in a pretty unique position,'' said
Eric Strumingher, a telecommunications analyst at PaineWebber.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives for BellSouth, Qwest, SBC, Sprint and WorldCom
declined to comment on the settlement Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the reticence is that the other companies have
nothing to gain by sticking their nose into what would be
considered a debacle for most of them. The fact is that under
Sunday's deal, with its limits on overtime and its limits on job
movements, Verizon ultimately has less control over its own
business than does just about any other big communications carrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing is the pace at which they can adapt
to change in the industry and innovate and capitalize on the new
growth opportunities,'' Strumingher said. ``If the Bells didn't
have unions, it's worth a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as the strike was starting this month, Verizon announced
new projections for its future revenue and earnings growth. Rabe
said the strike and the new deal would not alter those projections.
</P>
<P>
   But unionization nonetheless carries a big price tag on Wall
Street.
</P>
<P>
   The price of a stock is often calculated in terms of a multiple
of the company's expected per-share earnings. For instance,
Verizon's shares closed at about $42.81 Monday, up about 69 cents,
meaning that they are worth 14.63 times the company's expected
per-share earnings of about $2.93 this year.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Strumingher said that unionization is probably
costing all of the Bell companies ``at least five'' multiple
points. If Verizon's stock were trading at an earnings multiple of
19.63 rather than 14.63, each share would in fact be worth $57.44.
Overall, Verizon would have a market value of about $156 billion
rather than the $116 billion it currently enjoys.
</P>
<P>
   All else being equal, Verizon's earnings multiple probably
suffers by ``a couple of points'' relative even to SBC or the
BellSouth Corp., said Strumingher, because of the strength of
Verizon's unions and the presumed reduction in productivity they
cause. Just two points of earnings multiple costs Verizon about $16
billion in market value.
</P>
<P>
   None of this will come as a surprise to Verizon's senior
management. They know it all too well. Now, there is nothing they
can do about it.

LYNN A. TOWNSEND, RETIRED CHAIRMAN OF CHYRSLER CORP. DIES AT 81 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mich.)   By MELODY PETERSEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lynn A. Townsend, a retired chairman and chief executive of the
Chrysler Corp., died Thursday at Botsford Continuing Health Center
in Farmington Hills, Mich. The cause of death was not disclosed. He
was 81.
</P>
<P>
   When Townsend retired in 1975, Chrysler was heavily in debt and
incurring large losses as inflation and oil prices soared. Four
years later, with the company on the brink of bankruptcy, Lee A.
Iacocca took over.
</P>
<P>
   Townsend, an accountant, joined Chrysler as controller in 1957.
After becoming Chrysler's president in 1961, Townsend was credited
with strengthening the ailing company by decreasing its overhead
expenses, improving its cars and revamping its dealer system. One
of his first moves was to lay off thousands of white-collar workers
from Chrysler's overloaded payroll _ a move that prompted some
employees to nickname him ``the Brute.''
</P>
<P>
   Townsend's early plan worked. Each year brought improved
financial results. By 1968, Chrysler, which is now part of
DaimlerChrysler AG, had almost doubled its share of the domestic
auto market.
</P>
<P>
   But problems began again in 1969 when profits fell. Many
observers attributed the decline to bad management decisions. They
said that the tight operational controls that had made the company
successful in the early 1960s had been relaxed with disastrous
results.
</P>
<P>
   Among the four largest American automakers, Chrysler appeared
hardest hit by a recession in the 1970s. In 1974, the year before
he retired, Townsend miscalculated the size of the auto market.
Sales of new cars plunged and Chrysler was left with thousands of
new cars and little cash to pay its bills. To get through, the
company cut car prices and closed most of its plants for a month.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1975, at Chrysler's annual meeting, investors and
laid-off employees pummeled Townsend with questions and some asked
him to resign.
</P>
<P>
   He did so unexpectedly three months later at the age of 56,
saying that he believed that the interests of the company would
best be served by ``an early and orderly transition of leadership
to our younger executives.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had reached his decision to retire on his own and
that no one had pressured him to leave. He said that he had made up
his mind years earlier that he would not serve until he was 65
because that would mean he would have dominated the company for a
quarter of a century and ``the impact of one man'' would have been
too great.
</P>
<P>
   Townsend graduated from the University of Michigan in 1941 with
a master's degree in business administration. Before he joined
Chrysler, he worked as an accountant at Touche, Ross, Bailey &AMP;
Smart, where he audited the books of the firm's major client,
Chrysler.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, Townsend served as disbursing officer on
the aircraft carrier Hornet in the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Ruth; three sons, James, Charles and
Richard; and eight grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Townsend made it a point to be home at 6:30 each night and
rarely worked overtime. He told his children he had 180,000 people
working for him so the job should get done. &QL;

BUSH WOULD SEEK $1 BILLION PAY RAISE FOR MILITARY  

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ Lamenting that the next president ``will inherit a
military in decline,'' Texas Gov. George W. Bush said Monday he
will seek a $1 billion pay raise for the Armed Forces and boost
funding for school districts that serve military bases _ with $60
million going to four Texas communities.
</P>
<P>
   In an address to the 7,000 delegates at the national convention
of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, Bush said his ``urgent goal'' as
president will be to ``rebuild the military power of the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   He portrayed the Armed Forces as short on readiness and long on
problems, including low morale, deployment fatigue, inadequate
housing and health care and paltry pay.
</P>
<P>
   His proposal would bolster the $75 billion military pay increase
signed into law by President Clinton last month. It would amount to
a $750 annual pay hike per service member. But inadequate pay isn't
the only issue, Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current administration inherited a military ready for the
dangers and challenges facing our nation. The next president will
inherit a military in decline,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the best intentions of those in uniform, Bush said the
military is ``undermined by back-to-back deployments, poor pay,
shortages of spare parts and equipment and rapidly declining
readiness. Our investment in national security is at the lowest it
has been since Pearl Harbor,'' he said to a crowd that included
people who survived that attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall commitments around the world have tripled while our
forces have been reduced by nearly 40 percent,'' he said. Since
Clinton took office in 1992, ``full readiness'' among Air Force
combat units has declined from 85 percent to 65 percent, Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were reminded of readiness problems last May, when the USS
Decatur was forced to return to port a month earlier than planned
for lack of funds. Think of it: a guided missile destroyer of the
U.S. Navy turning back because there was not enough money for
fuel,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Pacific fleet, training exercises have been cut back for
the same reason and in the Atlantic fleet, 21 warships need
maintenance that has been delayed or canceled, Bush said. But other
service branches have woes, too, he said. In addition to old
equipment, both the Army and Air Force have had trouble meeting
recruiting goals, Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care what's said in the political campaign. These are
signs of a military in decline and we must do something about it,''
Bush stated.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Douglas Hattaway responded that the
administration signed a 4.8 percent military pay raise last year,
and that Gore supports a 3.7 percent increase this year.
</P>
<P>
   He said Bush's proposed tax cuts would use up too much of the
federal budget surplus to allow for increased military pay or
readiness.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Chris Lehane noted Gore's service in Vietnam _ an
unstated comparison with Bush's Vietnam-era service in the Texas
Air National Guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore volunteered, served and enlisted in Vietnam,'' he
said. ``He has a real understanding based on his own personal
experiences of what type of support our military personnel need and
desire.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore is scheduled to address the VFW convention Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In his comments to the veterans Monday, Bush said the neglect of
the military extends to the schools that serve 700,000 students who
are dependents of soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines.
</P>
<P>
   ``After years of under-funding, many of these schools are run
down and in need of repair. I will ask Congress for $310 million
needed to repair and construct schools that will educate the
children of the men and women who wear our nation's uniforms,''
Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   At the urging of the National Military Impacted Schools
Association, Bush offered the $310 million to 20 of the neediest
districts so they can upgrade their campuses. Bush's plan would
provide Killeen ISD, which serves Fort Hood, with $17.8 million and
three districts that serve bases in San Antonio _ Lackland,
Randolph and Fort Sam Houston _ with a total of $51 million.
</P>
<P>
   After unveiling his military proposals to the VFW, Bush
journeyed to Des Moines, Iowa to visit a public school and raise
funds at an Iowa GOP-sponsored event. Tuesday he campaigns in
Peoria, Ill., and St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am thrilled that the governor has proposed this. It's
something we've been asking for for years. We could definitely use
the help,'' said Killeen Superintendent Charles Patterson, whose
district maintains eight campuses on Fort Hood in Central Texas.
Two are in dire need of improvements, he said, including a
1975-vintage middle school with 20 portable classrooms and a
1950-era elementary school.
</P>
<P>
   Superintendent John Deegan of Bellevue, Neb., who heads the
association for military-impacted schools, also hailed the proposal
and chastized President Clinton for not seeking such funds earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very pleased. President Clinton as commander in chief
has shocked people by not fully funding the impact aid,'' Deegan
said, adding that Congress hasn't bolstered impact-aid programs
that originated in the 1950s and 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's scrambling right now because the buildings are
40-50 years old,'' said Deegan, whose district serves Offutt Air
Force Base. Money used for facilities is usually drained away from
education programs, he added.

<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ Gov. George W. Bush sharply attacked the
Clinton administration's military policies Monday, saying that the
country's armed forces had plummeted to a state of serious physical
and emotional disrepair and that he was committed to reversing the
decline.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to thousands of people at a convention of the Veterans
of Foreign Wars in Milwaukee, a city he visited early in the day
before traveling to Des Moines, Bush said today's servicemen and
women were confronting ``back-to-back deployments, poor pay,
shortages of spare parts and equipment and rapidly declining
readiness.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor said there were too many ``soldiers who are
on food stamps and soldiers who are poorly housed.'' Ticking off a
list of what he characterized as other troubling indicators, Bush
added that there were recruitment shortfalls in various branches of
the military, units that were measurably not ready for combat and
severe morale problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The facts are stark and the facts are real,'' Bush said. ``The
current administration inherited a military ready for the dangers
and challenges facing our nation. The next president will inherit a
military in decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still without equal in the world. But it is not without
serious problems that must be addressed immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush restated proposals he had made to increase military
spending, including his call for a raise for people in the armed
forces that would add $1 billion in annual salary to the increase
already authorized by Congress and signed into law last year.
</P>
<P>
   And he unveiled a new plan for the federal government to spend a
one-time amount of $310 million for the construction and repair of
public schools that serve roughly 570,000 children of service
people and are financed through the federal department of
education.
</P>
<P>
   That proposal fit into Bush's overall effort in this
postconvention period of focusing on education _ his bridge to
independent and swing voters _ in states that either lean slightly
Democratic or have voted Democratic in the last two or three
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin and Iowa have not voted Republican in a presidential
election since 1984, when Ronald Reagan was re-elected. But a few
polls taken before the party conventions suggested that Bush had a
chance of victory in both states.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Hughes, the Bush campaign's director of communications,
said that Bush and his running mate, Dick Cheney, would travel to
19 states from Friday to Aug. 31. All but four of those voted
Democratic in the last two presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   In Des Moines, Bush went to what Hughes reminded reporters was
the 93rd school that he had visited so far over the 14-month course
of his presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working our way toward 100,'' she said, ``to highlight
the importance Governor Bush places on educating our children.''
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Hattaway, a spokesman for the Gore campaign, disputed
Bush's portrayal of the U.S. military as inadequately prepared.
Even so, he said, Vice President Al Gore had also called for
additional spending on the military, including further raises.
</P>
<P>
   Hattaway also questioned how Bush could afford more money for
the armed forces in light of his proposed $1.3 trillion tax cut
over the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He won't be able to pay for the promises he's making,''
Hattaway said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the military cutbacks that Bush criticized Monday began
in the administration of his father, President George Bush,
although the former president was in part reacting to diminished
needs after the end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor, who spent the years during the Vietnam War
stationed in Houston with the Texas Air National Guard, made a
point in his remarks to the veterans to allude to his father's
military service overseas during World War II and to invoke
Cheney's credentials as the defense secretary during his father's
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Bush called Cheney, who was not on the campaign trail with him,
``one of the greatest secretaries of defense this nation has ever
known.''
</P>
<P>
   He also told the veterans that if he is elected president, he
will make it a priority to ensure that veterans get the benefits
they were promised without the bureaucratic delays that he said
were too prevalent today. To that end, he said he would create what
he called a ``veterans health care task force.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In my administration,'' Bush said, ``the Department of
Veterans Affairs will act as an advocate for veterans seeking
benefits and claims, not act as an adversary.''

MICHAEL MAGGIO, DIRECTOR   WHO SHAPED CHICAGO THEATER, DIES AT 49 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ill., Minn.)   By BRUCE WEBER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Michael Maggio, a theater director known for his appetite for a
wide range of works _ from Shakespeare and Samuel Beckett to Tom
Stoppard and Stephen Sondheim _ but perhaps as much for his own
personal drama, died on Saturday in Chicago, where he was born and
lived most of his life. He was 49.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Rachel Kraft, said the cause was complications from
lymphoma, which he developed as a result of extensive drug
treatments following a successful double lung transplant in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   An active and popular figure in the fertile Chicago theater
community, Maggio had been associate artistic director of the
Goodman Theater, the city's largest nonprofit theater, since 1987,
and was recently appointed dean of the theater school at DePaul
University, where he had been a professor since 1996. But long
before that, he directed shows for a number of Chicago companies,
becoming a leading contributor to a rising local theater scene that
over the past quarter-century has made Chicago a rival to New York.
</P>
<P>
   Equally at home with classics and with new plays, with dramas as
well as with comedies and musicals, he directed productions that
included Stoppard's ``Travesties'' and ``Arcadia''; Beckett's
``Endgame'' and ``Waiting for Godot''; Sondheim's ``Sunday in the
Park with George'' and ``A Little Night Music''; and ``Romeo and
Juliet.'' That production, set in Chicago's Little Italy at the
turn of the 20th century, led Joseph Papp to ask him to direct
``Titus Andronicus'' for the New York Shakespeare Festival in
Central Park in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   His last work was a new play at the Goodman, ``Boy Meets Girl,''
by Rebecca Gilman, which he was expected to restage at the
Manhattan Theater Club next season.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps his most striking work was on ``Wings,'' a musical by
Jeffrey Lunden and Arthur Perlman, based on Arthur Kopit's play of
the same title. The show, about a woman aviator who is debilitated
by a stroke, was his first after his lung surgery and was
transferred successfully from the Goodman to the Joseph Papp Public
Theater in New York in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The critic David Richards wrote in The New York Times that
Maggio understood the central character ``intuitively, having
journeyed over similar landscapes and conquered many of the same
paralyzing fears.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This accounts for the scrupulous honesty of the evening,'' he
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Maggio was an exception to the F. Scott Fitzgerald dictum about
second acts in American life. Born with cystic fibrosis, a genetic
disease that progressively clogs the lungs with mucus, Maggio was
by his mid-30s a wan, concave-chested man who weighed perhaps 100
pounds and took an oxygen tent to the theater with him when he had
the strength to work at all. According to his doctor, he was six
months from death when, in a 13-hour operation, he received the
lungs of a teen-ager killed in an auto accident.
</P>
<P>
   Miraculously provided with a vigor he had never had, he was
robust within months, with the bounce of a soccer player. But it
was rejuvenation with a price: the knowledge that his body might
someday wither from the effort of maintaining the new organs. In
the intervening years, he often spoke of this astonishing chapter
of his life as a bonus.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, he is survived by his parents, Carlo
and Genevieve; a sister, Dona Will, of White Bear, Minn.; and a
son, Ben, from a previous marriage. &QL;

FOR GORE, LIFE ON THE MISSISSIPPI IS FULL OF DETAILS

<TEXT>
<P>
   HANNIBAL, Mo. _ For Vice President Al Gore these days, there is
no devil in the details.
</P>
<P>
   As he finished his four-day riverboat tour of the Mississippi
River with a floating seminar on tax policy _ a significant
departure from the crap games that once prevailed on these waters _
Gore tried to convey once again that his political message is built
on a foundation of substance.
</P>
<P>
   On his postconvention trip down the Mississippi, which began on
Friday morning and ended here Monday in Mark Twain's boyhood home,
Gore has underscored the theme of his policy-laden convention
acceptance speech by portraying himself as the candidate of
specifics.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than simply riding the tides of postconvention momentum,
he has held a nautical forum on health insurance and given speeches
on dry land about the environment and managed care. In remarks to
his newly enthused crowds, he races through a laundry list of
policy positions, then plants his tongue in his cheek and asks
whether he is providing too much detail, whether he is being too
specific.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Gore likes to be very specific about how specific he is
being. ``If you don't want specifics,'' he told the crowd at a
riverside rally here tonight, ``now is the time to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   At a rally earlier Monday in Quincy, Ill., Gore critiqued Gov.
George W. Bush's proposal to allow a portion of Social Security
payroll taxes to be invested in the private markets, and then
asked, ``Where are the specifics? Where does the money come from?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll give you the specifics before the election because I'm
not afraid for you to know the facts of what Joe Lieberman and I
are proposing,'' he said. Doing so, he said, is ``a way to respect
and honor our democracy.'' Then he asked: ``Do you want specifics
in this election?'' And the crowd, as always, yelled that it did.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's obsession with specifics, and his nonstop promotion of
his obsession, serves a dual purpose. At one level, he is trying to
draw substantive distinctions between his policy proposals and
those of his Republican opponent. From health care and education to
Social Security and tax cuts, Gore argues that his positions will
do more than Bush's to improve the lives of middle-class Americans,
who control the swing vote in this election.
</P>
<P>
   But at a somewhat more subliminal level, Gore aides make clear,
the vice president's focus is intended to reinforce questions about
Bush's intellectual heft. And so even as Gore technically sticks to
his pledge not to wage personal attacks against Bush, he is able to
use policy to plant doubts not only about his opponent's positions
but about his depth and acuity as well.
</P>
<P>
   It is terrain where Gore clearly feels he holds an advantage,
and it reflects his campaign's effort to turn a perceived liability
_ the candidate's wonkishness _ into an asset.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than make apologies for giving people specifics, Gore
is being proud of it,'' said Greg Simon, a senior adviser to Gore.
``The other side is trying to win on charm, but charm doesn't help
you with prescription drugs or putting your kids through school.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore voiced a similar theme aboard the riverboat, the Mark
Twain, as he conducted a discussion Monday morning on tax cuts with
several area residents who had been brought aboard as props.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the forum consisted of an arithmetic lesson that
compared Bush's call for a deep reduction in income tax rates with
Gore's own proposals for tax cuts aimed at those struggling to
afford college tuition, long-term care and child care.
</P>
<P>
   But before delving into policy, Gore said, ``I don't go for the
old approach that says just give sound bites and public relations
and images and that kind of thing and keep the facts hidden until
after the election. I think the specifics are important.'' His
comments came on a day when Gore rose early to conduct five brief
network television interviews, and when he used the picturesque
deck of the Mark Twain as a backdrop for a number of interviews
with local television reporters.
</P>
<P>
   In his defense, Gore can be self-deprecating about his tactics.
In an impromptu news conference aboard the riverboat Monday, he
said he sensed from the enthusiasm of his crowds that his devotion
to detail was paying off ``because people appreciate the effort to
lift the tone of the campaign to substance and not just sound
bites.'' Then he added with a laugh, ``Although that in itself is a
sound bite.''
</P>
<P>
   The strategy is also driving Gore's public comments about
proposed debates with Bush, who has said he would debate the vice
president three times but has not said when or where.
</P>
<P>
   In the news conference Monday, Gore accused Bush of
``procrastinating,'' and said that ``the American people have a
right in this day and time to be respected with an adult,
intelligent discussion of what the major issues are in a
give-and-take without the slick image-makers intervening.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's use of the phrase ``adult, intelligent discussion'' may
or may not have been arbitrary. But his aides have been more
explicit.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are beginning to ask the question more and more,'' said
Chris Lehane, Gore's press secretary. ``Does George W. Bush have
what it takes to be president?''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, that is the message that Gore's crowds take
from his speeches. ``The key point when you're specific is that
you're accountable,'' said Robert Merrick, a 49-year-old physician
who attended Monday's rally in Quincy. As for Bush, Merrick said,
``He certainly hasn't presented anything that would make you think
he has the ability to do the job.''
</P>
<P>
   But at other moments on this trip, there have been doubts about
exactly how much detail the public really craves. As the riverboat
paused in a lock in Wisconsin on Friday, Gore stood on the top deck
and exchanged small talk with several people on shore. ``Anybody
have any questions on any of the issues?'' he asked. Nobody did.

FOR THE OTHER ONES, ANOTHER CHAPTER 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOEL SELVIN  
 c.2000, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NOVATO, Calif. &LR;   &LR; _ Mickey Hart was plucking an electric kalimba,
a handheld African thumb piano, while wandering across a room
littered with cables and sound equipment. The plink-plunk of the
little instrument surfed a mighty wave of sound from the rest of
the Other Ones, who were rehearsing for the band's tour in the
cavernous soundstage at the headquarters for what remains of the
Grateful Dead.
</P>
<P>
   As the rest of the band played on, Hart put down the kalimba and
climbed behind the second set of drums next to the man he played
beside for almost 30 years, Bill Kreutzmann. As Hart slammed his
sticks into the giant drum set, familiar thunder crackled and
exploded. The two sounded for all the world like the Grateful Dead.
</P>
<P>
   The Other Ones is the living Dead. With its second tour starting
Wednesday, this seven-man band built around three surviving members
of the Grateful Dead spent last week working in two new members _
one entirely new and one only sort of new _ and refreshing
everybody's recollection of a repertoire untouched since the end of
the band's first tour in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Kreutzmann has not played with the other members of the Dead
since the death of guitarist Jerry Garcia five years ago. His
return to the fold comes amid a fractious split in the band's
ranks. Bassist Phil Lesh took the other Other Ones' drummer, John
Molo, and went on the road this summer as Phil Lesh and Friends.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent cause of the rift was the band's proposed plans to
put the Dead's vault of live recordings on the Internet, but the
differences seem to run deeper. Both Hart and guitarist Bob Weir
strongly implied that Lesh's split followed a failed bid to take
over the leadership of the famously rudderless ship that is the
Grateful Dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't just summarily dismiss your old friends, all of
them,'' said Weir, sounding a conciliatory note. ``He's going to be
doing some rethinking.''
</P>
<P>
   After not touring last summer, while the band reportedly waited
for Lesh to decide whether he wanted to tour after his liver
transplant, the Other Ones will tour without Lesh, but with
Kreutzmann. Playing bass is Alphonso Johnson, a highly regarded
hired gun who has worked for Weather Report and Santana.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the musicians were working hard to learn a daunting
list of 59 songs. Three blackboards covered with lists of songs
stared back at the band as the musicians raced through a briskly
disciplined rehearsal, already a stark contrast to the Dead. There
were long periods when the Grateful Dead didn't rehearse at all.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia's position was too much of a hot seat for any one
guitarist, although that, too, was apparently a point of dispute
with Lesh. Returning are the two players from the 1998 Other Ones
tour, Steve Kimmock and Mark Karan. Kimmock is well known to
Deadheads as a Garcia disciple who used to lead the band Zero.
Karan, not so well known, was a journeyman in the Marin County
music scene for years before moving to Los Angeles, where he was
living when he landed the job with the Other Ones.
</P>
<P>
   Kimmock can evoke Garcia flawlessly, squeezing off his skipping,
spinning, silvery lines. He also played briefly on the Phil Lesh
and Friends tour this year, but left midway (``I don't want to work
on Maggie's farm,'' he said at the time). Karan has been playing in
Weir's sideline band, Ratdog, for two years and worked in Hart's
solo band for a while.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, they are still outsiders. They have studied tapes
of the band and know the Dead's music as fans and students. ``This
is a startlingly original idea I stole from you,'' Kimmock said to
Weir at rehearsal.
</P>
<P>
   The Other Ones' pianist, Bruce Hornsby, is another fan who
joined the band. Hornsby toured as a temporary member of the Dead
for almost two years after keyboardist Brent Mydland died in 1990,
while the band looked for a permanent replacement. Hornsby has
pursued a highly successful, adventurous career as an artist
himself, both before and after his stint with the Dead. But he is
no longer ``the new guy'' _ a position poor Mydland held for more
than 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Other Ones is a strange combination of new and semi-new
pieces grafted on to the remaining parts of the Grateful Dead.
Weir, Hart and Kreutzmann made music together for more than 30
years, but this band has performed only a few times.
</P>
<P>
   Bassist Johnson and Kreutzmann, new to the lineup for this tour,
actually showed up a couple of days early to practice together.
Kreutzmann needed to learn a few new songs that Weir and Hart
brought to the repertoire.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fresh,'' said the drummer, who retreated to the north
shore of Kauai shortly after Garcia died. ``It's basically a new
band, but I have the benefit of knowing the songs.''
</P>
<P>
   With Hart and Kreutzmann back together, this unruly mess forming
itself into a rock band sounds like the Grateful Dead in ways it
couldn't any other way. With Kreutzmann keeping a tidy rhythm
figure going, Hart decorates the beat. They are brothers in rhythm.
While Kimmock lays the Garcia-brand solos on top, the two other
guitarists drive the interior sound with punchy contrapuntal
accents. It is a deep, resonant and satisfying evocation of the
Grateful Dead, not so much a re-creation as a calling forth of the
spirit.
</P>
<P>
   But with Hornsby finally joining for full band rehearsals only
three days earlier, and the week's schedule cut short by Hart's
departure to appear at the Democratic National Convention with his
pal Al Gore, there was a lot of work to be done in a short time at
rehearsal. And the debate over how much rehearsal is actually good
for a band that depends on improvisation is always a topic of
conversation with the Dead.
</P>
<P>
   Hornsby overheard Hart saying he didn't care about fine-tuning
the songs, a typical Grateful Dead attitude. ``No,'' Hornsby
interjected, ``we want to get them as tight as possible and take
off from there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't want all those guitar players tripping over each
other,'' said Hart.
</P>
<P>
   ``101 Strings,'' said Hornsby, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   ``My worst nightmare,'' said Hart. ``At least there's no
saxophone.''

BARAK SEEKS TO LIMIT USE OF RELIGIOUS PRIVILEGES IN ISRAEL 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN F. BURNS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Surprising even some of his closest political
associates and enraging his ultra-Orthodox opponents, Prime
Minister Ehud Barak informed his supporters during the weekend that
he planned to push a ``civil reform'' through parliament that,
among other things, would strip the Jewish religious establishment
of many privileges and powers.
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected announcement, coming at a time Barak faces a
fast-approaching deadline in talks with the Palestinians and
several political challenges at home, left much of the country
wondering about his motives.
</P>
<P>
   Some speculated that he was setting the scene for new elections
and others theorized that he was pressuring the opposition to
support his dealings with the Palestinians, who have threatened to
unilaterally proclaim a Palestinian state by Sept. 13 if a
settlement has not been negotiated.
</P>
<P>
   Barak announced his proposal after summoning ministers and
legislators from his One Israel coalition to a meeting late
Saturday. He told them of a sweeping plan that would strengthen the
secular nature of Israeli society at the cost of entrenched Jewish
rights woven into the country's social and political fabric since
its founding in 1948. Israeli commentators said that the plan posed
one of the most serious political challenges ultra-Orthodox parties
have faced in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, Barak pledged to introduce a new
constitution guaranteeing a full range of political, social and
religious freedoms that would create greater equality between Jews
and non-Jews. In addition, he promised to dismantle the religious
affairs ministry, introduce a bill allowing for civil marriages
that would be beyond the control of the rabbinate and sponsor bills
promoting the status of women.
</P>
<P>
   He also outlined a ``comprehensive national service bill'' that
would require all young Israelis, including members of
ultra-Orthodox groups now exempted from military service, to sign
up for two years of nonmilitary work directed by the government.
Finally, he pledged to impose a curriculum for all state-financed
schools, including those run by ultra-Orthodox groups, that would
include classes in subjects they have shunned, including civics,
mathematics and English.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's continuing political problems were also compounded
Monday when a second aide in his secretariat resigned. Haim
Mendel-Shaked, one of Barak's old army friends, quit his
administrative post as director of Barak's office. His resignation
was considered a symbolic and psychological setback because Shaked
had been loyal to Barak for many years. He was the second member of
Barak's office to quit following the resignation last week of his
own deputy, Shimon Batat.
</P>
<P>
   Accounts in Israeli newspapers on Monday about Barak's weekend
meeting said that many of those who attended were stunned. The
accounts said this was partly because Barak had kept his plans to
himself before the weekend meeting, compounding complaints that he
had become increasingly isolated from his top officials and
ministers in the weeks leading up to, and since, the deadlocked
Camp David peace talks with the Palestinians last month.
</P>
<P>
   By forging ahead with a peace plan that offered greater
concessions to the Palestinians on Jerusalem and other key issues
that right-wing and ultra-Orthodox parties were prepared to
support, Barak in effect sacrificed his ruling coalition, which
began to disintegrate before he left for Camp David. Now, with
barely 40 of the 120 members of the Israeli parliament still firmly
behind him, he has taken another step, posing a challenge to the
power of the religious establishment, that Israeli commentators
view as politically risky and even quixotic.
</P>
<P>
   These commentators offered several possible explanations for
Barak's move. Some said he had abandoned hope of achieving peace
with Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, and thus felt free to
adopt domestic policies that would end any prospect that right-wing
and ultra-Orthodox parties that quit his coalition before Camp
David would agree to return to his government.
</P>
<P>
   Others said that Barak had realized that the only chance of
winning support for a peace agreement rested on a re-alignment of
Israeli politics that consolidated the power of secular forces.
Still another view was that Barak, facing the probability of a new
election in the next six months, and increasingly doubtful of
having a peace agreement that could secure victory, had decided his
best chance rested with a bold new plan for reforming Israeli
society from within.
</P>
<P>
   Accounts of the Saturday meeting said that it broke up in
disarray, with some of Barak's closest political allies expressing
grave doubts about his proposals, and others vigorous opposition.
One newspaper, Yedioth Ahronoth, said one of the strongest dissents
came from Shimon Peres, a former prime minister who won the Nobel
Peace Prize for helping to initiate the 1993 Oslo accords that
provided the foundation for the current peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Newspaper commentators said the changes had no hope of passing
the Israeli parliament, where Barak's government faces a right-wing
opposition galvanized by the concessions on Jerusalem and other
issues that Barak offered at Camp David. Although other prime
ministers from the secular, left-wing political spectrum that Barak
represents have tried and failed to achieve some of these reforms
before, these critics said, none had ever sought to accomplish so
much in one swoop, especially from a weak political position.

NUMBER OF YOUTHFUL OFFENDERS ON DEATH ROW HITS 24-YEAR HIGH 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: A shorter version slugged YOUTHS-EXECUTE-ABRIDGED is also
moving.) 
 By SARA RIMER   and RAYMOND BONNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   If the state of Georgia electrocutes Alexander Williams on
Thursday, as planned, five men who committed murder when they were
17 will have been put to death this year in the United States. That
is more than in any year since 1954, when six teen-agers were
executed in Florida and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, now 32, is one of 80 condemned youthful offenders _
those who were under 18 at the time of their crimes _ and while
they make up only a small percentage of the overall death-row
population, more are awaiting execution than at any time since the
ban on capital punishment was lifted in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   The practice of condemning teen-agers reflects the complexity of
attitudes about capital punishment in the United States. While 23
of the 38 states that have the death penalty permit the execution
of youthful offenders, only a handful have actually carried out
such executions since the death penalty was reinstated. Half of all
condemned youthful offenders are in Texas and Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, where four juvenile offenders are on death
row, Wayne Bailey, a district attorney, expressed a view popular
among supporters of the death penalty for those who committed
capital crimes when they were younger than 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you do an adult crime,'' Bailey said, ``the jury ought to
have the option to come back with the death penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   But even many prosecutors who support the death penalty, as well
as national organizations that are neutral on the issue, are
expressing concern about sentencing to death those who were,
according to most laws, still children when they committed their
crimes. The United States is one of only seven countries in the
world that permit such executions, according to the State
Department. Language prohibiting the practice is included in
several international human rights treaties, including the U.N.
Convention on the Rights of the Child, which only the United States
and Somalia have not yet ratified.
</P>
<P>
   ``It offends my conscience to execute someone who was under 18
at the time of the crime,'' said District Attorney Joshua Marquis,
of Astoria, Ore., a member of the board of the National Association
of District Attorneys, who otherwise supports the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the death
penalty for 16- and 17-year-olds by one vote in 1989. The previous
year the court ruled that executing those under 16 was cruel and
unusual punishment, but legal experts are split on whether that
constitutes a ban on such executions. No one younger than 16 at the
time of the crime has been executed, and only one person who was 16
at the time of the crime has been executed. Of the 23 states that
permit the execution of juvenile offenders, only seven have carried
out such executions since 1976: Texas, Virginia, South Carolina,
Louisiana, Missouri, Georgia and Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that it is little surprise that most are Southern
states, since the South has the highest incarceration rate and the
highest execution rate in general. This year, Virginia and Texas
each executed two men who committed their crimes when they were
under 18.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law prohibits the execution of juvenile offenders
charged with federal crimes, and when New York reinstated the death
penalty in 1995, it specifically excluded juvenile offenders.
Kansas took the same step when it reinstated the death penalty in
1994. Montana outlawed the death penalty for its juvenile offenders
last year. Maryland raised the age for capital punishment to 18 in
the late 1980s, and the state of Washington did so in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The American Bar Association and the Children's Defense Fund
oppose death sentences for juvenile offenders.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, several former prosecutors formed a group to
protect juvenile offenders last year when they learned their state
has four on death row.
</P>
<P>
   ``Considering all the ways the government failed our children _
from crack babies to horrible public schools to miserable health
care, we can at least ask the government not to willfully kill
them,'' said Zoe Sanders Nettles, a former prosecutor who helped
found the group, South Carolinians for Alternatives to the
Execution of Children.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways Alexander Williams is the typical condemned
youthful offender: Southern, black, poor, male and his victim was
white and female. The six teen-agers who were executed in 1954 were
all black and their crimes involved either the murder of white men
or the rape of white girls. They were all between the ages of 17
and 19 when they were electrocuted.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' lawyers have asked the Georgia Board of Pardons and
Paroles to commute Williams' sentence to life imprisonment and are
planning a last-minute appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The American Bar Association and the Children's Defense Fund
have condemned the sentencing to death of juvenile offenders and
have written letters to the pardons board on Williams's behalf.
Rosalynn Carter, the former first lady, has also written, asking
that Williams' sentence be commuted to life imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   Carter wrote: ``As a society we traditionally have given special
consideration to children who commit crimes because we recognize
that they lack the maturity or the mental capacity to function as
adults.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams' cause has also been taken up by the European Union, a
measure of the repugnance other Western countries have for the
execution of juvenile offenders. A representative of the union met
with the Georgia pardons board Monday to present an ``urgent
humanitarian appeal'' for the sentence to be commuted to life
imprisonment, a European Union official said.
</P>
<P>
   While it is impossible to document with certainty the extent of
the death penalty for juvenile offenders internationally, the U.S.
State Department, the U.N. High Commission on Human Rights and
Amnesty International, a human rights advocacy group, report that
the only countries other than the United States to have carried out
such executions in the last 10 years are Iran, Nigeria, Pakistan,
Saudi Arabia, Yemen and Congo.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has executed 14 juvenile offenders in that
time, more than the other countries combined, according to Amnesty
International. China, which executes more people than any other
country in the world, formally banned the execution of juvenile
offenders in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Other countries that allow the death penalty but prohibit it for
juvenile offenders include Japan, South Korea, Singapore and Libya.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the prohibition in the U.N. treaty, the execution of
juvenile offenders is also banned under the International
Convention on Civil and Political Rights. The U.S. Senate voted to
ratify that in 1992, but specifically reserved the right to execute
juvenile offenders.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The United States is continuing a practice that dates to 1647,
when 16-year-old Thomas Graunger was reportedly hanged in Plymouth
Colony for bestiality involving a cow and a horse, said Victor
Streib, a leading expert on juveniles and the death penalty, and
the dean of the law school at Ohio Northern University.
</P>
<P>
   Streib and other experts on adolescence and criminal justice say
that juvenile inmates facing execution may be viewed as an extreme
expression of Americans' fears of violence, and the attitudes among
politicians and law enforcement officials who want to be seen as
tough on crime.
</P>
<P>
   The experts say that executing juvenile offenders in more recent
years reflects the trend toward treating juvenile offenders as
adults, with their crimes judged as more significant than their
youth as a mitigating factor.
</P>
<P>
   Execution of juvenile offenders increased with the escalation of
juvenile violent crime in the mid-1990s and has continued even as
that crime rate has been declining in the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts contend there is growing scientific evidence that
the brain is still developing through adolescence, and that with
proper intervention, violent juvenile offenders can be
rehabilitated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The empirical and moral question here is, at what age can we
be so sure of a person's inability to change in the context of an
attempt by society to change that person that we would sentence
that person to death?'' said Laurence Steinberg, a psychology
professor at Temple University and the director of the MacArthur
Foundation Research Network on Adolescent Development and Juvenile
Justice. ``I don't think that 16 or 17 seems like a very reasonable
answer to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials and politicians who favor the
treatment of teen-age offenders as adults say the traditional
juvenile justice system was not set up to handle the numbers of
teen-agers who now have access to guns, and who commit the types of
crimes that are punished with the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Williams was 17 in 1986 when he abducted 16-year-old
Aleta Bunch from a shopping mall in Augusta, Ga., then raped and
fatally shot her.
</P>
<P>
   Aleta's mother, Carolyn Bunch, said of her daughter's killer in
a recent interview, ``I don't care how old he was. He was old
enough to know better. I could pull the switch on him and never
have any remorse. He shot her three times in the forehead. He shot
her eye out. He shot her in the heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Craig, the district attorney in Augusta, said in an
interview that he opposes clemency for Williams because the jury
had ``determined that the appropriate response of a civilized
society is the death penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Georgia law, at 17 Williams was automatically charged as
an adult, but it was the prosecutor's decision to seek the death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Williams is described in prison records as mentally ill: records
indicate he is bipolar and has schizoaffective disorder, which
reportedly leads him to worship the actress Sigourney Weaver as god
and to dress as the Lone Ranger. As a juvenile, he was charged with
several offenses, including reckless conduct for holding a knife to
a 13-year-old classmate's throat.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' sister, Alexsandriya Clemons, and half-brother, Rodney
Blair, have both sworn affidavits describing the abuse their mother
meted out to all of them as children. In an interview in Jackson,
Ga., last month, where they were visiting their brother on death
row, they said their mother had beaten them frequently with
electrical cords, frying pans, belts, barbells and a vacuum
cleaner. Their brother Alexander, they said, bore the brunt of the
worst abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``One time she was hitting his toes with a screwdriver and a
hammer,'' Clemons said.
</P>
<P>
   They said their mother, Pat Blair, held down three jobs while
supporting five children. She declined to be interviewed for this
article.
</P>
<P>
   At the trial, Alexander Williams' lawyer, O.L. Collins, who has
since died, did not present any of the details of his client's
childhood.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, four jurors, and a fifth this week, swore affidavits
stating that had they known about Williams' childhood abuse, and
his mental illness, they would not have voted to sentence him to
death. It is for that reason they, too, are asking Georgia's
pardons board to grant Williams clemency.

</P>
<P>
   Streib and other experts who have studied the youthful offenders
on death row say that they often grew up in fractured families
marked by drugs, alcohol, violence and mental illness. As children
the offenders had to figure out ``how not to get beaten to a pulp
or sexually abused by one of the so-called adults who'd been placed
in charge of them,'' said Craig Haney, a professor of psychology at
the University of California at Santa Cruz, who has compiled the
social histories of many juvenile offenders on death row for
defense lawyers. That kind of early abuse can lead to aggression
and violence, Haney and other experts contend.
</P>
<P>
   Haney and other experts also say that the stereotypical image of
teen-age killers as superpredators who cannot be redeemed is not
borne out by scientific evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even people who are cynical about the rehabilitation of adults
recognize that juveniles are different,'' Haney said. ``It's the
notion that human nature is unfolding. It's not until later in
someone's life that you're willing to throw up your hands and say
there is nothing more we can do now.''
</P>
<P>
   But many law enforcement officials view these offenders
differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gary Hart is not a kid,'' the prosecutor said during the trial
of Gary Davis Hart II, who was 16 when he fatally shot a restaurant
manager in Mobile, Ala., in 1989. ``Gary Hart is a predator.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Hart, who is on Alabama's death row, testified at trial
that an older man had given him and a friend instructions on how to
rob the restaurant. The shooting, he said, had been an accident.
Once he had cocked the gun, he did not know how to uncock it, he
said. He said he had taken the gun from the trunk of his mother's
car.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Simmons, who is on death row in Missouri, was 4 when
his stepfather began taking him to bars and pouring him drinks,
defense psychologists say. His stepfather would tie young
Christopher to a tree when he went fishing.
</P>
<P>
   At 17, in the course of a burglary in 1983, Christopher and a
15-year-old friend bound and gagged a 46-year-old woman and pushed
her into a river and she drowned. The 15-year-old was given life
without parole.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seventeen years old,'' the prosecutor said of Christopher at
his trial. ``Doesn't that scare you? Mitigating? Quite the
contrary, I submit.'' The prosecutor suggested that Christopher's
family would be better off if he were executed. ``Show some mercy
to his family,'' he said. ``Give him death.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Hughes had a mother who was a schizophrenic and an
alcoholic, according to court records. Left alone by their mother
for weeks at a time, Kevin and his five siblings begged on the

<P>
   From wage increases to greater pension benefits to less
mandatory overtime, telecommunications union workers in 12 Eastern
states from Maine to Virginia and the District of Columbia appear
to have been the victors in the strike that ended Monday for more
than half of the 86,000 workers who walked off their jobs 16 days
ago.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, the unions' agreement with Verizon Communications,
the nation's largest telecommunications employer, with 260,000
employees around the nation, touches many of the hot-button issues
of the New Economy _ including stock options, profit sharing and
the relentlessness of long work days.
</P>
<P>
   As the company tried to bring the remaining 40,000 or so
strikers in several mid-Atlantic states into the fold Monday, labor
and management experts were marveling at a settlement that is
generous by almost any measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a huge victory for the unions because it shows what
they can do in parts of the economy where they still have
leverage,'' said Paul Osterman, a professor of management at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ``But I suppose it remains
to be seen how this plays out in wireless organizing, the most
tantalizing part of the agreement, because that's where unions have
far less leverage.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, it was one matter for the Communications Workers of
America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers to
go on strike against Verizon, a company formed by the merger of
Bell Atlantic and GTE. The strike involved workers in the union's
stronghold _ the region formerly served by Bell Atlantic. But it is
quite another task to begin organizing at the company's wireless
division, where fewer than 50 of 32,000 employees around the
country are unionized.
</P>
<P>
   And yet the unions won concessions that should make it easier to
try to recruit union members at the unit, Verizon Wireless _ the
issue that was at the heart of the strike. The unions, particularly
the Communications Workers of America, are intent on organizing
workers at the mobile-telephone company, which is operated in a
venture with Vodafone AirTouch of Britain. Verizon Wireless is the
nation's largest wireless carrier, with more than 25 million
subscribers, and it is growing much faster than Verizon's
conventional telephone services.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say it is too early to gauge how the union effort might
play out with the wireless unit, where organizing is not expected
to begin in earnest for six months or so. The union will no doubt
be pointing to wage disparities between some workers. Customer
service representatives can make no more than $33,000 a year at
Verizon Wireless, but as much as $44,400 for Verizon's union
telephone company.
</P>
<P>
   While the natural inclination of Wall Street is to associate
union jobs with higher costs, some analysts say greater
unionization could have a potentially positive impact in some parts
of the company.
</P>
<P>
   The unions, for example, won a concession from the company
allowing their members to perform the entire installation of
high-speed Internet access for customers who sign up for Verizon's
Internet services. (Wholesale installations performed by Verizon
under other companies' names would not necessarily be performed by
union workers, according to a person involved in the talks.) Union
members are expected to be able to complete an installation in
about one day, instead of the two days it can sometimes take when
Verizon uses nonunion contractors to perform some of the tasks.
</P>
<P>
   ``A shorter installation cycle should quicken Verizon's
deployment of access,'' said Joseph Bellace, an analyst at
Jefferies &AMP; Co. who covers companies providing high-speed Internet
access. ``It sort of surprises me that this hasn't happened
sooner.''
</P>
<P>
   Verizon officials, too, sought to put a positive spin on the
unions' new contract. ``I'm thoroughly confident this will enhance
our competitiveness,'' Lawrence T. Babbio, vice-chairman of
Verizon, said in an interview. ``We've found ways to motivate our
employees on a performance basis that will also reduce churn within
the organization.''
</P>
<P>
   In another move that could speed Verizon's effort to transform
itself, the company created a profit-sharing plan _ pegged to that
of the chief executive, Ivan Seidenberg _ that would provide
provide payouts of up to $1,000 a year per employee.
</P>
<P>
   And adopting a benefit similar to the nonunion companies that
Verizon competes with in many parts of its business, the company
will hand out a small number of stock options to union members in
an effort to further interest them in Verizon's overall financial
performance and efficiency. Full-time employees will receive a
one-time grant of 100 stock options, while part-time employees will
receive 50.
</P>
<P>
   As union members absorb details of the agreement before meeting
to vote on its approval over the next three weeks, the company and
financial analysts mainly seem relieved that the strike is
effectively over. Verizon said it had a backlog of some 78,000
repair orders, with about 38,000 of these including people with no
service at all and 40,000 with some sort of trouble like static on
the line.
</P>
<P>
   And there is an estimated backlog of 200,000 orders for new
installations of service, which Verizon hopes to clear up in about
a month. This estimate anticipates an increase in orders as
students return to universities along the East Coast in coming
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how good the agreement looks to the unions, Verizon
nipped the real risk of the strike in the bud by ending it before
it entered into September,'' said Courtney Quinn, an analyst at the
Yankee Group, a telecommunications consulting company.
</P>
<P>
   Investors expressed mild optimism Monday, voting up Verizon's
shares 69 cents Monday, to a closing price of $42.81.

SCIENTISTS RENDER FLESH TEMPORARILY INVISIBLE 

</HEADLINE>
 MAN-HNS

c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It doesn't exactly produce The Invisible Man, but a team of
University of Texas-Austin scientists have learned how to make
flesh temporarily transparent.
</P>
<P>
   In experiments that could lead to better medical diagnosis and
therapy, UT biomedical engineers succeeded in making windows out of
areas of rat and hamster skin. When injected with a substance,
small parts of their flesh stayed transparent for 20 minutes or
more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could actually see blood vessels not previously visible,''
said Ashley J. Welch, a professor of biomedical engineering and the
chief investigator on the project. ``We're not sure how deep we can
take this, but this discovery holds promise for improving
procedures ranging from laser surgery to the detection and
treatment of tumors.''
</P>
<P>
   The research team has not done any experiments on human skin.
</P>
<P>
   Although the team is working with other substances, the rat and
hamster skin was turned transparent with injections of glycerol, a
colorless, syrupy liquid that absorbs water. The substance is often
used in manufacturing, medicine and many other applications.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, the transparency extends only a couple millimeters
deep, but that's at least five times and as much as 20 times deeper
into the body than doctors can currently see with optical devices
such as lasers. Doctors can now see only about a tenth of a
millimeter deep with light.
</P>
<P>
   The inability to see deeper into the body restricts treatment.
Therapeutic procedures that depend on accurately focusing lasers on
a particular area _ such as eye surgery and the accurate targeting
of tumors and other laser surgeries _ are limited by the fact a
beam of light cannot pass directly through overlying tissue.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, transparent human skin would allow optical devices
to penetrate further and illuminate tissue properties that suggest
tumors; direct light to the precise problem area rather than
cutting away healthy tissue to reach it; and deliver therapeutic
light without diffusing stray light that can damage capillaries.
</P>
<P>
   The process of attaining transparent skin has to do with the
fact that light is scattered as it moves through skin. Just as fog
scatters light, so do small components of tissue, as can be
demonstrated by placing a penlight against the thin tissue between
the fingers.
</P>
<P>
   Because none of the light passes directly through the skin, the
scattering prevents the viewer from seeing sharp images _ in this
case, blood vessels near the surface of the skin.
</P>
<P>
   Glycerol changes the degree of scattering by absorbing water: it
shrinks the tissue and modifies the way light is scattered.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a simple idea,'' said Welch. ``To make it useful
will be the more difficult task. For instance, we'd rather the
process not be by injection. We'd like to make it as non-invasive
as possible _ say, by pricking holes in the skin and then just
rubbing the substance on.''
</P>
<P>
   The UT team's research was originally published in the journal
Lasers in Surgery and Medicine in 1999. A second paper, quantifying
the research, was recently submitted to the same journal.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers said the next steps will involve discovering
other agents that have similar effects and determining the safest
to use; finding how deep they can make the transparency; and
identifying the exact medical applications for it.

AT RECORD LEVEL NOW, SCHOOL ENROLLMENT EXPECTED TO GROW THROUGH
CENTURY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Nev., Tenn., N.C.)  (Eds.: In third graph, corrects 1950s to 1970s and ``two decades''
to ``a decade.'') 
 By JACQUES STEINBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The federal government says the nation's elementary and
secondary schools will enroll a record 53 million students this
fall, continuing a decade-long rise, and officials expect that
number to jump to 94 million by the end of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   The enrollment figure, released Monday by the Secretary of
Education, Richard W. Riley, includes both private and public
schools and represents an increase of 200,000 students, or 0.4
percent, since last the beginning of last term, and an increase of
6.6 million, or 14.2 percent, since 1990. School enrollment is
expected to continue to rise slightly through 2005, to 53.5
million, and then level off through 2010.
</P>
<P>
   But in contrast to the baby boom _ which was followed, beginning
in the late 1970s, by a plunge in school enrollment that lasted
almost uninterrupted for nearly a decade _ the school population is
expected to grow without any letup throughout the rest of the 21st
century. Enrollment will swell steadily because of rising births
and an unabated flood of immigrants, the report said, citing census
projections.
</P>
<P>
   As graduation rates continue to climb, some colleges will be
swamped by the overflow, at least in applications; college
enrollment is expected to grow by 19 percent, or 2.4 million
students, over the next decade alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a century of growth ahead of us, a crescendo of
children,'' Riley said. ``America's challenge as we begin the 21st
century is to make good choices now, so that we won't be
overwhelmed later.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Riley issues an annual enrollment report at the end of
each summer, his emphasis on the long view was aimed, at least in
part, at the Republican Congress, which has consistently blocked
President Clinton's efforts to make available $25 billion in
interest-free bonds to enable districts to build and renovate
schools. The Republicans have said such responsibility lies with
school districts themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Riley made clear that public school districts, urban and rural,
are already coping with extraordinary growth. In Las Vegas, where
Riley released the report, the Clark County School District has
almost doubled in size over the last 10 years, growing to 208,777
from 105,054. (One of the newest schools, Irwin and Susan Molasky
Junior High School, was named, appropriately, for a builder.) The
Chattanooga, Tenn., schools grew at a similar rate, to 42,292
students from 20,425. And in Greensboro, N.C., enrollment rose by
156 percent, to 61,154 from 23,851.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has estimated the cost of renovating
and repairing existing schools alone at $127 billion.
</P>
<P>
   While every section of the country is expected to be affected by
the growth over the next century, Riley said that western and
southern states would feel such increases acutely. Over the next 10
years, public schools in Texas are projected to grow by 219,000
students, an increase of 5.4 percent; California is expected to add
278,000 students, an increase of 4.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   As overwhelming as the projected growth in school enrollment
appears over the 21st century, it is, by percentage, smaller than
that over the last 100 years: the nation's public and private
schools grew by 31.5 million students, or 147 percent, from 1900
through 2000, as compared with a projection of 41 million
additional students, or 77 percent, from now to 2100.

 &HT;    Take notice: Hurricane season about to enter its busiest time
 &HT;    By Eliot Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. - South Florida is entering the busiest
part of the hurricane season _ and it's in your best interest to
take notice. Now is the time to do all those things you were
supposed to do in May, but haven't.
</P>
<P>
   After more than two months without a swirl to speak of, four
named storms have formed since Alberto on Aug. 4. The two weeks or
so on either side of Sept. 10 represent the height of the season,
so you can expect at least the threat of a hurricane at least once
in the next three to four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps you'll be looking at a hurricane warning as early as the
end of the week, if Debby aims our way. Perhaps not.
</P>
<P>
   If Debby, or any other storm, threatens South Florida in the
coming weeks, and you wait until a watch or warning has been
issued, you can expect to be fighting for plywood, batteries and
water.
</P>
<P>
   In seven of the last 10 years, at least one tropical storm or
hurricane either made landfall in the Palm Beach County-Treasure
Coast-Glades region or got close enough to spark a hurricane watch
or warning. That means in seven of the last 10 years you've had to
perform at least the minimal preparations.
</P>
<P>
   If you wait, ``all the other folks that haven't made plans are
doing the same thing you are,'' Palm Beach County Emergency Manager
Bill O'Brien said. ``You're going to be busy enough at the final
moments doing the things you have to do then.''
</P>
<P>
   And Keith Holman, O'Brien's Martin County counterpart, said,
``When we talk about storms, they're always somewhere else. It's
always some other time or some other place. (But) everything coming
off the African coast is heading east to west, any of which has the
potential to land in your back yard.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's what you can be doing now, tonight (there's plenty of
daylight this time of year):
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Go to the Internet: www.storm2000.com/getready/. If you can do
neither, at least grab one of those hurricane map/tips brochures
the television stations provide at the grocery store, library and
other locations.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Clear your yard of all that junk that's been lying around for
months: bricks, toys, that rusted-out lawn chair you keep meaning
to throw out.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Unless your vegetation pickup date is today it may already be
too late to trim trees of loose branches and fronds and drag them
out to the curb. If Debby threatens the region and a watch or
warning is issued in the next few days, crews may not do pickups.
Even if they do, they won't be wanting to collect a lot of
material, so you'll just be creating big piles of potential
missiles.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Load up on the batteries, water, canned goods, and other
supplies that will disappear in minutes if a storm approaches.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Make a list of the last-minute things you'll do; bringing in
lawn furniture and potted plants, freezing water, charging
batteries, etc.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Check that you have all the proper mounting equipment for your
window coverings. If not, head to the hardware store now.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Unless you're in an area that probably will be evacuated, plan
on riding out the storm at home. Have a safe room in mind. If
that's not an option, be looking for a friend to take you in. If
you insist on leaving the region, remember gridlock is a real
possibility. Leaving now, when there's no direct threat, is just a
waste of time, effort and money, but you can plan your route and
check hotel rooms now. A shelter is an absolute last resort. If
that's your case, check for the nearest one now and know how to get
to it. It won't take your pet, so be looking for a kennel that
will.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  If you haven't already, make plans for your boat.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  If you live in a mobile home park or condominium, review
hurricane plans and check with managers or neighborhood captains.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Make sure you have all the insurance papers and other
documents you'll need should the storm hit. You may want to do a
video-walk around the home to create a record of your belongings.

NUMBER OF YOUTHFUL OFFENDERS ON DEATH ROW HITS 24-YEAR HIGH 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: A longer version slugged YOUTHS-EXECUTE is also moving.)

<P>
   If the state of Georgia electrocutes Alexander Williams on
Thursday, as planned, five men who committed murder when they were
17 will have been put to death this year in the United States. That
is more than in any year since 1954, when six teen-agers were
executed in Florida and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, now 32, is one of 80 condemned juvenile offenders _
those who were under 18 at the time of their crimes _ and while
they make up only a small percentage of the overall death-row
population, more are awaiting execution than at any time since the
ban on capital punishment was lifted in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   The practice of condemning teen-agers reflects the complexity of
attitudes about capital punishment in the United States. While 23
of the 38 states that have the death penalty permit the execution
of youthful offenders, only a handful have actually carried out
such executions since the death penalty was reinstated. Half of all
condemned youthful offenders are in Texas and Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, where four juvenile offenders are on death
row, Wayne Bailey, a district attorney, expressed a view popular
among supporters of the death penalty for those who committed
capital crimes when they were younger than 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you do an adult crime,'' Bailey said, ``the jury ought to
have the option to come back with the death penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   But even many prosecutors who support the death penalty, as well
as national organizations that are neutral on the issue, are
expressing concern about sentencing to death those who were,
according to most laws, still children when they committed their
crimes. The United States is one of only seven countries in the
world that permit such executions, according to the State
Department. Language prohibiting the practice is included in
several international human rights treaties, including the U.N.
Convention on the Rights of the Child, which only the United States
and Somalia have not yet ratified.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the death
penalty for 16- and 17-year-olds by one vote in a 1989 ruling. The
previous year the court ruled that executing those under 16 was
cruel and unusual punishment, but legal experts are split on
whether that constitutes a ban on such executions. No one younger
than 16 at the time of the crime has been executed, and only one
person who was 16 at the time of the crime has been executed. Of
the 23 states that permit the execution of juvenile offenders, only
seven have carried out such executions since 1976: Texas, Virginia,
South Carolina, Louisiana, Missouri, Georgia and Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law prohibits the execution of juvenile offenders
charged with federal crimes, and when New York reinstated the death
penalty in 1995, it specifically excluded juvenile offenders.
Kansas took the same step when it reinstated the death penalty in
1994. Montana outlawed the death penalty for its juvenile offenders
last year. Maryland raised the age for capital punishment to 18 in
the late 1980s, and the state of Washington did so in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways Alexander Williams is the typical condemned
juvenile offender: Southern, black, poor, male and his victim was
white and female. The six teen-agers who were executed in 1954 were
all black and their crimes involved either the murder of white men
or the rape of white girls. They were all between the ages of 17
and 19 when they were electrocuted.
</P>
<P>
   While it is impossible to document with certainty the extent of
the death penalty for juvenile offenders internationally, the U.S.
State Department, the U.N. High Commission on Human Rights and
Amnesty International, a human rights advocacy group, report that
the only countries other than the United States to have carried out
such executions in the last 10 years are Iran, Nigeria, Pakistan,
Saudi Arabia, Yemen and Congo.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has executed 14 juvenile offenders in that
time, more than the other countries combined, according to Amnesty
International.
</P>
<P>
   Other countries that allow the death penalty but prohibit it for
juvenile offenders include Japan, South Korea, Singapore and Libya.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the prohibition in the U.N. convention, the execution of
juvenile offenders is also banned under the International
Convention on Civil and Political Rights. The U.S. Senate voted to
ratify that in 1992, but specifically reserved the right to execute
juvenile offenders.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is continuing a practice that dates to 1647,
said Victor Streib, a leading expert on juveniles and the death
penalty, and the dean of the law school at Ohio Northern
University.
</P>
<P>
   Streib and other experts on adolescence and criminal justice say
that juvenile inmates facing execution may be viewed as an extreme
expression of Americans' fears of violence, and the attitudes among
politicians and law enforcement officials who want to be seen as
tough on crime.
</P>
<P>
   The experts say that executing juvenile offenders in more recent
years reflects the trend toward treating juvenile offenders as
adults, with their crimes judged as more significant than their
youth as a mitigating factor.
</P>
<P>
   Execution of juvenile offenders increased with the escalation of
juvenile violent crime in the mid-1990s and has continued even as
that crime rate has been declining in the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts contend there is growing scientific evidence that
the brain is still developing through adolescence, and that with
proper intervention, violent juvenile offenders can be
rehabilitated.
</P>
<P>
   Streib and other experts who have studied the youthful offenders
on death row say that they often grew up in fractured families
marked by drugs, alcohol, violence and mental illness.
</P>
<P>
   But many law enforcement officials view these offenders
differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gary Hart is not a kid,'' the prosecutor said during the trial
of Gary Davis Hart II, who was 16 when he fatally shot a restaurant
manager in Mobile, Ala., in 1989. ``Gary Hart is a predator.''

NEW TEAM OF U.N. ARMS INSPECTORS SETS SIGHTS ON IRAQ 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (REPEATING to correct coding)  (Exclusive) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE and STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The United Nations has assembled a new team of arms inspectors
that is ready to enter Iraq within weeks, raising the prospect of
another confrontation with President Saddam Hussein over his
weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   The creation of the new inspection team comes more than two
years after Saddam halted cooperation with a previous group of
inspectors, provoking a diplomatic crisis that culminated in four
nights of American and British airstrikes in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has repeatedly said it will not cooperate with the new
weapons commission, which the Security Council ordered nine months
ago in the hope that it would resolve some objections that the
Iraqis, as well as the Russians and French, had about the previous
commission.
</P>
<P>
   One of the chief Iraqi complaints about the previous commission,
headed by Richard Butler, an Australian arms control expert, was
that there were too many inspectors from the United States and
Britain, who, the Iraqis asserted, were really spies.
</P>
<P>
   The new team, with members from 19 countries, is meant to be
more accountable to the U.N. secretary-general, Kofi Annan. All the
members work directly for the United Nations, not for their own
countries, as before.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Hans Blix, the leader of the new team, is to discuss
the need for access to Iraq with a panel of international weapons
experts who serve as the commission's directors. By Sept. 1 he is
expected to report to the Security Council that the inspectors are
ready to begin work and to tell them that _ barring a change in
Iraq's position _ the Iraqis have continued to reject new
inspections.
</P>
<P>
   But it remains far from clear what the United States or other
members of the Security Council will do if Iraq refuses to
cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear how forcefully the Security Council will push
the new inspections, especially since its 15 members are sharply
divided over Iraq and the economic sanctions imposed on it. The
position of each member is not likely to be clear until debates in
the council begin sometime in September.
</P>
<P>
   The broad economic sanctions were imposed after Iraq invaded
Kuwait in 1990. They are to remain in place until Iraq is certified
as free of prohibited weapons _ chemical, biological and nuclear
arms as well as long-range missiles. Last December, the Security
Council said it would suspend the sanctions if Iraq cooperated with
the new team of arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   If Saddam refuses, the council will have no alternative but to
keep the sanctions in place. It is unlikely the council would call
for the use of force, but in previous confrontations, the United
States and Britain have argued that existing resolutions authorize
military action.
</P>
<P>
   If a confrontation developed, it would focus new attention on
the Clinton administration's policy toward Iraq in the middle of
the presidential election. That policy has come under sharp attack
from Republicans and even some Democrats in Washington, who
complain that President Clinton has not acted forcefully enough to
force Saddam's government to accept the inspections.
</P>
<P>
   If Saddam refuses to cooperate, the administration will be under
political pressure to act forcefully. If the Iraqi leader reverses
course, Clinton's successor could be confronted with the
politically difficult decision of whether to go along with a
suspension of sanctions, which the Security Council has offered as
an incentive to the Iraqis if they demonstrate cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats and other officials at the United Nations said they
believe that during this year's election campaign, the Clinton
administration is not likely to press for strong action, even if
Iraq remains defiant.
</P>
<P>
   But a senior administration official said that the Iraqis or
anyone else would be foolish to assume that. Although the
administration has not indicated how it would answer new Iraqi
defiance, the official refused to rule out the possibility of an
``October surprise'' of American military action at the height of a
campaign, should the Iraqis provoke it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will be making a severe mistake if they think an election
campaign will affect how we carry out our foreign policy,'' the
official said.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, administration officials said they would insist
that Iraq comply with the resolution that created Blix's team or
face an indefinite extension of sanctions. ``It's a mandatory
resolution,'' Thomas R. Pickering, the undersecretary of state,
said in a telephone interview. ``If the Iraqis don't comply, the
sanctions will stay in place.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the resolution that created Blix's team, those sanctions
can be suspended six months after the Iraqis fulfill a list of
``key'' requirements set by the inspectors and, ultimately, be
lifted once the inspectors conclude that Iraq has come clean and
dismantled its prohibited weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   The previous commission had a more comprehensive standard for
declaring Iraq free of weapons before sanctions could be lifted,
offering no interim steps like a suspension for meeting some
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   The new inspection organization, officially known as the United
Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission, is led
by Blix, a Swedish arms control expert who previously served as
director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency in
Vienna, Austria.
</P>
<P>
   This month, Blix completed recruiting and training the 44 arms
inspectors from countries both friendly and not so friendly to the
Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
   Blix said his first step was to find out what happened to
several hundred sites inspected by the last commission in 1998 _
which could take at least several months.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis have said they believe the United States would never
agree to a suspension of sanctions but rather find another reason
to keep them in place, making cooperation, in their view,
fruitless.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials have long argued that resuming
inspections inside Iraq _ rather than resorting to force _ is the
most effective way to combat Saddam's efforts to hold on to
nuclear, chemical or biological weapons, as well as long-range
missiles that could deliver them.
</P>
<P>
   Within the Pentagon and the American intelligence agencies,
however, there is growing concern that Saddam has used the
prolonged absence of inspectors to continue those efforts. The CIA
sent a report to Congress this month warning that Iraq had already
rebuilt missile and chemical weapons factories since the airstrikes
in 1998.

</P>
<P>
   The issue of weapons inspections is only one area in which the
international standoff with Saddam appears headed for a new period
of confrontation, a decade after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait led to
the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Saddam has taken steps to ease his diplomatic
isolation, receiving a visit from President Hugo Chavez of
Venezuela. A thriving black market is reportedly eroding the
sanctions, while Russia, supported by China, is challenging the
American and British patrols of the ``no flight'' zones in northern
and southern Iraq, established to protect minority populations from
Saddam's government.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of these challenges, diplomats at the United Nations
and even some American officials say, the administration's policy
has been left to drift. The American ambassador to the United
Nations, Richard C. Holbrooke, has not involved himself in the
issue. Holbrooke says that he has been too busy on other matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt things are on autopilot,'' said one official
in Washington. ``And it might be an autopilot with a 10-degree
downward tilt.''
</P>
<P>
   Several diplomats, including some from nations on the Security
Council, said the administration had undermined its influence by
openly calling for the removal of Saddam from power. This has given
the Iraqis an excuse for dismissing the Security Council's pledge
to suspend sanctions if Saddam cooperates with new inspectors, the
diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   The administration may find itself even further isolated on the
Security Council, since three countries supportive of the United
States and Britain _ Argentina, Canada and the Netherlands _ will
be among the five countries relinquishing their rotating council
seats.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials say they have succeeded in containing
Iraq, enforcing the sanctions. They say they have also continued to
enforce the ``no flight'' zones, despite repeated Iraqi
provocations that have resulted in hundreds of limited airstrikes
since 1998.
</P>
<P>
   When American and British warplanes and missiles launched a much
larger attack 20 months ago, administration officials acknowledged
that the attack would make it difficult to resume weapons
inspections. But they argued that with Saddam refusing to
cooperate, there was no other way to prevent Iraq from acquiring
chemical or biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark my words,'' Clinton said of Saddam at the time, ``he will
develop weapons of mass destruction. He will deploy them, and he
will use them. Because we're acting today, it is less likely that
we will face these dangers in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen and others
also warned that the United States was prepared to use force again
if there was evidence that Iraq had resumed its chemical or
biological weapons programs _ or if Iraq threatened its neighbors
or attacked the Kurds in the north.
</P>
<P>
   James M. Bodner, the principal deputy undersecretary of defense
for policy and a longtime aide to Cohen, said in an interview that
the United States remained ready to respond if Iraq crossed any of
those ``red lines.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said they had no concrete evidence that
Iraq has restarted its weapons programs. But in addition to
repairing the damage done in 1998, Iraq has resumed testing its
shorter-range missiles. Officials fear that those tests, while not
explicitly prohibited under the U.N. resolutions, have allowed Iraq
to perfect longer-range missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that, the administration's warnings about Iraq's weapons
have lost much of their urgency. In the fall of 1997, Cohen held up
a bag of sugar on television and ominously warned that an
equivalent amount of the biological agent anthrax, which Iraq is
believed to possess, would destroy half the population of
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, administration officials have made no such
dire warnings, even though there have been no effective inspections
in two years. At the same time, Americans have done little publicly
to press Blix to accelerate the formation of his inspection team,
which has proceeded slowly.
</P>
<P>
   ``At no time have we been dragging our feet,'' Blix said in an
interview last Wednesday, adding that he had met all of the
Security Council's deadlines. ``We are working at full speed on a
lot of issues here.''
</P>
<P>
   Blix began interviewing weapons experts in May, and those
selected have completed a four-week training program. While Iraq
has vowed not to recognize the commission, Blix said there were
signs that Iraq was thinking over its next moves.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis recently presented a legalistic analysis of the new
inspection plan to governments of Islamic nations meeting in Kuala
Lumpur. The eight-page memorandum asks many, often accusatory,
questions, suggesting that the Iraqis still nurture hopes that the
resolution creating the inspection commission could be rewritten.
</P>
<P>
   Some diplomats say that Iraq may have calculated that it could
bide its time, hoping for a better deal in the future. Russia has
already called for changes in the resolution, but U.N. and American
officials have adamantly ruled out the possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Others say Saddam will stop short of any actions that would
invite American retaliation, while trying to build support for an
unconditional lifting of the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, he thinks things are going his way,'' an American
defense official said. ``He's outlasted the Clinton administration.
He outlasted the Bush administration. I think his perception is he
can outlast them all.''

INDUSTRY LEADERS MEET, BUT OFFER LITTLE RELIEF FROM AIR DELAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Beleaguered airline passengers looking for
immediate relief from a summer of record delays and cancellations
received scant hope Monday from a meeting of airline executives,
labor unions, industry groups and the government.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was hastily called earlier this month by
Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater to discuss ways of improving
air travel in the face of a growing outcry from passengers.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference following the meeting, Slater, flanked by
several of the participants, announced three initiatives but
admitted that none of them would have a significant impact before
the fall, when air travel traditionally diminishes after the peak
summer season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The greatest accomplishment of today's meeting is that we have
stated our shared commitment and expressed our renewed effort _ all
of the participants here _ to improve our service to the American
people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Several participants said that the meeting did succeed in
setting a more cooperative tone between groups that have tended to
blame each other for recent problems.
</P>
<P>
   For example, airline executives have attributed most of this
summer's difficulties to stormy weather, an antiquated air traffic
system and covert protests by pilots and machinists, especially at
United Airlines, which has had by far the worst on-time performance
of the major airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Air traffic controllers and some government officials have
accused the airlines of scheduling too many flights that leave at
the same times, overwhelming air traffic capacity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that I found for myself that's different from
anything I have ever experienced is a commitment to really pay some
attention to this issue,'' said David Z. Plavin, the president of
the Airports Council International, a trade association
representing major airport operators, including the Port Authority
of New York and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   But Plavin and others warned that there is no magic solution to
an infrastructure problem that is going to take years to correct.
``It's an evolutionary process,'' he warned. ``That's not an easy
sell to the public but this is enormously complex stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Plavin, the meeting was attended by, among
others, executives from nine major airlines and eight labor unions
representing virtually all airline and airport workers from pilots,
to flight attendants to air traffic controllers. Slater said that
he would host another meeting next week with regional airlines and
consumer advocates, who had complained that they were excluded from
Monday's summit.
</P>
<P>
   Among the new initiatives announced Monday, Slater pledged to
make the transportation department work more aggressively to help
the airlines exchange information about practices that improve
customer service. He also appointed a deputy to lead a task force
that will report back to him in 90 days with ideas for improving
the information about quality of service, such as statistics about
on-time performance and lost baggage, that the department receives
from airlines and passes on to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Slater said that the Federal Aviation Administration,
which operates the country's air traffic system, had undertaken 20
initiatives to improve the performance at seven ``choke points''
around the country that are often responsible for causing delays.
Many of the improvements, such as redesigning air space around
frequently congested cities like New York, Boston and Cleveland,
will take years. However, Slater said that 11 of the improvements
could be instituted by the end of October.
</P>
<P>
   Michael P. McNally, president of the National Air Traffic
Controllers Association, said that the changes would not make much
of a difference. ``Everything is a tweak,'' he said in an interview
after the meeting. ``We are just trying to add a few percentage
points to a system that is pretty much maxed out.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he added that the meeting left him hopeful that the
various industry players could begin a new era of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   One indication of that will be how fast United can negotiate new
contracts with its pilots and machinists. A portion of Monday's
meeting focused on how to speed up bargaining in the industry,
which often can extend for years.
</P>
<P>
   Since airline workers are prohibited from striking until given
permission by a federal mediator, many workers express their
displeasure by refusing to fly overtime, working to rules, or
calling in sick. United has said such protests by its pilots and
mechanics have forced it to cancel thousands of flights.
</P>
<P>
   The unions have repeatedly denied they have orchestrated any job
actions. Asked at Monday's new conference about the impact the
protests have had on consumers, Robert Roach Jr., vice president of
the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers,
said: ``Machinists never use job actions to aggravate consumers.''

   Deep in One Part of Texas
</P>
<P>
   Weighing in on Robert Altman's fashion satire, ``Ready to
Wear,'' six years ago, Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times,
``Beyond being so slack, the bleached, hazy `Ready to Wear' commits
the cardinal fashion sin: it doesn't even look good.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics might have a hard time leveling that particular
complaint about Altman's newest movie, ``Dr. T and the Women,''
which opens in a few weeks and stars Richard Gere as a Dallas
gynecologist who ministers to the kind of women (played by Laura
Dern, Kate Hudson and Farrah Fawcett, among others) who wear
rose-colored mink cuffs on their wrists and ostrich-feathered hats
to lunch.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of Dona Granata as costume designer, Altman, it
seems, has made his true fashion movie. To research the kind of
Texas woman the director was trying to portray, Granata spent time
going to Dallas fund-raisers and taking notes at Stanley Korshak,
the city's well-known upmarket specialty store. In fact, a
saleswoman in bridal wear there ended up with a role in the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the young women are very much in the New York black
mode,'' Granata observed, ``but they'll put on some outrageous shoe
or a really big piece of jewelry, and that wouldn't happen in New
York. In Dallas, surgery starts young and diamonds are a girl's
best friend.''
</P>
<P>
   So, too, are Dior bags, Dior miniskirt suits, stamped leather
jackets from Escada and various outrageously styled numbers from
St. John. Of one especially garish number worn by Laura Dern _ a
fur-trimmed road-sign-yellow cape with matching fur-trimmed
stiletto boots _ Granata said: ``Women were actually buying that.
It's real. I didn't make it up.''
</P>
<P>
   A World of Talent
</P>
<P>
   When New York Fashion Week gets under way in the middle of next
month, this premier showcase for American fashion will feel, well,
slightly less American than usual. ``What we're doing is a kind of
international summit,'' Fern Mallis, executive director of Seventh
on Sixth, which organizes Fashion Week, said the other day. The 10
days of men's and women's shows begin on Sept. 13.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday Sept. 16 and throughout the following week, an
unprecedented number of little-known designers from around the
world will show their clothes in Bryant Park, among other sites.
They are coming from Hong Kong, Portugal, Brazil, South Africa and
Nigeria. The five African designers _ one from Nigeria and four
from South Africa _ are the winners of a continent-wide design
competition that had Mark Eisen, a Seventh Avenue designer by way
of South Africa, as a judge.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've all been coming and calling and wanting to show in New
York,'' Mallis said.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from this international jamboree, Lizzy Disney, a British
designer, will be part of Moet &AMP; Chandon's Designer Debut show.
Also, the Parisian Nicolas Ghesquiere, the designer for Balenciaga,
will show his line for the Italian label Callaghan for the first
time here as well.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Jacobs, Major and Minor
</P>
<P>
   Conspiracy theorists might see it an effort to ward off the
foreign invasion: the quintessentially American designer Marc
Jacobs is holding not one show this coming season, but two.
</P>
<P>
   In September, in addition to his Marc Jacobs line, the designer
will inaugurate his secondary line, which, assuming trademark
issues are hammered out, will be called Marc. (Doom-sayers will
remember that Isaac Mizrahi's ill-fated secondary line was called
Isaac.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we're missing a segment of the population because of
our price point,'' Robert Duffy, president of Jacobs' company,
explained. That segment of the population includes the many who see
no reason to pay $800 for a Marc Jacobs sweater.
</P>
<P>
   The collection, Duffy said, will be priced below those of most
secondary lines _ probably below $200 for that sweater. It will
feature knits, shoes and bags, among other pieces. ``It's modeled
after the way people we know dress,'' Duffy continued. ``No one
wears designer head to toe.''
</P>
<P>
   The line will be shown at the Stuart Parr gallery in Manhattan
with the help of Juergen Teller photographs and about two dozen
live models.

RETURNING LUXURY TO FIFTH AVENUE

 By GINIA BELLAFANTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One bright afternoon last week, at the Prada store on
Fifth Avenue, two young women who appeared to share the same
parents and the same attitudes about highly elective surgery,
passed a baby and platform shoes back and forth between them. With
some fall shoes already sold out, they gave up and moved downstairs
to the handbag section. ``I have the Chanel, I have the Louis, I
have the Gucci,'' said the redhead to the brunette, as a saleswoman
showed them a burgundy bowling bag. ``I want tan,'' said the
redhead. ``I need tan.''
</P>
<P>
   The two women seemed to defy the conventional thinking about
just who the Fifth Avenue shopper is. First, as locals, they were
in full command of the English language, and second, they were
spending actual money in a place that displayed not a single Tweety
Bird athletic sock.
</P>
<P>
   While certain New Yorkers continue to lament the downscaling of
the stretch of Fifth Avenue from Rockefeller Center to Grand Army
Plaza _ its amusement-park feeling, the out-of-towners in their
Easy Spirits _ it has become harder to argue that the blocks have
been abandoned to the tastes of those eager to dine at Hooters.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 4, Gucci will re-open on Fifth Avenue at 54th Street
after an extensive 17-month remodeling, unveiling a new limestone
facade, an interior by the architect William Sofield and 13,000
square feet of space in which to sell the label's $800 boots and
chevron mink coats. In December, Louis Vuitton will open a
6,000-square-foot store, about the size of its Beverly Hills
boutique on Rodeo Drive, one block north of Gucci. Both Bergdorf
Goodman and Cartier are in the midst of overhauls. Saks Fifth
Avenue is undergoing a $100 million renovation that will add 40,000
square feet of sales space to the store's flagship, including an
expanded fine jewelry section, when complete in 2005.
</P>
<P>
   What all of this amounts to in the minds of some retailers and
shoppers is that Fifth Avenue is reclaiming something of its
resplendent past. In a symbolic shift, several months ago the
Coca-Cola store on 55th Street _ the first of the avenue's theme
stores, which opened in 1992 _ shut its doors . Its former space is
occupied temporarily by Cartier while it spiffs up its longtime
home, three blocks south at 52nd Street. ``It's still a
world-renowned shopping destination,'' Pat Malone, the president of
Gucci America, said of Fifth Avenue. ``You see the resurgence of
luxury brands here.''
</P>
<P>
   Gucci, long a Fifth Avenue resident, briefly considered joining
the luxury exodus to upper Madison Avenue before deciding to stay
put. It is the sort of logic with which John Slavinsky, the senior
vice president for stores of Louis Vuitton, would not argue.
Slavinsky compared the company's decision to open a store on Fifth
Avenue to its decision to move one in Paris from a quiet street to
the more clamorous Champs-Elysees two years ago. Sales there
increased about 50 percent, Slavinsky said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my mind, Madison is where you put a third store,''
Slavinsky said. (Louis Vuitton put its first New York store in
SoHo.) ``We wanted to be in a place with a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   There is speculation in the commercial real-estate world that
the Warner Brothers store on Fifth Avenue and 57th Street, a mighty
symbol of Fifth Avenue as theme park, may move well before the
expiration of its lease in five years. The speculation is driven by
the fact that the theme-store business has been slackening (Warner
has closed four stores in 18 months) and that the building housing
its nine-story emporium was purchased in March by Allied Partners,
a development firm. A representative of Allied, which could
theoretically buy out the Warner Brothers lease, would not comment.
A spokeswoman for Warner Brothers, when asked if there were plans
to close the store, said, ``Not that I'm aware of.''
</P>
<P>
   For some, Fifth Avenue started its descent toward lowbrow well
before the theme stores ever arrived _ back in the late 1960s, '70s
and '80s, when discreet stores like De Pinna and Peck &AMP; Peck
stopped selling their establishment tweeds. Peck &AMP; Peck had opened
on Fifth Avenue and 48th Street in 1907, pioneering upscale
retailers' shift from the East 20s and 30s to what was then
considered ``upper'' Fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in the '90s, with the arrival of Barneys New York on
the Upper East Side, the focus shifted again, this time to Madison
Avenue above 61st Street, where rents in recent years have caught
up to what they are on Fifth, about $600 a square foot, said Faith
Hope Consolo, the vice chairwoman of Garrick-Aug Worldwide, a
real-estate consulting company. The renewed interest in Fifth,
Consolo said, has much to do with a heightened understanding among
retailers of the modern shopper's habits, whether she is from
Westport, Conn., or Duesseldorf. ``There's no pure luxury
anymore,'' Consolo said. ``There's no pure shopper.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone who shops at Chanel also shops at H&AMP;M,'' she said,
referring to the inexpensive Swedish clothier drawing crowds on
Fifth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Consolo, who bids on store spaces for retail clients, makes it
her business to know how well purveyors of expensive clothes do
once they land on Fifth. The Prada store between 56th and 57th
Streets on Fifth achieves sales four times greater per square foot
than at Prada's Madison Avenue store, Consolo said. She said that
when the men's clothier Ermenegildo Zegna opened on Fifth near
57th, it increased its wholesale business by about 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the view of Tom Cusick, the president of the Fifth Avenue
Association, ``the whole notion that Fifth turned down a mass path
is overblown.'' As head of the association, a group of merchants
and property owners, Cusick would not be expected to say otherwise;
but he does point out that while many spent the '90s whining about
the end of a recherche Fifth Avenue, the decade saw the arrival of
a fair number of high-end stores. Prada replaced a Doubleday
bookstore on Fifth. Fendi took the place of a Hallmark card store.
</P>
<P>
   Giulia Melucci, a publicist at Scribner, who was walking up
Fifth not long ago, felt that merchants like the National
Basketball Association had been gaining on the avenue until
recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walked past H&AMP;M,'' she said, ``and I saw that big sign
announcing a new Louis Vuitton across the street and I thought,
`What does it all mean?' It means that Fifth is a democracy, not
purely elite, not purely crass.''

KNICKS TO DEAL EWING TO SEATTLE IN MULTI-TEAM SHUFFLE 
</HEADLINE>
  By   MIKE WISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Patrick Ewing, the stoic, 7-foot center who for 15 years hoped
to be the player to bring a National Basketball Association
championship to the Knicks,  &UR;  &LR; was instead on the cusp of being
traded to the Seattle SuperSonics Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The 38-year-old veteran, whose arrival in 1985 revived the
floundering club, was the centerpiece of a blockbuster deal that
included four teams and more than a dozen players, an NBA official
said on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   In a summer of monster, multi-team deals that involved some of
the game's most prominent players _ Grant Hill ended up in Orlando
while Shawn Kemp was dealt to Portland _ the deal for Ewing may be
the most immense and most complicated. According to the NBA
official, the announcement of the trade was held up in early
evening because the Pistons were re-examining the financial
implications of bringing in so many players. But, the official
said, the deal was not in danger of collapsing.
</P>
<P>
   In the trade, Ewing would go to Seattle, while the Knicks would
acquire forward Vin Baker from the Super Sonics and Glen Rice and
Travis Knight from the Los Angeles Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers, in turn, would receive Chris Dudley from New York
and Christian Laettner from Detroit. The fourth team in the deal,
the Pistons were attempting to reduce their payroll so that they
could land a top-tier free agent next summer. They would take a
number of role players from the three teams, including Vernon
Maxwell, Lazaro Borrell, Greg Foster, Vladimir Stepania, John
Celestand, Tyronne Lue and David Wingate.
</P>
<P>
   After dealing Baker, the Sonics are expected to sign free agent
power forward Maurice Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most dominating post players in the NBA's modern era,
Ewing was the Knicks' No. 1 selection in the 1985 college draft.
They won the pick that season by winning the NBA's first draft
lottery; it was a day that sent long-suffering fans cheering into
the streets of Manhattan with the knowledge that the Knicks would
select the scowling, shot-blocking menace from Georgetown
University. Ewing would lead the Knicks into the playoffs 13
straight years. With him, the Knicks advanced to the Eastern
Conference finals three times. In 1994, the team came within a game
of winning the franchise's first title since 1973, when they lost
to the Houston Rockets in a seven game championship series.
</P>
<P>
   Holder of most major Knicks records, Ewing ended last season as
the 14th-leading scorer in league history. He is fourth in blocked
shots and he played in his 1,000th game last season. Ewing is one
of seven players in NBA annals to spend 15 years with the same
team.
</P>
<P>
   If his longevity was impressive, though, his durability was
wearing thin.
</P>
<P>
   In the last three seasons, he missed 88 regular-season games
because of injuries _ from a dislocated right wrist to a partial
tear in his left Achilles tendon _ and his production was severely
limited by his health. Ewing's injuries put him out of the 1999
championship series against the San Antonio Spurs, which the Knicks
lost in five games. He began last season on the injury list. Still,
Ewing came back and silenced his critics for most of the regular
season. He started 62 games, dutifully took on a reduced role in an
offense suddenly powered by Allan Houston and Latrell Sprewell.
</P>
<P>
   But as the playoffs came, the old question re-emerged both
inside and outside the locker room: Were the Knicks better off
without Ewing? The plodding half-court style played by the aging
7-footer came to be viewed as a blight to the Knicks' new,
high-octane outfit. Ewing missed two games of the Eastern
Conference finals series against the Indiana Pacers because of his
Achilles problem.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing was scheduled to make $14 million this season, the last
installment of a four-year, $68 million contract signed in 1997.
The Knicks balked when it came to talk of a contract extension
beyond this season, a development that forced Ewing and David Falk,
his agent, to consider other options.
</P>
<P>
   After giving Scott Layden, the general manager, a list of eight
teams he would agree to play for, Ewing waited for the Knicks to
make their move.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two months ago, the trade seemed highly unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order for us to get back to the finals, Patrick has to be
part of this team,'' Layden declared when asked if Ewing would be
moved.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed end of the Ewing era begets even more questions for
the franchise's future. Baker, a member of the 2000 U.S. Olympic
team who is coming off two subpar seasons, will fill the club's
need at power forward.
</P>
<P>
   But with no bona-fide center to guard players such as Alonzo
Mourning of Miami and the Lakers' Shaquille O'Neal, the Knicks are
at a distinct disadvantage in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   There was much conversation around the league about the Knicks
parting ways with their franchise center, the oft-maligned, aging
veteran who never delivered the championship to New York he so
desperately wanted _ and thus never earned the adoration of the
fans he so desperately coveted.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's sad,'' O'Neal said when informed of the trade. ``You
always thought Patrick Ewing would retire in New York. That's what
everyone thought.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Speaking in somber tones and at times struggling for
words, Russia's defense minister, Marshal Igor Sergeyev, on Monday
night defended the military's failure to rescue the crew of the
stricken nuclear submarine Kursk by saying that the armed forces of
the once powerful Soviet empire had been ``robbed and stripped'' in
the last decade and were operating on half the budget they
required.
</P>
<P>
   After divers finally gained entry to the wreck of the Kursk on
Monday and declared it completely flooded and its 118-member crew
dead, the 68-year-old officer said he did not exclude the
possibility that the military might have made some mistakes in the
rescue drama. But ``no principle mistakes were made,'' he insisted,
and he argued that foreign assistance might not have helped to save
the crew.
</P>
<P>
   The Kursk went down in 350 feet of water after unexplained but
powerful explosions sundered its hull during military exercises in
the Barents Sea on Aug. 12. Russian officials are investigating
whether it was involved in a collision with an unidentified vessel,
or perhaps struck an old mine or was scuttled by some internal
defect.
</P>
<P>
   In a day marked by expressions of remorse, confession and
resolution to solve the mysteries of the sinking of one of Russia's
most advanced warships, the commander of Russia's northern fleet,
Adm. Vyacheslav Popov, went on television to ask forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost the best submarine crew in the northern fleet,'' he
said, adding, with eyes cast downward, ``Forgive the children.
Forgive your sons. And forgive me for not bringing back your
boys.''
</P>
<P>
   Sergeyev's words were less contrite, and seemed in part an
attempt to quell the political storm that has laid siege to the
government of President Vladimir Putin for not making a more timely
request for Western assistance, and for withholding or distorting
information about the circumstances in which the submarine went
down and the fate of the sailors trapped in its nine compartments.
</P>
<P>
   And with fresh suggestions that a foreign submarine may have
been involved in a collision with the Kursk, Russian officials
betrayed some of the frustration and mistrust that were the
hallmark of the Cold War, even as an extraordinary collaboration
among British, Norwegian and Russian sailors unfolded in the Arctic
Sea _ most famous as a long-running venue for the silent war of cat
and mouse between rival fleets.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, who remained on vacation at a Black Sea resort during
most of the frantic rescue operation, made no public appearance
Monday. But Sergeyev, 68, in a nationally televised interview,
announced that all submarines of the Kursk's class would stay in
port until it was determined what caused the explosions that
wrecked the Kursk and sent her crashing into the seabed during
missile- and torpedo-firing maneuvers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not excluded that some mistakes were made, but as it
seems to me now,'' Sergeyev said, ``no principle mistakes were
made.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he added, ``we have to rise above emotions, and
coldly and scrupulously investigate the entire path of making and
carrying out decisions,'' however ``serious the consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that ``the whole reason'' Russia lacked deep-sea diving
and rescue equipment in the northern fleet was the pathetic state
of funding. ``The navy is really in decrepit shape,'' said Mark
Kramer, a Russian specialist at the Davis Center for Russian
Studies at Harvard University. ``A lot of the best people have been
leaving because they don't get paid. Only a tiny percentage of the
navy is at sea at any one time.'' Most ships, he said, ``are in
repairs or left in port to rust.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian sailors are paid $50 to $90 per month and schools in
naval towns last winter complained of 40-degree temperatures in
classrooms, where heat and electricity supplies are often
interrupted.
</P>
<P>
   The end of the rescue operation Monday followed fruitless
attempts by Norwegian divers on Sunday to open the rear escape
hatch on the Kursk. A plan to yank the hatch off by force using a
crane was deferred as divers descended again Monday morning and
succeeded first in opening the outer hatch to the escape chamber,
which was flooded and empty, and then the inner hatch to the ninth
compartment, which they also found flooded. The body of a Russian
sailor was reported to be just inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have found that the whole submarine is full of water,'' a
Norwegian military spokesman, John Epsen Lien, said in Oslo,
Norway.
</P>
<P>
   Russia requested that Norway help recover the bodies, but the
owners of the diving vessel, Stolt Offshore, said it might be too
dangerous for their men to enter the ship. Russian navy officials
said they would try to negotiate a contract to carry out the
recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shall cooperate with the Norwegians as before,'' said Vice
Admiral Mikhail Motsak, chief of staff of the northern fleet.
</P>
<P>
   In response to criticism that Russian officials waited too long
to seek Western assistance, Sergeyev said that as soon as it became
apparent last Wednesday that the Russian navy desperately needed
help to open an escape hatch on the Kursk, he personally made the
``political decision,'' on the recommendation of Navy Commander
Adm. Vladimir Kuroyedov, to ask for help and then informed Putin,
who concurred.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Sergeyev also disclosed new information to support what he
characterized as a strong suspicion on the part of Russian military
and civilian leaders that the Kursk collided with another submarine
that also suffered severe damage, but managed to escape.
</P>
<P>
   He said that at the moment that Russian navy vessels were
identifying the shattered hull of the Kursk at 6:40 p.m. on Aug. 13
_ more than 30 hours after Western sensors detected two explosions
in the area where the submarine was operating _ a second submerged
object, probably a submarine, was detected lying near the Kursk.
</P>
<P>
   Russian lookouts on two ships observed a signal buoy, not of
Russian origin, that is used by Western fleets to send emergency
messages by satellite transmission to their command base. Attempts
to retrieve the buoy failed in high seas, Sergeyev said. His
comments confirmed a report Friday from a Russian television
correspondent, Arkady Mamontov, who said that military officials
told him that the mystery buoy was green and white. Russian
emergency buoys, he said, were red and white.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time that lookouts spotted the signal buoy, Sergeyev
said, arriving Russian warships detected and ``directly observed
the object itself on the bottom of the ocean that was of equal
height of our submarine. This is a fact.'' Sergeyev then ordered
the navy to send a ``hydrographic vessel with more powerful
equipment'' to search for the mystery ship near the Kursk, ``but
this object was not found.''
</P>
<P>
   It appeared from his remarks that, in the early stages of the
rescue operation, Russian navy officials were not only organizing
the attempted rescue of the Kursk crew, but were also seeking to
apprehend a foreign submarine that they suspected was involved in a
collision.
</P>
<P>
   The Interfax news agency on Monday quoted an unidentified
military official in Moscow as saying that an object resembling
``the barrier of a foreign submarine tower'' had been discovered
lying on the seabed less than 1,000 feet from the Kursk. The
official said it was ``premature to draw any conclusions before
studying the object'' which ``may have been lying on the bed of the
Barents Sea for a long time,'' but the statement was another
confirmation that the Russian military is actively scouring the
seabed for evidence that might shed light on its collision theory.
</P>
<P>
   The American and British governments have categorically denied
that any of their submarines or surface vessels were involved in a
collision with the Russian vessel, but it was also apparent that
both governments were withholding information under their own
longstanding practice of refusing to comment on submarine spying
operations directed at the Russian fleet.
</P>
<P>
   When Russian officials at NATO headquarters inquired whether
``even one ship was there where the accident took place, they told
us no, there were no NATO ships there,'' Sergeyev said, adding that
Russian officials reported back that they overheard ``conversation
that if this incident had happened'' NATO officials ``would never
acknowledge it.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrei A. Kokoshin, national security adviser to former
President Boris Yeltsin, said in an interview Monday that ``there
were many cases'' in the past decade ``when our submarines in the
region and foreign subs were coming too close to each other and we
raised complaints several times to the Americans and some other
Western countries even to the point of proposing that there should
be some rules established for this kind of behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Kokoshin, now a member of Parliament who has joined those
calling for a parliamentary investigation of the sinking of the
Kursk, said that Russia owes a great debt to Norway and Britain for
assisting in the unsuccessful rescue of the crew, but he added that
even if the investigation proves that the Kursk was not involved in
a collision, a new international agreement on submarine ``rules of
conduct'' should be negotiated.
</P>
<P>
   ``This should be explored,'' he said, ``because it is too
serious for both of us, for our national security and for the
international community because it involves a nuclear power, and
the Cold War is over.''

FORD CLOSING THREE FACTORIES FOR TWO WEEKS TO EASE TIRE SHORTAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ With Ford Explorer owners still crowding car
dealerships in search of scarce replacements for recalled Firestone
tires, and with sales of new Ford Explorers beginning to slip, the
Ford Motor Co. said Monday that it will close three assembly plants
for two weeks to make an extra 70,000 tires available.
</P>
<P>
   Ford will close the plants next Monday, and reopen them Sept.
11, Ford executives said.
</P>
<P>
   Ford will shut down production of Ford Explorer sport utility
vehicles at its plant in St. Louis and shut down production of Ford
Ranger pickup trucks in St. Paul, Minn., and Edison, N.J. The
Ranger uses the same type of 15-inch tires as many Ford Explorers,
although virtually all of the 62 deaths that are possibly related
to flawed tires have occurred in Explorers, which outsell Rangers
by a wide margin. Regulators are still investigating accidents
reportedly connected with the tire problems.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Inglis, Ford's vice president for North American
automotive operations, told reporters about the plant closings in a
conference call Monday . An increase in tire production by
Bridgestone and other tire makers should ease Ford's current
shortage of 15-inch tires by mid-September, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jacques Nasser, Ford's chief executive and president, prepared a
television advertisement that was scheduled to be broadcast on
``Monday Night Football'' on ABC, confirming the automaker's
decision to cut production and vowing to keep customers' trust.
</P>
<P>
   Ford will idle 6,000 unionized assembly line workers at the
three factories. Under Ford's union agreement, the workers draw 95
percent of their pay, excluding overtime, during the temporary
shutdown.
</P>
<P>
   Ford had advertised in national newspapers on Sunday that it
would channel just 30,000 tires a month to dealerships, instead of
using them in the production of new Ford vehicles. The decision to
close the factories, releasing more tires into the market, was made
at 1 p.m. Monday, Ford executives said.
</P>
<P>
   While Ford might be able to catch up some of the production of
Rangers later this year, its St. Louis factory constantly runs at
full capacity and is unlikely to be able to make up the lost
production. Because Ford earns an average pre-tax profit of $8,000
on each Explorer, that will hurt the company's earnings for the
third quarter, financial analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows Ford is willing to put customer satisfaction before
profitability _ shutting down an auto plant where you make eight
grand a unit is a pretty bold statement,'' said Nicholas Lobaccaro,
an auto industry analyst at Lehman Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   George Pipas, a Ford market analyst, said that Ford's sales of
Explorers had been running at 91 percent of the company's target
over the last four days after matching the company's target during
the first two weeks of the month. Ford's target had been a
4-percent increase in Explorer sales compared with those last
August, and overall sales of Explorers so far this month are
slightly ahead of last year's level, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Ford is still short of Explorers, having struggled for years to
keep up with demand.
</P>
<P>
   Ford will keep open its Explorer plant in Louisville, Ky. That
plant makes more expensive Explorer models that are likely to be
equipped with 16-inch tires, which have not been recalled.
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Auto Safety, a nonprofit group sometimes allied
with consumers' lawyers, filed a lawsuit against Ford and
Bridgestone/Firestone on Monday, contending that the 16-inch tires
should also be recalled, a move that Ford and Bridgestone have
repeatedly dismissed as unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   Ford said that it would lose the production of 10,000 Explorers
and 15,000 Rangers at the three factories closed. Lobaccaro
estimated that the loss of the Explorer production during the third
quarter would cost Ford up to $80 million in pretax profits and
about $52 million in after-tax profits. The lost Ranger production,
with a pretax profit of $4,000 each, will cost Ford about $60
million in pretax profits and $39 million in after-tax profits in
the third quarter, though he said about half that loss can be
recovered in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The lost profits could be smaller if Ford can adjust production
in the coming months to emphasize higher-profit versions of the
Explorer and Ranger. Ford earns $1.2 billion to $2 billion each
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   While Ford executives have consistently said that they are
paying attention now only to customer safety, and not to the
company's liability exposure, Ford's decision to close the
factories temporarily could help its legal position.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for consumers said last week that people injured in the
coming weeks in Ford vehicles equipped with recalled Firestone
tires would have strong cases in suing the company as long as Ford
continued putting new, 15-inch tires on vehicles instead of making
them available as replacements.
</P>
<P>
   Closing the factories for two weeks will make 70,000 15-inch
tires available, though 6.5 million tires have been recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Ford said that it could not adjust production to make only those
models of Explorers and Rangers that need other size tires.
</P>
<P>
   A national survey of 3,600 people published Monday by Automotive
News, a weekly trade magazine for auto executives, found that 47
percent of the people thought that Ford's honesty had been fair or
poor, and 49 percent said that the speed of Ford's response had
been fair or poor. Public perception of Bridgestone was
considerably worse. The image of Ford sport utility vehicles other
than the Explorer, notably the Expedition, had also eroded, the
survey found.
</P>
<P>
   Ford executives responded that their own focus groups showed
that people thought the automaker had handled the issue well.

IN POSTCONVENTION POLLS, GORE BOUNCES JUST AHEAD OF BUSH 
</HEADLINE>
   By ADAM CLYMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Six public polls conducted for news organizations
since the Democratic convention have all shown Vice President Al
Gore leading Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, though in two cases by
only a single percentage point.
</P>
<P>
   The post-convention gains for Gore were generally larger than
the bounce recorded by the same polls earlier for Bush. But the
Bush gains generally fell off quickly. If Gore's also do, he will
find himself trailing Bush again. Moreover, in none of the polls
does Gore's lead exceed the margin of sampling error, a fact that
underlines the narrow, uncertain margins.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the polls were released Monday. A CBS News Poll of 956
registered voters conducted Friday through Sunday showed Gore
leading Bush, 45 percent to 44 percent, with 6 percent for Ralph
Nader of the Green Party and 1 percent for Pat Buchanan of the
Reform Party. A comparable poll taken two weeks earlier, just after
the Republican convention, gave Bush 50 percent and Gore 34
percent. Gore had never led Bush in a CBS News or CBS News/New York
Times Poll this year.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen A. Frankovic, director of surveys for CBS News, said
the advantage for Gore extended beyond the horse-race numbers. ``He
improved the public's assessment of him as having strong qualities
of leadership and someone who could be trusted. Overall, the
favorable evaluation of Gore is now the same as that for Governor
Bush,'' she said. Each is rated favorably by 45 percent of the
public and unfavorably by 27 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, a Zogby International Poll for Reuters, conducted on
the same three days among 1,004 ``likely'' voters, gave Gore a 44
percent to 41 percent lead, with 5 percent for Nader and 2 percent
for Buchanan. A week earlier, the same poll had Bush up, 43 percent
to 40, with 7 percent for Nader and 2 percent for Buchanan. The
last time a Zogby Poll showed Gore with any kind of lead was at the
beginning of February, when he had a 1 point margin.
</P>
<P>
   In an ABC News/Washington Post Poll of 896 registered voters,
Gore has 46 percent to Bush's 44 percent, with 4 percent for Nader
and 3 percent for Buchanan. Before the Democratic convention, Bush
led Gore in that poll, 48 percent to 40 percent, with 5 percent for
Nader and 2 percent for Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   Three polls conducted and released earlier pointed in the same
direction. A Gallup poll of 697 ``likely'' voters for CNN and USA
Today, taken Friday and Saturday, had Gore leading Bush, 47 percent
to 46 percent. Nader had 3 percent and Buchanan 2 percent. One week
earlier, before the Democratic convention, Bush had 55 percent,
Gore 39 percent and Nader 2 percent, with only a scattering for
Buchanan. Gore last led in one of these polls at the beginning of
April.
</P>
<P>
   Another Friday-Saturday poll, done for Newsweek by Princeton
Survey Research among 806 registered voters, gave Gore a 48 percent
to 42 percent lead, with 3 percent for Nader and 1 percent for
Buchanan. Eight days earlier, that poll found Bush leading, 48
percent to 38 percent, with 3 percent each for Nader and Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   The first post-convention poll, conducted among 508 registered
voters Thursday night for NBC News, showed Gore with a 46 percent
to 43 percent lead over Bush, with 2 percent for Nader and 1
percent for Buchanan. Just before the convention, Peter D. Hart and
Robert Teeter, who conduct the NBC polls, found Bush with 44
percent, Gore with 41 percent, Nader with 5 percent and Buchanan
with 2 percent. None of their previous polls had found Gore ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Frankovic said the Gore bounce measured by the CBS News Polls
had been exceeded only once in her polling, by Bush's father. In
1988, she said, Vice President George Bush went from a 17 point
deficit to a 6 point lead over Gov. Michael Dukakis. Bush never
trailed again.

SPORTS COLUMN: WHEN WOODS BECOMES A TIGER 
</HEADLINE>
   By   CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ To understand the genius of Tiger Woods, you
must appreciate not only his skill, but also his will.
</P>
<P>
   Like truly great athletes in any sport, Woods possesses
something deep within that allows him to focus clearly in the most
chaotic and challenging situations. Those who watched Woods and Bob
May battle Sunday during the final round of the PGA Championship
saw a classic moment in sports. It was like watching Muhammad Ali
vs. Joe Frazier at the Thrilla in Manila, like watching Michael
Jordan's last game, against the Utah Jazz, in which he ended his
career with a textbook jump shot that clinched another
championship.
</P>
<P>
   During Sunday's finishing holes, Woods' putting stroke under
pressure was as pure as Jordan's shooting stroke at the buzzer.
Woods faced two difficult putts that he could not afford to miss _
the 15-footer to save par at No. 15 in regulation and the 5-footer
for birdie at No. 18 to force the playoff.
</P>
<P>
   Was anyone surprised that Woods sank them both? Was anyone
surprised when Woods opened the playoff with another birdie putt,
chasing the ball into the hole like a jockey riding a horse down
the backstretch? Those putts reflected another quality shared by
Woods and Jack Nicklaus. Both are good putters. But in pressure
situations, they become great putters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great battle, and I enjoyed it,'' Woods said
afterward. ``You learn something about yourself in situations like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   But instead of learning something, Woods actually reinforced
something he already knew. Not only is he the world's most talented
player, but he may be the toughest mentally.
</P>
<P>
   Woods is 5-0 in majors when he leads entering the final round.
There were people who actually wondered how Woods would react if he
were challenged during the back nine of a major championship. After
all, he had run away with both the U.S. Open and the British Open,
turning the final holes into a victory lap. Would Woods crack if
someone finally pushed him to the final hole and played against him
without fear?
</P>
<P>
   The answer came Sunday. May played remarkably well, and his
performance was more impressive when you consider that he had never
been in that situation before. One could argue that he would have
beaten any other player in the world except Woods. On the back
nine, May turned in the performance of his life, shooting a
five-under-par 31. All weekend, May played the tournament of his
life, shooting 66 in each of the final three rounds.
</P>
<P>
   No, May was not perfect, and his missed 4-foot birdie putt at
No. 15 was huge. But he played well enough to force Woods to make a
5-footer on No. 18 just to force a playoff. Who expected that when
the day started? Yet, May still lost because Woods would not let
anyone else win.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you shoot 66 in the final three rounds of a major, you're
supposed to win,'' May said. ``But it wasn't good enough to beat
Tiger.''
</P>
<P>
   When Woods blitzed the field at both the U.S. Open and the
British Open this year, it was a tribute to his talent and his
preparation. When Woods won Sunday, it was a tribute to his grit.
He never came close to hitting the ball as well here as he did
during his romps at Pebble Beach and St. Andrews. For most of the
PGA, his putting was erratic.
</P>
<P>
   From the moment May went two strokes up on Sunday, however,
Woods became a different player. When he senses a tournament
slipping away, Woods truly becomes a tiger. That was true during
his amateur days, when he won three consecutive U.S. Amateur
championships, and it remains true today. Competition does not
scare Woods, it inspires him. When May opened the door by missing
his crucial 4-foot birdie attempt at No. 15, Woods sensed an
opening and seized it.
</P>
<P>
   So Woods added to his lore, becoming the first player to win
four out of five majors, and only the second to win three
professional majors in one year, matching Ben Hogan's feat from
1953. By dueling into a playoff, Woods and May made the PGA
Championship the most dramatic of the year's four majors.
</P>
<P>
   Watching Woods dominate at Pebble Beach and St. Andrews was
compelling in its own right because nobody had ever seen anything
quite like it. But at those two events, it became obvious that
Woods would win. There was not the heart-pounding excitement that
Sunday's final round contained, when people were afraid to turn
away, fearful they might miss a dramatic shot.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere at Valhalla Golf Club was electric, with people
in the gallery screaming for both players. Television viewers tuned
in and could not turn it off. It was another great moment for golf,
and once again, Woods was the focal point. With Woods still only 24
years old, there should be many great moments to come.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever he does the rest of year is gravy. The majors are over,
and there is no doubt who will win the money title or the Player of
the Year award. For Woods, the next great achievement could come
next year at Augusta, where he will try to win the Masters and
become the first player to win four consecutive professional
majors, the consecutive Grand Slam, if you will.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, it would be wise to appreciate what Woods has done
over the past 12 months. Even he may never enjoy another run like
that. By finding a way to win Sunday, Woods proved again that both
his skill and his will are enormous. &QL;

PATAKI SIGNS LAW ON ALERTS FOR PESTICIDES
</HEADLINE>
 By KIRK JOHNSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Gov. George Pataki signed on Monday what experts
called the nation's most stringent notification procedures for the
use of pesticides by private companies, schools and individuals.
</P>
<P>
   The law promises to affect everyone from the parents of
preschool children, who will get written notices 48 hours in
advance of pesticide use at day care centers, to fans of weed-free
lawns, who could be required to post a notice every time they go to
battle with their crab grass.
</P>
<P>
   The outbreak of the mosquito-borne West Nile virus in the New
York region, and concerns about the methods used to battle it,
provided a backdrop for the passage of the law, even though this
law would not be binding on local governments, legislators and
environmentalists said.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Neighbor Notification Law, as the new measure is
called, covers all manner of chemical pesticides, from those used
against insects to garden-variety weed killers, but leaves it up to
each county to decide whether to adopt the most stringent
provisions, including a requirement that lawn care companies and
other commercial pesticide users notify all residents in advance of
pesticide use in their neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Other parts of the law would affect the entire state, including
the requirement that every public school give parents lists of
pesticides used on school grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Under New York's law, individual counties can require pesticide
users to give 48 hours written notice to properties within 150 feet
of an area being treated with a pesticide, although granular
pesticides _ which are too large to be carried by the wind _ would
be exempted. Counties could require homeowners to post notices on
their properties whenever a pesticide had been applied. Because
local governments are exempt from the notice requirements, the law
would not have any effect on efforts against the mosquitoes that
carry West Nile virus, although most counties have been notifying
residents in advance about spraying.

BOTTLERS COMBINE WITH WHITMAN PURCHASE OF PEPSIAMERICAS
</HEADLINE>
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Furthering a consolidation among bottlers of Pepsico beverages,
the Whitman Corp. said Monday that it had agreed to acquire
PepsiAmericas Inc. for about $331.7 million in cash and stock.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the transaction, Whitman will pay $3.80 a
share in cash and stock. In addition, it will assume $330 million
in PepsiAmericas debt.
</P>
<P>
   The deal unites the second- and third-largest Pepsi bottlers in
the United States. Executives at Whitman said the combined company
would have 20 percent to 21 percent of the market for Pepsi
products.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsi's largest bottler, the Pepsi Bottling Group, has about 55
percent of the market.
</P>
<P>
   Last year PepsiCo, which owns about 40 percent of Whitman's
outstanding common stock, transferred several of its bottling
franchises to Whitman. The transfer came just before the Pepsi
Bottling Group went public.
</P>
<P>
   ``The merger is a giant step forward in the consolidation of our
business, which will translate into greater efficiencies and
increase the likelihood that we will participate in other deals,''
Bruce Chelberg, Whitman's chief executive, said in a teleconference
with reporters Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Chelberg, who is 66, will step down once the transaction is
completed, Whitman said. He will be succeeded by Robert Pohlad, 46,
PepsiAmericas' chairman and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consolidation makes sense in terms of increased scale, but the
key point is that the deal solves the management issue at
Whitman,'' said Bill Pecoriello, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein
&AMP; Co. `` Pohlad is well respected within the industry. And Whitman
will build its management bench'' with PepsiAmericas executives.
</P>
<P>
   Based in Minneapolis, PepsiAmericas does business in nine
states, many in the South, and in Puerto Rico. The company has
annual sales of about $576 million.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is publicly traded, 70 percent of PepsiAmericas
shares are owned by Dakota Holdings LLC, a private enterprise
controlled by the Pohlad family.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman, which operates from headquarters in Rolling Meadows,
Ill., produces and distributes Pepsi products in 10 central states
as well as a number of foreign countries, including Poland, Hungary
and the Czech Republic. Whitman has revenue of about $2.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``PepsiAmericas is not a huge company, but it is very well
located relative to Whitman,'' said George Thompson, an analyst at
Prudential Securities. ``The deal not only allows Whitman to
increase its leverage with big food retailers, but puts the company
in a position where they are the only game in town in that
territory.''
</P>
<P>
   Consolidation among supermarket chains is a big reason both
Coca-Cola and Pepsi have been seeking to cut the number of local
bottlers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are lots and lots of very small bottlers still out
there,'' said John D. Sicher, publisher of Beverage Digest, an
industry newsletter. ``Consolidation among both Coke and Pepsi
bottlers slowed down in the last year, but I would anticipate that
it will pick up over the next two to three years.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Whitman and PepsiAmericas together employ 14,700
people.
</P>
<P>
   Company executives spoke generally yesterday about anticipated
cost savings as a result of the merger, but declined to talk about
specific cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are synergies in this combination,'' Pohlad said, ``but
the focus of this merger is on accelerating growth.''
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange on Monday, Whitman shares closed
at $14.13, up 38 cents a share. Shares of PepsiAmericas fell 81
cents, to $3.94 a share.

FENCING SISTERS GLAD TO BE COMPETING TOGETHER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICH HAMMOND  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Iris Zimmermann dreamed about the possibility for
four years, the thought that she might one day walk into Sydney's
Olympic Stadium, stride for stride next to her older sister,
Felicia.
</P>
<P>
   So whatever happens later this month, whether the U.S. women's
foil team wins an unexpected fencing medal or not, the Zimmermann
sisters will shed no tears of sadness or regret. Each one's dream
will have already come true, simply because of the presence of the
other.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is so awesome,'' 19-year-old Iris Zimmermann said.
``(Felicia) is my role model, sister, best friend in the world,
confidant, psychologist and shopping partner. It is just so
wonderful that she and I are able to share this experience
together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Felicia is the closest thing to me on this earth, and it is so
amazing that we are going to Sydney together. I can't ask for much
more than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is probably for the best, since America's chances of
winning a medal in any of the eight fencing categories are slim, at
best. No American has medaled in fencing since Peter Westbrook's
sabre bronze in 1984, which broke a 24-year U.S. medal drought.
</P>
<P>
   No American individual is ranked in the top five in the World
Cup rankings, which means that the Zimmermann sisters and Ann
Marsh, the three athletes who make up the women's foil team, have
the best shot at a medal in Sydney. The team earned an Olympic
berth by finishing seventh in the 1999 World Championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are really excited about our prospects as a team,'' Felicia
Zimmermann said. ``We are a very dangerous team to many countries
because of our mental toughness and physical strength. I don't
think we need to win a medal to feel successful. I feel that as
long as we prepare and do our thing, we will be ready for anyone
and everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   The team certainly doesn't lack for camaraderie, or experience.
Marsh, 29, is one of Felicia Zimmermann's best friends. The two
women were Olympic teammates four years ago in Atlanta and Marsh,
who also works in a hospital emergency room in Buffalo, N.Y., also
competed in the 1992 Games.
</P>
<P>
   Felicia Zimmermann, 25, is a recent graduate of Stanford, where
she won three NCAA Division I fencing championships. It is a legacy
she now hands over to her sister. Iris has already reached the
semifinals of the World Championships, a feat she accomplished in
1999, and is delaying the start of her sophomore year at Stanford
because of the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, I have to say there are no words to describe what I
feel about representing my country at the Olympic Games,'' Iris
Zimmerman said. ``I am so overwhelmed when I take time to step back
and check out my accomplishments that I just break down in tears.''
</P>
<P>
   The two sisters, six years apart, grew up in Rochester, N.Y.,
where they still train, and have become better friends over the
past few years. The Olympic experience is special enough, but the
joy of being accompanied by a sibling is unmatched, according to
the sisters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always knew that being on the Olympic team together was in
the future for us,'' Iris Zimmerman said. ``My sister and I have
gotten closer over the years since I have been getting older and
experiencing more of the things she has experienced.''
</P>
<P>
   And now comes the ultimate in shared experiences, medal or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love having my sister with me at this Olympics,'' Felicia
Zimmermann said. ``She brings so much to the team and we are a
package when it comes to fencing. We work well together, pushing
each other and supporting each other. It is really special to be
with her.''

CLINTON SIDESTEPS RACE THAT HAS STIRRED TENSIONS
</HEADLINE>
  By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PURCHASE, N.Y. _ Steering clear of a political struggle that has
stirred ethnic tensions in New York's Democratic Party, Hillary
Rodham Clinton declined Monday to offer her backing for Rep. Eliot
Engel, a five-term Bronx Democrat who is facing a September primary
challenge orchestrated by black and Hispanic leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not getting involved in that campaign,'' Clinton said at
a news conference in Yonkers, as Engel stood, stiff and
expressionless, at her side. ``This is a local situation. I'm not
going to have anything to say about that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I count both of them as friends, and I'm not going to become,
you know, involved one way or another,'' said Clinton, the
Democratic candidate for senator.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's statement was in keeping with a general policy of her
campaign not to take sides in any primaries, even ones that involve
incumbents.
</P>
<P>
   This congressional contest has drawn unusual attention since
Roberto Ramirez, the Bronx Democratic leader, who is also a senior
Hispanic leader in New York, announced that he was withdrawing his
support for Engel, who is Jewish, and endorsing Larry W. Seabrook,
a state senator who is black.
</P>
<P>
   A number of Engel's supporters and some Jewish newspapers have
assailed Ramirez's decision as a stark attempt to increase the
power of black and Hispanic leaders. Ramirez disputed that Monday,
saying his decision was based on what he described as Engel's
lackluster performance in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Engel, who appeared with Clinton at two campaign stops in lower
Westchester on Monday, said he was not surprised by Clinton's
statement, though he made no effort to hide his disappointment.
``I'm told that she's not endorsing any race in a contested
primary,'' he said. ``If it was solely my race, I would be more
upset about it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Engel said that Clinton's decision to sit out this struggle
was likely to complicate her already unsteady position with some
Jewish voters. ``She has a lot of convincing to do in the Jewish
community, and frankly, I think the fact that she's staying neutral
isn't helping her,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton discussed Engel's primary challenge on a day in which
she campaigned through Yonkers, before coming here Monday evening
to be the host of a fund-raiser on behalf of the Westchester
Coalition for Legal Abortion. At both stops in Yonkers, she
reprised her attacks her on opponent, Rep. Rick Lazio, for his
support of Republican positions backing large tax cuts and against
strict regulation of HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spent Sunday night at her home in Chappaqua with
President Clinton and, for the first time, she said, with their
dog, Buddy.
</P>
<P>
   She expressed particular delight Monday morning at being at
Sunnyside Manor, a community center for the elderly by the Hudson
River in Yonkers. ``What a well-named, place: Sunnyside!'' she
enthused. ``Look at all these faces; it makes me feel so sunny!''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's attempts to avoid a discussion about Engel's campaign,
one of the more complicated ethnic situations on New York's
political landscape this year, suggests the experience the first
lady has gained since she came to New York more than a year ago,
when she found herself ensnared in a number of only-in-New-York
ethnic political disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has appeared at public events with Seabrook and Engel,
in a concerted attempt, her aides said, to appear to be evenhanded.
Several Democrats said that Clinton would be particularly well
advised not to take sides between Ramirez, the powerful Bronx
leader and one of the most influential Hispanics in New York, and
Engel.
</P>
<P>
   And Ramirez applauded Clinton's decision to stay out of the
race, and said his own abandonment of Engel, whom he had supported
before, reflected his conclusion that he was an ``absentee
congressman'' who had lost interest in the concerns of Bronx
residents. He chastised Engel for even complaining about the turn
of events.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eliot Engel ought to stop that nonsense,'' he said. ``Take a
chill pill. Relax. It's just a primary.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Clinton's decision was not without risks. Engel's case
has raised concern among a number of Jewish leaders, some of whom
have already been less than full-throated in their support of
Clinton's campaign. For his part, Engel placed the blame not on
Clinton but on Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   ``I accept that is the position that she's taken,'' Engel said.
``Let's face it: Robert Ramirez has browbeaten the world and
threatened the world and this is the kind of boss-laded politics he
runs in the Bronx. Everyone is afraid of him.''  &QL;

HILL REQUIRES NO ALTERATIONS   TO FIT INTO YANKEES' LINEUP 
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Glenallen Hill squeezed his shoulders through the
doors to the press room the other day, striding steadily along a
shortcut to the home clubhouse at Yankee Stadium. A picture hanging
on the wall seized his imagination and he stopped suddenly. ``Look
at that,'' he said. ``Look at those arms.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a black-and-white picture of a Yankee hitter, his face
contorted at the end of a massive swing, his pinstriped jersey
barely restraining the muscles of his shoulders and biceps. Hill
was fascinated. ``That's amazing,'' Hill said. ``Who is that?''
</P>
<P>
   The picture is of Mickey Mantle, a long-reigning heir to the
Yankees' heritage of power hitters, a tradition Hill is embracing.
He hit his 11th home run in his 18-game Yankee career Monday, a
12-3 blowout against Texas. Orlando Hernandez won for the first
time since July 7, surrendering six hits and three runs over seven
innings.
</P>
<P>
   All five of the Yankees' starters have now contributed solid
outings in the last trip through the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Posada ripped a two-run homer and drove in four runs, and
Clay Bellinger contributed three hits. Bellinger has reached base
in his last seven plate appearances.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees played without Bernie Williams, who has a strain in
the right side of his rib cage, but who might return Wednesday .
They were also without David Justice, a late scratch from the
starting lineup because of stiffness in his neck.
</P>
<P>
   In their absence, Hill, the designated hitter, slid into the
cleanup spot naturally, and by the time he chipped in with his two
hits, the Yankees' rout of Brian Sikorski was well under way.
Sikorski had shut out the Yankees for seven innings last week, and
after the right-hander held them scoreless in the first two innings
Monday, Manager Joe Torre loudly chided his players in the dugout
for swinging at bad pitches. By forcing Sikorski to throw 41
pitches in the third inning, the Yankees scored six runs.
</P>
<P>
   Hill batted in the fourth inning and ripped a line drive toward
left, where the Rangers' Rusty Greer _ one of the best fielders at
his position _ moved to cut off the ball. But Hill's liner, moving
much faster than Greer thought, got past him, allowing Paul O'Neill
to score.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill was on first again for Hill's next at-bat, in the sixth,
and Hill laced another line drive, this one carrying over the
left-field fence. While Hill jogged around the bases, the small
afternoon crowd roaring, the batboy, John Viola, retrieved Hill's
bat and noticed a deep crack in the handle, just above the place
where Hill places his hands.
</P>
<P>
   Hill had broken his bat and still hit the ball about 420 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Viola showed Hill the crack when he returned to the dugout, and
the bat was examined by teammates. ``That just shows you how strong
his wrists are,'' Viola, 17, said.
</P>
<P>
   Torre joked: ``I said to him, `It was easy; with your hands you
were able to hold the bat together.' It's amazing what he's done.
It's fun to watch on our side because if you make a mistake, he's
going to hit it hard.''
</P>
<P>
   First baseman Tino Martinez said: ``He's obviously a strong guy.
He's got a short, compact swing. He's not overswinging; he's short
and compact to the ball, and he's hitting it hard. Even when he
strikes out, he's taking good swings.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill has been with the Yankees for less than a month and he is
already known to his teammates as something of an eccentric
personality. He plays music loudly _ ``all kinds,'' Derek Jeter
said _ and speaks softly. He wears eye black for both night and day
games. He dresses elegantly, but swings his bat viciously, quickly,
powerfully. ``Like Muhammad Ali's left jab,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, there are ways to get Hill out. He came into the
2000 season with a .271 career batting average, striking out often,
once for every 4.5 at-bats. If he gets behind in the count, Hill
inspires opposing pitchers to throw breaking balls down and away,
or fastballs high and inside to finish him off.
</P>
<P>
   But Hill, 35, is batting .446, with four doubles and 11 homers
in 56 at-bats. His slugging percentage is 1.107. ``I don't know _ I
don't want to jinx it,'' Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   He swings hard and is hitting everything very hard; this is not
a fluke, Martinez said.
</P>
<P>
   Hill's explosion is reminiscent of Shane Spencer's run at the
end of the 1998 season, when he bashed 10 homers in 67
regular-season at-bats and added a couple more in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a lot stronger than Shane is,'' Martinez said of Hill.
``He can hit the ball out anywhere in the ballpark. When he hits
the ball hard, it's going out. It doesn't matter where. Shane
turned on his a lot. This guy is hitting them out to right field,
left field, center. This guy is just ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez often follows Hill in the lineup. ``It's definitely
fun,'' he said, smiling. ``But it makes me feel like a Little
Leaguer after a while.'' &QL;

CANADIAN TELECOM BIDS TO BECOME COUNTRY'S BIGGEST WIRELESS
NETWORK 
</HEADLINE>
   By TIMOTHY PRITCHARD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Telus Corp., the largest telecommunications company in
Western Canada, made a brash move to become the country's biggest
wireless telephone network Monday with an offer worth $3.12 billion
for Clearnet Communications Inc. of Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   The takeover would greatly accelerate the expansion of Telus and
pose a competitive challenge to two other big Canadian
telecommunications providers, the Bell Mobility division of
Montreal-based Bell Canada, the country's largest
telecommunications company, and Rogers AT&AMP;T Canada, a unit of
Rogers Communications Inc. based in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Like other wireless phone companies around the world, the
Canadian competitors are scrambling to gain geographic reach,
partly in anticipation of a boom in demand for Internet services
accessibly by wireless networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wireless and Internet applications are the two fastest-growing
areas in telecommunications,'' said Darren Entwistle, president and
chief executive of Telus, based in Burnaby, British Columbia. ``Our
objective is to become the Canadian leader of this market.`
</P>
<P>
   Michael Cant, an analyst at Renaissance Strategies in Waltham,
Mass., said Telus had strengthened its hand by moving quickly to
gain a national wireless network. But he also expressed caution
that with so many wireless networks under construction around the
world, companies like Telus may find themselves in tough
competition with new marketers who are able to buy capacity at
inexpensive rates.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders of Clearnet have been offered 70 Canadian dollars,
$47.18, in cash, or 1.636 of a Telus nonvoting share for their
stock. The total offer amounts to about 4.6 billion Canadian
dollars, about $3.12 billion at Monday's exchange rates. Telus will
also assume Clearnet's debt of 2 billion Canadian dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The offer has been endorsed by the boards of both companies.
</P>
<P>
   The offering price is a 53 percent premium to Friday's closing
price of 45.80 Canadian dollars on the Toronto Stock Exchange. In
trading Monday, Clearnet shares surged 42 percent to 64.95 Canadian
dollars, $44.05, still below the 70 Canadian dollar per share
offer. Telus shares fell 10 percent to close at 40.05 Canadian
dollars in Toronto, $27.16.
</P>
<P>
   Telus said the offer, which requires shareholder and regulatory
approval, is expected to be completed by October. George Cope,
president and chief executive of Clearnet, would head Telus'
wireless division.
</P>
<P>
   Clearnet shareholders would own 18.5 percent of Telus under the
deal. Shareholders with 86 percent of the voting stock and more
than 30 percent of total equity shareholders have agreed to the
bid, including the family of founder David Simmonds, Nextel
Communications Inc. of Reston, Va., and Motorola Canada Ltd. of
Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   While Motorola may sell its shares after a one-year holding
period expires, Nextel may remain as a strategic investor. Through
Nextel, Clearnet links its Canadian wireless customers with the
United States, just as Verizon Communications' network in the
United States ties in with Telus.
</P>
<P>
   Previously based in Edmonton, Alberta, Telus was owned by the
provincial government and called the Alberta Government Telephones
Commission before it was privatized in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Clearnet was formed in 1984 and has raised more than 3.2 billion
Canadian dollars _ $2.17 billion _ to build two digital networks _
Clearnet PCS and Mike, which integrates PCS phone service with
two-way radio, data and other communications services for
businesses. With Clearnet, Telus avoids having to build its own
cross-country wireless network, and it will become a national
competitor three years earlier than many had expected.
</P>
<P>
   The combined company will have 26,000 employees and revenue of
6.5 billion Canadian dollars _ $4.41 billion _ a quarter of it from
the mobile phone operation.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Herbert Scheftel, an investor in real estate and
television stations, died on Wednesday in New York. Scheftel, who
lived in New York and had residences in East Hampton and Le
Touquet, France, was 92.
</P>
<P>
   The best-known real estate project Scheftel was involved in,
along with his brother, Stuart, and another partner, Alfred G.
Burger, was the Pan Am building, now headquarters of the MetLife
insurance company, which was built behind Grand Central Terminal on
Park Avenue in 1963. The Pan Am project also involved Erwin S.
Wolfson, who owned a contracting company, and several British
investors. At one point, Grand Central City, as it was called, was
to have had several theaters, an exhibition hall and an open-air
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Among Scheftel's other real estate investments were the
Beresford and San Remo apartment buildings in New York, and the
Mark Hopkins Hotel in San Francisco. He also had ownership
interests in three television stations and six cable television
stations in Connecticut, Illinois and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   In 1931, Scheftel graduated from Baillol College of Oxford
University with a combined bachelor's and master's degree in
politics, economics and history. During World War II, he rose to
the rank of major in the 64th Fighter Wing of the U.S. Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   Scheftel and his first wife, Agnes Mary, who died in 1970, were
active in several charitable organizations, including Greenwich
House, a settlement house in New York. He has been a director of
Greenwich House, where he concentrated on children's services,
since 1938, and he was the president of the organization from 1954
to 1960.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, Yolande, Scheftel is survived by his
daughters, Francoise Fielding of San Franciso and Cynthia
Fielding-Singh of Tucson, Ariz.; his niece, Susan Scheftel of New
York; four grandchildren and a great-niece and nephew.

 &HT;    Dancer cuts plea deal, will tell of sex with celebrities for
money
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - Federal prosecutors now have a potential star witness
in the racketeering case involving the Gold Club _ a dancer who
admits to being paid for having sex with professional athletes and
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Jana Pelnis, a Gold Club stripper, pleaded guilty Friday to
reduced charges in return for her cooperation against fellow
defendants, including club owner Steve Kaplan, according to court
documents unsealed Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan and 14 co-defendants had maintained a united front since
the case was first indicted in November. But Pelnis becomes the
first employee of the Buckhead club to plead guilty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never ceases to amaze me what people will say to get
themselves out of trouble,'' said Atlanta lawyer Steve Sadow, who
represents Kaplan. ``On many occasions, even up to today, she has
indicated that Steve Kaplan was not involved in any wrongdoing.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadow promised to produce several witnesses to discredit Pelnis'
allegations. ``This will not simply be her word against his word,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Gold Club trial is tentatively set for February. In a
sweeping federal indictment, Kaplan and other club officials are
charged with illegal ties to organized crime, money laundering,
credit card fraud, police corruption and prostitution. Prosecutors
have said Kaplan paid his dancers to provide sexual favors to
celebrity and high-roller customers to give the club a high
profile.
</P>
<P>
   Federal authorities have been investigating the club, at
Piedmont Road and Lindbergh Drive, since 1996. The indictment
alleges that Gold Club management provided dancers to have sex with
celebrity customers at the club and Atlanta hotels and flew the
dancers to the 1999 Super Bowl in Miami and to Las Vegas,
Minneapolis and Charleston, S.C., for prostitution.
</P>
<P>
   Pelnis is one of two dancers charged in the case, along with two
Atlanta police officers and two Delta Air Lines employees. Former
floor manager Jeffrey Johnson also is cooperating and is expected
to enter a guilty plea, prosecutors say.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing before U.S. District Judge Willis Hunt, Pelnis, 28,
said she is pregnant with her first child. She pleaded guilty to
aiding a racketeering conspiracy, which carries a maximum sentence
of five years in prison. But Pelnis, in return for her cooperation,
could receive a possible misdemeanor sentence of less than one
year.
</P>
<P>
   During the hearing, Assistant U.S. Attorney Art Leach outlined
to Hunt what he expects Pelnis to say when she takes the witness
stand.
</P>
<P>
   With Hunt's permission, Leach kept under seal the names of
athletes and high-roller customers who allegedly had sex with club
dancers.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Leach only referred to them by their initialsamous
individuals and it will obviously sensationalize this situation if
these names behind the initials were to become public.''
</P>
<P>
   One athlete from out of town, Leach said, came to the Gold Club
in Atlanta and was taken to a Gold Room where there was another
athlete ``and there was a variety of sexual activity that was going
on in the room.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan then asked Pelnis to enter the room and she engaged in
sex with an athlete, Leach said.
</P>
<P>
   That athlete ''ended up providing (Pelnis) some funds after that
and it was clear that Kaplan remained throughout much of the sexual
activity that was occuring in the room,'' Leach told the judge. He
added that he believed that Kaplan paid Pelnis money as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I accurate on that?'' Leach asked the dancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' she replied.
</P>
<P>
   On another occasion in the Gold Club, Leach said, Pelnis and
another dancer engaged in sex with an athlete. While this went on,
Kaplan was ``in and out of the room,'' the prosecutor said.
</P>
<P>
   When the sexual activity was finished, Kaplan directed that the
room be cleared because he wanted to meet with all of the
entertainers and waitresses who had been in the room, Leach said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He asked everyone present if they were treated all right,''
Leach said. ``Everyone responded that they were.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan soon arranged for these women to be paid, Leach said,
stating this is what Pelnis is expected to testify on the witness
stand.

LAND GRAB: INVESTORS SEEK SOLID GROUND IN REAL-ESTATE
INVESTMENT  TRUSTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ARTHUR M. LOUIS  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;   &LR; They're baaaaaack!
</P>
<P>
   Remember real-estate investment trusts, those high-flying
stock-market darlings of 1996 and 1997?
</P>
<P>
   If you do, then you must also remember that their stocks went
into a harrowing 28 percent decline during 1998 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Today, REITs _ closed-end funds that own real estate rather than
securities _ are hot again.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, they are hotter than almost any other type of stock.
They have risen 22.4 percent this year _ as measured by the Morgan
Stanley real estate investment trust index _ and have recovered
virtually all the ground they lost in the two previous years.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index is up 1.5 percent
for the year, while the Dow Jones industrial average and the Nasdaq
composite index are down roughly 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   REITs have become a fad again in great part because the nation's
real-estate markets are booming.
</P>
<P>
   A voracious demand for space in industrial, office and apartment
buildings _ especially along the East and West coasts _ has pushed
rentals and property values sky-high.
</P>
<P>
   REITs also are benefiting from the backlash against technology
and Internet stocks that began in March. Many investors have grown
wary of companies that are heavy on hype but light on earnings and
are attracted to the steady and reliable earnings growth and the
generous dividends available from REITs.
</P>
<P>
   Through all the stock market's ups and downs, the real-estate
industry has been faring quite well, notes Bill Schaff, manager of
the Undiscovered Managers REIT Fund.
</P>
<P>
   The REITs have averaged strong, 10 percent annual gains in their
flow of funds from operations _ the customary measure of their
earnings power. (Flow of funds from operations _ known in the
industry as FFO _ consists of earnings plus depreciation.)
</P>
<P>
   Lately, the industry's growth appears to be accelerating, says
Jay P. Leupp, an analyst with Robertson Stephens in San Francisco.
He figures that FFO will increase by 11 percent to 13 percent per
year during the next year or two.
</P>
<P>
   Couple that with the average REIT dividend _ amounting to 7
percent of the share price _ and you have what Leupp calls ``a
magnet for investors.''
</P>
<P>
   The second-quarter earnings reports of most REITs have been
``just stellar,'' Leupp remarks. ``The average REIT is running
about 2 percent ahead of expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   With REITs hot again, should investors worry about another
cooling-off period just ahead?
</P>
<P>
   Not necessarily.
</P>
<P>
   At their peak in late 1997, REITs were selling at an average of
20 percent above their net asset values _ the per-share value of
their real-estate holdings, minus any debt.
</P>
<P>
   That, in retrospect, was too good to last. By the time they hit
bottom in December, they were selling at 25 percent to 30 percent
below net asset value.
</P>
<P>
   Today, even after this year's strong surge, REITs typically
trade at a discount of 5 percent to 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are still a good buy,'' says Ken Rosen, a widely
respected real-estate expert and portfolio manager in Berkeley.
``They will do very well unless we begin to see signs of
overbuilding _ and right now there are no signs of overbuilding.''
</P>
<P>
   Some kinds of REITs seem more attractive than others.
</P>
<P>
   Those that specialize in office buildings, apartments and
industrial buildings are riding high in these economically buoyant
times. Such prominent REITs as Equity Office Properties, Archstone
Communities and AMB Property fit in those categories.
</P>
<P>
   The stocks of REITs that specialize in malls, shopping centers
and other retail properties have performed worse than other types
of REITs. Analysts attribute this to investor concerns about
competition from Internet retailers.
</P>
<P>
   The stock of Simon Property Group, the biggest shopping-mall
REIT, has gained less than 5 percent since the end of last year.
Another leading mall REIT, Mills Corp., is actually down slightly
for the year.
</P>
<P>
   However, Leupp points out that Mills could be an attractive buy
if only because of its extraordinarily high dividend yield _ a
juicy 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   While there is no doubt that the Internet is cutting into the
amount of shopping done at malls, experts say most malls are doing
well enough and are not threatened with extinction.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is the perception that the big malls won't grow as fast,
which is true,'' says Schaff. ``But there will be a place for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Leupp says the proliferation of successful Internet retailers
actually could be good for the malls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most e-tailers are realizing that they need to have some kind
of bricks-and-mortar presence as part of their operating
strategy,'' he observes. ``The REITs are perfectly positioned to
fulfill that role.''

POSSIBLE CONFLICT OF INTEREST PERPLEXES OFFICIALS 
</HEADLINE>
   By TODD WALLACK  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ State officials were scrambling yesterday to
determine whether a public utility commissioner should be
sanctioned for investing $10,000 in a cellular phone company his
agency regulates.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Attorney General Bill Lockyer said his office
is still trying to determine whether it should get involved. And
Peter Arth, chief lawyer for the Public Utilities Commission, said
the other PUC commissioners haven't decided yet whether they should
investigate the apparent conflict of interest or refer it to
Lockyer.
</P>
<P>
   The state's Public Utilities Code specifically bars
commissioners from investing in companies the agency regulates,
including wireless firms.
</P>
<P>
   But the law is vague over what the penalty is for someone who
violates the rule and who should enforce it.
</P>
<P>
   John Symkowick, a spokesman for the Fair Political Practices
Commission, said his agency would have the power to investigate if
the matter violates the state's more general conflict of interest
rules. Symkowick declined to say whether the commission will
investigate.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in a statement yesterday, PUC Commissioner Henry
Duque said he immediately sold his shares in Nextel Communications
after he was advised it was an ``apparent conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have taken, and am taking, appropriate action,'' Duque said
in a statement issued late yesterday. Duque bought the stock in May
1999, but said he didn't realize it could be perceived as a
conflict until a Chronicle reporter asked him about it on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In the statement, Duque said he didn't believe there was a
conflict of interest because the PUC has never set rates for Nextel
and the company largely falls under jurisdiction of the Federal
Communications Commission. Duque also noted that he included the
investment in his financial disclosure forms.
</P>
<P>
   Arth said PUC officials normally do not review the completed
forms.
</P>
<P>
   Duque's Nextel investment, first reported in The Chronicle
yesterday, drew mixed reactions.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Carl Wood called it an honest mistake. ``I think
it's unfortunate that such a big deal is being made over what, if
anything, is an oversight.''
</P>
<P>
   But consumer advocates considered the error serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think (Duque's) statement recognizes the reality of
what has occurred,'' said Robert Gnaizda, general counsel for the
Greenling Institute, a San Francisco consumer group. ``A
commissioner has a position at least of equal importance to a U.S.
or California Supreme Court justice, and therefore appearance is
almost everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Some observers even went so far on Sunday as to urge Duque to
resign. Still, even liberal watchdog groups, who often disagree
strongly with Duque's conservative voting record, called him honest
and a straight shooter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he (violated the rules) deliberately,'' Gnaizda
said.
</P>
<P>
   The topic didn't come up at all in a PUC meeting yesterday. PUC
President Loretta Lynch said yesterday afternoon that she hadn't
had time to talk with anyone about the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates also expressed concern that Duque and Wood
accepted two-week European tours _ described as educational _ in
the past few years that were paid for by the California Foundation
on the Environment and the Economy. The group receives much of its
funding from utilities and related corporations, including Sempra
Energy, parent of San Diego Gas and Electric, and Chevron.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it always creates the appearance of public officials
being given something by the industry which undermines public
confidence,'' said Jocelyn Larkin, chairman of California Common
Cause.
</P>
<P>
   Although the trips were legal, some critics said they thought
they raised the appearance of a conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
   Duque accepted a $7,849 trip to England, Sweden and Eastern
Europe in late March and early April of 1996. Wood went on a $9,060
excursion to Ireland, Germany and Spain. Many legislators also went
on the trip.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation's chairman, Donald Vial, a former PUC president,
said the trips are important for educating state officials.
</P>
<P>
   On the 1996 trip, for instance, California lawmakers got an
on-site look at energy deregulation in Europe. He said the group is
a nonprofit charity and doesn't support any particular position. He
said it receives money from so many different companies that it is
independent of any one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Wood said his trip was a wonderful opportunity to get to know
state legislators.
</P>
<P>
   But staffers at Greenlining and The Utility Reform Network said
they thought the group was too closely tied to industry. ``I doubt
the educational viewpoint they get out of these trips,'' said
Regina Costa of TURN, a San Francisco consumer group.

ADS PROMOTE BUSH'S EDUCATION AGENDA
</HEADLINE>
   (With BUSH-IMPACT-AID) 
 By ADAM CLYMER  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Republican presidential campaign of Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas and Dick Cheney began showing two new commercials in 21
states Monday. One deals with Bush's education proposals and the
other declares that now is the time to deal with ``tough
problems,'' such as Social Security, declining moral values and
education.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCER: Maverick Media for both
</P>
<P>
   `EDUCATION AGENDA'
</P>
<P>
   ON THE SCREEN
</P>
<P>
   Bush accepting the Republican presidential nomination. Children
running in a school hallway. Bush again. Then four quick cuts,
showing alphabet blocks, children reading and other school scenes,
followed by another scene of Bush from the GOP convention.
</P>
<P>
   THE SCRIPT
</P>
<P>
   Bush: ``Seven out of 10 fourth-graders in our highest poverty
schools cannot read a simple children's book. Millions are trapped
in schools where violence is common and learning is rare.''
</P>
<P>
   Announcer (as school scenes shift): ``The Bush education agenda:
Reform Head Start, focus on reading, restore local control, triple
funding for character education, hold schools accountable for
results.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush: ``Now is the time to teach all our children to read, and
renew the promise of America's public schools.''
</P>
<P>
   `HARD THINGS'
</P>
<P>
   ON THE SCREEN
</P>
<P>
   Bush, in a sport shirt, talking to the camera. Then, as he
discusses problems, pictures of a classroom, of elderly women
singing around a piano with trophies on it, of a black woman and of
a teen-age girl in a shot that widens to include a teen-age boy.
Then Bush again.
</P>
<P>
   THE SCRIPT
</P>
<P>
   Bush: ``This is a moment in history when we have a chance to
focus on tough problems. It's not always popular to say `Our
children can't read' or `Social Security needs improving' or `We
have a budget surplus and a deficit in values.' But those are the
right things to say. And the right way to make America better for
everyone is to be bold and decisive, to unite instead of divide.
Now is the time to do the hard things.''
</P>
<P>
   ACCURACY
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the assertion about reading levels in schools in the
poorest neighborhoods, which is based on a federal Department of
Education study, neither advertisement includes factual statements
that could be either accurate or inaccurate. Bush has indeed made
the education proposals that his commercial cites.
</P>
<P>
   SCORE CARD
</P>
<P>
   The education commercial is intended to re-emphasize one of
Bush's political strengths: the impression that he cares deeply
about education, long a Democratic strong point.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Hard Things'' commercial is intended to underline an
argument made in his acceptance speech that the Clinton
administration squandered the opportunity presented by economic
prosperity to solve major problems. And its call ``to unite instead
of divide'' seeks to imply that the Gore campaign is divisive and
negative. That was a Bush strength after the Republican convention,
but a CBS News Poll released on Monday shows that more people now
say Bush, not Gore, is spending more time on the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Other advertisements for Bush are available from The New York
Times on the Web: www.nytimes.com/politics

BUSH BACKS SCHOOL PLAN OPPOSED BY EVERY PRESIDENT SINCE TRUMAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Wis.)  (With BUSH-AD-BOX) 
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Fifty years ago next month, on Sept. 23, 1950,
President Harry S. Truman signed legislation to provide federal
money to schools overcrowded by the children of federal workers and
military personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Every president since then has tried to abolish the program or
at least cut it to the bone. And every one has failed.
</P>
<P>
   They failed because every senator and most representatives in
Congress have schools in their districts that receive money under
the program, called impact aid, and have not been willing to let
the program die.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. In a speech in Milwaukee
on Monday to the Veterans of Foreign Wars, Bush proposed adding
$310 million to the impact aid program, increasing the budget by
more than a third.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our men and women in service put their lives on the line to
defend our freedom,'' Bush said. ``We have a special obligation to
rebuild the schools that educate their children. As president, I
will ensure that this obligation is met.
</P>
<P>
   ``This funding means that thousands of students who are
dependents of military personnel and attend public schools located
near or on military facilities around the country will learn in
better school environments.''
</P>
<P>
   The justification for the program has always been that school
districts need compensation because the children of federal workers
and people who work on military bases attend public schools that
are supported by property taxes, but the federal government does
not pay local taxes.
</P>
<P>
   That may have posed a burden in Truman's day. But for decades,
budget experts have put the impact aid program in the same category
as federal subsidies for the producers of honey and mohair: relics
of the past that exist entirely because of pork barrel politics.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus of authorities who have studied the matter is that
parents who work for the federal government today more than pay
their own way. Most of the parents nowadays live in the community,
pay property taxes and state and local sales and income taxes, and
contribute to the local economy by buying goods and services.
</P>
<P>
   And military bases must be an economic boon to communities or
they would not fight so hard to keep them when base-closings are
threatened.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas M. Corwin, the acting deputy assistant secretary for
elementary and secondary education, said Monday that over the
years, some presidential candidates have been more eager than
others to do away with the program. But Corwin said he could not
think of a single one before Bush who proposed expanding it.

THE PROS SEEM TO BE LOSING THE STOCK PICKING WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   By ARTHUR M. LOUIS  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: What percentage of U.S. stocks are owned by mutual funds? By
individuals? By institutions other than funds?
</P>
<P>
   A: A Federal Reserve report for the third quarter of last year
indicates that mutual funds owned $2.7 trillion of the $16 trillion
worth of U.S. stocks. That is nearly 17 percent. Only a decade ago,
their share was less than 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Other institutions, notably pension funds and insurance
companies, held about $5.3 trillion worth of stocks, or 33 percent
of the total _ up from 18 percent a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   There is no breakout exclusively for individuals, but the stake
held by ``households and nonprofit organizations'' amounted to $6.6
trillion, or 41 percent. That is down from 51 percent a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   So, if you view stock investing as a form of competition _ which
it is _ then individual investors who pick their own stocks are
competing more and more against professionals.
</P>
<P>
   That's probably a good thing for individuals, because
professional investors can't seem to get the hang of stock picking.
Just witness the failure of 80 percent of mutual funds to match the
performance each year of the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index.
</P>
<P>
   The next time you buy or sell a stock, you ought to hope that an
institutional investor is on the other side of the transaction. If
that's the case, there's a strong chance that you made a good
choice.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Stock Splits 101
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  Q: I own 50 shares of RF Micro Devices. The company is
splitting its stock 2 for 1, with the split shares payable on
August 25 to shareholders of record on August 8. Since I was a
shareholder of record on August 8, why can't I sell my stock at the
full, presplit value before August 25, then get 50 free split
shares from the company on August 25? This seems like a nice
opportunity to get something for nothing. Why doesn't everyone do
this?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: Repeat this to yourself rapidly, until your hormones
stabilize: There is no such thing as a free lunch.
</P>
<P>
   You certainly can sell your 50 shares before August 25, if you
wish. But in doing so you also will be selling your claim to the 50
split shares to which you would be entitled if you held your stock
beyond the August 25 payout date. The `'of record'' cutoff is a
formality, allowing the company's transfer agent enough time to
process and distribute the split shares by the `'payable'' date.
</P>
<P>
   If your shares are held for you by a broker, the broker will
automatically relay the split shares to the new owner of the stock
you sold.
</P>
<P>
   If you hold your own stock certificates, chances are you will
indeed receive a certificate for 50 shares from the company after
you sell the original shares. But you won't be entitled to keep or
sell them. You will have to return them so they can be credited to
the rightful owner.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Long and Short of Losses
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  Q: You mentioned in a recent column that a taxpayer can
claim no more than $3,000 in net capital losses on his tax return
for any given year and that anything more than that has to be
carried over to the next year. Does it matter whether the net loss
is long-term, short-term, &LR;  or a combination?
</P>
<P>
   A: No, it doesn't matter, according to Internal Revenue Service
spokesman Jesse Weller.
</P>
<P>
   A loss is a loss is a loss. (Long-term capital gains, on the
other hand, are taxed at lower rates than short-term gains.)
</P>
<P>
   For example, if you have a $1,500 net short-term loss and a
$1,500 net long-term loss, they are lumped together to make a
$3,000 net loss _ the annual maximum.
</P>
<P>
   Another example: If you have $5,000 in net long-term losses and
$2,000 in net short-term gains, again you claim a net $3,000 loss
for the year.
</P>
<P>
   And the same would hold true if you have $5,000 in net
short-term losses and $2,000 in net long-term gains.

BARAK SEEKS TO LIMIT USE OF RELIGIOUS PRIVILEGES IN ISRAEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: SUBS 9th graf, By forging ..., to correct `that' to `than'
before right-wing and ultra-Orthodox parties, because they did not
support concessions to Palestians.)  
By JOHN F. BURNS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Surprising even some of his closest political
associates and enraging his ultra-Orthodox opponents, Prime
Minister Ehud Barak informed his supporters during the weekend that
he planned to push a ``civil reform'' through parliament that,
among other things, would strip the Jewish religious establishment
of many privileges and powers.
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected announcement, coming at a time when Barak faces a
fast-approaching deadline in talks with the Palestinians and
several political challenges at home, left much of the country
wondering about his motives.
</P>
<P>
   Some speculated that he was setting the scene for new elections,
others that he was applying pressure on the opposition to support
his dealings with the Palestinians, who have threatened to
unilaterally proclaim a Palestinian state by Sept. 13 if a
settlement has not been negotiated.
</P>
<P>
   Barak announced his proposal after summoning ministers and
legislators from his One Israel coalition to a meeting late
Saturday. He told them of a sweeping plan that would strengthen the
secular nature of Israeli society at the cost of entrenched Jewish
rights woven into the country's social and political fabric since
its founding in 1948. Israeli commentators said that the plan posed
one of the most serious political challenges ultra-Orthodox parties
have faced in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, Barak pledged to introduce a new
constitution guaranteeing a full range of political, social and
religious freedoms that would create greater equality between Jews
and non-Jews. In addition, he promised to dismantle the Religious
Affairs Ministry, introduce a bill allowing for civil marriages
that would be beyond the control of the rabbinate. and sponsor
bills promoting the status of women.
</P>
<P>
   He also outlined a ``comprehensive national service bill'' that
would require all young Israelis, including members of
ultra-Orthodox groups now exempted from military service, to sign
up for two years of nonmilitary work directed by the government.
Finally, he pledged to impose a curriculum for all state-financed
schools, including those run by ultra-Orthodox groups, that would
include classes in subjects they have shunned, including civics,
mathematics and English.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's continuing political problems were also compounded
Monday when a second aide in his secretariat resigned. Haim
Mendel-Shaked, one of Barak's old army friends, quit his
administrative post as director of Barak's office. His resignation
was considered a symbolic and psychological setback because Shaked
had been loyal to Barak for many years. He was the second member of
Barak's office to quit following the resignation last week of his
own deputy, Shimon Batat.
</P>
<P>
   Accounts in Israeli newspapers on Monday about Barak's weekend
meeting said that many of those who attended were stunned. The
accounts said this was partly because Barak had kept his plans to
himself before the weekend meeting, compounding complaints that he
had become increasingly isolated from his top officials and
ministers in the weeks leading up to, and since, the deadlocked
Camp David peace talks with the Palestinians last month.
</P>
<P>
   By forging ahead with a peace plan that offered greater
concessions to the Palestinians on Jerusalem and other key issues
than right-wing and ultra-Orthodox parties were prepared to
support, Barak in effect sacrificed his ruling coalition, which
began to disintegrate before he left for Camp David. Now, with
barely 40 of the 120 members of the Israeli parliament still firmly
behind him, he has taken another step, posing a challenge to the
power of the religious establishment, that Israeli commentators
view as politically risky and even quixotic.
</P>
<P>
   These commentators Monday offered a range of explanations for
Barak's move. Some said he had abandoned hope of achieving peace
with Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, and thus felt free to
adopt domestic policies that would end any prospect of right-wing
and ultra-Orthodox parties that quit his coalition before Camp
David agreeing to return to his government.
</P>
<P>
   Others said that Barak had realized that the only chance of
winning support for a peace agreement rested on a realignment of
Israeli politics that consolidated the power of secular forces.
Still another view was that Barak, facing the probability of a new
election in the next six months, and increasingly doubtful of
having a peace agreement that could secure victory, had decided
that his best chance rested with a bold new plan for reforming
Israeli society from within.
</P>
<P>
   Accounts of the Saturday meeting said that it broke up in
disarray, with some of Barak's closest political allies expressing
grave doubts about his proposals, and others vigorous opposition.
One newspaper, Yedioth Ahronoth, said one of the strongest dissents
came from Shimon Peres, a former prime minister who won the Nobel
Peace Prize for helping to initiate the 1993 Oslo accords that
provided the foundation for the current peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Newspaper commentators said the changes had no hope of passing
the Israeli parliament, where Barak's government faces a right-wing
opposition galvanized by the concessions on Jerusalem and other
issues that Barak offered at Camp David. Although other prime
ministers from the secular, left-wing political spectrum that Barak
represents have tried and failed to achieve some of these reforms
before, these critics said, none had ever sought to accomplish so
much in one swoop, especially from a weak political position.

SPORTS COLUMN: GOODBYE, BIG GUY 
</HEADLINE>
  By   HARVEY ARATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After a summer of so much trade talk that hovered over the city
like a suffocating blanket of stale hot air, a genuine Knicks'
legend answered the telephone in his Manhattan apartment Monday
afternoon and sounded amazed that the biggest deal of all might be
going down after all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really didn't think it was going to happen,'' he said. ``To
be honest, I thought that you guys were just selling papers.''
</P>
<P>
   Walt Frazier needed to be reminded that if he was traded when it
wasn't about the money, then Patrick Ewing could certainly be
dispatched to Seattle when it apparently is.
</P>
<P>
   He chuckled, obviously delighted with this spontaneous
historical perspective, and said: ``I guess we've all seen Ewing as
part of the Knicks for so long, we just assumed he would never play
anyplace else. And I guess people, even me, forget that it also
happened to me.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a long time ago, longer than I'd prefer to admit, as the
dealing of Frazier to the Cleveland Cavaliers (``Cleveland, come
on, man,'' is how he put it) occurred shortly before I was assigned
to follow the Knicks around with a suitcase and my trusty Olivetti
typewriter. I can still remember treading carefully into the
Cavaliers' locker room at the Richfield Coliseum one wintry night
in 1978, hoping this champion of my own adolescence, this one-time
embodiment of urban chic and cool, would cough up a few quotes on
life in the Cleveland `burbs.
</P>
<P>
   Frazier wasn't in the best of moods _ understandable
considering, as he recalled Monday, that he had been informed of
the 1977 deal for Jim Cleamons by his agent, who was waiting for
him when he returned to his apartment after having been out
shopping. More than two decades later, a modern multi-millionaire
star like Ewing at least had the power to engineer his potential
departure on more favorable terms, relative to his earning power
beyond next year.
</P>
<P>
   If Walt Frazier couldn't finish his career in New York, please
spare me any whining or wheezing about Ewing possibly moving on
after 15 fruitful yet also frustrating years. On judgment day in
the court of all-time greats, Frazier happened to be everything
Ewing was not. He was an improvisational genius, a master of
surprise, a showman who connected and communed with the crowd. And
when his team found itself in a seventh game, the championship
riding on one 1970 spring night against Wilt and the Lakers,
Frazier responded with the game of his adult life.
</P>
<P>
   If it is the end for Ewing in New York, no one should say the
1990s Knicks didn't do and spend all that they could to help put
him in the same position as Frazier, 30 years ago. The personnel
moves weren't always the best. The surrounding players were never
as good. The opposition, particularly in the person of Michael
Jordan, was almost always better. But Ewing did have Game 7 in
Houston, 1994, when it was him against Hakeem Olajuwon, and Ewing
stood passively back in the fourth quarter and watched his best
championship opportunity hoisted into oblivion by John Starks.
</P>
<P>
   The quest continued, with more plot twists than an afternoon
soap. Often, in the heat of the playoffs and in recent seasons
under painful conditions, it seemed courageous and real. But there
was always the other side of Ewing, the one who somehow seldom
seemed to have the big picture in focus, and whose stubborn streak
stretched well past the limits of pride. If Ewing is to leave New
York this week, he goes because the organization made the prudent
decision not to extend a contract that is already hopelessly
inflated in terms of his 38-year-old worth.
</P>
<P>
   Someone close to Ewing said Monday that once the Knicks made it
clear that a contract extension was not forthcoming, his immediate
response was to caucus with his agent, David Falk, to plan the
strategy to obtain it elsewhere. Falk made it clear that he was
unlikely to land with a serious title contender. That Ewing would
be willing to go to Seattle speaks volumes about what his primary
interest is at this stage of his career, 38 and without a ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people said Patrick held back the Knicks, what would they
say about him out west?'' Frazier said. ``All those teams want to
run. That's why I'm surprised he would want to go there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics play in the conference of most recent champions, San
Antonio and Los Angeles, of Duncan and Shaq. Then again, they did
not make the playoffs two years ago and most recently lost in the
first round. Seattle is a place that will not frown upon being led
to the second or third round by Ewing, as was New York. It might
even be appreciative enough to pay him more millions to do it
again, and again.
</P>
<P>
   Cynicism of his motives must be tempered by those of the Knicks,
now maneuvering frantically to justify their consumer warfare on
the middle-class fan. In recent years, they paid Ewing whatever
they had to and catered to his every whim to protect the illusion
of contention around the man in the middle. Vin Baker? Glen Rice?
They are the available talent out there, not necessarily the stuff
of champions, of Walt Frazier three decades past. &QL;

<P>
   The issue of weapons inspections is only one area in which the
international standoff with Saddam appears headed for a new period
of confrontation, a decade after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait led to
the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Saddam has taken steps to ease his diplomatic
isolation, receiving a visit from President Hugo Chavez of
Venezuela. A thriving black market is reportedly eroding the
sanctions, while Russia, supported by China, is challenging the
American and British patrols of the ``no flight'' zones in northern
and southern Iraq, established to protect minority populations from
Saddam's government.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of these challenges, diplomats at the United Nations
and even some American officials say, the administration's policy
has been left to drift. The American ambassador to the United
Nations, Richard C. Holbrooke, has not involved himself in the
issue. Holbrooke says that he has been too busy on other matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt things are on autopilot,'' said one official
in Washington. ``And it might be an autopilot with a 10-degree
downward tilt.''
</P>
<P>
   Several diplomats, including some from nations on the Security
Council, said the administration had undermined its influence by
openly calling for the removal of Saddam from power. This has given
the Iraqis an excuse for dismissing the Security Council's pledge
to suspend sanctions if Saddam cooperates with new inspectors, the
diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   The administration may find itself even further isolated on the
Security Council, since three countries supportive of the United
States and Britain _ Argentina, Canada and the Netherlands _ will
be among the five countries relinquishing their rotating council
seats.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials say they have succeeded in containing
Iraq, enforcing the sanctions. They say they have also continued to
enforce the ``no flight'' zones, despite repeated Iraqi
provocations that have resulted in hundreds of limited airstrikes
since 1998.
</P>
<P>
   When American and British warplanes and missiles launched a much
larger attack 20 months ago, administration officials acknowledged
that the attack would make it difficult to resume weapons
inspections. But they argued that with Saddam refusing to
cooperate, there was no other way to prevent Iraq from acquiring
chemical or biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark my words,'' Clinton said of Saddam at the time, ``he will
develop weapons of mass destruction. He will deploy them, and he
will use them. Because we're acting today, it is less likely that
we will face these dangers in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen and others
also warned that the United States was prepared to use force again
if there was evidence that Iraq had resumed its chemical or
biological weapons programs _ or if Iraq threatened its neighbors
or attacked the Kurds in the north.
</P>
<P>
   James M. Bodner, the principal deputy undersecretary of defense
for policy and a longtime aide to Cohen, said in an interview that
the United States remained ready to respond if Iraq crossed any of
those ``red lines.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said they had no concrete evidence that
Iraq has restarted its weapons programs. But in addition to
repairing the damage done in 1998, Iraq has resumed testing its
shorter-range missiles. Officials fear that those tests, while not
explicitly prohibited under the U.N. resolutions, have allowed Iraq
to perfect longer-range missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that, the administration's warnings about Iraq's weapons
have lost much of their urgency. In the fall of 1997, Cohen held up
a bag of sugar on television and ominously warned that an
equivalent amount of the biological agent anthrax, which Iraq is
believed to possess, would destroy half the population of
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, administration officials have made no such
dire warnings, even though there have been no effective inspections
in two years. At the same time, Americans have done little publicly
to press Blix to accelerate the formation of his inspection team,
which has proceeded slowly.
</P>
<P>
   ``At no time have we been dragging our feet,'' Blix said in an
interview last Wednesday, adding that he had met all of the
Security Council's deadlines. ``We are working at full speed on a
lot of issues here.''
</P>
<P>
   Blix began interviewing weapons experts in May, and those
selected have completed a four-week training program. While Iraq
has vowed not to recognize the commission, Blix said there were
signs that Iraq was thinking over its next moves.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis recently presented a legalistic analysis of the new
inspection plan to governments of Islamic nations meeting in Kuala
Lumpur. The eight-page memorandum asks many, often accusatory,
questions, suggesting that the Iraqis still nurture hopes that the
resolution creating the inspection commission could be rewritten.
</P>
<P>
   Some diplomats say that Iraq may have calculated that it could
bide its time, hoping for a better deal in the future. Russia has
already called for changes in the resolution, but U.N. and American
officials have adamantly ruled out the possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Others say Saddam will stop short of any actions that would
invite American retaliation, while trying to build support for an
unconditional lifting of the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, he thinks things are going his way,'' an American
defense official said. ``He's outlasted the Clinton administration.
He outlasted the Bush administration. I think his perception is he
can outlast them all.''

TOP TWO UNIONS COMPETING FOR WORKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL NYHAN  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The biggest union at Boeing stepping up a battle for
up to a quarter of the company's Puget Sound workforce, is starting
to knock on doors. Literally.
</P>
<P>
   The effort is the latest development in a competition between
the largest and second-largest unions at Boeing, The Machinists
District Lodge 751 and the Society of Professional Engineering
Employees in Aerospace respectively.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides are fighting for the chance to represent up to
20,000 administrative, computing, planning and other workers in the
region who are not now part of any union at Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Machinists intensified their effort by
dispatching an army of union officials to the doors of regional
employees, hoping to eventually reach as many as 10,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of their 10-day effort? To secure enough support from
potential members for the IAM to file for an election before the
end of year, according to Dennis London, grand lodge representative
at the union.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big piece of the effort,'' London said ``This is an
issue of working families ... providing people (with) benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   The organizing campaign could also become a major issue within
the national labor movement. That's because 20,000 workers
represents a huge target for any union, according to Margaret Levi,
director of the University of Washington's Center for Labor
Studies.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Machinists, the engineering union is focusing its
efforts on reaching people in the workplace, according to Paul
Shearon, the union's director of organizing. The IAM, meanwhile, is
targeting workers in both arenas, London said.
</P>
<P>
   Both unions would receive a huge boost in membership if they
could secure the entire group. Roughly 20,000 workers would nearly
double the International Association of Machinists District Lodge
751's current level of more than 24,000 Boeing workers. The lodge's
parent claims more than 530,000 active members.
</P>
<P>
   The engineering union, which linked up with its parent, the
International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers,
and the AFL-CIO last year, already represents roughly 20,000
workers in the Puget Sound region.
</P>
<P>
   But it is possible that more than one union would appear on any
ballot _ if the unions get enough signatures to bring
representation to a vote.
</P>
<P>
   The Machinists argue they have been working on this campaign for
nearly a decade, responding to requests from the workforce. So,
they're confident they should speak for the non-represented Boeing
workers at future bargaining tables.
</P>
<P>
   So the union has sent out roughly 70 two-man teams _ armed with
manuals, newsletters, information on dues and other data _ in
recent days.
</P>
<P>
   The teams stress the advantages of IAM membership, from recent
contract successes to AFL-CIO supported credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders place particular emphasis on their recent
negotiating record, saying they secured the best contract in the
aerospace industry for their members during the last negotiating
round.
</P>
<P>
   The Machinists have set an ambitious schedule. Organizers are
striving to file completed petitions with the National Labor
Relations Board by the end of the summer, although they haven't set
any hard deadlines.
</P>
<P>
   The engineers argue they are a better match for the targeted
workers, described by officials as white collar employees, since
they already represent similar workers. In fact, the union recently
won a fight with Boeing to represent the same classes of workers in
Wichita, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the only union at The Boeing Co. that represents the
employees that we are seeking to represent,'' SPEEA's Shearon said.
``We have proved that the model we have used to organize can be
successful and succeed with this type of employee.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Machinists union dismiss that argument,
pointing out their union represents a wide range of workers,
including clerical and office workers at Northwest Airlines,
hospital workers at Evergreen Washington Health Care and technical
and office employees at a Boeing operation in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   While the two unions are feuding, the engineers said they would
discuss some type of compromise.
</P>
<P>
   If the petition campaigns succeed, the National Labor Relations
Board would then review the efforts, checking with employees and
taking other steps, according to union officials.
</P>
<P>
   The board could also call a hearing to listen to both union
leaders and Boeing executives.
</P>
<P>
   If the labor board approves the petitions, union officials are
hoping to hold an election by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing officials declined to comment on the ongoing campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   But, UW's Levi said the company is likely to discourage workers
from linking up with either union:
</P>
<P>
   ``They will try to persuade workers, probably, that they are
better off not being unionized.''

SOUTH AFRICA REJECTS U.S. OFFER OF LOANS TO BUY ANTI-AIDS DRUGS 
</HEADLINE>
   By RACHEL L. SWARNS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ The United States' offer of $1
billion in annual loans to finance the purchase of anti-AIDS drugs
in sub-Saharan Africa has been rejected by South Africa, one of the
countries most devastated by the disease, health officials said.
Namibia has also rejected the offer, and other nations in this
stricken region are voicing serious reservations, the officials
say.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa, the nation with the largest number of people
infected with the virus that causes AIDS, and Namibia said they
needed affordable drugs, not loans that would burden their
economies.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Southern African Development Community, which
represents 12 other countries in the region, along with South
Africa and Namibia, are also expressing doubts about the proposal.
They say they would prefer that the United States pressure U.S.
drug companies to reduce prices and to support countries that are
disregarding patents and producing generic drugs more cheaply.
</P>
<P>
   ``Members are already burdened by debt,'' said Dr. Thuthula
Balfour, director of the health unit of the Southern African
Development Community, in a telephone interview from Pretoria.
``Making drugs affordable is the solution rather than offering
loans that have interest.''
</P>
<P>
   The offer last month by the U.S. Export-Import Bank, an
independent government agency financed by Congress, was made to 24
sub-Saharan countries. Bank officials say none of the countries
have formally accepted the offer so far. The officials, who
emphasized that it is too early to assess interest in the program,
say they are still educating eligible African nations about the
program.
</P>
<P>
   But even when the program was announced, officials acknowledged
that some members of the Clinton administration had doubts about
its benefits. The offer comes at a time when the West is seeking to
forgive as much as $100 billion of the debt held by poor countries,
hoping to free up scarce resources for health, education and other
social programs in those nations.
</P>
<P>
   Marsha Berry, the spokeswoman for the Export-Import Bank, said
bank officials knew of South Africa's concerns. She said they
understood those concerns and the hesitancy expressed by officials
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are poor countries and should they be taking on more
debt?'' she said in a telephone interview from Washington. ``That's
a very valid question.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just doing what we can, knowing it's a small part,''
Berry said. ``We have not got anyone to sign on the line yet. But
it's going to take a couple of months of working through these
touchy details.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Third World nations have been pressuring the West and
pharmaceutical companies to make costly anti-AIDS therapies more
accessible. Earlier this year, UNAIDS, the U.N. agency dealing with
AIDS, and five drug companies began negotiating steep drops in
prices of the drugs for poor regions afflicted by the disease.
</P>
<P>
   But some AIDS groups argue that the companies are lowering
prices simply to forestall the seizure of their patents by poor
countries desperate for the drugs. Thailand and South Africa have
recently passed laws allowing such seizures; India, Bangladesh and
Brazil have drug industries that ignore patent treaties.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the Clinton administration angered the pharmaceutical
industry by issuing an executive order saying the government would
not interfere with African countries that violated U.S. patent law
to obtain cheaper AIDS drugs.
</P>
<P>
   In South Africa, where about 4 million people are infected with
the virus that causes AIDS, health officials say such efforts,
which support the production and distribution of generic drugs, are
more useful than loan programs, said Nothemba Dlali, a spokeswoman
for the Ministry of Health.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kalumbi Shangula, the permanent secretary for the Namibian
Ministry of Health, agreed. He said his country simply could not
afford the drugs. In the United States, an U.S. patient might spend
$12,000 a year or more on drug therapy, a price tag way out of
reach for patients in poor African countries.
</P>
<P>
   The Export-Import Bank offers loans to buy the drugs at
commercial interest rates that now average about 7 percent. But
health officials in Namibia are desperately searching for other
ways to get drug therapy to their infected citizens, who make up an
estimated 20 percent of that country's population.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you take loans, you are plunging the country deeply into
debt,'' Shangula said. ``We are actually looking for ways to
acquire the anti-retroviral drugs to improve the quality of life of
our people, but this does not offer the solution.''

CAREER MARKETING FIRM DRAWS COMPLAINTS 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKE-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PAUL WENSKE and DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even so, critics say, it's hard to justify high counseling fees
when there are cheaper and equally effective ways to get
personalized career help to take advantage of a strong economy.
</P>
<P>
   Many college-based programs, employment agencies and individual
advisers offer expert career coaching for $50 to $100 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   The Career Counseling Center at Johnson County Community College
offers services that range from life assessment and personality
tests to job search, resume writing and interview training. Clients
do mock interviews and get help networking through professional
associations.
</P>
<P>
   Even with extra coaching job seekers would be hard-pressed to
spend more than $500 on a custom program. ``There are different
pieces. Course work depends on where the person is at and what his
or her preference is,'' Laura Johannesmeyer, the community career
counseling coordinator, said. Last year the center helped 700
people make career decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Hughes attended three job-coaching sessions at the college
at a cost of $50 a session. ``I didn't need a whole battery of
tests. What I needed to do was narrow my focus,'' he said. A
licensed psychologist, Hughes has been exploring jobs in the
nonprofit market.
</P>
<P>
   By far the cheapest way to finance a job search is to do it
yourself. And there are plenty of self-help guides.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you need someone to hold your hand eight hours a day, maybe
the career counseling service is the way to go for you,'' said
Martin Yate, author of the national best-selling job-seeker's
handbook Knock 'Em Dead, used in many job-search courses. It
retails for $12.95.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you are a motivated person who can tell your elbow from
a hole in the ground, you can get all these things in books for a
few dollars or free on the Internet,'' Yate said.
</P>
<P>
   Yate's latest self-help effort is his Web site: careerbrain.com,
which features video lectures, resume advice, job links and a
six-page, free personality assessment.
</P>
<P>
   He said there is nothing exotic about a ``hidden market,'' which
he said has become a lucrative sales pitch used by career marketing
companies to make their services appear ultrasophisticated.
</P>
<P>
   ``All it refers to are jobs you don't happen to see in the
Sunday newspaper. Tapping the hidden job market is simply
networking, using the newspaper, the Internet, associations and
professional organizations, people you know and your references.''
</P>
<P>
   Costly career counseling might appeal to those who feel lost,
Yate said. ``But you have to ask, `Would I feel a little less lost
if I kept some money in my bank account?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Haldane is different from some other career counseling
firms. It is primarily a ``retail'' operation that prospects for
individual clients. In contrast, other career marketers work solely
for corporate clients who pay the bills. A company might pay for
``outplacement'' services for employees who are downsized or
executives who are let go.
</P>
<P>
   A company might also pay fees to placement or staffing agencies
that send them job candidates. In either case, the employer, rather
than the individual job hunter, pays the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Hoyt &AMP; Associates, another employment firm, charges
corporate clients a contingency fee to recruit employees. But it
also offers services to individuals at an installment or hourly
rate. ``You don't have to pay a large fee up front,'' said owner
Ron Like.
</P>
<P>
   Independent career counselors say services should seldom run
into the thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Danielle Rodenbough, a principal of Trouble at Work, charges
between $250 and $500 for individual services. ``I can't understand
how something like that could cost $5,000,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Connie Russell, an individual career counselor, said job hunters
should look beyond the cost to check out the backgrounds of the
advisers, especially those who charge high-dollar fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think the quality varies a lot,'' she said. It's
important, she said, to know if you are ``talking to a counselor or
a marketer.'' You should choose someone who will help ``focus your
efforts, help motivate and coach you, and give you practical
suggestions.'' Job hunters should be able to get all this and more
and for less than $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Boas, chief executive of Boas Associates, a human
resources and career development consulting firm, said consumers
should be skeptical of any firm that charges a large up-front fee.
</P>
<P>
   Boas, president of the Human Resources Management Association of
Greater Kansas City, said a fee of as much as $3,000 might be a
reasonable expense for extensive career advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that should cover everything from beginning to end,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Phelps, who is now searching for a job on her own: ``For
$6,000, I think I deserved something better.''
</P>

KNICKS' DEAL TO TRADE EWING TO SEATTLE FALLS THROUGH 
</HEADLINE>
  (SUBS: Trade is called off. Pls. note story is no longer on Page
One)   
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Patrick Ewing, the stoic 7-foot center who for 15
years tried to be the player to bring a championship to the New
York Knicks, was on the brink of being traded Monday night before a
four-team, 13-player deal collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing, a 38-year-old veteran, was to be the centerpiece of the
blockbuster deal, a National Basketball Association official said
on condition of anonymity. But the Detroit Pistons, who were set to
acquire seven lesser-known players in the deal, called off the
trade because they did not want to assume four of the players'
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Knicks were going to give the Pistons money, and the whole
deal was about to be done,'' said an Eastern Conference team
official, ``but the contracts became a mess. There were just too
many red flags.''
</P>
<P>
   In the proposed trade, Ewing would have gone to Seattle, while
the Knicks would have acquired forward Vin Baker from the
SuperSonics and forward Glen Rice and center Travis Knight from the
Los Angeles Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   In a summer of monster, multiteam deals that involved some of
the game's most prominent players _ Grant Hill ended up in Orlando
while Shawn Kemp is expected to be dealt to Portland _ the deal for
Ewing might have been the most immense and the most complicated.
</P>
<P>
   In the proposed trade, the Lakers would have received Chris
Dudley from the Knicks and Christian Laettner from the Pistons. The
Pistons, the fourth team in the deal, were trying to reduce their
payroll so that they could land a top-tier free agent next summer.
They were to take a number of role players from the three teams,
including Vernon Maxwell, Lazaro Borrell, Greg Foster, Vladimir
Stepania, John Celestand, Tyronn Lue and David Wingate.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most dominating post players in the NBA's modern era,
Ewing was taken by the Knicks with the No. 1 selection in the 1985
college draft. New York fans were thrilled to get the scowling,
shot-blocking menace from Georgetown University.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing has since led the Knicks into the playoffs 13 straight
years. With him, the Knicks advanced to the Eastern Conference
finals three times. In 1994, they came within a game of winning the
franchise's first title since 1973 before losing to the Houston
Rockets in seven games.
</P>
<P>
   Holder of most major club records, Ewing ended last season as
the 14th-leading scorer in league history. He is fourth in blocked
shots and he played in his 1,000th game last season. Ewing is one
of seven players in NBA annals to spend 15 years with the same
team.
</P>
<P>
   If his longevity was impressive, though, his durability was
wearing thin. In the last three seasons, he missed 88
regular-season games because of injury. From a dislocated right
wrist to a partial tear in his left Achilles' tendon, his
production was severely limited by his health. He could not play in
the 1999 championship series against the San Antonio Spurs, a
series the Knicks lost in five games. He began last season on the
injury list.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ewing came back and silenced his critics for most of the
regular season. He started 62 games, and he dutifully took on a
reduced role in an offense suddenly powered by Allan Houston and
Latrell Sprewell.
</P>
<P>
   But as the playoffs came, the old question began to re-emerge
outside and inside the locker room: were the Knicks better off
without Ewing? His plodding, halfcourt style came to be viewed as a
blight to the Knicks' new, high-octane outfit. He would miss two
games in the playoffs because of his Achilles' problem.
</P>
<P>
   In complete games without Ewing against the Indiana Pacers in
the past two postseasons, the Knicks went 5-1. Sprewell tried to
play down the controversy during the Indiana series in June,
saying, ``If we win the championship, Patrick has to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Ewing is scheduled to make $14 million this season, the last
installment of a four-year, $68 million contract signed in 1997.
But the Knicks balked when it came to talk of a contract extension,
a development that forced Ewing and David Falk, his agent, to
consider other options. Ewing's insistence on being compensated
beyond this season _ coupled with his growing disenchantment with
New York fans and news media _ made their decision to shop him NBA
more palatable.
</P>
<P>
   After giving Scott Layden, the general manager, a list of eight
teams he would not protest being traded to, Ewing waited for the
Knicks to make their move.
</P>
<P>
   There was much the conversation around the league on Monday as
the Knicks planned to part ways with their franchise center, the
oft-maligned, aging veteran who never delivered the championship to
New York he so desperately wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's sad,'' O'Neal said before the trade was killed. ``You
always thought Patrick Ewing would retire in New York. That's what
everyone thought.''
</P>
<P>
   And it may still be the case.

CAREER MARKETING FIRM DRAWS COMPLAINTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PAUL WENSKE and DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Fluent in Portuguese, her college degree in
hand, Karol Phelps hoped to reap big bucks working for a
multinational company.
</P>
<P>
   What she didn't have was a big job offer.
</P>
<P>
   So she went to Bernard Haldane Associates in Overland Park,
Kan., one of 80 offices affiliated with the nation's largest career
counseling firm.
</P>
<P>
   Convinced by its ads that the company could place her in a
high-paying position, she plunked down $5,985 in advance on Nov. 5,
charging the fee to her credit card.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of being introduced to a private network of
corporate bigwigs, Phelps spent hours copying names from newspaper
ads, Internet sites and databases. It was tedious work, much of
which she said she could have done on her own, and for far less
money.
</P>
<P>
   Now she wants her money back and has filed a complaint with the
Kansas attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   ``They make you feel they are very big and that they have a
secret network of people,'' she said. ``But they didn't have any
network that can help me.''
</P>
<P>
   Demand for career counseling is growing as a robust economy
encourages professionals to seek new jobs or change careers. But
like Phelps, many job seekers say the services provided by some
career marketing firms fail to justify their large advance fees.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia, California, Colorado and Kansas have taken legal
action against Bernard Haldane. The states alleged, among other
things, that the firm exaggerated its access to executives and
unadvertised jobs.
</P>
<P>
   More than 30 complaints against Bernard Haldane have been filed
with Kansas Attorney General Carla Stovall. No other large career
counseling service has been the subject of recent complaints in
Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1999 national Bernard Haldane officials and the former
owners of the Overland Park franchise agreed to pay $80,000 to
settle complaints and legal costs. Without admitting wrongdoing,
the company agreed to refrain from using deceptive sales pitches in
the future.
</P>
<P>
   Reed Freeman, who bought the local franchise in November 1998,
said any problems were resolved. ``Certainly our record speaks for
the changes that have been made in the last two years,'' the
current owner said.
</P>
<P>
   But a spokesman for Stovall said the attorney general is
investigating two new complaints against Bernard Haldane. ``Anytime
you get into this kind of money up front, consumers have to weigh
what this company is going to do for them that they can't do for
themselves,'' said Steven Rarrick, the deputy attorney general
overseeing the Kansas cases.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Haldane officials declined to discuss pending cases. But
they said their program is the best in the nation at teaching job
search skills, and they can point to many satisfied customers.
``Our commitment is to do everything we can for a client who puts
out the effort to be successful,'' said Stephen Briscoe, director
of career advising.
</P>
<P>
   Complaints, he said, result from misunderstandings. ``Our
contract specifically says in big print, we're not an employment
agency,'' he said. ``There are no guarantees.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Lauri believed his contract with Bernard Haldane would
give him an edge in his search for a new job two years ago. The
warehouse manager had been laid off and his confidence was shaken.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tell you they have connections with almost every company
of any size in Kansas City. They say 90 percent of the jobs are
never advertised. It's the `hidden market.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But little panned out. His best offer was a job as a warehouse
rate clerk in Virginia at $9.50 an hour. ``By that time I was flat
upset with the whole situation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Tobin of Olathe said he approached Bernard Haldane after
the firm he worked for closed and he lost his sales manager job. He
said firm advisers told him they had ``special connections'' with
``decision makers'' in a wide range of professions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was an exclusive employment agency, even though
they will tell you they are not an employment agency. It's like
they say, `We don't do this for everyone.' '' He paid $4,000.
</P>
<P>
   Lauri and Tobin filed complaints with the Kansas attorney
general's office and settled with Bernard Haldane more than a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Local Bernard Haldane officials say, generally, that some
clients may become disgruntled after failing to take responsibility
for their own efforts. ``Those people who make an investment, make
it happen,'' said Briscoe, the director of career advising. ``Those
who don't, won't.''
</P>
<P>
   Briscoe said Bernard Haldane provides mentoring to people
uncertain how to search for a job on their own. ``Our goal is to
get you in front of people to network with,'' he said. He said he
can help a client get an interview in any of the city's biggest
offices.
</P>
<P>
   The program entails three main phases. The first includes
appraisals of a client's career goals and preparation for
interviews. A second phase entails assessing job offers. A third
phase assesses long-range objectives and career advancement. The
local office employs 12 persons, who include former educators,
military officials and sales people.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman said the local office advises 450 clients annually. He
said a Bernard Haldane certificate makes a client ``specifically
more marketable.'' He compares the firm's advance fees and
no-refund policy to financing a college course: ``Why do you pay
for a college education up front?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Haldane has its staunch supporters, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were there when I needed them,'' said Craig Rodgers, who
said leads he developed through Bernard Haldane helped him land a
management job at a local Birch Telecom office after a yearlong
search.
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers, who moved from the military to the business world, said
he got help in preparing for interviews and in writing his resume.
``In the end,'' he said, ``I got the kind of job I was looking
for.''
</P>
<P>
   L. Campbell Schutte said Bernard Haldane was ``a phenomenal help
in my decision to change careers'' from a vice president of a mail
order firm to an information systems consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Koranda, Overland Park's manager of international trade
development, said Bernard Haldane helped him polish his job
interviewing skills. ``I don't know if I could have successfully
changed careers without their assistance,'' said Koranda, a former
disc jockey.
</P>
<P>
   He agreed the cost is steep, but, he said, ``For myself, it was
worth it. I doubled my salary.''

9-YEAR-OLD STARTED FOSTER HOME FIRE, POLICE SAY

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A 9-year-old girl started the fire that
killed two sisters early Sunday at a group foster home, police said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Police said she squirted charcoal lighter fluid on a box of
stuffed animals in a first-floor classroom. She then ignited a
piece of paper on a gas stove and tossed it on the toys. Twelve
children were sleeping nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the Missouri Division of Family Services on
Monday were investigating reports that only one staff member was on
duty when the fire started about 5 a.m. at the Early Childhood
Residential Center, 3911 Agnes Ave.
</P>
<P>
   They also said children would no longer be placed with the
agency if the family services division confirmed that only one
person was caring for 13 children.
</P>
<P>
   State regulations require that at least two staff members be
present overnight, with one awake at all times.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this center was not in compliance, we will take the most
severe action we can,'' Denise Cross, director of the Missouri
Division of Family Services, said Monday from Jefferson City.
</P>
<P>
   ``This agency is very concerned,'' said Margaret Randle, Jackson
County administrator for the family services division.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities and neighbors said the employee _ with the help of a
good Samaritan _ ushered 11 children out of the burning building.
</P>
<P>
   Alexus Brown, 2, was found in her crib on the first floor.
Aliyah Brown, who turned 6 last week, was found in an upstairs
bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   Cora Thompson, the center's treatment director, said Sunday that
the center had 18 to 20 staff employees, but that only one was
working at the time of the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they were told that another employee was supposed to
be working Sunday but had called in sick.
</P>
<P>
   Directors of the center could not be reached for further comment
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson County Prosecutor Robert Beaird was out of town during
the weekend and learned of the fire Monday. He said he would meet
early today with staff to discuss possible charges.
</P>
<P>
   It would not be the first time that the Early Childhood
Residential Center had staffing problems.
</P>
<P>
   Cross said her agency suspended the center from child placement
earlier this year after complaints were filed alleging inadequate
staffing. The suspension meant that no new children were placed at
the center; those already there were allowed to stay.
</P>
<P>
   The suspension lasted about six weeks, from early March to
mid-April, Cross said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We worked with them, and they made staffing changes,'' Cross
said. ``And we allowed them to resume taking children.''
</P>
<P>
   The victims and an older sister had been living in the home
since February, according to police.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the 9-year-old girl initially told them that a
masked man broke into the home and started the fire. The details of
her story, however, soon began to change.
</P>
<P>
   She altered the times of some events, the way the man broke in,
and his description. She then told detectives she started the fire
by squirting lighter fluid on the stuffed animals, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The girl told them that the fire blazed out of control and that
she went to alert the employee. She said that the woman was asleep
and that she did not want to wake her.
</P>
<P>
   Police had to stop questioning the girl at that time, and they
turned the girl over to juvenile authorities. State law prohibits
police from questioning juvenile suspects. They were allowed to
question the girl initially because they thought she was a witness.
</P>
<P>
   The employee told police she had folded clothes, watched
television and eaten a frozen dinner before falling asleep on a
chair in an upstairs room between 3 and 3:30 a.m. She awoke and
heard a man yelling.
</P>
<P>
   Two smoke detectors also sounded.
</P>
<P>
   The man, Sean Jones, 27, had seen the fire from a nearby parking
lot and ran to the center, kicked in the front door and yelled,
``Fire!'' He helped herd 11 children outside.
</P>
<P>
   He tried to go back for the remaining two children, but the
smoke was too thick.
</P>
<P>
   According to its literature, the center was operated by the
Civic Registration Council, a community outreach organization
founded in 1977 to ``address the urgent and unmet needs of food,
clothing and shelter for low-income residents of Jackson County.''
</P>
<P>
   Children were placed at the center by the family services
division on a temporary or an emergency basis. Some had been abused
or neglected. Others came from families in crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Randle said the center was the only emergency group foster home
on the Missouri side of the metropolitan area. The center was state
licensed _ which required it to meet standards, such as 24-hour
staffing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to maintain staffing,'' Randle said.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday division officials were studying files on the
surviving children and placing them in homes.

CLAYTON'S ERROR DOOMS RANGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Shortstop Royce Clayton has been the Texas Rangers'
most dependable defensive player this year. Manager Johnny Oates
has gone out of his way several times recently to make that point.
</P>
<P>
   But in a season that broke apart at the seams a long time ago,
nobody seems immune from the fate that has befallen the Rangers.
Clayton's bobble of Derek Jeter's third-inning potential
double-play ground ball went from a simple error to a disaster when
the New York Yankees scored six unearned runs and went on to beat
the Rangers, 12-3, at Yankee Stadium on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Starter Brian Sikorski's second major-league start was a
complete reversal from his debut last week when he pitched seven
scoreless innings. This time he gave up nine runs in 41/3 innings
as the Rangers lost for the 13th time in 18 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just screwed up the play,'' Clayton said. ``I've played long
enough to know there are certain situations where you know an error
is going to come back to haunt you. The kid was pitching a pretty
decent game, he had worked out of some jams, and that play opened
up the inning. I'd rather strike out four times instead of making
an error that hurt my pitcher.''
</P>
<P>
   This one did. The Rangers were leading 1-0 in the third when
Clay Bellinger led off with an infield single and Luis Polonia
walked. Jeter then hit a wobbly grounder, and Clayton hurried
trying to turn two, rather than settling for a force out. He
bobbled it, then pulled second baseman Frank Catalanotto off the
bag with his flip, loading the bases.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a play that requires a lot of effort,'' Clayton said.
</P>
<P>
   Sikorski got Paul O'Neill to pop out and struck out Glenallen
Hill, but he walked Tino Martinez to force in the tying run. Jorge
Posada then lined a two-run single to center, and the inning fell
apart. Singles by Luis Sojo, Scott Brosius and Bellinger _ two
bloops and a grounder through the right side _ made it 6-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walking a run in doesn't help,'' Sikorski said. ``I felt good.
I felt for the most part I threw the ball where I wanted to. I
tried to control the damage, but they kept finding the holes.
They're not the defending champions for nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Clayton's superb year defensively has been marred by two costly
errors in the past five games. He had a key error with two outs in
the ninth inning Thursday night when he momentarily bobbled a
tricky grounder, allowing the Red Sox to rally with three runs
against closer John Wetteland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defensively I've felt pretty good until the last couple of
games,'' Clayton said. ``I still feel good, but a couple things
happened that don't necessarily look good. But I was trying to make
some tough plays, and I don't think anybody can fault me for
trying.''
</P>
<P>
   Not Oates, who said: ``Defensively he has been a bright spot.
Today he had a rough day.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been many like that for the Rangers, and Clayton
feels it as much as anybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely, there's been a lot of frustration,'' Clayton said.
``It's been a rough year for the team and for me personally. I
haven't done what I'm capable of doing. Offensively I haven't
really been hot all year, but I'd like to get in a position where I
can finish strong.''
</P>
<P>
   That's about all anybody on the Rangers can do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody here is giving up or throwing in the
towel,'' Clayton said. ``I go out there every day with my pride on
the line. You don't want to go out there and get beat on, make
mistakes or not do what you're capable of doing. Even if we're not
in the (playoff) picture, you still want to go out and win the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's getting harder and harder, and nobody seems immune in
any area. nn

CALIFORNIA CAPS ELECTRICITY RATES FOR SOME SAN DIEGO CONSUMERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With electricity rates doubling or tripling for
some consumers in San Diego, the California Public Utility
Commission voted Monday to cap electric bills for some residential
and business customers in the city.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement left many people still unhappy, and several
experts said further regulations might be needed because of what
some have described as price gouging in the wholesale electricity
market and a system that leaped toward deregulation before
sufficient supplies were available.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's decision, on a vote of 3-2, would cap rates for many
residents of San Diego by about 43 percent, assuring that customers
who keep their consumption below certain caps would pay no more
than $68 a month through the end of the year. San Diego was the
first big market in California to be deregulated because its
principal gas and electric utilities merged earlier to form Sempra
Energy.
</P>
<P>
   Loretta Lynch, the president of the commission and an opponent
of the decision Monday, explained that the price caps would apply
only to individuals who use 500 kilowatts-hours or less a month,
about 60 percent to 70 percent of customers in the city. Customers
who use more than that will be charged the higher rates, she said.
The decision also applies to small-business customers that use
1,500 kilowatts-hours a month or less.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego's mayor, Susan Golding, said one of her biggest
concerns was that the plan left important users, including public
schools and hospitals, at the mercy of a market that has seen
prices skyrocket. Golding said that while she generally favored
deregulation, it was ill-considered because the supply was clearly
inadequate to meet demand, particularly at a time when the economy
was booming.
</P>
<P>
   ``But even if demand weren't so strong, we still would be in
incredibly bad shape,'' Golding said.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego's utility welcomed Monday's step as a temporary
measure that would be required only until new power plants become
operational, perhaps in three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The impact of deregulation on San Diego has been just awful,''
said Steve Baum, the chairman of Sempra Energy, which owns San
Diego Gas and Electric. ``This step as a smoothing mechanism has
been very helpful.''
</P>
<P>
   The deregulation of the $20 billion electrical power industry in
the state resulted from a 1996 law that phases in the effects from
south to north. But the state has suffered power shortages that led
rolling ``brownouts'' in the San Francisco Bay area in June, in
addition to the price increases in San Diego. The average wholesale
price for San Diego electricity was $117 per megawatt-hour, up from
$25 per megawatt-hour at a comparable time last year, The
Associated Press quoted a member of the utilities commission, Carl
Wood.
</P>
<P>
   This was not the first time that the commission had retreated
slightly from its earlier decision to deregulate utilities in San
Diego, but it was seen as a larger move than in the past. It was
also characterized as a possible prelude to more restrictions
because of the soaring rates and concerns about inadequate
supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch said that an investigation was under way into why
wholesale rates had soared, and that the results of that inquiry
might be used to establish other restrictions, at least until new
supplies of electricity were built.

SPORTS COLUMN: A KNICKS LEGEND PAUSES TO REFLECT 
</HEADLINE>
  (SUBS to change hed and rewrite throughout to reflect trade
collapse) 
By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After a summer of so much trade talk that hovered
over the city like a suffocating blanket of stale hot air, a
genuine Knicks legend answered the telephone in his Manhattan
apartment Monday and sounded amazed that the biggest deal of all
might go down after all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really didn't think it was going to happen,'' he said. ``To
be honest, I thought that you guys were just selling papers.''
</P>
<P>
   Walt Frazier needed to be reminded that if he was traded when it
wasn't about the money, then why can't Patrick Ewing be dispatched
to Seattle when it apparently is?
</P>
<P>
   He chuckled, obviously delighted with this historical
perspective, and said: ``I guess we've all seen Ewing as part of
the Knicks for so long, we just assumed he would never play
anyplace else. And I guess people, even me, forget that it also
happened to me.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a long time ago, longer than I'd prefer to admit, as the
dealing of Frazier to the Cleveland Cavaliers (``Cleveland, come
on, man,'' is how he put it) occurred shortly before I was assigned
to follow the Knicks around with a suitcase and my trusty Olivetti
typewriter. I can still remember treading carefully into the
Cavaliers' locker room at the Richfield Coliseum one wintry night
in 1978, hoping this champion of my own adolescence, this one-time
embodiment of urban chic and cool, would cough up a few quotes on
life in the Cleveland 'burbs.
</P>
<P>
   Frazier wasn't in the best of moods, even months after being
informed of the deal by his agent, who was waiting for him when he
returned to his apartment late one Friday night. More than two
decades later, a modern multimillionaire star like Ewing at least
has the power to engineer his potential departure on more favorable
terms, relative to his earning power beyond next year.
</P>
<P>
   If Walt Frazier couldn't finish his career in New York, please
spare me any whining or wheezing about Ewing possibly moving on
after 15 fruitful yet also frustrating seasons. On judgment day in
the court of great players, Frazier is remembered as everything
Ewing is not. He was an improvisational genius, a showman who
connected with the crowd. And when his team found itself in a
seventh game, the championship riding on one 1970 spring night
against Wilt and the Lakers, Frazier responded with the game of his
adult life.
</P>
<P>
   If the 11th-hour edges of the proposed four-team trade are
resolved, if it is the end for Ewing in New York, no one can say
the 1990s Knicks didn't spend all they could to help put him in the
same position as Frazier, 30 years ago. The personnel moves weren't
always the best. The surrounding players were never as good. The
opposition, particularly in the person of Michael Jordan, was
almost always better. But Ewing did have Game 7 in Houston, 1994,
when it was he against Hakeem Olajuwon, and Ewing stood passively
back in the fourth quarter and watched his best championship
opportunity hoisted into oblivion by John Starks.
</P>
<P>
   The quest continued, and in the heat of the playoffs and in
recent seasons under painful conditions, it seemed courageous and
real. But there was always the other side of Ewing, whose stubborn
streak stretched well past the limits of pride. If Ewing is to
leave New York _ and it is difficult to imagine the Knicks pulling
him back now _ he will go because the organization made a perfectly
prudent decision not to extend a contract that is already
hopelessly inflated in terms of his 38-year-old worth.
</P>
<P>
   Someone close to Ewing said Monday that once the Knicks made it
clear that a contract extension was not forthcoming, his immediate
response was to caucus with his agent, David Falk, to plan a
strategy to obtain it elsewhere. That Ewing would be willing to go
to a team that is the fifth- or sixth-best in its conference speaks
volumes about his primary interest at the stage of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle plays in the conference of the most recent champions,
San Antonio and Los Angeles, and of Duncan and Shaquille. But here
is the catch: the Sonics did not make the playoffs two years ago
and most recently lost in the first round. Seattle is a place that
will not frown upon being led to the second or third round by
Ewing, as was New York. It might even be appreciative enough to pay
him more millions to do it again, and again.
</P>
<P>
   Cynicism of Ewing's motives must be tempered with those of the
Knicks, who now maneuver frantically and perhaps foolishly to
justify their continuous warfare on the middle class fan. Over the
past decade, ticket prices have swelled, along with the franchise
player's head, as the Knicks indulged him every which way to make
him happy and maintain their illusion of contention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was devastated when I got traded,'' Walt Frazier said. ``But
you know what? It turned out better for me. People equated the
Knicks' decline with my leaving, even though we were declining
anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Declining or retooling, the Knicks won't be Patrick Ewing's
problem anymore if this deal is made, and he won't be theirs. &QL;

PEPPER SPRAY ENDS FIRST LADY'S VISIT 
 
</HEADLINE>
  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   YONKERS, N.Y. _ Hillary Rodham Clinton's appearance at a
community center ended abruptly Monday afternoon when a woman in
the audience inadvertently discharged a pepper-gas canister in her
purse, sending people, many of them coughing, out of the building.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was posing for pictures with children and taking
questions at the Nepperhan Community Center when the room broke out
in a wave of coughs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's Secret Service contingent escorted Clinton outside,
and there she continued to shake hands, give autographs and pose
for photographs. Her aides said she was not affected by the release
of the gas, but she left ahead of schedule to make way for
firetrucks called to investigate the release of the pepper gas.
</P>
<P>
   The pepper gas canister was inadvertently set off by Ka'ttie
Coleman, a Democratic district leader, who was seated in a
wheelchair about 50 feet from where Clinton was speaking. Coleman,
who was questioned by Secret Service agents, said that she had
placed an organizer into her purse, which had set off the pepper
gas canister.
