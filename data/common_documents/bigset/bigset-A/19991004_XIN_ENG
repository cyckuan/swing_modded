<HEADLINE> Kuwait Seeks Higher Oil Prices to Erase Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Oil-rich Kuwait is working
to achieve higher oil prices in the world market to help erase the
country's big budget deficit, a Kuwaiti oil official said here on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The reasonable price for Brent crude should be 25-28 U.S.
dollars per barrel (dpb), said Kuwaiti Oil Minister Saud Nasser
Al-Sabah, quoted by official Kuwait News Agency.
</P>
<P>
"Reaching this reasonable price is vital for our economy and we
are working to achieve it," Saud said.
</P>
<P>
He said if the price for Brent oil could reach the 25-28
dollars mark, "so when we calculate the average annual price, we
will conclude the price for Kuwaiti crude ranges between 20-21
dpb."
</P>
<P>
"This is the reasonable price of the Kuwaiti oil, which is
enough to erase the budget deficit of the current fiscal year,"
Saud said.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's 4.25 billion dinars (14.025 billion dollars) budget
for 1999/2000 carries a gross deficit of 2.248 billion dinars
(7.418 billion dollars). The government based its projection of
the 1.761 billion dinars (5.811 bullion dollars) oil revenues on a
price of 10 dpb.
</P>
<P>
Saud was upbeat over a possible increase in oil prices. He said
prices will pick up as winter sales have not started yet.

<HEADLINE> Germans Celebrate Reunification Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Germans Sunday
celebrated the ninth anniversary of the reunification, both in the
city of Wiesbaden in the west and in the capital of Berlin.
</P>
<P>
In Wiesbaden, the celebration was featured with a speech of
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, who said that German reunification
was far from fully realized, and there was still a huge gap
between Germans leaving in the west and those in the east.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a festivity to mark the national holiday, Schroeder
said, "Although the border between the west and the east has
disappeared, the economic and social borders still exist."
</P>
<P>
The building-up of the east needs Germans to pay more for the
solidarity until after the year 2004, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder called October 3 "the day of thanks to German
people." He praised the leading roles in the then West Germany for
their "solidarity and readiness to help (the east Germans)."
</P>
<P>
"That kind of solidarity is also required in the coming years,"
said Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder, also chairman of the Social Democratic Party (SPD),
called for more social equality in the German society.
</P>
<P>
"Only if people profit from society and have a say in its
workings, can Germany face the challenge of globalization," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Attending the ceremony were more than 1,000 people, including
President of the European Commission Romano Prodi, German
President Johannes Rau, and Wolfgang Thierse, president of the
German parliament's lower chamber, the Bundestag.
</P>
<P>
Noting Germany's importance in Europe's peace and stability,
Prodi said the difficulty in German reunification reflected the
problems in the eastward enlargement of the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
"The enlargement is not simple, but it gives Europe an
opportunity for peace and prosperity, after all those bleeding and
horrible conflicts in this century," said Prodi, who was the main
speaker at the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
He set the planned structural reform as a prerequisite of the
EU's enlargement, saying that the present institutions of the EU
were not able to manage a block of 25 or 30 member countries.
</P>
<P>
The new members in the future EU, Prodi said, would enjoy equal
rights just as the current members, since no "second class
membership" will be allowed in the EU.
</P>
<P>
Rau said in his speech that he was pleased with the progress in
the eastern states after the reunification.
</P>
<P>
"I have not yet forgotten the astonishment in German
reunification," said Rau, adding, "I am pleased by what the people
in the so-called new states have achieved during this period."
</P>
<P>
The ceremony in Wiesbaden, under the name of "common life,
common celebration," was held with a special church service
jointly by leading Protestant clergyman Peter Steinacker and his
Catholic counterpart, Franz Kamphause.
</P>
<P>
In Berlin, thousands of people rallied in the streets under the
motto of "Germany Celebrates 99 -- We're All of One Country."
</P>
<P>
Floats and groups in period costume depicting the 50-year
history of federal Germany, with mayor Eberhard Diepgen on head,
passed through the famous Brandenburg Gate before a street party
in the city got underway.
</P>
<P>
In the evening, the celebrations rounded off with a concert by
the Berlin Philharmonic conducted by Claude Abbado and attended by
Johannes Rau as a guest of honor.

<HEADLINE> Iran Intends to Free Hostage by Force: Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Interior Ministry is
planning to use force to free the three Portuguese nationals
kidnapped by drug smugglers, an official of the ministry has said.
</P>
<P>
The official said "we will use force to teach a lesson to the
drug traffickers who must stop this sort of blackmailing," the
English daily Tehran Times reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The clan called "narooi" in Iran's southeastern province of
Sistan-Baluchistan, which is notorious for drug-trafficking, was
responsible for the kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
"One of the clan members was arrested in Karaj with a huge
amount of morphine; the next day they kidnapped the three
portuguese near the Pakistani border," he said, adding that they
are demanding the release of the arrested narooi smuggler.
</P>
<P>
The official said every time a drug smuggler is arrested, they
kidnap some one; but he stressed "this time, we will teach a
lesson so that they do not repeat such a thing."
</P>
<P>
The three Portuguese nationals were taken hostage by drug
smugglers last month near the city of Zahedan, close to the
Pakistani border. This was the third kidnapping of foreigners in
four months.
</P>
<P>
In June, three Italians were abducted in southwestern Iran and
freed unharmed after a week in captivity.
</P>
<P>
In mid-August, the scenario was repeated. Four European tourists
and an Iranian national were abducted by suspected drug smugglers
in southeastern Iran and were released two weeks later.
</P>
<P>
Southeastern Iran is on the main route for drug smugglers
heading from Pakistan and Afghanistan to Europe. The so-called
Gold Crescent that overlaps parts of Iran, Pakistan and
Afghanistan, is one of the flagrant drug-producing areas.

<HEADLINE> Earthquake Rocks Athens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, October 3 (Xinhua) -- An earthquake measuring 4.1 on
the Richter scale rocked the Greek capital city of Athens Sunday
evening.
</P>
<P>
This is one of the fresh aftershocks following the September 7
earthquake which had an epicenter in the Parnitha region, some 20
kilometers northwest of Athens.
</P>
<P>
A total of 143 people were killed and more than 2,000 others
injured and some 60,000 left homeless in the earthquake, which is
estimated to cost Greece more than 200 billion drachmas (about 645
million U.S. dollars)
</P>
<P>
Some 100 buildings collapsed in the earthquake and of the
buildings inspected by state engineers, around 40,000 have
sustained serious or slight damage.
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are some different views in Greece that there
will be a possible strong earthquake in Athens.
</P>
<P>
The Van team had predicted that an earthquake registering
between 5 and 6 on the Richter scale would hit somewhere between
Athens and the central Greek city of Lamia by Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Van team, led by Prof. Panayiotis Varotsos, claims that it
can predict earthquakes by reading electrical activity in the
earth, but most seismologists and government officials say that
these findings can only be regarded as experiments and research
and cannot be seen as predictions as they are either vague or
mistaken on time, location and magnitude.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus, Greece "Perfect" in Military Cooperation: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Cooperation on military and
defense matters between Cyprus and Greece is "perfect", the
defense ministers of the two countries said here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Cypriot Defense Minister Socrates Hasikos and his Greek
counterpart Akis Tsohatzopoulos also vowed that this cooperation
will continue. Tsohatzoupoulos is here on a four-day official
visit.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers told a press conference that Cyprus' defense
capability is at a very high standard.
</P>
<P>
On attempts to settle the Cyprus issue, Tsohatzopoulos noted
the unprecedented effort by the U.S. to help reach a settlement
but called for "great care" in dealing with any moves that may
promote other goals.
</P>
<P>
Tsohatzopoulos said both Greece and Cyprus see the prospect of
Turkey joining the European Union in a positive light provided
Ankara contributes to the peace effort and paves the way for
substantive negotiations leading to a solution in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
On defense matters the Greek minister said he was certain
Cyprus' armed forces were at the peak of their readiness and the
art of war.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers watched earlier part of the annual military
manoeuvres of Cyprus' National Guard "Nikiforos 99".
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Cyprus reached an agreement in November, 1993
that Greek will offer Cyprus land, sea and air cover in the
event of fresh Turkish attacks.

<HEADLINE> BOOT Helps Egypt Attract Foreign Capital: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal
El-Ganzouri said on Sunday that implementing infrastructural
projects under the build-own-operate-transfer (BOOT) system
enables Egypt to pump foreign investments that are accompanied by
the most advanced technology.
</P>
<P>
El-Ganzouri made the remark at a signing ceremony of four
contracts between the Egyptian Electricity Authority and
Electricite de France (EdF) on the building of two power stations
under the BOOT system.
</P>
<P>
He said the BOOT system helps Egypt curb borrowing from foreign
countries and international financial institutions or imposition
of new taxes or dues aimed at amassing funds for infrastructural
construction.
</P>
<P>
Building infrastructure projects such as power stations,
seaports, airports and roads under the BOOT system reflects
President Hosni Mubarak's keenness on building the foundations of
development for the country, he added.
</P>
<P>
The BOOT system has helped Egypt attract billions of dollars of
foreign investments in the fields including industry, agriculture
and tourism, a move that reflects the confidence of other
countries in Egypt's economic policy and political stability, the
prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
Under the contracts, EdF will invest 750 million dollars in the
building of two power stations in each of East Port Said and
Suez. Each of the stations has a capacity of 650 megawatts. EdF
will run the power station and sell the product to Egypt in a
period of 20 years.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Electricity Authority has planned to invite
foreign investors to build more than 10 power stations in this way
before 2005.

<HEADLINE> Germany Welcomes Expansion of Ties With Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 3 (Xinhua) -- German Deputy Economy Minister
Axel Gerlaq said here Sunday that Germany welcomes expansion of
ties with Iran.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 25th Tehran International Fair, Gerlaq said
that Germany is prepared to increase import of Iranian goods, but
he stressed that Germany-Iran ties have not had the necessary
stability in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Iran and Germany were cooled down in April
1997 after a Berlin court accused Iran of sponsoring assassination
of four Iranian Kurdish leaders in Berlin in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The Berlin court rule triggered a diplomatic row between Iran
and members of the European Union (EU), which recalled their
ambassadors from Tehran in a protest. The two sides ended their
dispute in November 1997 after the EU states agreed to return
their ambassadors.
</P>
<P>
Gerlaq, who is in Tehran for the Tehran International Fair,
said that Iranian goods are facing intense competition from other
countries in Europe and new ideas are needed to ensure success in
European markets.
</P>
<P>
German Ambassador to Iran Klaus Celler expressed satisfaction
with Iranian President Mohammad Khatami's visit to the German
pavilion at the fair and hoped that Khatami will visit Germany
upon an invitation of the German chancellor.
</P>
<P>
He also said participation of more than 100 German companies in
the ongoing trade fair in Tehran reflects Germany's interest in
strengthening bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Germany is Iran's largest trade partner in west Europe, with
Germany's exports to Iran reaching 1.7 billion U.S. dollars last
Iranian year ending March 20 this year and Iran's non-oil products
exports to the European state amounting to 410 million dollars.

CAIRO, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Three people were killed and two
others injured on Sunday when a building collapsed in Cairo,
police officials said.
</P>
<P>
Karima Mohammed el-Sayyed and her husband, Abbas Mustapha, both
66, died when their old four-story building crashed, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
El-Sayyed's sister, Fatima, 64, was also killed. Another

when they were visiting el-Sayyed's home.
</P>
<P>
No other people were in the building, which is in the capital's
Sayida Zeinab neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
Police advised the residents in 1993 to leave the building for
fear that it might collapse, but some families did not follow the
advice.
</P>
<P>
Building collapses are common in Egypt due to shoddy
construction, poor materials or additions built without permits.

<HEADLINE> Millions of Tanzanians Pray for Nyerere's Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Millions of Tanzanians
continue to pray for the ailing former president Julius Nyerere a
quick recovery.
</P>
<P>
People in northern town Arusha prayed at churches, mosques and
temples for Nyerere who is admitted at St. Thomas!/ Hospital in
London for leukemia and other health complications.
</P>
<P>
The Arusha Regional Commissioner, Daniel Ole Njoolay, led the
prayers Sunday at a Lutheran Church. They all wished Nyerere,
revered as the founding father, an early recovery and God to grant
him special strength so that he could overcome his illness and
come back home safely.
</P>
<P>
In the capital Dar es Salaam, Azania Front Lutheran Church and
several others in the city conducted prayers for Nyerere, a major
figure in post- colonial Africa.
</P>
<P>
The Youth General Council Executive Committee of the ruling
Chama Cha Mapinduzi, which ended its two-day session in Dar es
Salaam Sunday, expressed concern over Nyerere's health and wished
him quick recovery and good health.
</P>
<P>
The committee conducted special prayer for Nyerere, 77, and
appealed to all youth countrywide to pray for him in response to a
call made by President Benjamin Mkapa.
</P>
<P>
According to two bulletins released by the State House Sunday,
doctors attending Nyerere said that there is every possibility for
Nyerere to recover. However, they said his critical condition has
not changed.
</P>
<P>
The doctors said they have so far managed to control some of
his health complications, and X-ray checks indicated that most of
the important parts of his body are stable and jaundice
complications are decreasing.
</P>
<P>
President Mkapa telephoned the elderly African statesman's wife
Maria Nyerere, who is at the bedside of his husband, and wished
Nyerere all the best. The government has vowed to try all means to
save the founding father' s life, government spokesman Geoffrey
Nkurlu said.
</P>
<P>
The first lady Anna Mkapa is also offering help at the
hospital, together with three sons and two daughters of Nyerere,
who was admitted to the hospital nine days ago.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere led the then Tanganyika to independence from Britain in
1961 and masterminded its union Zanzibar isles in 1964 to form
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
After retiring as president in 1985, he played an advisory role
in both Tanzanian politics and African affairs. He tirelessly
mediated Burundi peace talks since 1996.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere is addressed throughout Africa as Mwalimu, or teacher
in Kiswahili, for his wisdom and integrity.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Administration and Local Government, Kingunge
Ngombale-Mwiru, is in London administering issues concerning
Nyerere in collaboration with Tanzanian High Commission in
Britain.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus to Place New Ceiling on Age of Ships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus announced here Sunday
that as of 1 January 2000 it will introduce a new policy for the
registration of ships under the Cyprus flag, placing a new ceiling
on the age of ships.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made by Cyprus' Minister of
Communications and Works Averof Neophytou, at the opening of a
four-day international meeting on shipping.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, attended by some 1,000 delegates from 35
countries, will deal with international brokering, ship finance,
the tanker industry, marine insurance, European Union (EU) safety
policy and use of information technology in shipping.
</P>
<P>
"Under the new policy there is a new ceiling on the age of
ships which may be registered while the age of ships for which an
entry inspection is required is lowered from 17 to 15 years,"
Averof said.
</P>
<P>
He said Cyprus in its effort to improve quality has appointed
additional professional staff at the Department of Merchant
Shipping and has expanded the network of independent surveyors.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus, he said, has decided to allocate all is resources in
the next two years to "safety, pollution prevention and adequate
manning standards" rather than growth.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Iraq Accuses U.N. Committee of Blocking Contracts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Trade Ministry on Sunday
accused the U.N. Sanctions Committee of blocking four of its
contracts signed under the oil-for-food program, Iraqi News
Agency (INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The unnamed spokesman for the ministry blamed the U.S. and
British representatives at the Sanctions Committee for suspending
those four contracts during the committee's session held on
September 28.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said these blocked contracts were signed with
companies of Italy and France and included engineering equipment,
educational prerequisites, medical appliances and spare parts for
the oil sector.
</P>
<P>
Under the oil-for-food deal, now in its sixth phase which
expires in November, Iraq is allowed to sell limited amount of
oil in every six months to buy food, medicine and other
humanitarian supplies for its 24 million people.
</P>
<P>
Since the fourth phase of the deal, the ceiling of the limited
amount of oil has been raised to 5.2 billion dollars from 2
billion for the first three phases.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has long accused the U.S. and British envoys in the
Sanctions Committee of hampering the endorsement of its
contracts, arguing that the oil-for-food deal has failed to
alleviate the sufferings of the Iraqi people.

<HEADLINE> PNA, Israel to Meet Again over Passage Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 3 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli-Palestinian Safe
Passage Committee is scheduled to meet again Sunday evening to try
to iron out differences over the opening of the southern safe
passage route.
</P>
<P>
Saeb Erekat, local government minister of the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) and Mohammed Dahlan, PNA preventive
security chief in Gaza and Israeli Public Security Minister Shlomo
ben-Ami will join the meeting, it is learned.
</P>
<P>
Ben-Ami said earlier Sunday that the committee can soon settle
the contentious issues.
</P>
<P>
The southern safe passage that links Gaza and Tarkumia near the
West Bank city of Hebron was scheduled to open on October 1 under
the lastest Palestinian-Israeli peace deal, or the Sharm al-Sheikh
Memorandum. The opening date was reset for Sunday because of
Jewish holidays on Friday and Saturday.
</P>
<P>
But earlier in the day, Orit Messer-Harel, spokeswoman of the
Israeli Public Security Ministry, announced to postpone the
opening again, saying the two sides failed to settle differences
over some major issues after five hours of talks Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
She said the major sticking points were which side and where to
issue the corridor passes and whether Israel is entitled to arrest
Palestinians suspected of security offenses as they use the
passage.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side wants to be the ultimate issuing authority
for the passes. Israeli newspapers reported that Israel wants to
maintain control in order to prevent forgeries by militants
planning attacks.
</P>
<P>
The delay in the passage opening is the first major setback in
the implementation of the Sharm al-Sheikh Memorandum signed last
month by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi PM Calls for Settlement Through Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister of Bangladesh
Sheikh Hasina Sunday asked opposition leader Begum Khaleda Zia to
fix up her demands first and then settle those through discussion
with the government.
</P>
<P>
"We will do everything possible for the welfare of the country
through discussions," she said while addressing a huge public
meeting in Kachua, about 370 kilometers to the southeast of Dhaka,
according to Bangladesh News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister reiterated her commitment that the ruling
Awami League would never call hartal (destructive strike) even if
it goes to opposition.
</P>
<P>
She said that stability is a pre-requisite for development and
the frequent hartals destroy the stability.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan, secretary general of the
Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), the main opposition party of
the country, on Sunday reiterated the opposition's demand for
resignation of the government and handing over of power to a
caretaker authority to arrange fresh parliamentary polls.
</P>
<P>
He repeated this demanded when addressing a post-hartal
briefing here on Sunday night. The opposition has announced fresh
anti-government programs, including countrywide "anti-aggression
day" on October 11, to protest the "Indian aggression" and "the
government's silence" over the Indian Border Security Force
aggression along the country's border.
</P>
<P>
The clashes during the opposition-enforced down-to-dust hartal,
which ended this evening, left one killed and at least 50 persons
injured.

<P>
JAKARTA, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Muhammad Amien Rais, General
Chairman of the National Mandate Party (PAN), was elected as new
chairman of Indonesia's highest decision-making body, the People's
Consultative Assembly (MPR), on Sunday midnight.
</P>
<P>
Born in Solo, Central Java, on April 26, 1944, Amien Rais, the

</P>
<P>
He received his primary and secondary education in Muhammadiyah
schools in Solo from 1956 to 1962. Then he studied social and
political subjects at the Faculty of International Relations in
Yogyakarta, Central Java. He continued the same subject in Egypt
and was known as a political expert. From 1974 to 1981, Rais
studied political science and medical science at Chicago
University in the United States. In the early 1980s, he became the
general chairman of the Muhammadiyah, the second largest Muslim
organization in the country.
</P>
<P>
In 1990, Rais became the chairman of the experts commission of
the Association of Indonesian Muslim Intellectuals (ICMI) headed
by B.J. Habibie. In February 1997, he withdrew from ICMI and then
took an active part in the struggle against former president
Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
On August 23, 1998, Rais established the National Mandate Party
and was elected its general chairman. He was a leading critic of
the Soeharto regime and kept a high profile during the student
protests in May last year that triggered Soeharto's fall from
power.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Vice President's Visit to Egypt Private: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 3 (Xinhua) -- The current visit by an Iraqi vice
president to Egypt has "no political implications," a top Iraqi
diplomat in Cairo said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Taha Moheidin Maarouf's visit is private and has no plans to
meet Egyptian officials, Iraq's permanent representative to the
Arab League Sultan al-Shawi told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Maarouf arrived here unexpectedly Saturday on a flight of Royal
Jordanian from Amman, Jordan, Egypt's Al-Akhbar daily reported
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Reports quoted some Arab diplomats as saying that Maarouf came
here apparently for medical treatment and he may hold talks with
Egyptian officials.
</P>
<P>
Terming the reports "totally void of truth," al Shawi said
there are no arrangements for him to meet Egyptian officials
during his 7-10 days of stay here.
</P>
<P>
Maarouf is the highest-ranking Iraqi official to visit Egypt
since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990, which triggered the 1991
Gulf War. The two countries severed diplomatic relations over
Egypt's participation in the Gulf War against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Foreign Ministry has also confirmed that Maarouf
is in Cairo on a private visit.
</P>
<P>
Maarouf is not considered as part of Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein's inner circle. But his diplomatic credits are respected
in Iraq. Before the Gulf War, Maarouf served as Saddam's emissary
to foreign leaders, including Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Detent Foreign Policy Welcomed: Kharrazi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi has said that Iran's foreign policy of detent and
confidence-building has been welcomed by world states.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi, who returned here Saturday after attending the 54th
session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, said
all foreign leaders he talked with expressed their countries'
readiness to further expand relations with Iran.
</P>
<P>
Since the moderate President Mohammad Khatami came to power in
1987, Iran has been pursuing a policy of detent in order to
improve ties with the rest of the world and effectively break the
isolation following the victory of the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
</P>
<P>
Iran has so far reached rapprochement with some Gulf Arab
neighbors and normalized relations with European countries.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said that during his talks on the fringes of the
U.N. meeting, he had in mind plans for further promoting economic
ties with foreign countries and activating engagement of Iran's
private sector in the process.
</P>
<P>
According to the official news agency Sunday, Kharrazi, during
his stay in New York, attended the sideline meetings of foreign
ministers of the Organization of the Islamic Conference, the Group
of 77 developing countries, and the Non-aligned Movement.
</P>
<P>
At the meetings, he outlined the Iranian government's stances
towards international developments as well as issues of the
Islamic world, the Islamic Republic News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi and his counterparts discussed different international
and regional crises in the Middle East, East Timor, central Asia
and Caucasus, Iraq and Afghanistan, global disarmament and fight
against drugs, among other topics.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian minister also held talks with U.N. Secretary General
Kofi Annan.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Lashes out at Israel's Settlement Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa on Sunday lashed out at Israel's policy on continuing
expansion of Jewish settlements in the occupied Palestinian
territories.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Israel's decision to expand settlements, Moussa
told reporters that this step is detrimental to the
Palestinian-Israeli peace talks and the general atmosphere of the
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
He said Egypt has urged the United Nations to adopt a
resolution that will denounce Israel's settlement activities as an
obstacle to the peace process. He called on other countries to
follow suit.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is cautiously optimistic about the Palestinian-Israeli
peace negotiations due to Israel's settlement policy, the foreign
minister said.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian-Israeli relations soured in 1996 when former
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's settlement policy
stalled the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Although the bilateral relations have been improved after the
moderate Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak took power in July,
Egypt is critical of Israel's hardline policies.
</P>
<P>
The settlement issue, among other things, is much at the core
of the final status negotiations between the Palestinians and
Israel, which began on September 13. The two sides have agreed not
to take unilateral actions before reaching a final peace deal.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Moussa dismissed as baseless a report by the Israeli
Yediot Ahronot newspaper that Egypt, the United States, Israel,
Jordan and the Palestinian National Authority have agreed to
cooperate in combating terrorism in the region.
</P>
<P>
The report is not true and misleading, and is aimed at causing
confusion, he said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with
Israel. But alongside other Arab countries, it has vowed not to
forge significant cooperation with the Jewish state until a
durable and comprehensive peace is realized in the Middle East.

JERUSALEM -- The Israeli-Palestinian Safe Passage Committee is
scheduled to meet again Sunday evening to try to iron out
differences over the opening of the southern safe passage route.
</P>
<P>
The major sticking points were which side and where to issue
the corridor passes and whether Israel is entitled to arrest
Palestinians suspected of security offenses as they use the
passage.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side wants to be the ultimate issuing authority
for the passes. Israeli newspapers reported that Israel wants to
maintain control in order to prevent forgeries by militants
planning attacks.
</P>
<P>
The southern safe passage that links Gaza and Tarkumia near the
West Bank city of Hebron was scheduled to open on October 1 under
the lastest Palestinian-Israeli peace deal, or the Sharm al-Sheikh
Memorandum. The opening date was reset for Sunday because of
Jewish holidays on Friday and Saturday. (BC-Israel-Palestine-Safe

JERUSALEM -- The opening of a safe passage between the West
Bank and Gaza Strip has been postponed due to Israeli and
Palestinian negotiators' failure to resolve their differences in a
meeting Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
Orit Messer-Harel, spokeswoman of the Israeli Public Security
Ministry said the main sticking points were which side and where
to issue the passage passes and whether Isarel is entitled to
arrest Palestinians suspected of security offenses as they use the
passage.
</P>
<P>
The passage, linking Gaza and the West Bank city of Hebron, was
supposed to be opened October 1 under the Sharm El Sheikh peace
deal signed early September. But the opening has been postponed
for two days by the Israeli side due to the Israel's Jewish
holiday. (BC-Isarel-Passage)

BEIJING, October 4 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese People's Association
for Friendship with Foreign Countries (CPAFFC) held a banquet here
this evening to mark the 50th anniversary of the establishment of
Sino-Bulgarian diplomatic ties.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zhenghua, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress (NPC), together with other senior

</P>
<P>
CPAFFC President Qi Huaiyuan said on the occasion that although

century, Sino-Bulgarian friendship has maintained and developed
further.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Canadian Fishermen Clash Over Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Non-native fishermen clashed with
their native counterparts in Canada's Atlantic province of New
Brunswick Sunday night over the controversial rights on off-season
catch of lobsters.
</P>
<P>
Non-native fishermen' protest turned into violence of pulling
up and cutting lobster traps of the natives at Miramichi Bay. An
angry mob later stormed three local fish plants, destroying
computers, vending machines and refrigerators, Canadian media said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Two trucks owned by non-natives were set on fire on the Burnt
Church Reserve, where a crowd of native fishermen were gathering.
Local authorities have not yet confirmed if it was a retaliation
by natives.
</P>
<P>
Police urged calm from both sides and demanded they start to
find solutions to the problem by dialogue and communication.
</P>
<P>
Tensions have remained high in New Brunswick following a
Supreme Court ruling last month that allows natives to fish out of
season and without a license to earn a moderate livelihood, local
media said.
</P>
<P>
Non-native fishermen are worried that lobster stocks could be
depleted by the time they are allowed to open fishery next spring.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Taliban Hit Out at Tajikistan "Interference" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's ruling Taliban
Tuesday warned Tajikistan not to "play with fire" by supporting
Afghan opposition, threatening "grave consequences".
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the religious militia's foreign ministry
accused Tajikistan of allowing the anti-Taliban alliance led by
Tajik ethnic Ahmad Shah Masood to use Tajik territory for supply
routes to their supporters.
</P>
<P>
Anti-Taliban groups use Tajikistan's Kolyab airbase close to
the Afghan border while Tajik ships carry military supplies to
Masood through a newly-built crossing point on the Oxus river into
the opposition base in Takhar province, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, once again stressing its
desire of having friendly relations with all countries,
particularly the neighbors, seriously warns the Dushanbe regime
rulers that they will face grave consequences of playing with this
fire," it said.
</P>
<P>
"The Islamic Emirate, as the legitimate state of Afghanistan,
reserves the right to react as required in order to counter
foreign interference," the strongly-worded statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban have controlled over 80 percent of the territory of
Afghanistan during their five-year-long war against the opposition
alliance, but the regime of Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan it
established has been recognized only by three Islamic countries
including Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and UAE.
</P>
<P>
At the U.N. General Assembly last week, Tajikistan urged the
world body to consider imposing sanctions against those, in a
direct reference to the Taliban, who "violate the resolutions of
the Security Council and the General Assembly".
</P>
<P>
Last December the Security Council issued a resolution,
demanding the warring Afghan factions enter peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Tajikistan's demand for sanctions is "another sign of Dushanbe
rulers' enmity with the Afghan nation ..." the foreign ministry
statement added.
</P>
<P>
Tajikistan shares a 1,500-kilometer border with Afghanistan
which is guarded by Russian soldiers.

<HEADLINE> Eight Injured in Clash Between Police, Kashmiri Activists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 4 (Xinhua) -- At least eight people were
injured Monday during a clash between Pakistan's police and
Kashmiri activists who made an attempt to cross the Line of
Control (LoC) in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Muzaffarabad, capital of Pakistan-administered
Kashmir, said that police fired bullets in the air and used
teargas shells to stop a march by activists from the Jammu and
Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) across LoC.
</P>
<P>
JKLF supporters gathered at Hajira, 12 kilometers west of LoC
which divides the disputed Kashmir area despite a security
crackdown.
</P>
<P>
Mohammad Yasin, spokesman for the JKLF, claimed that police
fired bullets on the activists who were holding a peaceful
demonstration.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani authorities banned the planned crossing, saying
it will prompt retaliatory attacks by Indian soldiers stationed
along LoC.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said that a crowd of about 1,000 people was able to
force its way through police hurdles and marched toward Midarpur
village close to LoC.
</P>
<P>
The JKLF spokesman claimed that police had detained more than
2,000 of their activists during the last four days. About 200
people were arrested on Monday, said Yasin.
</P>
<P>
Police sources, however, said that they had detained 120 people
in the last four days to stop the march across LoC.
</P>
<P>
The JKLF planned the march to oppose the existence of the
military LoC drawn in 1972 after the last of three wars between
the rival South Asian neighbors of Pakistan and India.

<HEADLINE> Philippine House Speaker Urges Halt to Mindanao Fighting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Philippine House Speaker Manny
Villar on Monday urged military authorities as well as leaders of
the secessionist Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) to end the
fierce fighting in the southern Philippines that has left at least
67 MILF guerrillas and an undetermined number of government troops
dead.
</P>
<P>
"We have seen enough dead Filipinos," Villar said, as he urged
a resolution to the ongoing conflict. He appealed to the MILF to
"sit down and dialogue" with the government instead of resorting
to armed responses, Philippine News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The source of the conflict, military officials claim, is the
MILF's harassment of military patrols in an attempt to expand
their territory beyond Camp Omar in Cotabato, Mindanao, in
preparation for coming peace talks on October 25.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, on the other hand, says that it was the military that
intruded into their territory.
</P>
<P>
"It's ironic that while peace talks are set for this month,
fighting is still going on," Villar said.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated the commitment of the House of Representatives to
bringing forth a lasting peace throughout the country, especially
in the Mindanao region.
</P>
<P>
"Mindanao's potential as a growth area will only be put to
waste if peace and stability cannot be achieved in the region,"
Villar said.
</P>
<P>
"We are doing our best to help the government find a lasting
peace solution that will hopefully begin a new era of development
in Mindanao," he said, as he urged MILF leaders "to keep an open
mind" and believe in the sincerity of the administration to end
the secessionist problem.

BANGKOK, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Two hundred and twenty-one Thai
soldiers bound for East Timor left here Monday for Darwin,
Australia, which is the International Force for East Timor
(INTERFET)'s staging point.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday, 115 Thai soldiers and their equipment already
left for the same destination.
</P>
<P>
Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai, who saw the 221 soldiers off
at the military airport in Bangkok, asked the soldiers to make
their contributions to the peace and stability of East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Commander of the Thai Army's Rapid Deployment Force Colonel
Noppadol Charoenporn was quoted by Thai News Agency (TNA) as
saying earlier Monday that he had told Thai troops that their duty
was not to fight anybody but to restore peace and order in the
territory.
</P>
<P>
The use of force would not be the soldiers' priority, the
colonel said.
</P>
<P>
According to TNA, the troops were also told that gambling,
smoking, drinking and courting women would be strictly forbidden
during their mission in the former Portuguese colony.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has agreed to send a total of 1,581 military personnel
to join the INTERFET and the country's Major General Songkitti
Jaggabatra has been appointed deputy commander of the
multinational force.

An advance group of 33 people had left Thailand on September
17, while the rest of the 1,581 troops to join the Australian-led

<HEADLINE> Nigerian President Not to Implement Extra Gov. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun
Obasanjo will not implement extra spending approved by the
National Assembly to maintain financial stability as Nigeria
rebuilds its economy after 15-year military rule, a Nigerian
newspaper quoted government sources as saying on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The legislature approved a 22 percent increase in spending on
 government ministries on Thursday over the original budget
proposed by Obasanjo in July, according to the Vanguard newspaper.
</P>
<P>
"If we used the budget the National Assembly has approved then
it would mean releasing so much money that inflation would really
rise. It would really be out of control," said one senior
government official. "We are not prepared to see that happen," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo's revised budget severely cut back government
commitments after the military pushed the deficit to 2.5 billion
US dollars before they stepped down in May.
</P>
<P>
The budget cuts were one-point in Nigeria's favour in
discussions with international financial institutions, which were
otherwise worried about the slow pace of privatization, continued
subsidies and an unwillingness to allow a market-determined
exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
But the National Assembly said the rise in oil export prices to
more than 21 US dollars per barrel from around 10 dollars at the
start of the year meant Nigeria could afford to loosen the purse
strings a little to restart the damaged economy.
</P>
<P>
The country's top legislature approved an increase in the
budget to 462. 8 billion naira (4.87 billion U.S. dollars) from
June to the end of 1999, compared to the 443.3 billion naira (4.66
billion U.S. dollars) proposed by Obasanjo.

SHANGHAI, October 4 (Xinhua) -- The first large MD-90 airliner
manufactured by Chinese in cooperation with the U.S. company
completed its first test flight on Sunday in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The 3-hour flight carried 10 Chinese and U.S. aviation experts.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft can carry as many as 165 passengers and has a
range of 4,020 km. About 70 percent of the airliner's components
were produced locally and represent a major improvement in Chinese
aviation engineering and manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
Its electronics and equipment make the aircraft fuel efficient
and relatively quiet, according to experts.
</P>
<P>
China's leading aircraft manufacturers in cities like Shanghai,
Chengdu, Xi'an, and Shenyang have been involved in the project,
which began in 1995. Analysts say that manufacturers will apply to
government departments in the United States to extend their
licensing agreements soon after they finish the second trial
flight, so that the aircraft will be fully eligible for commercial
use.

"Since Bulgaria has, for two and a half years, constantly

<HEADLINE> Beijing Observes World Animal Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 4 (Xinhua)-- Nearly 400 people took their pets
to a playful gathering at Beijing's Changping Stadium for World
Animal Day today.
</P>
<P>
Dogs got acquainted with each other and showed off their skills
by baying at a microphone to the accompaniment of a Chinese bamboo
flute, bowing, standing up, getting leather balls, and jumping
through a hoop.
</P>
<P>
Pet food companies and hospitals for vegetarian pets had stands
around the soccer field demonstrating their products and services.
The gathering was sponsored by the Beijing Small Animal
Association and was the fourth such annual gathering in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The Association's president Geng Binjin said at an opening
ceremony that the purpose of the activity was to provide a chance
for animal lovers to get together and to increase awareness of the
need to protect animals and to share nature with animals.
</P>
<P>
Pets have become a major part of leisure time in China since
the late 1970s when China started its reforms and opening up. But,
because of a lack of awareness of pet care and government
restrictive measures like registration fees and annual maintenance
fees that amount to several times the purchase price of a dog, the
pet population is much smaller than it is in developed countries.
</P>
<P>
Zu Shuxian, a professor at Anhui University of Medical Sciences,
is one of the people promoting pets in the household, who argues
that keeping pets is good for humans physically and
psychologically.
</P>
<P>
October 4 was designated World Animal Day in the 1920s.

Southern African International Dialogue (SAID) conference in
Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe, Monday identified the tourism sector as
the most critical area for cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Economy Tops List of Public Concerns in HK: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Problems relating to the
economy have reclaimed the top spot in Hong Kong, replacing labor
issues which have been the public's leading concern in the past
four months.
</P>
<P>
The proportion of people who mentioned economy-related problems
has gone up from 43 percent to 51 percent in the September survey,
the latest bimonthly public opinion investigation conducted by the
Home Affairs Bureau (HAB) of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
Whereas labor-related issues, which had been the problem most
often mentioned in the last two surveys, were relegated to the
number two slot.
</P>
<P>
"This may have to do with the higher number of job vacancies
registered with the Labor Department and the fact that the Health
and Welfare Bureau is considering relaxing the restrictions on
income and hours of work for Comprehensive Social Security
Assistance applications," an HAB spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"There also appeared to be a correlation between economic and
labor issues as among those who mentioned economy-related problems,
51 percent were also concerned about the current employment
situation, which is higher than in the last survey of 47 percent,"
the spokesman observed.
</P>
<P>
The proportion of survey respondents who mentioned labor-
related problems had gone down from 45 percent in July to 38
percent in this survey. Of this group, 95 percent, down by one
percentage point, reported difficulty in finding jobs, layoffs or
underemployment.
</P>
<P>
Housing, at 22 percent, up from 15 percent, remained the third
most often mentioned problem.
</P>
<P>
Some findings of the survey remained relatively unchanged,
including the 32 percent who expressed satisfaction with the
overall performance of government, the 44 percent who were happy
with the present situation and the 60 percent who were confident
that Hong Kong would continue to be prosperous and stable.
</P>
<P>
The survey is the 84th in the series which started in January
1983. It resulted from the successful interviewing by telephone of
1,447 respondents aged 15 to 64 who were chosen by random from the
residential telephone directories.

Now 11.4 percent of Ugandan population live in urban areas and

<P>
However, only100 housing units are built per year in Kampala
under government plan, and 300 to 400 housing units are
constructed by the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, most of the urban houses lack basic services. For
example, 70 percent of Kampala houses use shared toilets, 60
percent use shared bedrooms, 70 percent have no kitchens and 8.5
percent have no piped water inside.

AMMAN, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prime Minister Abdel
Raouf al-Rawabdeh Monday held talks with visiting
U.S. Under-Secretary of Defense Walter Slocombe on the defense
need and military training of the desert kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Rawabdeh, who is also defense minister, and Slocombe discussed
"army defense and training," said the official news agency Petra
without giving further details.
</P>
<P>
The talks also touched on the developments in the Middle East
peace process and Jordan's efforts to narrow the differences in
stances between Israel and its Arab neighbors, Petra said.
</P>
<P>
The United States has been steadily boosting the defense muscle
of the kingdom after Amman signed a peace treaty with Israel in
1994.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government has promised a package of 300 million
U.S. dollars of assistance in 1999 to prop up the defense and
social security of the kingdom, and is trying to get the Congress
to endorse the package.
</P>
<P>
Washington has provided hundreds of millions of dollars' worth
of sophisticated weapons to Jordan in recent years, including F-16
fighter planes, tanks and armored vehicles, anti-tank rockets,
night vision and border monitoring equipments.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton viewed Jordan as an ally in the
Arab world, and the increased U.S. assistances are apparently
aimed at rewarding Jordan as a peace broker in the region.

DHAKA, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar on Monday agreed in
principle to sign counter trade and coastal shipping agreements
with Bangladesh to enhance trade between the two neighboring
countries, the official BSS news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The proposed coastal shipping agreement would facilitate plying

Bangladesh and Sittwe in Myanmar to reduce smuggling and increase
government revenue, the BSS said.
</P>
<P>
During talks here with his Bangladeshi counterpart Tofail Ahmed

operate private sector airlines on the Chittagong-Cox's
Bazar-Sittwe route and open new border trade point between Meikwee
of Myanmar and Bandarban of Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar also agreed in principle on increasing stay time of
Bangladeshi businessmen in Sittwe to seven days from the present
72 hours.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed to set up pulp mills in Myanmar in joint
venture and discussed the possibilities of setting up a cement
factory along the border using limestone from Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with members of the Federation of Bangladesh
Chambers of Commerce and Industries Monday afternoon, the Myanmar
minister hoped the existing geographical proximity of the two
countries would help promote bilateral trade, economic relations
and technical cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"I wish to assure you that it is my ardent desire to further
enhance our mutual interests and find all possible ways and means
for the exchange of experience and technical cooperation for
mutual benefit," he said.
</P>
<P>
The volume of trade between the two countries is negligible and
unstable despite huge trade potentials between the two countries,
according to BFCCI President Awal Mintoo.
</P>
<P>
The total volume of bilateral trade between the two countries
stood at 10 million U.S. dollars in fiscal 1997-98.

<HEADLINE> Britain's Conservatives Promise Tax Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Britain's opposition Conservative
leader William Hague Monday promised all taxpayers they would be
paying less within five years of a Tory government.
</P>
<P>
He made the pledge as one of five guarantees to voters on the
first day of the party's annual conference in Blackpool.
</P>
<P>
Other key Tory ideas are handing powers over the running of
schools to parents, forcing the unemployed to take any job on
offer and guaranteed waiting times for patients.
</P>
<P>
Unveiling the Conservatives' 43-page policy document, the "
Common Sense Revolution," Hague boasted it would provide a "step
change in the opposition to this arrogant and unresponsive
government."
</P>
<P>
The 60 policies detailed in the glossy document would be backed
by "guarantees of delivery that can't be broken," he added.
</P>
<P>
"The tax assurance is that we will take a smaller amount at the
end of the next parliament as a proportion of national income," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Tories would also use the tax system to promote marriage,
which Hague called "the cornerstone of a strong society".
</P>
<P>
While Hague stressed he was not setting out a full manifesto
for the next election, he insisted he was offering a valid
alternative to the British people.
</P>
<P>
He defined his program as giving power back to the people.
</P>
<P>
Another guarantee from Hague was that everybody who is able to
work would be forced to take a job by the Tories.
</P>
<P>
On Europe, the Conservative leader said he would keep the pound.
</P>
<P>
"When the Conservative Party wins the next election, the
attempt to bundle the country into the European single currency
will stop and we will not abolish the pound," he said, to cheers

The Conservative leader also insisted the new policies

</P>
<P>
But opinion polls still make grim reading for Britain's main
opposition party. Two new polls on Monday showed it still
trailing heavily behind the ruling Labor Party.

<HEADLINE> India Yet to Decide on CTBT Meeting Participation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 4 (Xinhua) -- India has not yet made up its
mind on whether to participate in the two-day United Nations
Conference on Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) beginning in
Vienna on Wednesday, a government official said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The matter is being examined," a spokesman of the External
Affairs Ministry told the press, adding that no decision had yet
been taken in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether New Delhi had been invited for the function, he
said that India had been informed in New York that "although
participation in this conference is for the ratifying states and
signatory states are present as observers, non-signatory states
may also be present".
</P>
<P>
Quoting External Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh's speech at the
U.N. General Assembly in New York on September 22, the spokesman
said India was engaged in discussions on a range of issues
including CTBT and that they would be resumed by the new
government which will be formed this month.
</P>
<P>
He said that India remained ready to bring these discussions to
a successful conclusion.
</P>
<P>
"Naturally this requires the creation of a positive environment
as we work towards creating the widest possible consensus
domestically. We also expect that other countries shall adhere to
this treaty without any conditions," he said.
</P>
<P>
CTBT has so far been signed by 154 countries and ratified by
only 23 countries while it needs to be ratified by 44 nuclear
capable countries for entry into force.

<HEADLINE> People Development Vital to Singapore: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's New President S.
Nathan Monday said people development is vital to achieve
Singapore's vision for next millennium and the key requirement to
build his country's brighter future is "to develop our people and
strengthen our social bonds."
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening of the Second Session of the Ninth
Parliament of Singapore, Nathan said, "People will be the major
focus of my government's policy."
</P>
<P>
The president promised his government will create more
opportunities and space for citizens to develop to their full
potential, to get Singaporeans to play a full part in shaping his
country's future and to make everyone has a part to play in
building Singapore and has a share in its success.
</P>
<P>
Nathan said the government will refocus the education system to
prepare the next generation for a knowledge-based economy, to
develop a national system for life learning and continue to
attract foreign talent so as to make Singapore "a center of
opportunity, a global hub where people, idea and capital come
together to spark still more new ideas and opportunities."
</P>
<P>
Noting that "what really makes Singapore tick, and makes all
the other hardware and software work is our Heartware", the
president said his government will implement programs to
strengthen that Heartware of Singapore with a view to developing
social cohesion and strengthening active citizenship.
</P>
<P>
Drawing attention to the increasing aging population in
Singapore and emphasizing the need to maintain social cohesion
between the young and old, Nathan said his government will
encourage strong extended families and to maintain and reinforce
the role of the family which is the first line of care for its
older members and primary avenue for the young to support the old
and for transmitting values from generation to generation.
</P>
<P>
"We want citizens to plan for old age, stay healthy, active,
secure and continue to contribute to society," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president also said his government will care for the less
successful and look after the less fortunate in the society.
</P>
<P>
The government will develop a Singaporean model of a local
community social safety net that renders help where it is needed
but does not undermine incentives for people to be self-reliant
and to strive to uplift themselves, he added.
</P>
<P>
In conclusion, Nathan said Singapore has to respond creatively
to the challenges of globalization and the knowledge-based economy
and "Globalization must not weaken the sense of mutual obligation
between us, between the more and less successful."
</P>
<P>
Nathan was sworn in as Singapore's sixth president on September
1.

<HEADLINE> Greek Jets Take Part in Cyprus' Military Exercises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Four Greek jets on Monday took
part in Cyprus' National Guard annual military exercises
code-named "Nikiforos '99", the Cyprus News Agency (CNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Two A-7 Consair bombers of the Greek air force participated in
one of the phases of the six-day exercises, which started last
Saturday, in Nicosia district while two F-16s took part in another
phase in the southwestern Paphos district.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus' Defense Minister Socrates Hasikos watched the exercise
in Nicosia district accompanied by National Guard Commander,
Lieutenant-General Demetrios Demou.
</P>
<P>
Hasikos noted Greece's presence in the Cyprus' military
manoeuvres in a statement, stressing the "excellent" cooperation
between the military commands of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus and Greece reached an agreement in November 1993 that
Greece will offers Cyprus land, sea and air cover in the event of
fresh Turkish attacks.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriot-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriot-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
The exercises aim to test the Cypriot military's preparedness
and to train soldiers under realistic conditions, CNA said. All
branches of Cyprus' armed forces, both active and reserve, are
involved in the day and night-time manoeuvres.
</P>
<P>
The date of the exercises was brought forward this year in
order for Nikiforos not to interfere with talks on the Cyprus
issue which had been anticipated before the end of October.
</P>
<P>
The manoeuvres are usually carried out in late October or
early November. Cyprus' Defense Ministry said the decision to put
the exercises forward had been taken by Cyprus President Glafcos
Clerides and Greek Premier Costas Simitis at their September
meeting in Athens.

<HEADLINE> General Assembly Opens Plenary Session on Older Persons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 4 (Xinhua) -- The 54th General Assembly
(GA) session Monday began a two-day meeting on the older persons,
which is part of activity to mark the International Year of Older
Persons.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of some 64 delegations and eight
non-governmental organization (NGO) are expected to take the floor
at the plenary session to consider the follow-up of the
International Year of Older Persons, GA spokesperson Shirley
Brownell told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, the General Assembly proclaimed 1999 as the
International Year of Older Persons, whose objective is to promote
the United Nations Principles for Older Persons.
</P>
<P>
"It is fitting for the last year of the millennium to be the
International Year of Older Persons, with the theme `towards a
society for all ages' -- a society that does not caricature older
persons as pensioners, but sees them as both agents and
beneficiaries of development," U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
has said.
</P>
<P>
Opening the plenary session, the GA president, Theo-Ben Gurirab
of Namibia, said, "It is encouraging to see that in the course of
this International Year, focal points have been established in
more than 100 Member States."
</P>
<P>
"This clearly indicates that more and more nations are
recognizing a significant increase in the population of their
older citizens who are now living longer," he said.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Deputy Secretary-General Louise Frechette told the plenary
session, "Throughout the year, 99 national committees and
innumerable other actors from all sectors -- governments,
non-governmental organizations, academic institutions and the
corporate world, not to mention the U.N. family -- convened
conferences, organized campaigns, launched studies, held cultural
events and created Internet pages.
</P>
<P>
They are "all in pursuit of one goal: highlighting the issue of
ageing and raising awareness of the implications of the
demographic revolution for individuals and societies all over the
world," she said.
</P>
<P>
The General Assembly is expected to adopt a resolution at the
end of the plenary meeting, which is to conclude Tuesday.

ABU DHABI, October 4 (Xinhua) -- The Gulf Cooperation Council
(GCC) states must work towards greater military cooperation,
stressed a senior military leader of the United Arab Emirates
(UAE) on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"It is necessary to put an end to the problems in the way of
our military cooperation through joint training and exchange of
expertise in various fields, including armaments," said Sheikh
Mohammed Bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, chief of staff of the UAE Armed
Forces.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Mohammed, who was presiding over the 17th meeting of the
GCC chiefs of staff which opened here Monday, also stressed the
need for more government support to increase military capabilities
and to build a unified air defense system.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Abu Dhabi Crown Prince and Deputy Supreme Commander
of the UAE Armed Forces Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, when
receiving the chiefs of staff, reiterated the need to enhance
military cooperation between the GCC countries to attain stability
in the region.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the two-day meeting will produce
positive results in the development of defense capabilities and
the implementation of joint projects.
</P>
<P>
The six GCC countries, namely the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait,
Oman, Qatar and Bahrain, are all represented in their joint
Peninsula Shield force, created in 1986 and with about 4,000
troops based at Hafr El Baten in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, 12 frigates from the GCC countries started
joint naval exercises in Qatari waters.
</P>
<P>
Officials stressed that the exercises, to last until October
15, were not aimed at any particular country and were not related
to the dispute between the UAE and Iran over the sovereignty of
the islands of Abu Musa and Greater and Lesser Tunbs, currently
occupied by Tehran.

ISLAMABAD -- Afghanistan's ruling Taliban Tuesday warned
Tajikistan not to "play with fire" by supporting Afghan opposition,
threatening "grave consequences."
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the religious militia's foreign ministry
accused Tajikistan of allowing the anti-Taliban alliance led by
Tajik ethnic Ahmad Shah Masood to use Tajik territory for supply
routes to their supporters.
</P>
<P>
Anti-Taliban groups use Tajikistan's Kolyab airbase close to
the Afghan border while Tajik ships carry military supplies to
Masood through a newly-built crossing point on the Oxus river into
the opposition base in Takhar province, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, once again stressing its
desire of having friendly relations with all countries,
particularly the neighbors, seriously warns the Dushanbe regime
rulers that they will face grave consequences of playing with this
fire," it said.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban have controlled over 80 percent of the territory of
Afghanistan during their five-year-long war against the opposition
alliance, but the regime of Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan it
established has been recognized only by three Islamic countries
including Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and UAE.
</P>
<P>
At the U.N. General Assembly last week, Tajikistan urged the
world body to consider imposing sanctions against those, in a
direct reference to the Taliban, who "violate the resolutions of
the Security Council and the General Assembly." (Afghanistan-

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Finnish President Martti
Ahtisaari will make a lightning visit to Beirut on Wednesday as
part of his Middle East peace-making endeavor, the state-run
National News Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
During his two-hour stay in Beirut, the president will hold
talks with his Lebanese counterpart Emile Lahoud to sound out
views of Middle East adversaries and speak about the European
Union (EU) aspirations to play an active role in the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
European diplomatic sources said Ahtisaari may be carrying new
ideas to jumpstart talks on the Syrian-Lebanese peace track which
has been stalled for three and a half years.
</P>
<P>
His visit is also meant to relay a message to the United
States, a co-sponsor of the peace process, that is Europe has a
complementary political role in the peace talks which the
U.S. should not ignore, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
Ahtisaari's tour comes when some Arab leaders, notably those
of Syria and Lebanon, are calling for a more active European role
in the talks to offset the U.S. bias in favor of Israel.
</P>
<P>
Ahtisaari, accompanied by Foreign Minister Tarja Halonen and
EU peace envoy Miguel Angel Moratinos, will also visit the Gaza
strip and Israel after a trip to Syria and Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> 1.2 Mln EU Citizens Protest Live Animal Transport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 4 (Xinhua) -- A total of 1.2 million European
Union (EU) citizens have presented their signatures for a protest
action against subsidies of live animal transport which was held
here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The signatures were shredded openly to demonstrate the
"helpless of the EU citizens." The Taxpayers Association of Europe
(TAE), organizer of the event, said in a statement that the
"merciless business, which threatens animals as mere products, is
continuing."
</P>
<P>
Neither the EU regulation on the protection of animals during
transport, which has been in force for five years, nor the
European-wide campaigns for the abolition of the EU-subsidies for
the export of living cattle could stop "the cruel lorry and ship
transport to as far as North Africa and the Middle East, the TAE
said.
</P>
<P>
The World Day of Animal Welfare fell on Monday, so they
launched the protest action in front of the building of EU
Commissioner of Agriculture Franz Fischler, sources from the TAE's
Brussels office said.
</P>
<P>
Actually, the 1.2 million signatures had been handed over as a
petition to the EU commissioner last year. The TAE said that
despite hopeful first signs within the bounds of the EU's Agenda
2000 and a resolution of the European Parliament, the appalling
suffering of transported animals continued as before.
</P>
<P>
In October last year, "the EU Commission even raised the
subsidies for life animal exports by 8 percent," the TAE said.
</P>
<P>
The taxpayers' group also used many official facts and figures
to support what they have been arguing. The taxpayer
representatives said they just want to prove that the existing EU
legal regulations are insufficient and offer too many loopholes to
the traders and transport companies.
</P>
<P>
"Only cuts in subsidies for the export of living animals and an
amendment of the EU Directive, which would limit the
transportation time of `slaughter animal' to four hours, could
achieve a noticeable improvement and could finally stop this waste
of tax money," the TAE added.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Accuses NGOs of Backing  Anti-Gov. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Fredrick
Chiluba has delivered a scathing attack on non-governmental
organizations (NGOs) for supporting dubious publications which
denigrate Africans, Zimbabwe News Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on Sunday night during the question and answer session
by African leaders and media editors at the Southern Africa
International Dialogue (SAID) being held in Victoria Fall,
Zimbabwe, Chiluba said the NGOs were abandoning their role in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
"The NGOs seem to have interests in African issues when things
go wrong, they support dubious publications which seek to disturb
our peace through their writings. Obviously this is not their
role," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said it was surprising that some of the small publications
which could not even produce a balance sheet and with a very
limited number of readers were still able to survive despite
economic hardships facing most African countries.
</P>
<P>
He said it was also clear from the editorials in the
publications that the editors were not interested in development
issues but to serve the interests of the NGOs.
</P>
<P>
He said the traditional role of NGOs has been lost. They have
become pressure groups in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Henry Muradzikwa, editor-in-chief of the Zimbabwe News Agency,
said the only solution was for the African governments to enact
laws that governed the operations of the NGOs.
</P>
<P>
The four-day SAID meeting, attended by most Southern African
leaders and their smart partners from Ghana, Kenya, Uganda and
Malaysia, will focus on building partnerships to cooperate in
economic, social and political issues.
</P>
<P>
There are also representatives from Europe, Latin America and
the United States.

<HEADLINE> Rebel Irish Guerrillas Plan London Raid: Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Renegade Irish republican
guerrillas are planning to attack the centerpiece of Britain's
celebrations for the year 2000, the Millennium Dome in London, the
Times newspaper reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper, quoting unidentified sources in the Irish
Republic's police special branch, said the renegades came from the
Real IRA guerrilla group and that they were plotting a campaign
aimed at high-profile landmarks in Britain.
</P>
<P>
The Irish Republic police said they have received information
that attacks are likely to be mounted around the new year to
coincide with any millennium bug computer problems.
</P>
<P>
The Real IRA was responsible for Northern Ireland's single
biggest atrocity, the 1998 bombing of the town of Omagh which
killed 29 people.
</P>
<P>
Soon afterwards, the Real IRA joined mainstream guerrilla
groups, such as the Irish Republican Army (IRA) and its Protestant,
pro-British "Loyalist" foes, in observing a ceasefire as part of
Northern Ireland's shaky peace process.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted one officer as saying that a bomb spectacular
in England would have a two-edged effect -- it would upset the
delicate peace talks in Northern Ireland and boost recruitment
among younger republicans.
</P>
<P>
Irish Republic police on Friday arrested six people in a pre-
emptive move to avert an attack by dissident republicans.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland's peace process has been stalled for months by
wrangling between politicians from the Protestant majority and
Catholic minority over the issue of guerrilla disarmament.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Foreign Exchange Reserves Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's foreign exchange
reserves fell from 7.2 billion U.S. dollars in December last year
to 5.009 billion U.S. dollars in June this year.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by a review of economy for the first half of
this year issued by the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria
(MAN), the Daily Times reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The association noted that the fall in external reserves
resulted from activities in the Autonomous Foreign Exchange Market
which came under pressure from a massive injection of liquidity.
</P>
<P>
However, the remarkable price increase of oil which is
Nigeria's major earner of foreign exchange has a positive impact
on its foreign exchange reserves.
</P>
<P>
The oil price has climbed from 10.42 U.S. dollars per barrel in
February this year to 15 U.S. dollars in the past three months,
according to the review.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's oil production and export for the first half of this
year were lower than that of the same period of 1998, but "this
drop has been compensated by the oil price increase".
</P>
<P>
For now, "the situation is critical which called for measures
to enhance the nation's non-oil exports, which from all
indicat of improvement in the capital market
with foreign investment inflow putting at 12 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The increase of foreign investment was a reflection of the
increasing confidence of foreign investors in the economy, the
review noted.

<HEADLINE> Burundi Peace Talks Delayed Due to Nyerere's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 4 (Xinhua) -- A new round of separate
consultations among warring Burundian parties, scheduled on Monday
here, has been postponed to a later date due to the critical
condition of Julius Nyerere, the mediator of Burundi peace
process.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian newspaper quoted reliable sources as saying that a
new date will be set pending the improvement of Nyerere who is
being treated for leukemia in a London hospital.

"We have been forced to postpone the separate consultations due
to the current health of Mwalimu Nyerere until further notice,"
said Judge Mark Bomani, a senior Nyerere's aide, in London.
</P>

Nyerere, 77, Tanzanian founding president, was admitted to St
Thomas Hospital for Leukemia two week ago and still remained in

<HEADLINE> Land Fund for Macao SAR Tops 1.2 Billion Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, October 4 (Xinhua) -- The land fund of the future Macao
Special Administrative Region (SAR) has increased to 9.5 billion
patacas (about 1.2 billion U.S. dollars), a Chinese official said.
</P>
<P>
The land fund may exceed 10 billion patacas (1.25 billion U.S.
dollars) at the end of the year if the current Portuguese Macao
government effectively demands the payment of land-using fees,
Yang Runzhen, chief representative of the Chinese side of the Sino-
Portuguese Land Group, said in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
The fund comes from land-leasing approved by the Portuguese
Macao government with the deduction of land development cost. The
total income is shared evenly by the current Macao government and
the future Macao SAR government.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-Portuguese Land Group was established in January of
1988 and will end its work on December 19 this year. The Chinese
side of the group is entrusted to manage the fund on behalf of the
future Macao SAR government.
</P>
<P>
"In the management of the land fund, the Chinese side follows
the principle of stability and low risk, and attempts to obtain
greater profits from the fund," Yang Runzhen said.
</P>
<P>
A major part of the fund managed by the Chinese side is
deposited in banks or used to buy bonds which are rather safe. In
1998, the average profit rate of the fund reached a record of 8.41
percent despite the Asian financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
The Macao SAR government will be set up in less than three
months. Yang Runzhen said that she will find a proper time to talk
about the transfer of the land fund with the chief executive-
designate of the SAR.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has vowed to take
measures against irregularities in the insurance sector by
conducting regular checks.
</P>
<P>
"From now on there will be regular onsite inspections at your
offices. Anybody found not complying with the provisions of the
insurance law will not be tolerated," said the Commissioner of
Insurance Crony Kasamala.
</P>
<P>
Kasamala gave this warning while attending a dinner party
hosted by Imperial Insurance Company Ltd. on Friday night in Dar
es Salaam, The Guardian newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The inspections are also aimed at detecting early signals of
mismanagement in the companies to safeguard premiums of
policyholders, he said.
</P>
<P>
The official urged all insurance brokers in the country to
cooperate with the Commission of Insurance in detecting ailing
insurers, and called on them to immediately report to the
commission all delays in settlement of claims, commission payment
or other unsatisfactory practices.
</P>
<P>
He warned insurers not to bend professional ethics in favor of
the interest of its shareholders.
</P>
<P>
So far, Tanzania has licensed 11 insurance companies, 157
agents and 24 brokers since the industry was liberalized last
year, ending the monopoly of the State Insurance Brokers Limited.
</P>
<P>
In an annual insurance meeting last month, President of the
Insurance Institute of Tanzania Inayat Manji said that settlement
of claims, rate undercutting and lack of professional training are
some of the bottlenecks in the insurance sector.

</P>
<P>
He made the remarks during meeting with Chinese Ambassador to
Jordan Qiu Shengyun when he presented the state credentials to the
Jordanian ruler at the royal palace in Amman.

expressing belief that the upcoming visit would further promote
friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Deputy PM Ends Visit to Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tareq
Aziz return home Monday after a brief and secret visit to Amman
ahead of a U.S. trip by Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Aziz left Amman early Monday morning after overnight talks
with Jordanian officials, including Prime Minister Abdul Abdel
Raouf al-Rawabdeh and Foreign Minister Abdel-Ilah al-Khatib on
bilateral ties and regional issues, informed sources said.
</P>
<P>
The sources remained tight-lipped over the details of the
talks, and it is not immediately clear whether Aziz's surprise
visit is connected with Abdullah`s imminent U.S. visit.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah is expected to visit U.S. on Friday and will meet
President Bill Clinton on October 12 on the Mideast peace process,
bilateral ties and the nine-year-old U.N. sanctions on Iraq, which
was imposed on Baghdad following its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Jordan was once isolated by Arab countries for its sympathy
with Iraq during the Gulf crisis.
</P>
<P>
Jordan normalized its ties with Kuwait earlier this year after
nine years of strains, but it heavily depends on Baghdad for crude
oil. It imports some 75,000 barrels of oil from Iraq a day.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian government has on many occasions appealed for
lifting the crippling sanctions to end the sufferings of the Iraqi
people.
</P>
<P>
Al-Rawabdeh said his government based its foreign policies on
keeping friendly relations with all countries, and will not
improve its ties with one country at the expense of another.

<HEADLINE> Vieira Accused of Tunnel Bust-up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Arsenal striker Patrick Vieira is
in trouble again after an incident with a police officer in the
player's tunnel, following his sending-off at West Ham.
</P>
<P>
The French international, who has also been accused of spitting
at Neil Ruddock, picked up the latest red card of his Highbury
career after two second-half fouls on Paolo Di Canio.
</P>
<P>
After the game, Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger said: "Di Canio
had a great game but I'm very frustrated by his behaviour.
</P>
<P>
"It's not really fair play. He dived and it was just in front
of the bench. I'm very upset.
</P>
<P>
"I think Patrick has to keep his nerves better but the referee
has been cheated by Di Canio.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure he deserved the first booking and I'm sure he
didn't deserve the second one."
</P>
<P>
Vieira hit the headlines last season when he was awarded a then-
record 20,000 pounds fine after his V-sign to the crowd during the
infamous game at Sheffield Wednesday, when Di Canio pushed referee
Paul Alcock to the floor.
</P>
<P>
The Frenchman was also cleared of assaulting a police officer
by an FA disciplinary committee on the same day.

<HEADLINE> Tyson: "I'd Bite Again" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Former world heavyweight champion
Mike Tyson has warned that he would bite Evander Holyfield again,
if provoked, and that only jail has prevented him from ruling his
sport, according to the BBC reports here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on US TV to promote his first fight since being
released from jail in May on assault charges, Tyson said: "If I
hadn't gone to jail and hadn't been inactive so long, I would
still be the champion and no one could last more than three rounds
with me."
</P>
<P>
Tyson bit off parts of both Evander Holyfield's ears in a 1997
title fight, later complaining that the referee was allowing
Holyfield to headbutt him.
</P>
<P>
"I would do it again if provoked. I would do it again under the
same circumstances," Tyson said.
</P>
<P>
"(Referee) Mills Lane was not protecting me from Holyfield's
head butts. He wasn't controlling the situation appropriately. I
would do it again if I see myself bloody and cut up."
</P>
<P>
Tyson, who lost his boxing license for 15 months following the
bout, returned to the ring in January, knocking out Francois Botha
in the fifth round.
</P>
<P>
He faces Orlin Norris on October 23 in Las Vegas and does not
expect any help from the referee.
</P>
<P>
"If he's having a rough fight and there is some foulness going
on, the referee is going to be paralyzed and not act," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody ever has any sympathy or pity for me. In retaliation, I
'll fight back because nobody is fighting for me.
</P>
<P>
"I have to defend myself. It is just human nature to defend
yourself. I just never sold out," he said.

<HEADLINE> Man United Profits Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 4 (Xinhua) -- European champions Manchester
United might have had a rare bad day on the pitch yesterday,
losing 5-0 to Chelsea, but the Treble winners last season helped
the company to better than expected full-year results, achieving
sales of more than 100 million pounds for the first time.
</P>
<P>
The group reported operating profits of 32.3m in the year to
the end of July, compared to 27m last year, and ahead of analysts'
expectations of 30-31m.
</P>
<P>
The share dividend from the world's richest football club was
raised by 5.9% - to 1.25p from 1.18p.
</P>
<P>
Player wages continued to grow, with costs jumping by 7.7m,
including 3.5m paid out in bonuses to team members for winning the
FA Cup, Premiership and European Champions Cup.
</P>
<P>
After player trading costs, and 1.8m spent on professional
advisers' fees during BSkyB's abortive takeover attempt, pre-tax
profits were down from 27.8m to 22.4m.
</P>
<P>
Accounting changes mean player transfer costs take a bigger
chunk from profits than before. This "player amortisation charge"
came to 10.2m - up 5.5m on last year.
</P>
<P>
Turnover increased 26% to 110.7m, from 87.9m, following a
higher number of home games and improved TV and sponsorship
revenues.
</P>
<P>
These helped offset a reduction in merchandising revenue, but
the group says it is confident about future merchandising
opportunities overseas, particularly in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Merchandising sales fell 10% to 21.6m, mainly due to a change
in replica kit supply arrangements.
</P>
<P>
The group - which has also launched its TV channel, MUTV,
alongside Granada and BSkyB - has admitted that subscriptions have
been lower than expected.
</P>
<P>
Manchester United said the three parties were addressing this.
It says it has also launched a website - www.manutd.com.
</P>
<P>
The club's stadium expansion, costing 30m, is progressing well,
said chairman Sir Roland Smith. The expansion will provide another
6,200 East Stand seats in March next year.
</P>
<P>
Roland also said an additional 6,200 West Stand seats would be
available in August 2000 and that Old Trafford would then have a
capacity of 67,400 - a year ahead of schedule.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Disputes With U.N. over Peace-keeping Bills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Whether Kenya will participate
in the United Nations peace-keeping force in East Timor has come
into spotlight following a dispute over 20 million U.S. dollars
owed to the African country by the U.N.
</P>
<P>
The appeal to Kenya to contribute troops to the U.N. operation
was presented by Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas two weeks
ago, the East African weekly reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Alatas reportedly told Kenyan Foreign Minister Bonaya Godana in
New York that Indonesia would prefer a peace-keeping force
comprising substantial number of Asian and African countries.
</P>
<P>
A claim of 20 million U.S. dollars by Kenya for its
contribution to U.N. peacekeeping missions has been outstanding
since 1996, but the U.N. said that it owed Kenya only 4.3 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Godana said that Kenya could participate in the East Timor
mission if funds were provided by the international community.
</P>
<P>
Kenya has sent a battalion to the U.N. peace-keeping operation
in Sierra Leone and a 20-man police contingent to Kosovo.

ISLAMABAD, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Interior Ministry

<P>
ABU DHABI, October 4 (Xinhua) -- A single-engine British
helicopter on a record-breaking journey from Britain to Australia
is due to arrive here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Tim Gilbert and Martin Rutty, the two pilots, will stay here
for two days while their Robinson R44 helicopter undergoes an
overhaul, the Gulf News daily reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The two Britons, who started their epic journey in Cambridge,
England, on September 24, plan to fly 22,400 kilometers and 150
hours in the air before arriving in their destination --
Australia's Sydney. The whole journey is expected to take six
weeks.
</P>
<P>
Their route, covering North Africa, the Gulf, the Indian
subcontinent and Southeast Asia, will take them to 22 countries
with 51 fuel stops.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the Cambridge-Sydney journey is being
staged to raise funds for the international charity organization
SOS Children's Village, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary
this year.
</P>
<P>
Proceeds from the journey will be used to help the SOS
Children's Village in Ibid, Jordan.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Concerned Over Future Safety of Diplomats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has expressed concern
over the future safety and security of its representatives and
diplomatic premises abroad following the peaceful ending on last
Saturday of the seizure of its embassy in Bangkok and the taking
of hostages by Myanmar armed men.
</P>
<P>
"Although this ordeal has been over this time, the government
of Myanmar, together with the world community, is deeply
concerned with the future safety and security of their
representatives and diplomatic premises in foreign countries,"
said a government statement released here Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
"Upon the pretext of the precedent, other radical or even
non-radical groups may get the wrong message that these kinds of
terrorists and criminal activities can be conveniently carried out
under the banner of freedom, democracy and human rights," the
government Information Sheet said.
</P>
<P>
It complained that a number of camps along the Thai-Myanmar
border have become breeding ground of dissident terrorists for
armed violence and sanctuaries for radicals.
</P>
<P>
"These individuals or groups have been staging acts of violence
and terrorism for many decades along the Thai-Myanmar border and
also infiltrating into Myanmar proper to terrorize the innocent
people by their continuous attempts and to destabilize peace and
tranquillity," the Information Sheet charged.
</P>
<P>
The statement expressed regret that the recent incident of the
embassy take-over in Bangkok by these terrorist groups seems to
indicate that foreign diplomats with their families and embassy
premises are now very much vulnerable to acts of violence and
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Five armed men with AK47 rifles, who are all Myanmar students
living in Thailand, stormed the Myanmar embassy in Bangkok last
Friday and held the embassy staff and their families together with
a number of foreigners who came for visa application.
</P>
<P>
The incident ended peacefully last Saturday afternoon with 34
hostages freed and the gunmen leaving the embassy compound by
minibus provided by the Thai authorities after negotiation
between them.

<HEADLINE> Manufacturing Fault Caused Apache Crash in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 4 (Xinhua) -- An investigation indicated
that a manufacturing fault caused the fatal crash of a U.S.-made
Israeli air force Apache helicopter in June this year, the Israeli
army said Monday.
</P>
<P>
An Apache attack helicopter, manufactured by the American
Boeing Company, crashed in southern Israel on June 1 while
attempting an emergency landing. The flight mechanic was killed
and the pilot injured.
</P>
<P>
A faulty part in the helicopter's hydraulic system caused the
crash, said the army in a inquiry. Also, the helicopter's
emergency backup system did not work as designed, the inquiry
added.
</P>
<P>
After the hydraulic system failed, the pilot tried to execute
an emergency landing, but the rotors seized and the helicopter
crashed. The Israeli army blamed the manufacturer for the defects.
</P>
<P>
There have been previous mishaps involving Apache helicopters
in Israel, but the cause was not determined until now.
</P>
<P>
The inquiry showed that the hydraulic part had worn out
much faster than the manufacturer expected. The findings were
passed on to Boeing.
</P>
<P>
The Apache helicopter, in service in the U.S. army since
1984, is meant to knock out enemy tanks. It carries anti-tank
missiles and a machine gun and is capable of operating in
adverse weather conditions and at night.

<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Prime Minister has
warmly congratulated the 50th founding anniversary of the People's
Republic of China and said China's reform is an undeniable victory.
</P>
<P>
"The establishment of the People's Republic of China 50 years
ago is the birth of a new path toward development and success of
the Chinese people," Hun Sen said in a written statement to Xinhua
marking the occasion.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Under the leadership of the Communist Party and the
government with the participation of the whole people, China has
made great progress."
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen, who has paid an official visit to China in February

The problems of food and clothes for the world's largest
population have been solved."

Hun Sen said Cambodia and other nations highly admire China's
foreign policy of peace, mutually beneficial cooperation and

<HEADLINE> Wanted Palestinian Allowed to Cross Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Israel Monday allowed
Palestinian police chief Ghazi Jabali, who is wanted for his
alleged role in an attack, to cross Israel from Gaza to the West
Bank to attend his father's funeral.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Ehud Barak granted Jabali the permission to
enter the West Bank city of Ramallah for the funeral, Barak's
office said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Israel issued an arrest warrant against Jabali two years ago
for his alleged involvement in the planning of an attack against a
Jewish settlement near the West Bank city of Nablus.
</P>
<P>
Three Palestinian police officers arrested by Israel allegedly
on their way to carry out the attack were held for a year without
trial and then released.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Israel had revoked Jabali's VIP pass to cross Israeli
territories without security checks and demanded his
extradition. The Palestinian side denied the charges against
Jabali and refused to hand him over to Israel, which later
dropped its extradition demand.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian security sources said that Jabali would travel in
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's helicopter to Ramallah and
would return to Gaza within four hours.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a group of Israeli settlers gathered at the Erez
Checkpoint between the Gaza Strip and Israel to protest against
Jabali's travel.

<HEADLINE> Israel: Some Progress in Safe Passage Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Israel and Palestinian
negotiators reported some progress in talks here Sunday night, in
efforts to resolve their differences that has delayed the opening
of the safe passage between the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
The two sides were close to agreement on the distribution of
magnetic cards, but differences still remain over Israel's demand
of having the right to arrest suspected Palestinians on the
passage, and the talks will continue Monday evening, according to
a senior official of the Public Security Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Under the Sharm El Sheikh Memorandum signed last month, the
passage linking Gaza and the West Bank city of Hebron was to have
opened on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
But this was postponed after hours of talks Saturday night
failed to resolve two disagreements over who should issue the
magnetic cards to the Palestinians and Israel's demand to have
the right to arrest Palestinians suspected of security offenses.
</P>
<P>
The level of talks was stepped up Sunday night at the request
of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, who reportedly spoke on the
telephone with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak earlier Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat, Gaza Preventive Security
Chief Mohammed Dahlan and Palestinian cabinet Minister of Civil
Affairs Jamil Tarifi were among the Palestinian delegation team.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli team was led by Public Security Minister Shlomo
Ben-Ami.
</P>
<P>
After several hours of talks Sunday night, both sides split up
to discuss proposals raised in the talks. The main bone of
contention appeared to be which side would issue the cards. The
Palestinians proposed a compromise of setting up a joint office
to issue the cards, but the Israeli side expressed concern that
this method could be used to forge cards.

<HEADLINE> WHO Launches Polio Immunization Campaign in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 4 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
launched a nationwide immunization campaign in Iraq Monday to
protect children under five from a polio outbreak there.
</P>
<P>
The campaign will be conducted in two rounds, from October 4 to
6 and from November 8 to 10, targeting 3.5 million Iraqi children.
Two more rounds will follow in next spring, WHO told the press
here.
</P>
<P>
"It is crucial to the global eradication effort to control the
outbreak in Iraq, and to prevent polio from spreading into
neighboring polio-free countries," said Dr. Harry Hull of the WHO
Expanded Program on Immunization.
</P>
<P>
According to WHO, declining routine immunization coverage in
many areas as well as insufficient National Immunization Day
coverage in southern and central governorates, especially among
high-risk populations, contribute to the eruption of the disease.
</P>
<P>
Since May, 16 cases of paralytic poliomyelitis in nine out of
18 Iraq governorates have been confirmed, said WHO. Another 19
cases are being investigated.
</P>
<P>
WHO warned that widespread transmission of wild poliovirus in
Iraq is posing a threat to the goal of eradicating polio by the
end of 2000.

Monday morning in Pakistan's southern province of Sindh, but no
casualty was reported.
</P>

explosive devices went off consecutively in the jurisdiction of
cantonment police station in the town.
</P>
<P>
The first device exploded near Hyderabad Circuit Bench of Sindh
High Court at about 10:05 a.m. The big bang of the device
up-rooted an electric pole and jolted the surrounding buildings.
</P>
<P>
Another bomb went off at the boundary wall of Barrage Colony
near Pathan Colony of the National High way at about 10:10 a.m.
</P>
<P>
The Deputy Commissioner of Hyderabad, Raashid Bashir Mazari,
was quoted by Associated Press of Pakistan as saying that the
bombs were planted beneath bushes at both instances and were of
mild intensity.
</P>
<P>
He said that it was an act of terrorism aimed to create scare
among the citizens. Earlier, he said, three explosive devices,
planted near Court building, Post Office and Qasim Chowck
respectively were detected and defused by the bomb disposal squad.
</P>
<P>
Security has been beefed up in the city to thwart nefarious
designs of anti-social elements adding that thorough checking of
suspected persons and vehicles is being carried out, according to

<HEADLINE> Pro-Israel Lebanese Militia Wants not to Be </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 4 (Xinhua) -- senior South Lebanese Army
(SLA) commanders have requested Israel to take steps to ensure the
SLA not be dismantled after Israel's withdrawal from south Lebanon,
local daily Haaretz reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
the request showed that the SLA wants Israel to guarantee that
the SLA commanders and their troops are not abandoned after its
pullout.
</P>
<P>
The report added that the SLA's senior command is interested in
exploring the possibility of its being integrated into the
Lebanon's armed forces as an intact brigade that would be based in
southern Lebanon. They told Israel that such a step would be
beneficial to enhancing regional security on both sides of the
border.
</P>
<P>
According to Israeli Defense Ministry sources, the late Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin explored such a possibility, but did
not pursue it after it became clear that it was unlikely to
work.
</P>
<P>
The SLA has about 2,500 personnel and many of them are former
members of Lebanese armed forces. Although they have continued to
receive their Lebanese pensions, many of them have been
court-martialed in abstentia and sentenced to long prison terms
and even death. Their main concern till now has been to ensure
that once the security zone returns to Lebanese control, their
sentences would be annulled by some form of amnesty or pardon.
</P>
<P>
SLA is a Lebanese military faction supporting Israel's
occupation in the security zone in south Lebanon, which was set up
by Israel in 1985 for self-claimed purpose of protecting Israel's
northern security.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Agrees to Drop DFLP From Terror List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 4 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. has agreed to remove
the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP) from
its terror list now it no longer opposes the Mideast peace
process, a senior Palestinian official confirmed Monday.
</P>
<P>
During his recent visit to Washington, Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat has requested the U.S. authorities to scrape the
DFLP from its terror list, the unnamed official said in the West
Bank city of Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. move reportedly came after DFLP's leadership dropped
their policy of armed struggle and its opposition to the
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. DFLP has agreed to join the
final-status talks and its leader Nayef Hawatmeh has also been
seeking Israeli permission to enter the West Bank and the Gaza
Strip.
</P>
<P>
The DFLP was one of several Palestinian factions appearing on
the U.S. State Department's terrorist list.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the official added, that the Palestinian National
Authority has also submitted a request to the U.S. authorities to
ask for the drop of the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine (PFLP), another Syria-based radical Palestinian faction,
from the list.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Israel allowed Mustafa Zibri, PFLP's No. 2, to
return to the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Israeli defense officials said Sunday night that the
U.S. decision would have no bearing on Israel's view of the DFLP,
adding that the faction's status would only be changed at the
recommendation of intelligence and security bodies after
considering their actions.
</P>
<P>
But Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh said Sunday that
Israel has to turn a new leaf, indicating that the Israeli
government may allow Hawatmeh's return to the Palestinian-controlled
areas.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Form National Housing Authority: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh will form a National
Housing Authority soon to expand residential facilities across the
country, particularly for the underprivileged people, Prime
Minister Sheikh Hasina said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The government would also set up planned townships in all
district headquarters to reduce the population pressure on the
capital and big cities besides establishing a "New Dhaka City" by
2020, the prime minister said while inaugurating the National
Habitat Day '99 at the Osmani Auditorium in the capital.
</P>
<P>
Following excess population pressure and in the absence of
planned construction of townships, the cities have become almost
"unfit" for human habitation which would cause national disaster
at any moment, she said.
</P>
<P>
To improve civic amenities and healthy atmosphere, the
government has taken up a program to establish "semi-urban
infrastructure development project" in 22 district headquarters,
said the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Listing steps of the government for rehabilitation of landless
urban people, Hasina said the government has taken massive schemes
for providing environment-sound and healthy shelters for the slum
dwellers and other low-income groups.
</P>
<P>
Besides proving shelters, these people would also be given
vocational training and provided with soft loan for creating
self-employment opportunities, she said.
</P>
<P>
House-building loans which were largely confined to big cities
for privileged people only would be extended to the rural level to
encourage people to stay in rural areas instead of crowing in the
capital and other cities, said the prime minister.

ATHENS, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Seven people were killed and 28
others injured Monday morning when a double-decker bus collided
head-on with a truck near Tembi in central Greece.
</P>
<P>
The bus, which was carrying fans of a Thessaloniki first

<HEADLINE> Man United Supports 16-Team Premier League </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 4 (Xinhua) -- European champions Manchester
United supported the proposal of smaller premier league, deputy
chief executive Peter Kenyon said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
It had been said that there was a call to cut the league from
current 20 to 16 teams.
</P>
<P>
Kenyon said United had long argued for a smaller premier league
and that the enlarged European Champions League, now a 32-team
competition, reinforced that view.
</P>
<P>
"We felt there needed to be a reduction in the numbers and that
(the enlarged Champions League) has done nothing to change our
opinion," Kenyon told reporters in a telephone briefing.
</P>
<P>
Kenyon said he believed 16 teams would be the optimum number
for the premier league. Such proposals would meet strong
resistance from the bulk of premier league teams, fearful of lost
revenue from a smaller number of fixtures and the increased risk
of relegation from the elite.
</P>
<P>
The new Champions League format means a team would have to play
17 games to win the competition this season, up from 11 under the
previous format.
</P>
<P>
United, Arsenal and Chelsea are the English teams in this
season's Champions League and their domestic performances have
tended to dip after big midweek European ties.
</P>
<P>
United were hammered 5-0 on Sunday but ironically this defeat
came at the hands of fellow Champions League contenders Chelsea.
</P>
<P>
Kenyon's words are sure to be warmly received by UEFA, European
soccer's ruling body, who have long advocated a reduction in the
size of bigger top divisions.
</P>
<P>
Spain, like England, has a top division of 20 teams and has
also come under pressure from UEFA in the past to reduce the
number.
</P>
<P>
Kenyon was speaking as United reported a 20 percent jump in
annual operating profit to 32.3 million pounds (53.4 million
dollars) on the back of its treble triumph last season.
</P>
<P>
United, regarded as the world's richest soccer club, said plans
to increase seating at its Old Trafford stadium were ahead of
schedule and that it would have a capacity of 67,400 from August
2000 -- a year earlier than planned.
</P>
<P>
The stadium in Manchester, north-west England, currently holds
some 55,000 people.
</P>
<P>
United, winners of the domestic premier league and F.A. Cup
double as well as the European Cup, said turnover jumped 26
percent to 110.7 million pounds -- the first time a club has
broken through the 100 million pound level.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia to Open New Horizons for Disabled People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prime Minister Hun Sen said in his opening speech, "I believe
that this seminar highlights an important thesis for our Cambodian
society as a whole."
</P>
<P>
He urged the government and the whole society to encourage the
disabled people to feel they are not isolated from society or
useless to society and family.
</P>
<P>
"Based on this, the Royal Government as well as the ministries,
all institutions and NGOs should pay more attention to make the
whole society open up to the new horizons for disabled people, so
that the people with disabilities will understand that they and
the society are being together with the same benefits," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to a Socio Economic Survey 1997, Cambodia has a
disabled population of 203,000, or 2.2 percent of the total
population, due to the many years of civil war.
</P>

Komura announced Monday that Japan will contribute 100 million U.S.
dollars to help developing countries participate in the

afford it.

East Timorese refugees in line with an international emergency
appeal to be announced soon by the United Nations.

the same day, he said, President Jiang Zemin expressed sympathies
and cordial regards to the Taiwan compatriots who were affected by
the disaster, and deep condolences for those killed in the quake,
and also expressed the readiness to provide every possible
assistance to help reduce the losses from the quake.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that the central government and all walks of life
responded immediately, and resorted to all kinds of measures to
offer help for quake relief work in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the international community also concerned itself
with the tremor, and expressed solicitude for the quake victims in
Taiwan by making remarks and sending telegraphs to the Chinese
government, and it also prepared to offer disaster relief.
</P>
<P>
Approximately 20 countries, including Japan, the United States,
Russia, France and Britain, immediately sent rescue teams to the
affected area in Taiwan promptly, he said, and some countries and
international organizations made donations.
</P>
<P>
In addition, overseas Chinese all over the world also extended
their solicitude for the Taiwan compatriots and donated money and
goods.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome and thank rescue actions of the international
community conducted through proper channels, and have always
offered convenience as possible as we can," Zhu said.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Coffee Export Sales Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's coffee export sales in
the first 11 months of the 1998-1999 crop was down 10.3 percent
from the year-ago period, Vietnam's business newspaper The Saigon
Times Daily reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper attributed the drop to a continuous decline in
export prices since early this year.
</P>
<P>
Figures of the Vietnam Coffee and Cocoa Association show the
country in the October-September period exported 505 million U.S.
dollars worth of coffee.
</P>
<P>
The average coffee price in the period was a mere 1,395 U.S.
dollars a ton, down from 1,525 U.S. dollars a ton in the same
period of the last crop.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnam Coffee Corporation was Vietnam's biggest exporter,
though its shipments abroad in the period fell to 49,513 tons from
the 93,696 tons in the crop-ago period.

<HEADLINE> FM Spokesman On International Earthquake Relief to Taiwan (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He went on to say that in order to mitigate the damage and
suffering caused by the quake, the Chinese government once
considered the launching of the international rescue action
through the United Nations, so that the affected areas in Taiwan
would attain every possible aid.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations, as an inter-governmental international
organization, can only act in line with its relevant regulations
and, in dealing with the quake relief matters of a member nation,
it has to consult with the government of a sovereign state and
obtain its permission, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
In order to effectively provide assistance to Taiwan, the
Chinese government send a letter to Taiwan-based Strait Exchange
Foundation (SEF) through Mainland-based Association for Relations
Across the Straits (ARATS) on September 24, inquiring about Taiwan
's needs, but the reply the mainland side got from SEF was that
there was no such a need.
</P>
<P>
Under such circumstances, the Chinese government therefore
referred to the U.N. that there was no need at present to set in
motion the international rescue action, Zhu said, and the U.N.
notified that it would act according to the relevant regulations
to comply with the Chinese government's requirements.
</P>
<P>
Although the United Nations does not launch the rescue action,
it does not affect the international community to provide
assistance for Taiwan's quake-hit areas through proper channels,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The present situation shows that the relief effort and
humanitarian aid provided by the international community are
effective and unimpeded, and the Chinese government will continue
to coordinate with the international community on the related
relief matters, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the countrymen across the Taiwan straits, born
from the same ancestors, are bonded with each other in flesh and
blood, and the devastating earthquake have filled millions and
millions of compatriots in the motherland with worries for their
kinsfolk in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"Relevant departments of the Chinese government have been
implementing President Jiang's remarks, that is, providing every
possible assistance to help alleviate the damages caused by the
quake," the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Hosts Fund Managers Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 4 (Xinhua) -- A two-day institutional fund
managers conference was inaugurated here Monday by Sri Lankan
Trade Minister Kingsley Wickramaratne to attract much-needed
capital for the country's stock market.
</P>
<P>
Wickramaratne said the Colombo stock market has been plagued by
a lack of liquidity for some time due to external reasons.
</P>
<P>
The market, with about half of its trading done by foreign
funds, lost 41 percent of its value between May and September 1998
due to the effects of the East Asian crisis and the tit-for-tat
nuclear tests which forced foreign fund managers to withdraw from
South Asia countries including Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
But he was hopeful that Colombo would be a focal point for
financial activities, with its advantages in terms of technology,
accounting standards and regulatory framework ahead of neighboring
countries.
</P>
<P>
The minister's prediction was endorsed by Ayaz Ebrahim, a fund
manager with the Indocam Asset Management Ltd, a Hong Kong-based
investment company with an asset of 150 billion U.S. dollars
globally.
</P>
<P>
Ebrahim told the conference that Sri Lanka would be a favorite
for fund managers as it has central depositing system,
well-established regulatory practices, good transparency and other
investors-friendly conditions.
</P>
<P>
The conference on Value vs Price, Exploring the Potential of
the Colombo Stock Market is hosted by Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE)
in association with the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri
Lanka.
</P>
<P>
It is attended by over 200 local fund managers and 26 foreign
counterparts from 10 countries, including Australia, China's Hong
Kong, India and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
The CSE is tiny in size with a market capitalization of 1.4
billion U.S. dollars, about 10 percent of the country's gross
domestic product.

<HEADLINE> S. African Region Urged to Formulate Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe has appealed to the Southern African region to formulate
strategies to promote economic integration on an equitable basis
while guarding against the bad effects of globalization.
</P>
<P>
The host president made the call at the third Southern African
International Dialogue conference opened in Zimbabwe's Victoria
Falls Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
In his keynote address, Mugabe said developing countries were
less prepared to face the challenges of globalization and called
for formulating regulations or abolishing currency trading, the
daily Herald reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Currency trading and speculation have led to financial crises
in south- east Asia and a number of African countries, including
Zimbabwe over the last two years, he said.
</P>
<P>
The economic downturns triggered mainly by speculation on the
foreign currency market have been worsened by the crippling
foreign debt of developing countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
Thirteen heads of State and Government and about 400 delegates
of industry, politicians from the region, the Commonwealth and
beyond are attending the conference to chart the way forward for
the region grappling with low economic growth, growing
unemployment, spiralling inflation and the AIDS epidemic.
</P>
<P>
"Globalization builds strong economic cooperation and promotes
the interaction of countries to enhance economic development."
Mugabe said, adding: "It should manifest itself in greater
inter-dependence and cross- border linkages between and among the
various countries and regions of the world."
</P>
<P>
Developing countries that are ill equipped to participate
actively in a globalized economy risk being further marginalized
by other players, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The experiences of both Asia and southern and eastern Africa's
worst financial crises in the last two years, spawned by foreign
currency speculators and hedge funds, have alerted us of the
developing or emerging markets to the danger of exposing our
markets and financial systems. Indeed, we now demand serious
reform to the global financial system in order to stop or regulate
currency trading," Mugabe said.
</P>
<P>
This year's session is the third after the inaugural dialogue
held in Kasane, Botswana, in 1997 and the second held in
Swakopmund, Namibia, last year.

<HEADLINE> Sudanese Rebel Leader Wants Talks with Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Sudanese rebel
leader John Garang has said Sudan's opposition alliance was
willing to hold talks with the government this month on the future
of the war-ravaged country .
</P>
<P>
Garang made the remarks at his just-concluded talks with South
African President Thabo Mbeki in Johannesburg, the Business Day
newspaper reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Mbeki and Garang discussed several options
aimed at ending the war in the Sudan, Africa's largest country.
</P>
<P>
Garang, head of the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA)
fighting a 16- year-old civil war in the country, said the talks
would come up with a framework for any future negotiations with
the country's Islamic government in Khartoum.
</P>
<P>
The talks would be held under the banner of the umbrella
National Democratic Alliance which groups northern opposition
parties and the SPLA. The venue would either be Kampala in Uganda
or Cairo in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
"We will be looking at our overall political strategy for our
country. We will be putting together a policy for any negotiations
with Khartoum. We will also review our military strategies,"
Garang was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said he was seeking to learn from South Africa's own
experiences in the country's transition from apartheid white
minority rule to a multiracial democracy.
</P>
<P>
More than 1.5 million people have died in fighting and famine
in the Sudan since SPLA rebels began a campaign against the Moslem
north in a fight for self-determination and freedom from Islamic
law for the mainly Christian south in 1983.

NAIROBI, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Elephants from a Kenyan national
reserve have turned the nearby farms into a mess, uprooting
fences, trees and food crops.
</P>
<P>
The farmers in Narok town of Rift Valley Province usually left
home after 7 am and returned before 6 pm to avoid being attacked
by a herd of 200 elephants,
</P>
<P>
according to Monday's Daily Nation newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The elephant menace also interrupted the order in seven primary
schools in the area.
</P>
<P>
Frightened and angry residents warned at the weekend that they
would take up arms against the elephants if the Kenya Wildlife
Service (KWS) did not tame the animals.
</P>
<P>
They complained that elephants from the Maasai Mara National
Reserve invaded the area annually and no compensation was ever
offered.
</P>
<P>
However, KWS Narok area officer Joseph Nashuu said a contingent
of rangers had been dispatched to drive off the elephants.

The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli and Palestinian negotiators reported some progress
in talks at Neveh Ilan near Jerusalem Sunday night in efforts to
resolve a dispute over security that has delayed the opening of
the safe passage between the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

security passes, but the talks were continuing.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- The results of the elections in Austria "change the
political map there and raise great concern," Minister of
Regional Cooperation Shimon Peres said Sunday in reaction to the
news that the far-right Freedom Party had finished second in the
Austrian national elections.
</P>
<P>
Other Israeli officials also expressed concern over the victory
of the "racist, anti-Semitic pro-Nazi party."
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:

<HEADLINE> Lebanon's Religious Authority Bans Use Koran in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's highest Sunni Muslim
authority has banned the use of Koranic verses in songs, one day
after a famous Lebanese singer was accused of insulting Islam by
quoting the Koran in his song.
</P>
<P>
The authority said in a statement that the recitation of any
verses from the Koran, the Muslim holy book, was only permitted in
sermons, speeches, praises of God and forms of scientific studies
or instructive literature, the Daily Star reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Any singer who quoted these verses in songs, regardless of
intention, was considered to have been remiss with the words of
God, the authority added.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Beirut's investigating magistrate Abdelrahman
Shihab recommended Marcel Khalife, one of the country's leading
artists, be imprisoned for insulting Islam by quoting Koranic
verses in his songs three years ago.
</P>
<P>
Khalife, 49, is famous in Lebanon and the Arab world as a
whole. His songs were particularly popular among young Lebanese
during Lebanon's 15-year-old civil war that ended in 1990.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, he was first charged with blasphemy by quoting the
Koran in his song "I am Yussef, oh Father," but then Prime
Minister Rafik Hariri ordered the case to be dropped after
widespread protests.
</P>
<P>
Shihab has referred the case to a Beirut criminal court and
proposed that Khalifa be sentenced from six months to three years
in jail.
</P>
<P>
After studying the judge's indictment, the Beirut prosecutor
will set a date for a court hearing.
</P>
<P>
The accusation has sparked strong protests from Lebanese
politicians and intellectuals, who don not see Khalife's song as
violation of Islamic law and will hold a solidarity meeting to
discuss the issue on Tuesday.

JAKARTA, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Three civilians were killed and
seven others injured in a new riot in Ambon, capital of
Indonesia's Maluku province, on Monday, according to reports
reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The clash broke out after four members of the security
apparatus led a mass who burned houses in the city.
</P>
<P>
The four military personnel fired on those who wanted to
extinguish the fire that ravaged 23 houses, while the fire-brigade
was not around because of the difficult access to the area.
</P>
<P>
The gun shots and hand-made bomb explosions in Batu Merah Dalam
and Karangpanjang district are continuing, according to the Antara
News Agency.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, a civilian was shot dead by unidentified people on
his way to a Chapel in Batumerah area.
</P>
<P>
Ambon and several other islands in Maluku province have been
the scene of violent clashes between Muslims and Christian groups
since mid-January this year.
</P>
<P>
Local religious figures, along with the military, had tried to
reconcile the warring camps but clashes broke out again in
mid-July, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The unrest in July claimed dozens of lives, injured an even
rnghlcw
bigger number of people and caused hundreds of residents to flee
their homes.
</P>
<P>
Most of Indonesia's 202 million people are Muslims, but Maluku

<HEADLINE> China Raises Efficiency in Patent Examinations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 4 (Xinhua)-- the Chinese State Intellectual
Property Office (SIPO) handled 60,443 patent applications in the
first eight months of this year, up 65 percent from the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
Today's China Daily reported that the efficiency of patent
examinations in China has been greatly improved by the effort of
the SIPO.
</P>
<P>
Patent applications for new inventions and product designs now
can be handled tin a timely manner.
</P>
<P>
During the first half of this year, the number of handled
patent applications was 38 percent more than planned, said Wu
Boming, SIPO's vice-commissioner.
</P>
<P>
Patent examinations are regarded as efficient if applications
can be resolved within 30 months from the registration date, Wu
said.
</P>
<P>
However, he added, shortages of specialized examiners
occasionally caused application delays of up to seven years.
</P>
<P>
To address the problem, SIPO has, since last October, invited
retired patent examiners to help examiners classify application
files in a bid to solve this problem, he said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he noted, the SIPO will publish bulletins
periodically to supervise the quality of patent examinations.

<HEADLINE> Industrial Production Rises Slightly in Bangladesh: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's industrial production
during the 1998-99 fiscal year was only marginally higher than
that in the previous year, The Financial Express newspaper
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The growth was only 0.2 percent, much lower than the projected
2.5 percent, the report quoted a review of macro-economic
indicators prepared by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The country's industrial activities followed a generally
declining trend in the first eight months of the 1998-99 fiscal
ending in July 1999, but picked up at an accelerating pace in the
final four months.
</P>
<P>
To improve the situation, the IMF stressed an urgent need for a
coordinated reform agenda which would address the main impediments
to growth, including infrastructural problems, inadequacies in
financial intermediation, labor difficulties and a week financial
base of many industrial enterprises.
</P>
<P>
According to Finance Minister Shah A.M.S. Kibria, however, the
growth rate of the country's manufacturing sector was 2.5 percent,
and the growth of the gross domestic product was 5.2 percent in
the 1998-99 fiscal year.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Rice Exports Top A Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's rice exports topped a
record of 3.8 million tones in the first nine months, Vietnam's
English daily Vietnam News reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The nine-month figure equaled last year's total rice exports,
an official of the Ministry of Trade (MoT) said.
</P>
<P>
The official optimistically said that the national target of
exporting 4.3 million tones of rice this year is "within reach".
</P>
<P>
He said that over 200,000 tones of rice a month could be
exported in each of the last three months of the year, with
250,000 tones likely to be exported in October alone, pushing
exports over the first 10 months to over 4 million tones.
</P>
<P>
This will represent a year-on-year rise of 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
A slight recovery in world rice prices means that exporters are
expecting higher earnings, although prices are still lower than
they were last year.
</P>
<P>
Asia still accounts for nearly 60 percent of Vietnam's rice
export markets, with Africa accounts for 20 percent, followed by
the Middle East for 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
Europe and the America consume nine percent of Vietnam's rice
exports.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian New Assembly Chairman Sworn in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Amien Rais, new chairman of the
People's Consultative Assembly (MPR), Indonesia's highest
decision-making body, was sworn in here Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
Seven new vice chairmen of the MPR were also sworn in
simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
The vice chairmen are Matori Abdul Djalil, general chairman of
the National Awakening Party, Kwik Kian Gie, chairman of the
Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle, Ginandjar Kartasasmita of
the Golkar Party, Yusuf Amir Faisal of the Crescent Star Party,
Lt. Gen. Hari Sabarno of the Indonesian Military/National Police
faction, Nasri Adlani from the interest group representatives
faction and Husni Thamrin from the United Development Party.
</P>
<P>
Rais, general chairman of the National Mandate Party (PAN), was
voted chairman of the MPR in a neck-to-neck race with Matori on
Sunday night. Rais booked 305 votes, followed closely by Matori
with 279 votes.
</P>
<P>
Rais, a 55-year-old professor in political science, was
nominated by the Reform faction, a coalition of PAN and Justice
Party.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the victory for Rais came as a deal
between the Golkar Party and the alliance of Muslim-based parties
called the "axis force".
</P>
<P>
Rais, who rose to the top of the political scene following his
role in a wave of student demonstrations which helped oust former
president Soeharto in May last year, promised he would continue
the reform agenda.
</P>
<P>
He said he would empower the MPR, which in the past served to
rubber stamp the ruler.
</P>
<P>
"I will introduce a new tradition of summoning the president
every year, not every five years as done in the past," he said.
</P>
<P>
The MPR has a total of 700 members who serve for five years,
including 500 members of the House of Representatives (DPR) and
200 presidential appointees (135 regional representatives and 65
functional representatives).
</P>
<P>
Last week, the MPR agreed to bring forward the presidential
election on October 20 from a scheduled date of November 10, in a
bid to end lingering political uncertainties through the swift
formation of a new, legitimate government.
</P>
<P>
The MPR will then elect vice president on October 21.

<HEADLINE> Central Bank Says Japan's Business Sentiment Improves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Business sentiment among big
Japanese firms improved further in September from three months
earlier amid optimism that Japan's economy will head for
sustainable growth soon, as shown by a quarterly survey released
by the Bank of Japan (BOJ) on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese central bank said in its closely watched Tankan
survey of business sentiment that the diffusion index for large
manufacturers improved to minus 22 from minus 37 in the previous
survey in June.
</P>
<P>
The index measures the percentage of companies that believe
business conditions are improving minus the percentage that
believe conditions are worsening. A negative number means
pessimistic corporations outpace optimistic ones.
</P>
<P>
The recovery in business mood marked the third consecutive

<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, October 4 (Xinhua) -- East China's Jiangsu Province
has been working on a three-year, 12.35 billion yuan (1.5 billion
US dollars) plan to improve electric grids in its rural areas,
since last November.
</P>
<P>
This year, the province plans to spend 5 billion yuan (600
million US dollars) improving electric grids in more than 12,000
administrative villages and 950 town or township seats.
</P>
<P>
So far it has improved twenty-two 110-kv rural power stations
and electric grids in more than 8,400 administrative villages,
benefiting farmers greatly by cutting the cost of electricity,
allowing an increasing number of them to purchase household
appliances that used to consume more electricity than they could
afford.
</P>
<P>
The improved electric grids have also contributed greatly to
industrial development in rural areas, where there is a growing
number of township enterprises.

<HEADLINE> China to Provide More Room for Urban Families </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Offering ideal apartments to
urban families will be a key task for the central government in
the next 10 to 20 years, said an official with the Ministry of
Construction.
</P>
<P>
Xie Jiajin, director-general of the Housing and Real Estate
Industry Department of the Ministry of Construction, said that the
goal is as soon as possible to pair "one family with one apartment
and each person with a separate room with a floor area of at least
13 square meters."
</P>
<P>
Xie said China may expect dramatic housing developments in the
next two decades.
</P>
<P>
To ensure healthy development for the housing market, the
Ministry of Construction has decided to broaden housing reforms
and strengthen housing legislation over the next several years.
</P>
<P>
Next year, the ministry will draft a housing law to ensure the
goal of "apartments for all" will be reached, the director-general
said, adding that the law will also safeguard the rights of
homeowners as properties are bought and sold.
</P>
<P>
From 1949 to 1998, China built apartments in towns and cities
worth 5.24 billion square meters of floor space, and per-capita
living space for urban residents increased from 4.5 square meters
in 1949 to 9.3 square meters last year.
</P>
<P>
However, Xie said, presently more than 30 percent of urban
families are not satisfied with their present apartments, most of
which were given to them according to the old social welfare
system.

<HEADLINE> Sichuan Province Recommended to Global Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Sichuan Province in Southwest
China has been strongly recommended by the World Bank to global
investors.
</P>
<P>
Today's China Daily quoted a recent WB report that the
investment environment in western Sichuan almost measures up to
that of the Yangtze and Pearl river deltas, and that investment
here has grown despite slumps elsewhere in Asia.
</P>
<P>
It is one of China's hinterland regions that investors should
tap first, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The WB recommends Sichuan because the province boasts abundant
natural resources and an improved investment environment, Deputy
Provincial Governor Li Dachang was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Located in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, Sichuan
covers 485,000 sq km, which is 5.1 percent of China's total area.
It is the country's third most populous province with nearly 85
million people.
</P>
<P>
Since China adopted economic reforms and opening up policies in
the late 1970s, Sichuan has witnessed unprecedented economic
development. Its economic potential makes it the most powerful
province in western China.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the province's gross domestic product was 358 billion
yuan (43 billion U.S. dollars), 4.5 percent of the national total
and 10th in the country.
</P>
<P>
The province has drawn up preferential policies to encourage
foreign investment. In 1998, it attracted about 1.6 billion U.S.
dollars in contractual foreign funds, while in the first half of
this year, contractual foreign funds rose 104 percent over the
same period last year.

<HEADLINE> Austria's Ruling Party Maintains Top Position in Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Austria's ruling Socialist
Democratic Party maintained the top position in the parliamentary
election Sunday, but only captured 33.4 percent of the votes, down
4.7 percentage points from the last election, according to
preliminary results released by the Interior Ministry.
</P>
<P>
With 27.2 percent of the votes, the right-wing Freedom Party
led by Joerg Haider rose to the second place to become the biggest
winner in the election, up 5.2 percentage points from the last
election.
</P>
<P>
The conservative Austrian People's Party of Foreign Minister
Wolfgang Schuessel dropped to the third place with 26.9 percent of
the votes, down 1.4 percent points.
</P>
<P>
The Greens joined the winners with a gain of 2.3 percentage
points to reach 7.1 percent of the votes.
</P>
<P>
If the results are confirmed, the Social Democrats will hold 65
seats in the 183-member parliament, a loss of six. Haider's
Freedom Party will gain 12 seats to take 53 seats. The People's
Party will keep its 52 seats, while the Greens took four more to
13 seats.
</P>
<P>
Before the election, Chancellor Viktor Klima had ruled out the
possibility of a coalition with Haider's Freedom Party if his
Social Democratic Party failed to gain the absolute majority.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Schuessel had said he would honor his pre-election
pledge to go into opposition if his party finishes the third.
</P>
<P>
Media commentators here said Klima will find it very difficult
for his much weakened Social Democratic Party to form a coalition
with the only choice left -- the Greens.

XI'AN, October 4 (Xinhua)-- Northwest China's Shaanxi
Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) has
issued a strict regulation condensing official conferences so that

To free officials from unnecessary and redundant businesses,
the provincial Party committee decided to take a number of
measures to simplify meeting procedures which will combine similar
meetings and eliminate unimportant ones.
</P>
<P>
The regulation also requires that provincial leaders to inspect
localities at all levels, but the places hosting them must do so

<HEADLINE> Chinese Seismologists Ready for Taiwan Earthquake Relief Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 4 (Xinhua) -- The recent earthquake that hit
Taiwan has caused great concern among seismologists on China's
Mainland and a team of six geologists and seismologists and
several hundred rescue workers are standing by for quake relief
work in Taiwan at any moment.
</P>
<P>
The rescue group is headed by He Yingnian, director of a cross-
straits earthquake center and vice-president of the board of the
Geology Society of China.
</P>
<P>
Other experts include Chen Yuntai, an academician of the
Chinese Academy of Sciences, who is president of the board of the
Seismology Society of China, and four researchers from the Chinese
Seismology Society and Geology Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
Seismologists and geologists on the Mainland have expressed
their readiness to work along with Taiwan compatriots to fight
against disasters and to take part in relief work by using the
latest developments and their experience from the strong
earthquakes that have jolted the Mainland.
</P>
<P>
The Mainland has a group of highly-trained seismologists and
experienced earthquake rescue personnel and it is a pity that the
rescue workers have not yet been given approval by Taiwan
authorities to head for Taiwan to help in the quake relief work
and researches there.

<HEADLINE> Serena Williams Beats Older Sister at Grand Slam Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, October 3 (Xinhua) -- In a family final, Serena
Williams defeated her older sister Venus for the first time to
take the women's singles title at the Grand Slam Cup in Munich,
Germany on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Serena, the US Open champion, outwitted the defending champion
Venus 6-1, 3-6 and 6-3 for a 900,000 US dollars payday.
</P>
<P>
This was the second sister-sister final between the two
American progidies in the year following their title battle early
in Key Biscayne, Florida in March wherein Venus beat Serena 6-1, 4-
6 and 6-4.
</P>
<P>
Venus, 19, applauded her one year junior sister for the victory
as their mother Oracene sat at the stands with smiles all over her
face.
</P>
<P>
"It's a win-win situation. One daughter is going to win. What's
the difference?" said Venus who also won their two nontitle
matches in 1998.
</P>
<P>
In the Grand Slam, Serena was all over Venus at the start of
the match, winning 12 of the first 13 points and holding Venus to
three points in the first five games.
</P>
<P>
But Venus got back in the match as Serena's game deteriorated.
</P>
<P>
The Williams sisters got a total of 1.3 million US dollars from
the Grand Slam cup as they have already won more than 1 million
dollars each this year.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Greg Rusedski used his big serve to overpower Tommy
Haas in four sets and capture the richest prize in tennis, picking
up 1.3 million dollars as the men's singles champion. Rusedski won
the title 6-3, 6-4, 6-7 (5-7), 7-6 (7-5).

<HEADLINE> Chinese Deserts Formed Seventy Million Years Ago </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, October 4 (Xinhua) -- China's deserts began to form
some 70 million years ago and have evolved from a red color to
today's yellow, according to deserts experts from the Chinese
Academy of Sciences (CAS).
</P>
<P>
Because of a warm subtropical climate during the Cretaceous
Period (about 70 million years ago), there was a red desert belt
from the Northwest to the Southeast, notes Dong Guangrong, a
researcher of CAS's Lanzhou Desert Institute.
</P>
<P>
Since the Quaternary Period (about two million years ago),
northern China has had comparatively cooler temperatures and a
yellow desert evolved in a vast area in the North in an area that
is prone to drought.
</P>
<P>
China's deserts now cover a 1.1 million sq km area, or 11.4
percent of China's total area, most of them in Xinjiang, Qinghai,
Gansu, Inner Mongolia, and Shaanxi in the North and Northwest.
</P>
<P>
China has some of the largest amount of desert land, but there
have been no definite explanations of desert evolution in the past.
So, CAS began its desert research in 1978 and scientists
eventually began to work out China's desert history.
</P>
<P>
Researches have shown that geological structure and climate
changes were the major causes of most deserts in the world, but
the man's destructive activities done to the natural environment
has helped increase desertification.
</P>
<P>
In order to halt desertification, the Lanzhou Desert Institute
is now doing researches on desert developmental and evolutionary
trends with a database.

<HEADLINE> Italian Town Claims 24 Million Dollars for Cablecar Tragedy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Cavalese, a northern Italian ski
resort, has claimed 44 billion lire (about 24 million U.S. dollars)
from the government in compensation for the cablecar tragedy that
occurred at the resort early last year.
</P>
<P>
On February 3, 1998, 20 tourists aboard a cablecar were killed
when the tail-fin of a U.S. Marine EA-6B Prowler surveillance
plane sliced the ski-lift cable above the Cermis mountain during a
ground-hugging training flight from a NATO air base in nearby
Aviano.
</P>
<P>
The claim includes 28 billion lire (about 15 million dollars)
to the owner-operator of the cablecar service.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the London Convention covering NATO
operations and liabilities in a NATO country, the Italian Defense
Ministry should pay for the compensation cost, which will be
shared by Italy and the U.S.

<HEADLINE> Man United Suffers Big Blow in Premier League </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Defending champions Manchester
United suffered a big blow at the English premier league here on
Sunday, when they were whitewashed 5-0 by Chelsea on road.
</P>
<P>
It was the first premier league defeat for the European
champions since December 1998 and their worst loss for three years.
</P>
<P>
The Treble winners also had Nicky Butt sent off in the match as
he was dismissed in the 23rd minute after a retaliatory kick at
Dennis Wise, who had floored his fellow midfielder with a high
tackle in the Stamford Bridge clash.
</P>
<P>
Chelsea had already swept into a 2-0 lead by that time with a
strike after just 28 seconds from Uruguayan Gustavo Poyet and a
headed goal from Chris Sutton in the 16th minute.
</P>
<P>
United, whose last league defeat was a 3-2 setback against
Middlesbrough at Old Trafford on December 19, simply could not
cope with Chelsea's fast, flowing football.
</P>
<P>
Poyet added his second after 55 minutes before an own goal by
Norwegian Henning Berg three minutes later and an 82nd minute
strike from Jody Morris completed United's misery.
</P>
<P>
Their new goalkeeper, Italian Massimo Taibi, looked especially
vulnerable as they plunged to their first defeat in 46 matches in
all competitions.
</P>
<P>
Chelsea manager Gianluca Vialli said: "I'm very happy with our
performance. You're never perfect but we almost were today. We
kept our concentration for 90 minutes and that's why we scored
five and let in none.
</P>
<P>
"We have to keep our feet firmly on the ground. Nothing has
changed. We are closer but we are still behind them (Manchester
United)."
</P>
<P>
United's thrashing, their worst defeat since losing 5-0 to
Newcastle in October 1996, also cost them the league leadership.
</P>
<P>
Leeds United took over at the top, coming from behind to win 2-
1 at Watford with goals from Michael Bridges in the 45th minute
and Australian Harry Kewell on 70th minute.
</P>
<P>
Leeds have 22 points, second-placed United have 21 and
Sunderland are third on 20, all from 10 games. Fourth-placed
Chelsea are on 19 with two matches in hand.
</P>
<P>
England striker Alan Shearer brought his goal tally to 10 in
his last four domestic and European games by scoring after 17th
and 45th minutes as Newcastle beat Middlesbrough 2-1 at St James's
Park.
</P>
<P>
Defender Gerry Taggart grabbed a 76th minute winner for
Leicester in a see-saw match at Tottenham Hotspur.
</P>
<P>
Leicester led after 25 minutes from a Mussy Izzet spot kick but
Norwegian Steffen Iversen fired the London club ahead with goals
on 26th and 35th minutes.
</P>
<P>
Izzet equalised in the 68th minute before Taggart dealt the
decisive blow eight minutes later.
</P>
<P>
Italian Paolo di Canio struck after 30th and 72nd minutes to
fire West Ham to a 2-1 victory at home to London neighbours
Arsenal, who had Patrick Vieira and Marc Vivien-Foe sent off in
the last 10 minutes.
