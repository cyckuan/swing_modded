<HEADLINE> France Rejects U.S. Proposal to Delay Sharing of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 7 (Xinhua) -- France today implicitly rejected a
proposal by the U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen that a
sharing of NATO's Southern Command between Europeans and Americans
be delayed for five to seven years.
</P>
<P>
"The position of France is very clear," said French Foreign
Ministry vice spokesman Yves Doutriaux, in reference to a
statement made by French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette at the
Atlantic Council in Brussels last month that France "wishes a
sharing of responsibilities within the Southern Command."
</P>
<P>
"To that end, we explore with our allies different conceivable
formulas on the basis of a parity of responsibility between
Europeans and Americans in Naples," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen said in Germany this
week that the United States will not study until five to seven
years later a possible sharing or a rotation between Europeans and
Americans in the Naples-based Southern Command of NATO.
</P>
<P>
France argues that a Europeanization of the Southern Command is
an interpretation of the decision made by NATO to let Europe have
a bigger say over its defense at a conference held in Berlin in
June 1996, while the United States continue to hold two supreme
allied commands in the Atlantic and in Europe.
</P>
<P>
France has indicated that if its negotiations with the United
States over Southern Command fail to produce any concrete result
before the NATO Madrid summit in July, it will continue to stay
out of the integrated military command structure of the
trans-Atlantic alliance.

WASHINGTON, March 7 (Xinhua) -- An American man shot to death
five family members before committing suicide in West Virginia

NEW YORK, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The National Aeronautics and
Space Administration of the United States on Thursday became one
of the latest victims of high-tech sabotage.
</P>
<P>
NASA says a group calling itself H4G13 hacked into NASA's
Internet site and announced an attack on corporate America for its
commercial use of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The soaring computer crimes led to losses topping 100 million
U.S. dollars last year, according to a survey of a U.S.
organization.
</P>
<P>
About 75 percent of 563 U.S. companies, government agencies,
financial institutions and universities surveyed by the San
Francisco-based Computer Security Institute reported financial
losses in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The institute is calling for companies to be on the alert for
security breaches. Last year, losses from financial fraud,
computer viruses and theft of laptops and proprietary information
were up 7 percent and exceeded 100 million U.S. dollars, according
to the survey.
</P>
<P>
The survey also showed that only 17 percent of the respondents
reported the crimes to law enforcement authorities. It urged the
public to enhance their information security by training,
publications and set up fire wall like security systems with some
investment.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Political Future Uncertain in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of Nepal's major
political parties were busy negotiating with each other today on
the formation of a new government as the present coalition
government led by the Nepali Congress (NC) party resigned
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Despite the existence of a variety of possibilities for a new
political equation in the country, there is no visible option for
any parties to form an alternative government as of Friday
evening, sources said.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba's three-party government
resigned Thursday night soon after it lost a confidence vote in
the 205-seat lower house of parliament, leaving the uncertainty
which party or parties will form the next government.
</P>
<P>
Main opposition the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist
Leninist, CPN-UML) is believed to have a leading role to play in
forming the new government as it is the biggest party in the hung
parliament.
</P>
<P>
However, with only 90 MPs in the lower house, the CPN-UML could
not form a stable government without support from other parties.
</P>
<P>
One possibility is that the CPN-UML will form a new coalition
government with the National Democratic Party (RPP), a ruling
partner of the present government, local observers said.
</P>
<P>
Senior RPP leader Lokendra Bahadur Chand told a press
conference today that he would be prime minister of the future
government although CPN-UML President Man Mohan Adhikari Thursday
claimed the leadership of any new government with his party's
participation.
</P>
<P>
Chand, who abstained from Thursday's house voting on the
confidence motion tabled by Prime Minister Deuba, reportedly lured
two MPs of the main ruling NC party away from the voting,
resulting in the unexpected fall of the Deuba government.
</P>
<P>
There is also a possibility that an alliance between the NC and
an RPP faction, led by party president Sruya Bahadur Thapa, will
remain in power with a new prime minister.
</P>
<P>
A CPN-UML party meeting today ruled out the possibility of its
joining hands with the NC party, the second largest one in the
lower house, in forming a coalition government.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the party has formed a five-member high-level team
to negotiate with other parties on the formation of the new
government, sources said.
</P>
<P>
If all efforts to form a government with majority parliamentary
support fail, the CPN-UML could form a minority one on its own in
accordance with the constitution, they said.
</P>
<P>
As King Birendra has set Monday as the deadline for the
formation of an alternative government with support of at least
103 MPs in the house, it seems that political leaders here will
have a busy and bargaining weekend.

WASHINGTON, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The share of foreign chips in
Japan's computer chip market improved during the third quarter of
last year, reversing a slump in sales there, The Journal of
Commerce reported today.
</P>
<P>
Quoting a report from the office of U.S. Trade Representative

Japanese computer chip market during the third quarter of 1996, up
from 26.4 percent in the second quarter and 26.9 percent in the
first three months.
</P>
<P>
However, the third-quarter market share was still well below
the record 29.6 percent reached in the last three months of 1995,

<HEADLINE>   U.S. Not Blind to Cyprus Issue, Ambassador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The United States has been
working, but quietly behind the scenes, to facilitate a solution
to the protracted Cyprus problem, a U.S. diplomat said here today.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador to Cyprus Kenneth Brill told reporters that
the U.S., Britain and the European Union (EU) are coordinating
their efforts under the U.N. umbrella.
</P>
<P>
The diplomat made the statements following a report by the
Cyprus Weekly that there was no proposal for a U.S. initiative on
Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted a U.S. State Department official as denying
reports that there will be an imminent "Clinton initiative" on
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
"A lot of our efforts on Cyprus are done outside the glare of
TV cameras and the media, we do it through a lot of private
discussions in the key capitals and with key personalities,"
Brill said.
</P>
<P>
"The American effort and the American engagement on the Cyprus
issue has been quite consistent for years," he said, but noted it
has been stepped up since July 1996 with a series of activities on
the part of the U.S. to try to advance the Cyprus issue forward.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright visited Cyprus last
July to press on with a military dialog between the Republic's
National Guard and the Turkish forces in a bid to reduce tension.
</P>
<P>
Brill noted the Cyprus question was discussed in Washington
Thursday at a meeting between Albright and her Greek counterpart
Theodoros Pangalos who is currently visiting the United States.
</P>
<P>
"There will be additional meetings in Washington next week
that relate to the issue," he added.
</P>
<P>
Brill also made it clear that the U.S. is acting under the
U.N. umbrella and as part of a team effort to move things forward.
</P>
<P>
Cypriot Government Spokesman Yiannakis Cassoulides announced
Thursday that U.N.-sponsored proximity talks between the Greek and
Turkish Cypriot sides will begin next week aiming to create common
ground to allow direct negotiations between President Glafcos
Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash to take place.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded
and took control of the northern third of the island in the wake
of short-lived coup seeking union with Greece. The Cyprus problem
has remained unsolved despite the U.N. and international
community's peace efforts for the past 22 years.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Personnel Mine Defused in Northern Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 7 (Xinhua) -- British bomb disposal experts
defused an anti-personnel mine in the town of Dungannon, Northern
Ireland earlier today, according to British police sources.
</P>
<P>
Police sources said that security officers who had been
searching the area this week for the body of a murdered woman
might be the possible targets.
</P>
<P>
No organization has so far claimed responsibility for planting
the mine but security sources said that it might be masterminded
by the Irish Republican Army (IRA) fighting to end British rule in
Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
"It was placed at head height in a tree at the side of the
road. It was an anti-personnel device filled with semtex (high
explosive), shrapnel and oil," a spokeswoman for the Royal Ulster
Constabulary said this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously there were a lot of police in the area at that time
searching and carrying out house to house inquiries, and obviously
somebody has taken advantage of that," the spokeswoman said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Launch Trust Fund for Aids Orphans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Revival of Hope, an organisation that
looks after children orphaned by the Hiv/Aids pandemic, plans to set
up a trust fund to assist in the education of the increasing number
of orphans in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Revival of Hope Director Nosihle Ndlovu today said destitution
among children orphaned by the pandemic had forced the organisation
to extend its services beyond provision of food and clothing.
</P>
<P>
''We view education as a better investment in their future rather
than have them as perpetual dependents even as they grow up. We hope
once they have education they will be able to do something for
themselves in future,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
Health experts estimate that the current Hiv/Aids death rate of
500 a week is expected to create 600,000 orphans by the turn of the
century.
</P>
<P>
Ndlovu said the organisation, which already had 2,200 orphans on
its register, was being flooded with applications for assistance from
children whose parents succumbed to the disease.
</P>
<P>
She said the Revival of Hope would extend its services to
Zimbabwse's rural areas where organisations dealing with Aids were
few but where the need was equally desperate. enditem

ISLAMABAD, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The visiting Philippine

President Farooq Leghari on bilateral and international issues.
</P>
<P>
The talks, held at the Presidential House, lasted about 50
minutes.
</P>
<P>
Leghari hoped that Ramos' visit would further cement existing
ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also discussed the situation in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Leghari told Ramos that an early solution of the long-standing
Kashmir issue is key to peace, progress and prosperity in the
region.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani president also said his country wants a peaceful
settlement of the Kashmir issue in accordance with U.N. Security
Council resolutions and the wishes of the people of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
On the Afghan crisis, Leghari told Ramos that peaceful
conditions in Afghanistan are in the interests of Pakistan, which
he said supports U.N. efforts for restoring peace in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Ramos arrived here today on a three-day official visit to
Pakistan. This is the second visit to Pakistan made by a
Philippine head of state in almost 40 years.

<HEADLINE> Starting Date for U.S.-Russian Summit Changed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The exact date for U.S.
President Bill Clinton to go to Helsinki for the U.S.-Russian
summit meeting has not been fixed yet, a White House spokesman
told Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
Asked to confirm an earlier news report that said the summit
between Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin has been
changed to March 19-20 from March 20-21, the spokesman said,
"That's still a question."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman told Xinhua by phone that the White House will
issue a statement later today to set the date for Clinton's
arrival at Helsinki.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that it appears that the summit will begin on
March 19 and ends on the following day, adding that the U.S. is
still discussing that with the Russians.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Helsinki say that the two-day summit has changed
to a one-day meeting.
</P>
<P>
Washington and Moscow last month agreed that Clinton and
Yeltsin will meet on March 20-21 over a range of issues from the
European security to Russia's economic reform.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is also expected to pay his first official visit
to Denmark on March 21 after the summit.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Demonstrate Against Building of Har </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Several thousands of
Palestinians today demonstrated at Har Homa (Jabal Abu Ghneim)
here, protesting against the planned construction of a new Jewish
neighborhood there.
</P>
<P>
Holding Palestinian flags, demonstrators marched from Beit
Sahur near the West Bank town of Bethlehem towards the
controversial site of Har Homa on the southern outskirts of
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Almost all Palestinian factions, which oppose the Oslo peace
agreement with Israel, including Hamas, Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine and the Democratic Front, participated in
today's demonstration.
</P>
<P>
As approaching the little hill of Har Homa, demonstrators were
blocked by Israeli army and police specially deployed for today's
demonstration.
</P>
<P>
A group of Fatah activists, loyal to Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat, helped to calm the angry
protesters and prevented a confrontation.
</P>
<P>
According to Israel Radio this morning, some 2,500 additional
policemen plus local police forces were deployed to prevent
disturbances.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, PNA declared today as "the Defense of Jerusalem
Day" and called on Palestinian residents in the West Bank to
attend a prayer service at Har Homa.
</P>
<P>
PNA minister for Jerusalem affairs Faisal Husseini, who
participated in today's demonstration, said he hoped that the
Israeli government would change the decision to build Har Homa,
which he said was against the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Husseini stressed that the Palestinians would go on with their
protests, in a "peaceful and non-violent way," to stop the Har
Homa plan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a senior Israeli police officer warned that if the
construction of Har Homa begins, the Palestinians will response
with rioting on a scale similar to that last September.
</P>
<P>
During a violent confrontation between Palestinian police and
Israeli soldiers, triggered off by the opening of the tunnel by
Israel in Jerusalem's Old City, more than 70 people were killed
and hundreds of others wounded.

<HEADLINE> War Against Inflation Far from Over, Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's largest discount house
warned today the war against inflation was far from over because of
macro-economic problems such as the government's bloated budget
deficit.
</P>
<P>
In a commentary, the Discount Company of Zimbabwe (DCZ) said that
although inflation had been on a downward trend in line with central
bank predictions, the economy was still susceptible to inflationary
pressures, particularly considering the high growth rates in money
supply.
</P>
<P>
Annual inflation stopped to a seven-year low last November, before
rising three pecentage points to 16.4 percent the following month.
</P>
<P>
During January this year, inflation dropped 0.6 percent to 15.8
percent, and indications were that inflation was on a sustainable
downward trend, considering that the average inflation figure for
1996 was 21.5 percent compared with 28 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
''Most economic commentators appear to agree that despite the
problems accompanied by a high budget deficit, inflation is unlikely
to rise above 20 percent this year,'' said the DCZ.
</P>
<P>
This week, the government admitted that the budget deficit, which
was expected to reach 10.1 percent in the year to June, was likely to
exceed 11 percent, mainly due to unbudgeted salary increases for
civil servants of more than 182 million US Dollars. enditem

<HEADLINE> Efforts Continue for Release of Abducted Germans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Efforts to secure the release of
seven German tourists abducted in Yemen continued with Yemeni
president Ali Abdullah Saleh joined the negotiations today, said a
German foreign ministry spokesman.
</P>
<P>
When the hostages will be set free remained yet unclear,
according to him.
</P>
<P>
Rashad Bagash, spokesman for Yemeni embassy in Bonn, was
optimistic about the fate of the Germans, saying the hostages
might be freed today and that negotiations with kidnappers were
going very well and the hostages were being well treated.
</P>
<P>
The seven Germans, aged between 30 and 45, who were in Yemen on
a motorcycling holiday, were kidnapped by a gang of about 30 men
near the border with Oman on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Yemeni security forces have surrounded the
location where the Germans were held. The German travel agency
that organized the motorcycle tour had initially been in telephone
contact with the abductees. By Friday, the contact had broken off.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three years, members of rival clans in Yemen had
kidnapped a total of 80 foreigners, to press various demands and
force ransom from the Yemeni central government in Sanna. In all
the cases, the abductees were freed unharmed.

<HEADLINE> IMF Urges Middle East States to Deregulate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Stanley Fischer, first deputy
managing director of IMF, praised the "remarkable change" in
economic policies taking hold in many Middle Eastern and Northern
African countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a two-day conference on opportunities for
investment in the region which ended here today, Fischer said
governments had realised that only high growth would permit them
to achieve better living standards, lower unemployment and create
jobs for a growing number of new entrants into the labor force.
</P>
<P>
But to maintain sustainable growth, Fischer urged governments
in the area to deregulate further "excessively regulated"
economies, secure higher domestic investment rates by reducing
government deficits.
</P>
<P>
IMF studies show that gross domestic product growth in the
Middle East and North Africa averaged 3.7 percent a year between
1991 and last year, yielding the first rise in per capita GDP in
more than a decade, but still well below the 6 percent annual
growth average in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Investment performance, however, has been disappointing, with
the ratio of foreign direct investment ranging between 0.5 percent
and 0.7 percent, compared to more than 1 percent of GDP in Asia.
</P>
<P>
But the IMF notes that resumption of growth in 1991-1996 has
been associated with a 1.1 percent of GDP rise in the investment
rate.
</P>
<P>
A central theme emerging from the two-day Conference entitled
"Opportunities for Investment in the Mediterranean Region" is the
need for the private sector to assume responsibility for
investment.
</P>
<P>
Manuel Marin, vice-president at the European Commission, also
told the conference that neither public sector investment nor the
EU aid package promised in the partnership must be relied upon to
increase investment.

<HEADLINE> Arafat: Israeli Withdrawal Decision No Sufficient </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Speaking in Gaza after meeting visiting German Foreign
Minister Klaus Kinkel, Arafat said he was "completely shocked" by
this decision together with Israel's another decision to build a
settlement in eastern Jerusalem's Har Homa (Jabal Abu Ghneim).
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio quoted Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat
as saying that Israel should have consulted with the PNA rather than
"dictates" the scope of further troop withdrawals. Israel has
already turned down the PNA requests for right to determine the
scope of further troop pullbacks.
</P>
<P>
"We are facing a real crisis in the peace process now," he said.
</P>
<P>
But Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu defended the
withdrawal decision, which was made after a seven-hour stormy
cabinet session overnight. After meeting with Kinkel today, he
reiterated that the decision had given the peace process "a good
chance" to move forward.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has briefed the cabinet's decision to the opposition
Labor Party leader Shimon Peres, U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright and Jordanian King Hussein.
</P>
<P>
According to the decision, Israel will withdraw from an
additional 9 percent of the West Bank land in the first stage of
the three-phase pullbacks, including 7 percent of Area B which is
under Israeli-Palestinian joint control and 2 percent of Area C
under Israeli total control.
</P>
<P>
Currently Israel controls 70 percent of the West Bank, while
the PNA controls only 3 percent, the rest areas are under the
joint control.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu is coming under mounting criticism from within his
own rightist camp.
</P>
<P>
Eight coalition members of the Knesset (Parliament) have
threatened to vote against him in the next week's non-confidence
motion.
</P>
<P>
If joining with the 54 opposition Knesset members in the vote,
they could topple the government with the required 61 votes in the
120-member Knesset. It seems that Netanyahu's fate lies now in
the hands of the Labor Party, which is supposed to support him as
long as he continues the peace process, observers here said.
</P>
<P>
Likud's former hardline Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir today
strongly criticized Netanyahu, urging him to step down if he
betrayed the Likud ideological principles which uphold the notion
of Greater Israel -- or a nation must retain the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Shamir said the areas to be handed over to the Palestinians
were very important because they could be used to accommodate
future massive immigration of Jews from around the world.
</P>
<P>
The Council of Settlers in Judea and Samaria (or West Bank and
Gaza Strip) also blasted the decision on further pullbacks. A
council spokesman said that this was not an Israeli decision, but
"an U.S. decision."
</P>
<P>
He added that the council would urge the coalition Knesset
members who were against the pullbacks to vote against Netanyahu
in the non-confidence motion.
</P>
<P>
Today's decision on further troop withdrawal was made just to
meet the deadline set by the Hebron agreement signed in January,
which requested Israel to carry out the first stage of further
pullbacks by today and complete the whole process by the middle of
next year.

<HEADLINE> France Envisages Quota Representation for Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The French government is envisaging
a quota representation for women in the country's legislature, and
a parliamentary debate on the subject will begin next week, the
daily Le Monde said today.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Alain Juppe held a meeting on Wednesday with
seven cabinet ministers on the possible adoption of a quota or
parity representation in parliament by women through a
constitutional reform, said the report.
</P>
<P>
However, a poll conducted by Le Monde in the National Assembly
(lower house of parliament) published today said that the most
deputies of the conservative ruling majority are opposed to a
quota representation for women in the legislature.
</P>
<P>
The French National Assembly only has 32 women deputies out of
a total of 576, a 5.3 percent representation, which is lower than
an average of 11 percent in parliaments of countries worldwide.
</P>
<P>
But deputies of the opposition Socialist Party, which will have
30 percent of its candidates to be represented by women in the
1998 legislative elections, overwhelmingly support a quota
representation, said the poll.
</P>
<P>
All the deputies of the Communist Party want a parity
representation between men and women in the legislature, saying
that "a parity between men and women in public life is a
condition for deepening democracy."
</P>
<P>
Former Prime Minister Edouard Balladur recalled that he had a
30 percent women representation in parliament as part of his
presidential election agenda in 1995.
</P>
<P>
But only one third of the women deputies in the parliament
supported such a kind of representation, said the poll.
</P>
<P>
The French prime minister will start a debate on the
constitutional reform over women representation in parliament next
Tuesday by addressing the parliament over the issue.
</P>
<P>
France's Constitutional Council scrapped a law in 1982 which
made it obligatory that women must be included in lists of
candidates in municipal elections.
</P>
<P>
Some women rights groups will hold demonstrations on Saturday,
which falls on the International Women's Day, in Paris to call for
stronger political power by women.

ADDIS ABABA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The Women's Affairs Standing
Committee of the Ethiopian parliament, the House of People's
Representatives, today said women workers, intellectuals,
entrepreneurs and farmers should exert efforts to ensure their
constitutional rights of forming their national association.

healthy family, and form educated society where the respect for
their right will be given due attention.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Welcomes Israel's Pullout Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Friday
welcomed Israel's decision to cede Palestinians control over 9
percent of the West Bank in its first phase of pullout of troops
from the West Bank rural areas, calling it a good first step.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright conveyed the message to Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during a telephone conversation early
on Friday following the Israeli Cabinet decision.
</P>
<P>
"We believe the decision is a demonstration of israel's
commitment to the peace process... and represents a serious
expansion of Palestinian authority. We hope Israel will do more in
the second and third phase," Burns summarized the telephone
conversation in a prepared statement.
</P>
<P>
It is the first pullout of Israel' troops from the rural areas,
agreed by the Israelis and Palestinians in a accord on Hebron
signed in January. The redeployment of the troops is starting
following the Israeli Cabinet decision.
</P>
<P>
There will be other two stages for the pullout which will
complete By mid-1998.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the Palestinians have sidely divergent views on how
much land should be handed over. Israel wants to remain in control
of 50 percent of the West Bank after the third phase, But the
Palestinians said they should hold the control of 90 percent of
the areas.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat, in his reaction to the
Israeli decision on the pullout, dismissed it as "a trick and
conspiracy against the peace process," saying: "it is an awful act
that was made from one side without contacting the Palestinian
side."
</P>
<P>
The palestinian Cabinet will hold an urgent session this
evening to discuss the Israel's decision, Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli coalition partners in Netanyahu's government
have threatened to vote against the government in a no-confidence
vote in parliament for ceding too much territory to the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Their ballots would make the necessary majority to topple the
government, causing new elections to be held.

<HEADLINE> German Coalminers Protest over Government Plan to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Several thousand coalminers in
Germany's Ruhr industrial area demonstrated today in protest over
government plan to trim federal subsidies to the hard coal
industry.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here said that miners staged protests at
several mines and temporarily blocked a motorway between
Oberhausen and Venlo.
</P>
<P>
The protests came one day after Bonn announced its plan to
gradually reduce subsidies to coal mining from about 10 billion
marks (5.8 billion U.S. dollars) a year currently to 5.5 billion
marks in the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
In states of North Rhine-Westfalia and Saarland that are run by
the main opposition Social Democrats, economics ministers
meanwhile voiced strong opposition today to the government plan.
</P>
<P>
North Rhine-Westfalia Economics Minister Wolfgang Clement said
his party would block the Bonn government's tax and pension fund
reform efforts, if it sought to cut subsidies.
</P>
<P>
The subsidy reduction would result in the closing of 10 mines
by the year 2005, as well as increased unemployment rate at 25
percent in some cities in the Ruhr district, according to him.
</P>
<P>
Saarland Economics Minister Christiane Krajewski called for
cooperation between the government and the states in working out
an agreement in wage cuts.
</P>
<P>
Hans Berger, head of the miners union IG Bergnau, Thursday
denounced Bonn's plan as "not worthy of compromises". It is
estimated that about 25,000 jobs at most could remain out of a
total of 90,000 given implementation of the government plan.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that hard coal production now covers 17 percent
of Germany's energy consumption, compared with 70 percent in 1957.
Coal output has also dropped from 149 million tons to 50 million
tons during the same period.
</P>
<P>
In addition, coal production cost in Germany runs much higher
than that in other countries. The sector is heavily-unionized and
the German government has been subsidizing the industry against
any possible unrest, said analysts.

contribution to our society is immense," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
However, The president noted, despite their qualifications,
"many of these Americans experience serious difficulty finding
work if they lose a job or desire new employment. Their search for
employment can become increasingly challenging as they grow
older."
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that a number of U.S. laws and government agencies
can offer protections, programs and services for older workers,
but it is up to employers also to recognize the potential of older
Americans as employees -- to recognize that by every common
measure of job performance, older workers are as effective as
younger people because of their unique skills, experiences, and
judgement.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the president called for employers to employ the
older workers on the basis of their ability to do job, regardless
of age.

<HEADLINE> Developing Nuclear Energy for Peaceful Purposes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Head of the African section of
the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Ali Boussaha
reiterated his agency's desire to assist African countries and
Cameroun in particular in developing nuclear energy for peaceful
purposes.
</P>
<P>
During the five-day working visit, while meeting with the
general manager of the National Hydrocarbons Corporation
(HYDRAC), Boussaha said not all technology is appropriate for
Cameroun and Africa as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of his visit therefore is to come to an agreement
with the local authorities on the appropriate technology for
hydrocarbon sector, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Boussaha, the IAEA is expected to offer 300
million CFA Francs to set up a laboratory for the control of
hydrocarbon products within the framework of the Chad-Cameroun
pipeline project.
</P>
<P>
The IAEA will assist in making available equipment, expert
services, and the training of Camerounians in non-destruction
control technics.
</P>
<P>
The hydrac company which is supposed to be the immediate
beneficiary of the project is poised to capture 40 percent of
control services in this sector.
</P>
<P>
In this light, the control of the quality of oil on the
Chad-Cameroun line is assured. This would bring in some 25
billion CFA Francs in revenue to the various institutions
concerned.
</P>
<P>
While receiving Boussaha and his delegation, Minister of
Scientific and Technical Research Bava Djingoer assured the
director that the Cameroun government is in favor of projects
aimed at using atomic energy for development needs in agriculture
and the control of petroleum products and promised the use of the
technology for peaceful and development purposes, the local
newspaper reported here today.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving Cameroun today, Boussaha and his delegation
assessed the national needs in atomic energy especially in the
agriculture sector.
</P>
<P>
It is for this reason that the delegation met and discussed at
length with the minister of animal breeding, fishery and
industry. They also made a stop at the Yaounde University where
the training program has links.

<HEADLINE> Cohen: Infrastructure Changes Needed for New NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 7 (Xinhua) -- American Defense Secretary
William Cohen today defended the idea of NATO's moving military
infrastructure eastward in its enlargement, saying infrastructure
changes are needed for new NATO members to carry out the
alliance's collective defense obligations.
</P>
<P>
"There has to be modernization, infrastructure changes to bring
them up to the capability that they could in fact carry out their
responsibilities like other members of the alliance," Mr. Cohen,
who was paying his first visit to NATO headquarters in Brussels as
US defense secretary, said after his meeting with NATO Secretary
General Javier Solana and ambassadors of the 16 NATO countries.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, there were things can be done to allay
Russia's concerns about the enlargement of NATO.
</P>
<P>
"We should make it clear NATO should go forward with
enlargement, and we will try to take account of the sensitivities
and the interests of Russia," he stated.
</P>
<P>
The infrastructure issue is one of the major divergences
between NATO and Russia concerning the former's enlargement plan.
</P>
<P>
Russia says it does not accept the idea of seeing the alliance
move eastward militarily, while NATO insists that the
infrastructure, which refers to logistics, command, control and
communication systems and air defense systems, will be extended
eastward, though "at a minimal level".
</P>
<P>
NATO argues that keeping military hardware away from its new
members will make them second-class citizens and weaken the
alliance's one-for-all-all-for-one security guarantee.
</P>
<P>
This issue will be tackled again when NATO Secretary General
Javier Solana meets Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov on
Sunday in Moscow for a third round of negotiations on a document
to lay out NATO-Russia relations after the Western Alliance begins
eastward enlargement.

ATHENS, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Greece expressed its satisfaction
today over the announcement by the International Olympic Committee
(IOC) to include in a shortlist of five cities bidding for 2004
Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
"We convinced the members of the IOC evaluation committee that
Athens is able to host the 28th Olympiad in 2004," the Chairperson
of Athens' candidacy committee Yianna Angelopoulou- Daskalaki told
reporters shortly after the shortlist was announced in Lausanne.
</P>

<HEADLINE> France Urges Zairean Rebels to Accept UN Peace Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 7 (Xinhua) -- France today asked Zairean rebels to
accept the United Nations five-point peace plan for Zaire, which
calls for an immediate ending of hostilities and the withdrawal of
foreign troops, including mercenaries, from Zaire.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt also
asked "certain states which support it (the rebellion)" to accept
the peace plan.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette said Thursday that
Uganda should stop intervening in Zaire.
</P>
<P>
The Zairean government has accused Uganda, Rwanda and -- to a
lesser degree -- Burundi of supporting the rebels led by
Laurent-Desire Kabila, an accusation rejected by these countries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, reports from Zaire said that Zairean troops have
greatly reinforced their positions around the strategic city of
Kisangani, which is the capital of Upper Zaire.
</P>
<P>
The Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported that Zairean government
forces, FAZ, have placed tons of explosives on the runways of the
airport of Kisangani, while reinforcements from mercenaries have
arrived to fend off an attack by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
The airport shelters the headquarters of the FAZ for its
operation in eastern Zaire against the rebels, and is said to be
the basis for launching a "devastating" counter-offensive which
actually has never taken place.

<P>
ATHENS, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Inflation marked a further drop in
Greece in February to reach 6.6 percent from the January level of
6.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to figures released today by the National Statistics
Service (NSS), the reduction was due to a 0.4 percent drop in the
consumer price index in February, compared to a drop of 0.2
percent in January.
</P>
<P>
The NSS said the latest favorable development on the inflation
front was a result of reduced prices in the categories of
clothing-footwear, heating oil and durable consumer goods.
</P>
<P>
NSS General Secretary Nikos Karaxitis forecast that the strong
downward trend in inflation expected to be maintained during the
rest of the first half of 1997 would continue also during the
second half.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Expresses Cautious Optimism About </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government today
expressed cautious optimism about the U.N.-sponsored talks between
the Greek and Turkish communities in Cyprus scheduled for Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his daily press briefing here, government
spokesman Yiannakis Cassoulides said "our optimism...is founded
more on a general impression that is created about Ankara's
intentions."
</P>
<P>
"There is some element which allows us to be cautiously
optimistic," Cassoulides said, noting that this does not relate
to Turkey's intention to discuss issues of substance but to
discuss each aspect of the Cyprus problem instead of sticking to
its long-standing positions," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Optimism means a desire to find a way out," he added.
</P>
<P>
Cassoulides said his government expects the proximity talks
could lead to "a productive dialog" between the leaders of the two
sides, President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General's Resident Representative Gustave
Feissel will start the talks between the two sides which will deal
with substantive issues.
</P>
<P>
Feissel met earlier this week with Clerides and was due to see
Denktash today, but the meeting was postponed because of the
Turkish Cypriot leader's illness.
</P>
<P>
However, Cyprus News Agency today quoted U.N. sources as saying
that the postponement of today's meeting between Feissel and
Denktash would not halt the start of proximity talks next week.
</P>
<P>
The forthcoming proximity talks were seen here as a positive
step toward reaching a solution to the protracted Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
occupied the northern third of the island in the wake of an
Athens-backed coup.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-sponsored peace talks aimed at reuniting the island
under a bizonal federal state, have been held on and off for the
past 22 years, but so far no tangible results have been achieved.
</P>
<P>
President Clerides and Denktash had two informal talks under
the U.N. auspices in Nicosia in October 1994, but the talks
reached a deadlock due to the wide gap on the substantive issues
of the Cyprus problem. The two men have not met since then.

<HEADLINE> Climate Talks End in Bonn With No Breakthrough </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 7 (Xinhua) -- After one week of negotiations in
Bonn, representatives from about 160 countries today failed to
make a breakthrough in setting up a target for the industrialized
countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions after the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
Due to "too different positions," negotiators had failed to
agree at a reduction target, said Raul Estrada-Oyuela, chairman of
the working group charged with conducting the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Although certain progress had been made, a draft treaty had not
been formulated yet, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Argentine chairman of the working group of the so-called
Berlin Mandate was asked by the negotiators to work out a draft
accord in the next few months, first for governments' review, and
then go to the Kyoto climate summit in Japan in December for
adoption.
</P>
<P>
Further negotiations on the draft text are still to be held in
Bonn at the end of July, and in October.
</P>
<P>
The Berlin Mandate came from the Climate Conference in Berlin
in 1995 which decided that concrete measures should be agreed upon
for the industrialized countries to reduce their emissions of
greenhouse gases after 2000, and that a relevant new treaty should
be adopted at the Kyoto climate summit. At issue is first of all
the reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.
</P>
<P>
Greenhouse gases are believed to be responsible for a gradual
warming of the Earth's atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
Five previous negotiating sessions of the working group, all
held in Geneva, had failed to achieve any concrete results.
</P>
<P>
The apparent failure of the Bonn talks was sharply criticized
by the Greenpeace, which said that agreement on critical cuts in
carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions is being blocked
by oil, gas, coal and car industry lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
"Behind the rhetoric governments are clearly supporting the
delaying tactics of these industries," the Greenpeace said.
</P>
<P>
It also called on the United States, Japan and the European
Union (EU) to come back to Bonn in July prepared to support the
proposal from the Alliance of Small Island States to reduce
emissions by 20 percent by 2005 from 1990 levels.
</P>
<P>
As a positive sign pointed out by negotiators in Bonn was an EU
agreement announced earlier this week in Brussels, which called
for a 15 percent cut in output of the greenhouse gases from 1990
levels by 2010.
</P>
<P>
For the first time a group of industrialized countries had
agreed on a concrete reduction target, they said.
</P>
<P>
In Bonn, the EU also called on other industrialized countries
to come along with the same reduction.

ANKARA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- A court in Istanbul today sentenced
nine gunmen who hijacked a ferryboat and took over 200 passengers
as hostages last year to nearly nine years in jail, the

The pro-Chechen hijackers commandeered Avrasya (Europe-Asia) in

<P>
The accused, six Turks, two Chechens and a Georgian, chanted
"God is Greatest" and scuffled with police after the sentence was
announced.
</P>
<P>
The hijackers had said that they took over the boat in protest
of Russia's military operations in Chechnya. They surrendered to
the Turkish police near Istanbul after holding the hostages for
72 hours.

<HEADLINE> Liberia's Kromah Detained for Hiding Arms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Alhaji Kromah, one of the major
former faction leaders in Liberia, was detained today by the west
African peace-keeping force (ECOMOG) for heavy weapons found in
his home in Monrovia, the Liberian capital.
</P>
<P>
The discovery, which came more than one month after the
deadline set by ECOMOG for the warring factions to put down their
weapons and disband, is said to include enough weaponry to feed
three trucks, a TV report said tonight.
</P>
<P>
A similar raid on Thursday found several rounds of ammunitions
and explosives at the executive mansion of the ruling Council of
State.
</P>
<P>
Early today, according to the report, ECOMOG troops raided the
residences of three major former faction leaders: Charles Taylor
of National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL), George Boley of
the Liberia Peace Council (LPC) and Kromah of United Liberation
Movement (ULIMO) in Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
"By daybreak, three truckloads of weapons whose compilation
ECOMOG Commander Major-General Victor Malu said is still going on
were found in Alhaji Kromah's house," the report said.
</P>
<P>
The weapons include AK47 rifles, RPG launchers, general
purpose machine guns, M15 rifles, anti-craft mortars as well as
thousands of assorted ammunitions.
</P>
<P>
But no weapons have been found in Taylor's compound nearby,
said the report which did not mention the result of the raid in
Boley's house.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Kromah has been put under house
arrest, with telephone lines cut and activities into his house
blocked by tanks.
</P>
<P>
Malu said Alhaji Kromah will be detained until investigations
are completed, after which he will be handed over the the civil
police for possible prosecution.
</P>
<P>
With the conclusion of voluntary disarmament for the former
rival factions at the end of January this year, ECOMOG gave a
grace period of one week for factional fighters to hand in their
weapons. After that, it will treat any one caught with weapons as
criminals.
</P>
<P>
According to observers here, this is the third time ECOMOG has
discovered weapons concealed by former warring factions in
Liberia.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, heavily armed ECOMOG troops uncovered a huge mass
of weapons, including short rifles and machine guns, and arrested
15 people linked to the arms found 45 km north of Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
The arrested described themselves as former NPFL fighters,
saying that the weapons had been buried by their commanders two
weeks before the disarmament exercise.
</P>
<P>
However, Taylor denied the charges, saying that it was a
propaganda meant to set ECOMOG against him.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, ECOMOG uncovered a large weapon case,
including assorted rifles and rocket propelled grenades, buried
at a diamond depository in Lofa bridge, about 60 km west of
Monrovia. The area was contested by the former United Liberation
Movement (ULIMO) factions before the disarmament exercise.
</P>
<P>
The discovery of such huge quantity of weapons near the
capital has led to the tightening of security in Monrovia. All
vehicles are being vigorously searched and people are also being
questioned if they demonstrated unusual attitude.
</P>
<P>
The Liberian peace process is currently progressing towards
general elections scheduled for May 30 this year. All the three
former warlords have resigned from the post of vice-chairmen in
the interim government to contest for the presidency in the
forthcoming national polls.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear at the moment in what degree the detainment of
Kromah will affect the peace process.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Disappointed Over European Politicians' Stand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Minister Tansu
Ciller said today that Turkey would not tolerate exclusion from
the European Union's (EU) expansion plans, the Turkish state-run
TV reported.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting of the Association of European Chambers
of Commerce and Industry (Eurochambers) in Istanbul, Ciller, also
deputy prime minister, said that Turkey should be given priority
over other mainly eastern European nations in EU expansion plans
in view of its traditional ties with EU.
</P>
<P>
The EU has designated several central and eastern European
countries for probable membership, including such favorites as
Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic and Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Ciller said her country enjoys several advantages in contending
an EU full membership, which include a NATO membership, its
fastest growing economy in Europe and the only customs union
partnership with the EU.
</P>
<P>
A meeting of the leaders of Christian Democrat parties, that
form the center-right European People's Party (EPP), held in
Brussels Tuesday reached a consensus that "Turkey is not a
candidate to become an EU member, short-term or long," reports
reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
"This is something we can't understand. This is something the
Turkish people can't accept," she said.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish foreign minister urged the European leadership not
to isolate Turkey and "put up new Berlin Walls" that will exclude
Turkey because of its Islamic affiliation.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, an associate member of the EU, has long been
struggling for a full membership, but witnesses no breakthrough
due to some controversial issues with the EU.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 7 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan today expressed regret over a decision by the Zairian
government on March 4, 1997 to expel 19 international aid workers.
</P>
<P>
Those aid workers were relocated from Kisangani to Kinshasa on
March 1, 1997 owing to a deteriorating security situation.
</P>
<P>
"He wishes to underscore that the aim of humanitarian
assistance is to provide relief to all those in need, wherever
there is a need, and to do so without jeopardizing the safety and
security situation," said a statement by U.N. spokesman Fred
Eckhard.
</P>
<P>
"It is therefore his expectation that, security conditions
permitting, those humanitarian workers who wish to do so, will
return to resume their work from Kisangani," it said.
</P>
<P>
The statement said Kofi Annan, having communicated his concerns
to Prime Minister Kengo wa Dondo, is sanguine that the government
of Zaire will show understanding for the situation of humanitarian
workers in a dangerous security environment, and therefore refrain
from implementing its decision to expel them from Zaire.

ISLAMABAD, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government will
provide legal protection to foreign investment besides facility of
repatriating capital and dividends, Commerce Minister Mohammad
Ishaq Dar said here today.
</P>
<P>
One window facility would also be available for foreign
investors in Pakistan, said Dar while meeting a 33-member investor
delegation from the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Dar said that main thrust of the Pakistani government's
economic policies was to facilitate foreign and local investors in
all sectors of the economy.
</P>
<P>
The government would take bold economic reforms to open up its
economy and was committed to waiving off rest of the restrictions
to hamper economic growth, Dar said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government had accelerated the privatization
process in a transparent manner by disinvesting a number of
industrial units and two banks.
</P>
<P>
"We still have a number of units to be disposed of in the
private sector and offered the visiting investors to go through
the process", he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he underscored the need of enhancing trade between
Pakistan and the Philippines by exploiting the potential in
different areas.
</P>
<P>
Dar hoped that the visit of the Philippine businessmen would
promote economic ties between the two countries for mutual
benefits.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine delegation arrived here Friday along with
President Fidel Ramos who is paying a three-day official visit to
Pakistan at the invitation of Pakistani President Farooq Leghari.
</P>
<P>
The visit, part of Ramos' tour of South Asia and Middle East
countries, is aimed at strengthening the traditional and cordial
relations between Philippines and Pakistan particularly in trade

<HEADLINE> E. Africa Needs 2.5 Million Tons of Cereal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
Imports
</P>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The cereal import requirement
for 1996/97 in east Africa is estimated at 2.5 million tons with
commercial imports at 1.9 million and food aid at 0.6 million
tons, a U.N. report has said.
</P>
<P>
The report issued by U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization
(FAO) said that the cereal production for the crop year in the
region is estimated at 19.7 million tons, 12 percent higher than
in the previous year, reflecting bumper harvest in Ethiopia and
Sudan.
</P>
<P>
However, grain production declined in Kenya, Somalia and
Eritrea, noted the February report of "Food Supply Situation and
Crop Prospects in Sub-Saharan Africa".
</P>
<P>
In Kenya, in most parts of Northeastern, Eastern and Coast
provinces, serious food difficulties are anticipated in the first
half of 1997 as a result of the failure of the 1996/97 "short
rain" season.
</P>
<P>
The second season cereal production is forecast at half the
normal levels while the main "long rains" production was also
reduced due to a decrease in plantings and yields, noted the report
reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The report pointed out that "the aggregate output of the main
maize crop is estimated at about one-quarter below last year's
level".
</P>
<P>
According to an estimation by a FAO/WFP Crop and Food Supply
Assessment Mission, 1.2 million tons of cereal imports are
required for the 1996/97 marketing year.
</P>
<P>
In Somalia, the 1996/97 secondary crop, accounting about 25
percent of the annual cereal production, is estimated at 45,000
tons, 45 percent below normal while the main crop was also poor.
</P>
<P>
"The total cereal production is forecast at 288,000 tons,
about the same as in the previous year but well below pre-war
average levels in Somalia," the report said.
</P>
<P>
In Eritrea, cereal production declined for the second
consecutive year to 132,000 in 1996, 11 percent below the poor
harvest of 1995 and 29 percent lower than the average for the
preceding four years.
</P>
<P>
By contrast, the report stated, the 1996/97 cereal production
of Ethiopia is forecast at 12 million tons, 20 percent higher
than last year#,while a bumper coarse grain crop was also
gathered in Sudan where the output is estimated at 4.7 million
tons, 65 percent above the poor harvest of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Despite an overall increase cereal production in the two
countries, some 1.9 million people in Ethiopia and about 2.6
million people in the southern states of Sudan affected by
prolonged civil conflict will still require food assistance in
1997, the report noted.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Leaders Attend Family Planning and Environment Forum (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Li Peng, who is a member of the Standing Committee of
the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, said that
efforts must be made to ensure that China's population is
controlled within 1.3 billion by the end of this century. To
achieve the family planning targets of the Ninth Five-Year Plan,
China must do a good job in the countryside, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
All of China has formulated some kind of rules and regulations
on family planning for migrant workers and has done a lot of work,
but that this is still not enough. This work involves both the
sources and destinations of migrant workers, so the two sides must
cooperate more closely, he said.
</P>
<P>
In environmental protection, Li said, "We must not follow the
old path of first pollution and then control, and must not look
for short-term development at the cost of the environment," but an
effort must be made to manage the urban environment and focus on
controling industrial pollution.
</P>
<P>
The Huai River Valley is one of the most polluted areas in
China and the people living along it have been seriously affected,
Li said, urging the four provinces along the river to make a
greater and coordinated effort to bring the pollution under
control.
</P>
<P>
"Whether in the cities or in the countryside, we should make
drinking water a major issue, curb the deterioration of water
quality, and improve the quality of drinking water," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also called for developing ecologically-sound agriculture to
improve the environment and for controls on the use of farmland,
saying that the use of farmland for urban and rural construction
must be held to a minimal level. Finances must also be provided
for developing industries that are environmentally- and
ecologically-friendly, he said.
</P>
<P>
Investment in pollution control will total 450 billion yuan
during the Ninth Five-Year Plan, he revealed.
</P>
<P>
Among those attending today's forum were Peng Peiyun, a state
councillor and minister in charge of the State Family Planning
Commission; Song Jian, state councillor and director of the
Environmental Protection Committee of the State Council; Wei
Jianxing, Xie Fei, Chen Muhua, Luo Gan, and other officials from
the Party and government departments, the National People's
Congress, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference,
the General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army,
the Headquarters of the Armed Police; and officials from various
provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions, as well as from
major cities.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Leaders Attend Family Planning and Environment Forum (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin and Premier
Li Peng today attended a forum in Beijing on family planning and
environmental protection sponsored by the central authorities,
held in Huairentang Hall at Zhongnanhai, headquarters of the
Chinese Government.
</P>
<P>
The forum was also attended by Qiao Shi, Li Ruihuan, Liu
Huaqing, and Hu Jintao, all members of the Standing Committee of
the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central
Committee.
</P>
<P>
Jiang and Li both stressed family planning and environmental
protection as China's basic national policies. "While continuing
the socialist modernization drive and developing the economy, we
must take population, resources, and environment into full
account, so as to ensure a sustained, rapid, and sound economic
growth and comprehensive social progress," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
In pointing to China's accomplishments in family planning in
the past several years, Jiang said that this has attracted
worldwide attention, but that there is still an imbalance in some
regions.
</P>
<P>
"There is still a boom in child births in some provinces and
autonomous regions and family planning is still a heavy task," he
said, "so, we should not let up or be blindly optimistic, even if
we've reached the population control goal in recent years."
</P>
<P>
He called for greater attention to be paid to the population
problem, and said that an effort must be made to ensure that the
country's population is held to 1.3 billion by the end of the
century.
</P>
<P>
"We must adhere to the existing family planning policies and
the population control objectives, and continue the principle of
focusing on education, contraception, and day-to-day work," he
emphasized. He also suggested that family planning in rural areas
be tied to promoting economy, helping farmers become prosperous
through diligent work, and making civilized and happy families. He
noted that steps must be taken to ensure that family planning
institutions have sufficient personnel and funds.
</P>
<P>
He said that family planning is still difficult in the
countryside, especially in underdeveloped regions, so they should
be the focus of birth control.
</P>
<P>
"In trying to alleviate poverty we should continue to implement
the family planning policy. Different departments across the
country must act according to specific conditions and find an
effective way to carry out the combined poverty alleviation and
family planning policy in accordance with the central authorities'
requirements," he said.
</P>
<P>
In terms of distributing aid funds, sending laborers to other
areas, and arranging technical training, preferential treatment
should be given to poor families practising birth control and to
underdeveloped counties, towns, and villages that have done a good
job in family planning.

<HEADLINE> Six People Die in Fighting in Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, March 8 (Xinhua) -- At least six people were killed
and 15 others injured in a heavy fighting between the militiamen
of Hussein Mohamed Aidid and armed gunmen escorting an ICRC aid
convoy in Baidoa yesterday.
</P>
<P>
The fighting broke out when Aidid's men in Baidoa, 245 km west
of the capital, blocked the convoy, that was heading to Bardera
Town in Gedo Region.
</P>
<P>
The Aidid's men believed they should be responsible to escort
the convoy from Baidoa to Bardera. However, the escort hired by
the ICRC were reluctant to turn the responsibility to
them.
</P>
<P>
During the armed clashes, both sides used heavy machine guns,
rocket propelled grenades and assault rifles. The incident
suspended the continuation of the 24 lorry convoy for more than
12 hours.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the convoy was released last night with an
escort of 4 battle wagons and hundred gunmen down to Bardera.
</P>
<P>
According to sources close to ICRC, the convoy consisted of
lorries transporting seeds of maize for cultivation for the
forthcoming rainy season in the region.
</P>
<P>
Most of the regions in Somalia are now being hit by severe
drought following the lack of rain falls in the last two years.
Several hundred people have died for famine, thirst and
malnourishment related diseases in the regions of Bay, Bakol and
Gedo of southwest Somalia since the beginning of this year.

<HEADLINE> Israel Welcomes U.S. Veto of U.N. Resolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 98 (Xinhua) -- Israel today welcomed the
U.S. veto of a United Nations resolution which demanded Israel to
abandon a controversial building project in eastern Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry issued a statement praising the U.S. move
as sending out a "positive message" that would strengthen the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
It also expressed reservation at the European countries which
initialed the resolution that criticized Israel's plan to build
the Har Homa neighborhood and called for its cancellation.
</P>
<P>
The resolution was drafted by Britain, France, Portugal and
Sweden, and approved by all other members in the Security Council
except the United States.
</P>
<P>
Eitan Bentsur, director-general of the Foreign Ministry,
denounced the resolution as "one-sided" and would not contribute
to the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The European countries' move could weaken the European Union's
efforts to mediate between the two parties involved in the peace
process, he asserted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) strongly
criticized the U.S. move of vetoing the U.N. resolution. PNA
Culture Minister Yasser Abed Rabbo said Friday the veto showed
that the U.S. could no longer play the role as a "valuable and
honest broker" in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Although the resolution was vetoed by the U.S., even
U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Bill Richardson criticized Israel for
its plan to build the new Jewish settlement in Har Homa, saying such
a move would not help build confidence and trust which were badly
needed now in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Richardson only justified the U.S. veto with the claim that
the Security Council was not the appropriate forum for debating
the issue which was under negotiation between Israel and the PNA.
</P>
<P>
Frustrated by the U.S. action, Arab countries have called for
an emergency meeting of the U.N. General Assembly today to
discuss the situation.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Jordanian King Hussein held telephone conversations
with PNA President Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu in order to help advance the peace process at
such a difficult time.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported that King Hussein expressed his support
for the PNA on the Har Homa issue. Meanwhile, Jordanian Prime
Minister Abdel Karim Kabariti is visiting Gaza this afternoon to
hold talks with Arafat to discuss the current situation and ways
to strengthen bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is to travel to Amman later today with Kabariti to hold
consultations with King Hussein.

<HEADLINE> Over 500,000 Ugandans Suffer from Aids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Over 500,000 Ugandans were
reported to be suffering from Aids by the end of 1996, reported
the local newspaper ''The Crusader'' today.
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth Madra, a senior official of the Aids Control Program
in Uganda, was quoted as saying that the actual figure was likely
much higher than that because there was a lot of under-reporting
and delayed reoprting of Aids cases.
</P>
<P>
Addressing partcipants at a workshop held here yesterday, Madra
said the ratio of infection of Ugandan girls to their male
counterparts in the same age group was 6 to 1.
</P>
<P>
She said that Hiv risk for women was rising daily and 10
million women worldwide were reported to be suffering from Aids
by the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
''Nine out of every ten infected women live in developing
countries, and close to half of the adults worldwide who become
infected daily are women."
</P>
<P>
She said up to 80 percent of the infected women get the virus
through sexual intercourse.
</P>
<P>
Marriage has also become a risky venture because partners
become too confident, she said, adding "they don't bother about
safe sex''.
</P>
<P>
"Between 25-40 percent of Hiv positive mothers in the country
pass over the infection to their newly-born babies,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
Uganda is one of the countries worst hit by Aids in the world.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that up to now 1.5 million Ugandans, or 7.7
percent of the country's 19.3 million population, are infected
with Hiv. The figure is expected to rise to two 2 million by the
year 2,000. enditem

<HEADLINE> Milk Consumption Rises in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Milk consumption in Uganda has
risen from 21 to 24 liters per person a year between 1996-97,
reported the local daily The New Vision today.
</P>
<P>
Benon Sebina, an official in charge of a private sector dairy
development project in the country, was quoted as attributing the
increase of milk consumption to the development of the country's
private dairy sector.
</P>
<P>
In October 1995, Uganda completed construction of its first
ultra heat treated milk factory in Mbarara, southwestern Uganda.
Since then a large amount of milk has been supplied to the
country's markets.
</P>
<P>
In the same month, the Uganda Dairy Corporation announced that
the number of its flavored milk products would increase from four
to eight to meet the needs of local schools and super markets.
</P>
<P>
Sebina also said that many dairy farmers had been trained to
increase milk quantities and quality, leading to an overall
increase in production. enditem

implementation of the principles of equality between men and
women, President Glafcos Clerides pledged here today.
</P>
<P>
In a message on the occasion of International Women's Day,
President Clerides further assured that his government will
intensify efforts to increase women's participation in state and
public decision making bodies.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the government will remain firm in its
commitment to further enhance the National Committee for Women's
Rights and to establish an Equal Rights Committee which will
investigate complaints on violations of principles of equality.
</P>
<P>
These measures will reinforce women's status and help Cyprus'
accession into the European Union course, President Clerides added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a series of events will be organized in Cyprus to
mark the International Women's Day, including an all-night sit-in
this evening at the Ledra Palace checkpoint for what Cyprus terms
as the violation of human rights by Turkey in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Next week, about 20 foreign women personalities will be
invited to join Cypriot women's candle-lit march from Eleftheris
square of downtown Nicosia to the Ledra Palace checkpoint on
the Nicosia Green Line, aimed at boosting international interest
in the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
occupied 37 percent of the island in the wake of a short-lived
coup seeking union with Greece.

<HEADLINE> Enhancement of African Women's Educational, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Dr. Salim A. Salim, Secretary
General of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), today called
on all African governments and peoples to take concrete actions
to create conducive policy and environment for the enhancement of
African women's educational and economic status.
</P>
<P>
In a message sent in connection with the celebration of the March
8 International Women's Day, Salim said ''we are happy to salute
African women with pride, encouragement and support for their human
endurance in their indefatigable efforts in maintaining the social,
economic and cultural fabric of our continent and their continued
struggle for a just and peaceful society.''
</P>
<P>
''We, however, feel seriously concerned about the still deeply
entrenched attitudes and practices which perpetuate inequality and
discrimination against women in public and private life in most of
our member states,'' he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said Africans should seriously and constantly reflect on
the heavy burden that the African women still carries on their
shoulders and the usually unnoticed and unnumberated chores and
responsibilities they have at home, in the community, in the work
place, as well as their role at attempting to manage the
consumption and production of food for the family under
conditions of increasing hardship and worsening feminization
poverty.
</P>
<P>
Regarding their economic status, Salim said women's poverty
is directly related to the absence of economic opportunities and
autonomy, coupled with inadequate access to education, to credit,
support services and their minimal participation in the decision-
making process.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out, the African women's commitment to protecting,
reconstructing and transforming their countries towards recovery
and sustainable development and their inalienable rights to take
their rightful place on various socio- economic, political and
cultural issues on the basis of equality and principles of
democracy, must be promoted and enhanced.
</P>
<P>
''This year as we celebrate March 8, the International Women's
Day, we should not lose sight of the importance and urgency of
accelerating our joint endeavours for peace and sustainable
development by way of contributing to prevent, resolve and manage
conflicts and strengthen Africa's infrastructures as the concrete
basis for implementing the provisions of the treaty establishing
the African Economic Community,'' he underlined.

<HEADLINE> China to Intensify Legislation on Resources Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- China will attach great importance
to resources-related legislation in 1997 to protect its natural
resources which are scarce given its huge population, said a
senior environmental protection expert here today.
</P>
<P>
Qu Geping, chairman of the Environment and Resources Committee
of the National People's Congress (NPC), said his committee will
work hard to enact, amend and draft laws on environmental
protection and marine environmental protection as well as on the
protection or control of arable land, water, forests, grassland,
toxic chemicals, flood and desertification.
</P>
<P>
Qu said the committee will expand international cooperation to
study features of environmental protection-related legislation
overseas to improve the quality of Chinese laws.
</P>
<P>
According to Qu, who served as head of the National
Environmental Protection Agency, China is among the world's
richest in terms of the total amount of natural resources.
</P>
<P>
However, the country's per capita resources are only half of
the world average, he said. Out of 45 important mineral resources,
the verified reserves of ten cannot meet demand in the Ninth
Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000), he said.
</P>
<P>
"The short supply of energy and major raw materials will hinder
China's economic development," he warned.
</P>
<P>
While it has limited resources, China has been suffering from
serious wastes such as random occupation of land, damage to
grassland, poor utilization of water resources, unlawful mining of
mineral resources and severe deforestation.
</P>
<P>
China's GDP has grown by more than ten times in the past
40-plus years while consumption of mineral resources has jumped by
more than 40 times, he said.
</P>
<P>
Qu noted that, when it inspects law enforcement this year, the
NPC's Environment and Resources Committee will concentrate on the
protection of land, forest, water and soil.

<HEADLINE> UN Spends 300,000 Dollars for 15 Former S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations and the New
York-based African-American Institute (AAIi) are spending 300,000
dollars to sponsor 15 former Sierra Leone military leaders now
studying at colleges in the United States and Britain, western
diplomats said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The disclosure comes in the wake of reports that many of them
are facing financial strains abroad.
</P>
<P>
The UN funding under ''the senior officers training program''
for the 15 began in March 1996 after democratic elections ushered
in the civilian government of President Tejan Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
According to UN officials here, the objectives of the program
were ''to create conditions for consolidating peace in Sierra
Leone'' and ''facilitate voluntary disengagement of military
personnel, accord them new skills to reintegrate them into
civilian life.''
</P>
<P>
Former Chairman Captain Valentine Strasser, who led the coup in
1992 but was toppled in a palace coup in early 1995 by his
deputy Brigadier General Julius Maada Bio, is reading law in England
while Bio is in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Former Deputy Chairman, Colonel Akim Gibril is also in the United
States along with five others including former Foreign Minister
Karefa Kargbo. enditem

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Newspaper Highlights Women's Role in Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's leading newspaper Nhan Dan
today emphasized the role of Vietnamese women in the country's
socio-economic development, particularly in the current
industrialization and modernization process, known as "renovation."
</P>
<P>
In an editorial to mark International Women's Day today, the
newspaper noted that Vietnamese women had made significant
contributions to national development, especially in the
"renovation" process initiated by the Communist Party of Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper praised women's efforts and active participation
in tackling issues such as employment, education, health care and
personnel training.
</P>
<P>
It also highlighted the success of the 11-million-strong
Vietnam Women's Union in increasing women's income and improving
state management in socio-economic affairs.
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese women, who account for 51.8 percent of the
population and 52 percent of the workforce, account for 70 percent
of healthcare and education workers, 70 percent of public service
workers, and 37 percent of scientific researchers.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper called for more joint efforts to improve women's
prospects and raise their status in society.
</P>
<P>
It concluded that the movement for women's advancement should
focus on job creation and improving income with a view to
eliminating hunger and reducing poverty, especially for women in
rural and mountain areas and single women. It also called for
plans to ensure women's equal and fair access to education and
healthcare.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 8 (Xinhua) -- A U.N official said here today
that the remnants of Iraqi destroyed missile engines would be
transported abroad this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Roger Knight, special assistant of the director of OMV(Ongoing
Monitoring and Verification) Center in Baghdad, told Xinhua by
telephone:"All the remnants stockpiled at the OMV Center will be
transported by air this afternoon to the U.S. for analysis as we
expected."
</P>
<P>
He said the move was taken in line with the joint statement
signed by Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz and UNSCOM
Chairman Rolf Ekeus on February 23.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, the Iraqi government and UNSCOM
have agreed to transfer the remnants of the destroyed missile
engines abroad to the U.S., Russia or France.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-imposed sanctions on Iraq since August 1990 cannot be
totally lifted before the UNSCOM clarifies that Baghdad has
destroyed all the weapons of mass destruction, in particular
missiles with a range of over 150 kilometers.

<HEADLINE> Northernmost China County Preparing For Stellar Occasion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, March 8 (Xinhua) -- With the solar eclipse and
Hale-Bopp comet concurrence approaching, one county in the
northernmost part of China which happens to be the best
observation site, has been making preparations for guests.
</P>
<P>
The astronomical phenomenon will occur on March 9, and has
already attracted more than 2,000 astronomers and amateur
star-gazers to Mohe county.
</P>
<P>
A reception group of more than 500 people has been organized by
the local government, and the town's 83 hotels have prepared more
than 1,200 beds for visitors. Over 120 motor vehicles have been
dispatched to Mohe from counties in the Daxinganling region, and
more than 1,500 overcoats have been set aside to help visitors
protect themselves against the local temperatures, which are often
more than 30 degrees below zero.
</P>
<P>
The more accident-prone parts of the 84-km highway to the
"North Pole Village" from the county seat are being guarded by
more than 40 traffic policemen day and night, and more than
200,000 local people have cleared away snow and ice from the
200-km highway in the county.
</P>
<P>
The county post office has been equipped with five more
telephones that take magnetic cards, ten telephones that use IC
cards and four fax machines, to make things more convenient for
astronomers and journalists.
</P>
<P>
Astronomy lectures can now be seen on local TV, and the county
eduction commission has bought a telescope in for observation,
while teachers are organizing students to make observation cards
to watch the spectacular moment.
</P>
<P>
Because the town is ringed by hills, the sky is affected by
dense smoke in the morning which is affected by low atmospheric
pressure, so the county government has decided to ban home fires
from early March 9 until the end of the phenomenon, before noon, a
move that has won the support of local residents.
</P>
<P>
The local meterological station forecasts that the weather on
March 9 will be clear with a small amount of clouds -- perfect
weather for observing the phenomenon.

problem of a deteriorating environment.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted, China still faces great pressure in the
protection of environment and resources, and its environmental
situation is still severe and environmental protection work still
great.
</P>
<P>
China has drawn up its environmental protection objectives in
the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000) and its long-term plan for
the year 2010; namely, striving to secure a basic control of the
deteriorating situation in environmental pollution and ecological
destruction and to improve the environmental quality of some
cities and areas by the year 2000; and to change the deteriorating
environmental situation and to improve both the urban and rural
environment considerably by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
"These are the objectives of our environmental protection work
which will go beyond the century," he said, urging the government
at all levels to include environmental protection in their annual
and long-term economic and social development plans, and to ensure
that measures in environmental protection be taken when decisions
are made on major construction projects.
</P>
<P>
Environmental protection appraisals must be made for regional
development and for the use of resources, Jiang said, adding that
an efficient management system must be established to make
policies that relate to the environment and economic development
more scientific and standard. Financial funding for environmental
protection should be increased, he said.
</P>
<P>
China has also made some progress in enforcing environmental
management laws, Jiang said. Fifteen kinds of small enterprises
causing severe pollution, for example, were closed thanks to the
resoluteness of government at all levels.
</P>
<P>
However, law enforcement in environmental protection is still a
relatively weak link that needs to be strengthened.

<HEADLINE> Croatian PM Arrives in Kuwait for Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Croatian Prime Minister
Zlatko Matesa arrived here today for a two-day official visit for
discussions on bilateral economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
His visit was in line with the Croatian strategy to boost
ties with Kuwait and other member states of the Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC), according to a Kuwaiti cabinet statement.
</P>
<P>
Matesa, heading a delegation of government officials and
businessmen, will hold talks with Kuwaiti Amir Sheikh Jaber
Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah and members of the Kuwait cabinet, the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
Later today, talks between Matesa and Kuwaiti Deputy Prime
Minister and Minister of Finance Nasser Abdullah Al-Rudhan will be
held in addition to similar ones between the Croatian prime
minister and Kuwaiti Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister
Sheikh Salem Sabah Al-Salem Al-Sabah.
</P>
<P>
Talks between members of the Croatian delegation and
representatives of the Kuwaiti Chamber of Commerce and Industry
are also due to be held Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti officials disclosed that tourism, oil and industrial
sectors in Croatia are potential investment domains for Kuwaiti
entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait and Croatia initialed an agreement in September 1995
to review mutual investments as a prelude to drawing up an
accord to protect enterprises and devise a framework for
arbitration.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait recognized the Republic of Croatia on June 17, 1992,
one year after it declared independence from the former Yugoslav
Federation in June 1991.
</P>
<P>
The Croatian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Mate
Granic paid a visit to the oil-rich emirate in October 1994,
during which he affirmed his country's support for Kuwait's
independence and territorial integrity, the cabinet statement
said.
</P>
<P>
The Croatian prime minister will conclude his visit here
Sunday afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Sino-UK Cooperation On HK Encouraging: Chinese Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua)-- Vice-Premier Li Lanqing says that
Hong Kong has been, is, and will always be an important bridge
between China and Britain, and that the two sides have the
responsibility of reinforcing this bridge and not undermining it.
</P>
<P>
Li made the remark this afternoon during a meeting with British
Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke in Beijing, where he
said that "A more prosperous and stable Hong Kong is much to the
benefit of China, Britain, the government of the HK Special
Administrative Region, and its people."
</P>
<P>
Speaking on bilateral ties, Li said that relations between
China and Britain have greatly improved in the past several years,
with frequent high-level visits, which are helpful to resolving
differences and misunderstandings, and that bilateral cooperation
on the smooth transition of Hong Kong has made progress.
</P>
<P>
Clarke, who is making his first visit to China, praised China's
achievements in the economy and reforms, and admired its fast
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that there will be more bilateral
business exchanges and not just political exchanges between the
two governments.
</P>
<P>
Discussing the question of Hong Kong, the Chancellor noted that
the transition is an historic event for the territory.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the Vice-premier also briefed the guest on
China's economic situation and said that, after 18 years of
reforms and opening up, China has realized its goal of quadruple
growth in the economy, a benefit of Deng Xiaoping's theory of
building socialism with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
This experience has shown that the reforms and opening up have
been a success, and that this reassures us that China will
continue to move forward in the direction that Deng indicated, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also exchanged views on finance, banking and the
international economy during their one-hour meeting.
</P>
<P>
Clarke arrived here earlier today for a four-day visit at the
invitation of the Ministry of Finance.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Minister Tansu
Ciller will hold talks with current President of the European
Union (EU) Hans Van Mierlo on the country's EU bid this
afternoon,
</P>
<P>
Ciller, also deputy prime minister, will meet with Mierlo,
Dutch foregin minister as well, at a working lunch in Istanbul,
the largest city of Turkey, to exchange views on the EU expansion
plans, a statement from the Turkish Foreign Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Mierlo arrived in Istanbul Friday after his visits to Greece
and Albania.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting of the Association of European Chambers
of Commerce and Industry (Eurochambers) in Istanbul, Ciller said
that Turkey would not tolerate its exclusion from the EU's
expansion plans, adding that her country should be given priority
over other mainly eastern European nations in the EU plans in view
of its traditional ties with the EU.
</P>
<P>
The EU has designated several central and eastern European
countries for possible membership, including such states as
Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic and Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish foreign minister said her country enjoys several
advantages in contending for a EU full membership, which includes
the membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), its
fastest growing economy and the customs union partnership
with the EU.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, an associate member of the EU, has long spared no
efforts in obtaining admission into the EU, but no breakthrough
has so far been achieved, due to human rights and Kurdish issues
in the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina today pledged to establish equality between men and women
in all spheres of national life and ensure women's security in all
fields of social, state and national life.
</P>
<P>
The first ever national women development policy was announced
by the prime minister at a grand, colorful women rally, organized
by the Women and Children Affairs Ministry in observance of the
International Women's Day.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said the policy had been formulated with an
ultimate objective to ensure empowerment of women in political,
social and administrative matters and establish human rights for
women.
</P>
<P>
Hasina said a national action plan for women development had
been formulated for the implementation of the policy and it would
be incorporated in the next five-year plan.
</P>
<P>
"It is the women who themselves should come forward to change
their own fortune in the positive direction," She emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some 30 women's organizations and other
non-government, socio-cultural organizations in Dhaka observed the
"International Women's Day" in different ways, including torch
processions, discussion meetings and musical programs.
</P>
<P>
The day is being observed worldwide since 1910 following the
declaration of the "second international socialist convention on
women" held in Copenhagen, Denmark.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Army in North on Full Alert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan army in the north is
now on full alert and ready to meet any raid by Sudan-backed
rebels, an army source was quoted as saying here today.
</P>
<P>
Shaban Bantariza, the Public Relation Officer of the Fourth
Division of the Ugandan government troops, told The New Vision
that his men are ready to launch a counter-offensive against
rebels should the latter strike any more from now.
</P>
<P>
The army is ready to destroy the training bases of the rebels
in southern Sudan, Shaban said.
</P>
<P>
But he assured Uganda will not invade Sudan. ''We are
organising and preparing for war with rebels and not Sudan,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan military and security sources said the Sudan-backed
rebels are preparing to launch another offesive on Uganda from Sudan.
</P>
<P>
There are two Sudan-based rebel groups invading northern
Uganda from time to time -- the Lord Resistance Army (LRA) acting
in Kitgum, Gulu, Lira, Acholi districts, and the West Nile Bank
Front (WNBF) acting in Arua, Moyo and Nebbi districts. Both
suffered heavy losses in fighting against the government troops.
</P>
<P>
Michael Southwick, the US Ambassador to Uganda, said yesterday
that the command of the LRA appeared to be breaking down in the
course of military action of the government troops.
</P>
<P>
Southwick visited northern Uganda last week and discussed the
situation in the north with Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni.
</P>
<P>
President Yoweri Museveni is now on a working visit in the
north. He will restructure the command of the Ugandan army in the
north to implement his new strategy to end the rebellion there,
the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Major General Salim Saleh, the President's Special Adviser on
Military and Political Affairs in the north, has transferred his
office from northern Gulu City to Arua on March 5. Military
sources said he will concentrate his efforts to eradicate the
WNBF rebels in Arua.

<HEADLINE> Deng's Policies Well Entrenched in China: Surinamese Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 8 (Xinhua) -- "The policies initiated by late
Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping are obviously well entrenched in
China" and the economy there is developing at a pace unexpected, a
 high-ranking Surinamese official said here today.
</P>
<P>
And the handover of Hong Kong to China will not cause any
setbacks, but on the contrary, it will promote economic and social
 development in Hong Kong, said Desire Delano Bouterse, special
envoy of the Surinamese president.
</P>
<P>
Bouterse made these comments at a press conference here today
after a 10-day visit to China by a high-level Surinamese
delegation he led. The delegation arrived here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Bouterse said that China is building "Socialism with Chinese
characteristics" and the pace of its economic development is
beyond expectation.
</P>
<P>
The concept of "one country, two systems" initiated by Deng has
 been proved to be workable and its implementation should be
accomplished through joint efforts by the people of China's
mainland and Hong Kong, Bouterse said.
</P>
<P>
Surinam and China had reached an agreement during their talks in
 Beijing that the two countries will develop a fully cooperative
relationship, Bouterse said.
</P>
<P>
Surinam's first ambassador to China Gys Tiju Fat Cheong, who
was also a member of the delegation, will be in the Chinese
capital for his mission before the end of this month and the
Surinam embassy in Beijing is to be set up as soon as possible,
Bouterse released.
</P>
<P>
The two countries established diplomatic relations in May 1976.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Official Raps U.S. Veto of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, March 8 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian official
today criticized the U.S. veto against a European-sponsored
resolution condemning Israel's plan to build new settlements in
east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Nayef Hawatmeh, Secretary General of the Democratic Front for
Liberation of Palestine (DFLP) said in a statement that the
U.S. veto blocks the international community from stopping the
Israeli settlement activity.
</P>
<P>
The United States Friday vetoed the resolution against Israeli
decision to build new Jewish housing in East Jerusalem after the
Arabs pressed for a Security Council vote despite the
U.S. opposition.
</P>
<P>
The vote was 14-1 on the draft resolution sponsored by
Britain, France, Sweden and Portugal.
</P>
<P>
Hawatmeh urged Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to halt the
peace talks with Israel in response to the recent developments.
</P>
<P>
He also called for an inter-Palestinian all-round dialogue at
any Arab capital with a view to reunifying the Palestinian people
and its national ranks in the face of the Israeli occupation and
settlement.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-based DFLP is generally considered the third
largest group in the Palestine Liberation Organization after
Arafat's Fatah group and the Popular Front for the Liberation of
the Palestine.

<HEADLINE> OSCE Steps in to End Albanian Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) today stepped up its efforts to
end the seven-week crisis in Albania by sending a delegation to
the country.
</P>
<P>
Head of the delegation, former Austrian Federal Chancellor
Franz Vranitzky, held talks today with Albanian opposition leaders
and was scheduled to meet Albanian President Sali Berisha who is
facing open rebellion in the country sparked by the collapse of
fraudulent pyramid investment schemes.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people lost their life savings and started
protesting to demand their money back. Two weeks ago, the protests
turned violent and the government declared a state of emergency.
</P>
<P>
The Albanian government and the opposition Thursday reached an
agreement for a 48-hour halt to military operations in the south
starting from Friday.
</P>
<P>
But the anti-government protesters, have turned down Berisha's
offer of an amnesty if they turn in their weapons during the
two-day suspension. They are demanding that Berisha, voted in
unopposed for a second term as president by parliament on Monday,
resign.
</P>
<P>
Unconfirmed reports today quoted OSCE officials as saying here
that President Berisha has agreed to holding elections within 45
days if the opposition, who took serveral towns in the south, lay
down their arms. The general elections were held in Albania in May
last year.
</P>
<P>
The OSCE's mission is the latest in a series of European
attempts to calm the crisis. The Council of Europe and the
European Union have also sent envoys to the country.
</P>
<P>
Both delegations called on President Berisha and opposition
leaders to work out a peaceful solution to the crisis.

<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- A draft decision on the government
work report delivered at the current session of the National
People's Congress (NPC), China's legislature, was passed today at
the second meeting of the presidium of the session.
</P>
<P>
The draft resolution will be put to a vote at the final plenary
meeting of this session.
</P>
<P>
The report makes a realistic summary of last year's government
work, indicates existing problems truthfully, and sets forth
feasible tasks for this year, the resolution says.
</P>
<P>
The presidium passed examination reports submitted by the NPC
Financial and Economic Committee on respectively: 1)
implementation of the 1996 plan for national economic and social
development, and the 1997 draft plan for national economic and
social development, and 2) implementation of the 1996 central and
local budgets, and the 1997 draft central and local budgets.
</P>
<P>
The presidium also adopted draft resolutions on national
economic and social development plans and on central and local
budgets to be submitted to a vote at the final plenary meeting of
the session.
</P>
<P>
Liu Suinian, chairman of the NPC Financial and Economic
Committee, said macroeconomic control measures aimed at curbing
inflation in 1996 met the pre-set goal, and targets put forth in
the 1996 national economic and social development plan were
attained.
</P>
<P>
This indicated a good beginning for fulfilling the Ninth
Five-Year Plan (1996-2000) and long-range goals for the year 2010,
he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The committee held that the guidelines, principles and key
points as set forth in the draft 1997 national economic and social
development plan are correct, he noted, and that various indices
are feasible. And it suggested that the draft plan and the report
made by Chen Jinhua, minister in charge of the State Planning
Commission, be approved.

Committee, said government revenue registered a remarkable
increase last year, surpassing the growth rate of the GDP at
present value and putting an end to a decade-long decrease of the
proportion of revenue in the GDP.
</P>
<P>
The overall implementation of last year's budget was good, Li
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The committee held that the guidelines for the draft 1997
central and local budgets are correct, with growth in budgeted
revenue in line with that of the GDP and budgeted expenditures
able to meet the needs of key aspects.
</P>
<P>
Li added that measures proposed for fulfilling budged targets
are suitable and that the draft budgets are feasible. The committee

Council be approved, and expressed approval for the report
delivered by Finance Minister Liu Zhongli.

<P>
The committee put forth the following proposals based on the

<HEADLINE> Abacha Free to Run: Nigerian Party Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lagos, March 8 (Xinhua) -- General Sani Abacha is free to run for
presidency in the 1998 presidential elections, Yemi Faounbi,
Vice-Chairman of the United Nigeria Congress Party said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The party chief said Abacha has the consitutional right for contesting
the presidency if he choose to be the flagbearer of one of the
country's five political parties.
</P>
<P>
Farounbi made the comment to journalists in Osogbo, the capital of
Osun State in west Nigeria, after presenting his party's candidates
for local government elections to the State Office of the National
Electoral Commission for screening.
</P>
<P>
He argued that even in the United States, it is not new for service
men to run for presidency.
</P>
<P>
Coming to power in 1993 in a coup, General Abacha announced in 1995
a three-year transition to civil rule program, according to which,
the military government will hand over power to an elected president
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
There have been reports and speculations of Abacha's intention to
succeed himself and some parties plan to woo him as their
presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
Abacha himself broke the silence for the first time earlier this
year. In an interview by the Washington Post newspaper, he said he had
put his mind to the issue, but added that it is not new in many parts
of the world for soldiers to drop their uniforms and run for
presidency.

<HEADLINE> Indian PM Calls for Consensus on Women's Quota Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister H.D. Deve
Gowda said today that members of parliament must reach a consensus
to pass a bill for reservation of 33 percent of seats to women in
national and local legislatures in the current parliament.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a function celebrating the International Women's Day
here, Gowda said the government would make all-out efforts to end
gender-based discrimination and he expressed the hope that
parliament would take a decision soon on the quota bill.
</P>
<P>
He said the government was committed to building women's
capacity to participate in politics and supporting them with
information and knowledge that would really empower them.
</P>
<P>
Gowda, however, said that merely changing the laws would not
help if social attitudes did not change.
</P>
<P>
He said the government was concentrating on education of the
girl child and special funds had been made in the 1997-98 budget
for education of the girl child in the low literacy areas of the
country.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe, Mozambique to Launch Joint Tsetse Fly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe and Mozambique have
agreed recently to carry out a joint project to control tsetse
flies in Zaimbabwe's Zambezi Valley and the common border areas.
</P>
<P>
The local daily Herald today quoted Chief Research Officer in
the Department of Tsetse and Trypanosomiasis William Shereni as
saying there was need for the two countries to conduct an initial
survey operation to assess the tsetse fly density across the
border before any meaningful joint operation got underway.
</P>
<P>
Several meetings have been held between Zimbabwe and Mozambique
and the former was now awaiting clearance from the government for
staff to go and work in that country.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique was ravaged by 16 years of civil war and so could
not put in place an effective tsetse control program.
</P>
<P>
Shereni said, ''the target program is along the north-eastern
border down the Zambezi Valley. We have set more than 50,000 targets
in the area.''
</P>
<P>
He added the targets along the border are maintained regularly
to form a barrier to restrict the flies from moving into the
country from Mozambique. enditem

<HEADLINE> Mandela Says Southeast Asian Tour "Immense Success" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Visiting South African
President Nelson Mandela today described his trip to four ASEAN
member countries as "an immense success".
</P>
<P>
Describing the Southeast Asian region as "a fast growing area"
in the world, Mandela said "my visit has been profitable as we
continue to learn from their experience in reconstructing and
developing their countries."
</P>
<P>
"We are going home fully enriched and knowing in some respects
what to do in confronting our own programs," Mandela said at a
news conference here.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia is the last leg of Mandela's four Southeast Asian
nation tour which also took him to the Philippines, Brunei and
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
On cooperation between ASEAN and the South African Development
Community (SADC), Mandela said there had been an initiative
undertaken by the ASEAN side to hold talks with other Southern
African states.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his confidence that Malaysian businessmen in South
Africa can meet their social obligations once they have settled
down.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether South Africa would implement the quota system
like in Malaysia for those historically disadvantaged, Mandela
said South Africa had made a policy before the election that
government institutions should actually reflect the racial
composition of the country.
</P>
<P>
He said it was absolutely imperative for any democratic
government taking over in South Africa, where privileges were once
monopolized by a minority, to apply affirmative action in all
institutions, and this was what the South African government was
doing.
</P>
<P>
On whether South Africa might emulate Malaysia's multi-racial
society policy, Mandela said the policy introduced by the
Malaysian Government had been able to distribute the economic
advantages among the various communities and had helped to remove
tension.
</P>
<P>
He said South Africa was facing a similar situation but in less
than three years the country was now on the way to removing the
tension.
</P>
<P>
"However, we do not want to arouse unrealistic expectations. It
will take us many years before we can eliminate such tension that
had arisen in the South African community," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, who arrived here on March 6 for a five-day state visit
to Malaysia, will wind up his 10-day Southeast Asian tour on
March 10.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Election Institute Approves List of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's general election
institute (LPU) has approved a definitive list of 2,285
parliamentary candidates submitted by three political parties, a
LPU official said here today.
</P>
<P>
The list was endorsed by the three electoral contestants -- the
ruling Golkar Group, the United Development Party (PPP) and the
Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI), LPU's deputy secretary Soetoyo
N.K. said.
</P>
<P>
Soetoyo told a function that the list contains 716 names for
the PPP, 825 from Golkar and 744 from the PDI.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government has set may 29 as voting day.
</P>
<P>
The three parties will contest 425 of the 500 seats in the
House of Representatives. The remaining 75 seats will be allocated
to the armed forces, whose members do not vote.
</P>
<P>
Soetoyo also said the government is breaking new ground in the
forthcoming election by allowing foreigners to observe the polls.
</P>
<P>
He quoted Minister of Home Affairs Yogie S. Memet as saying
Friday that foreign observers will have free access to monitor the
various stages of the election, including visiting the polling
booths on May 29.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that the government has officially
declared the general election open to foreign observers.
</P>
<P>
But Yogie, who is also LPU chairman, did no name the countries
to be invited.
</P>
<P>
About 125 million people have been registered as voters in the
general election. The LPU has set election campaigns for April 29
to May 23 followed by five days of pause.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan, Philippines to Develop Commercial Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif and visiting Philippine President Fidel Ramos held
wide-ranging talks here today and agreed to expand bilateral
commercial ties.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed to set up a business council to explore
ways of boosting their commercial ties.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said the Philippines would support Pakistan in its
efforts to become a full dialogue partner in the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum.
</P>
<P>
Ramos also asked Sharif to send a Pakistani business delegation
to Manila to find ways for further promotion of trade ties between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Sharif briefed Ramos on the current situation in Kashmir,
Afghanistan and the forthcoming Foreign Secretary-level talks
between India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also discussed the issue of signing an
extradition treaty between the two countries. They agreed on
measures to combat drug trafficking, money laundering and
ill-gotten wealth.
</P>
<P>
The draft of the extradition treaty is being prepared by the
Interior and Law Ministries and would soon be put up for the
cabinet's approval, according to government sources today.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines and Pakistan today also signed two agreements
on the arrangement for the establishment of policy consultation
talks and peaceful use of atomic energy between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani Commerce Minister Ishaq Dar told media that the talks
between Sharif and Ramos were "very good and we explored the
possibilities of expansion of trade between the two countries."
</P>
<P>
Ishaq Dar said the trade balance was in favor of Pakistan last
year. The trade between the two countries, he said, was quite good
in 1995-96 as Philippine imported rice and cotton from Pakistan.

<HEADLINE> Imelda Reacts Strongly to Statement on Marcos' Burial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' former First Lady
Imelda Marcos today reacted sharply to President Fidel Ramos'
statement that it is not yet "the right time" to bury the late
president Ferdinand Marcos at the Manila Heroes' Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
According to a news release from the Presidential Palace,
Imelda, now the Representative from Leyte province, said in a
one-sentence comment that "it is always the right time to do what
is right."
</P>
<P>
President Ramos Friday categorically rejected the renewed
request of the Marcos family for the burial of Marcos' remains at
the Manila Heroes' Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
He said during his visit to Bangladesh that the Marcos family
is free to bury Marcos' remains "anywhere in the Philippines, but
not at the heroes' cemetery".
</P>
<P>
He added that it was not the right time yet to bury Marcos'
remains at the heroes' cemetery.
</P>
<P>
Imelda requested the burial of Marcos at the heroes' cemetery
after the power supply to Marcos' air-conditioned mausoleum in
Ilocos Norte province was disconnected because of the failure of
the family to pay a five-million-peso (190,000 U.S. dollars) bill.
</P>
<P>
The widow of Marcos alleged earlier that Ramos had made a
written promise to her at the residence of Speaker Jose de Venecia
in 1992, agreeing to bury Marcos' remains at the heroes' cemetery.

<HEADLINE> Austria to Repatriate 10,000 Bosnian Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Austrian government today
introduced a plan to repatriate Bosnian refugees in the country in
a bid to ease worsening unemployment, but the plan received
criticism from opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, to be launched between March 15 and the end of
August, some 10,700 jobless Bosnian refugees remaining in Austria
will be sent back to their homes if they agree to leave.
</P>
<P>
Each household of the expatriates will be given 25,000
schillings (about 2,100 U.S. dollars) in alllowance if they leave
Austria voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
Austrian Prime Minister Viktor Klima and Minister of Interior
Karl Schloegl stressed that the program will be implemented on the
basis of the consent of the refugees.
</P>
<P>
They said those who are unable or refuse to go back to Bosnia
by the end of August will still put be under the protection of the
Austrian government.
</P>
<P>
The government will work out another plan for their settlement,
they added.
</P>
<P>
However, the government's plan received harsh criticism from
opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
President of the Freedom Party, Jorg Haider, said money will
not help solve the refugee issue. While there are actually around
60,000 Bosnian refugees in Austria, the plan only covers 10,700,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
The Liberal Forum and the Green Party also lashed out at the
plan's lack of legal basis.
</P>
<P>
Austria has been gripped with worsening social problems
including ever increasing unemployment. Foreign immigrants have
became a major headache for the government.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet is now discussing an amendment to the bill of
foreigners so as to curb the influx of immigrants to Austria.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government is making efforts to repatriate
jobless refugees in the country, in addition to tightening border
control to guard against human smuggling.

<HEADLINE> Famous HK Lawyer on Return of Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The smooth return of Hong Kong to
the embrace of the motherland will set an encouraging example for
Taiwan, and will surely exert a positive impact on China's
peaceful reunification, a renowned Hong Kong lawyer said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Henry Hu Hung-lick, barrister of Hong Kong and a Standing
Committee member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), made this remark at a
plenary meeting of the CPPCC National Committee.
</P>
<P>
"China's resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong by peaceful
means is a great creative endeavor in terms of international law
that is worth appreciations and emulations of all peace-loving
people across the world," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The principles of "one country, two systems," "Hong Kong people
governing Hong Kong" and "a high-degree of autonomy" initiated by
Deng Xiaoping, which resulted in the signing of the Sino-British
Joint Declaration in 1984, along with the enactment of the Basic
Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) in
1990, have laid a solid basis for Hong Kong's smooth transition
and hand-over of power, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Thanks to these correct principles, schemes of various parties
to hamper the smooth return of Hong Kong in recent years have all
been thwarted," he commended.
</P>
<P>
Chinese leaders have repeatedly declared with solemnity that
"one country, two systems" is China's basic national policy, which
will remain unchanged for at least 50 years, and this has provided
a substantive guarantee for the long-term stability and prosperity
of Hong Kong, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he added, booming economy in China's interior area
will prop up the prosperity of Hongkong Economy, and the interior
areas and Hong Kong complement each other and make up each other's
deficiencies.
</P>
<P>
Concerning the issue of China's reunification, he cited Hong
Kong's return to the motherland as a major stride toward the
peaceful reunification of the motherland, and said that it will
have a role of inspiration and enlightment, which is expected to
be helpful for the settlement of the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that at the Lunar New Year's Day of 1995, President
Jiang Zemin set forth an eight-point proposal for the peaceful
reunification with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"This proposal is conducive not only to the negotiations on
peaceful reunification across the Taiwan Strait, but to economic
prosperity for both sides of the Straits, so as to bring benefit
to the entire Chinese nation," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is beyond any doubt that Hong Kong's smooth return to the
motherland will play an exemplary role in the course of
accelerating the peaceful reunification of the motherland," Henry
Hu Hung-lick said.

"Evidences and clues show that there should not be deputies
holding ministerial portfolios," said King of Jordan Hussein
Friday in a late night television interview.
</P>
<P>
"A deputy's duty should be to monitor the government's
performance and should devote his time to serve the cause of
development and to follow up on legislation," said the king.
</P>
<P>
The king's remarks indicate that Jordan is leaning toward
adopting some kind of 'Norwegian law' which forbids
parliamentarians from holding cabinet posts, Jordan Times
reported today.
</P>
<P>
It said that a constitutional amendment specifically
prohibiting parliamentarians from holding cabinet posts will be
adopted or the king will express this preference in a letter of
appointment of Prime Minister Abdul Karim Kabariti for the next
term.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's current constitution does not prohibit members of
parliament from simultaneously holding ministerial posts and
there are currently 22 parliamentarians in the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
In the interview, the king also disclosed that he had offered
Kabariti a new mandate as head of a government willing to
confront formidable challenge and to introduce major reforms in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Hussein specifically mentioned the separation of powers between
the executive and legislative branches of government, regional
representation in the cabinet and the government's empowerment to
act on reforms even before the parliamentary elections are
held.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is scheduled to reshuffle the current cabinet in late
March after Hussein's visit to the United States on March 18.

<HEADLINE> Ethnic Minority Areas' Economic Growth Higher than National Average (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- China's five autonomous regions,
home to major ethnic groups, achieved a 10.5 percent economic
growth rate in 1996, 0.7 percent higher than the national average,
official sources said.
</P>
<P>
The regions covers a land area of 6.16 million square
kilometers, almost two thirds of China's land area.
</P>
<P>
To promote economic and social development in ethnic minority
areas, Law of Regional Autonomy was enacted in 1984. A
series of preferential policies have been formulated in recent
years to bridge the economic development gap between the
coastal areas and the central and western regions.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the first such area
to achieve regional autonomy, produced 15.35 billion kg of grain,
up by 4.8 billion kg over the previous year, making the region the
largest grain producer in terms of per capita output.
</P>
<P>
Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, had a gross regional product of
19.4 billion yuan last year, a three-fold increase over 1984.
Farmers' per capita income reached 1,416 yuan in 1996, an increase
of 1,117 yuan over 1984.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region had a gross regional product
of 188.5 billion yuan in 1996, up 10.6 percent over the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
Tibet Autonomous Region maintained a growth rate of more than
ten percent in the past two years while inflation declined from 17
percent to eight percent. The region's poverty-stricken population
fell from 480,000 in 1994 to 330,000 last year, official sources
said.
</P>
<P>
Local officials from the five autonomous regions attributed the
fast economic growth to reform and open policies as well as to
political stability and unity.
</P>
<P>
"The current situation marked by political stability, economic
progress, ethnic unity and better living standard is precious and
must be maintained," said Uliji, chairman of Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region.

</P>
<P>
The Nanning-Kunming Railway linking a major seaport in Guangxi
with the rest of the southwestern region and Guilin-Beihai
Expressway cutting through the region from the north to the south
will open to traffic in 1997. The central government will also
push ahead with its policy of shifting investment from the east to
the central and western regions.
</P>
<P>
"This will give Guangxi extraordinary historical
opportunities," said Cheng Kejie.
</P>

At present, all ethnic autonomous regions engage in economic
cooperation and exchanges with coastal provinces on a mutually
beneficial basis for common prosperity.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait joined other Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) states today in the 13th Gulf Traffic
Week which will end on March 14, a press release from Kuwait
Ministry of Interior said.
</P>
<P>
The theme of this year's program, an annual event to
emphasize the need for better and safer driving habits, focused
attention on the danger of jumping red signals, director of
public relations at the ministry Adel Al-Ibrahim said in the
released statement.
</P>
<P>
Huge posters carrying the emblem of the week for display on
buses as part of concerted efforts to highlight the issue were
prepared, the statement said.

As many as 40,000 brochures and 2,000 posters both in English

public places and supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
Besides, a five-day exhibition on traffic, the first of its

<HEADLINE> East China Seeks Overseas Help To Control Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, March 8 (Xinhua) -- East China's Anhui Province has
redoubled its efforts to promote international cooperation in
environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
The province has received some 140 million US dollars in loans
from the Asian Development Bank to finance a pollution control
project that involves the technological upgrading of a steel plant
and a chemical plant in the Chaohu Lake area.
</P>
<P>
The project, after completion, is expected to reduce some 3,570
tons of waste water that is now directly discharged into the lake
annually, and cut 97 percent of the ammonia and nitrogen that
spewed out by the two plants.
</P>
<P>
Two sewage treatment plants are under construction in Hefei
city, capital of the province, and Chaohu City, which will reduce
28,800 tons of Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), and greatly improve
the quality of the two cities' drinking water.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the province is speeding up a pollution control
pilot project in the Huaihe River valley, which has received 50
million US dollars in loans from the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
While introducing funds and advanced technology from abroad,
the province has paid more attention to learn overseas experiences
in the field, dispatching 20 delegations abroad, receiving 180
overseas scholars, and hosting several international symposiums in
the past few years.
</P>
<P>
Anhui has serious pollution problems in its Huaihe River valley
and Chaohu Lake area. The valley and the lake area are on the
national list of priorities in pollution control for the 1996-2000
period.

<HEADLINE> Post Office Savings Bank, Building Society </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe government, in a
major move expected to see another reduction in mortgage rates,
yesterday cut the interest rate on Post Office Savings Bank
(POSB) savings to the maximum 17 percent and on building society
tax-free shares to 15.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
The reduction, announced by Minister of Finance Herbert Murerwa
in a supplementary government gazette, came in the wake of a similar
recent cut in Commercial Bank lending rates, and the rediscount rate
of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
With such a drop in borrowing rates, the country's five building
societies are under pressure to cut their mortgage lending rates,
which would benefit thousands of Zimbabwean home-owners.
</P>
<P>
The POSB would also pay an interest rate of 17 percent on fixed
deposits, down from 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
These latest reductions have been made possible by the drastic
fall in annual inflation, which reached a seven-year low of 13
percent in November 1996, rose slightly to 16.4 percent in December
and dropped to 15.8 percent in January, local papers said today.

<HEADLINE> More Rebels Apply for Amnesty in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The National Amnesty Commission
(NAC) of the Philippines said today that more rebels are beating
the deadline to avail themselves of the benefits of the
government's amnesty program.
</P>
<P>
NAC executive director Teresa Veloso said that since the
issuance of an executive order providing for a 90-day extension of
the program up to March 20, some 7,166 rebels nationwide have
applied for amnesty.
</P>
<P>
She said the bulk of the applicants came from the New People's
Army and other insurgency groups.
</P>
<P>
The program, launched three years ago by the government, aims
to enjoin those who have revolted against the government to rejoin
the mainstream of society and lead peaceful and progressive lives.
</P>
<P>
Veloso said that only those who had fought for political belief
can be granted amnesty. Those who had committed common crimes may
not avail of the program.
</P>
<P>
The government signed a final peace agreement last September
with the mainstream Moro National Liberation Front, ending a
24-year-old civil war in the southern part of the country.
</P>
<P>
The government is currently pursuing peace talks with other
rebel groups like the National Democratic Front and the Moro
Islamic Liberation Front, trying to bring full and comprehensive
peace to the country.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report on Malaysia's CPO, Tin &AMP; Rubber Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's markets of Crude
palm oil (CPO), tin and rubber closed the week mixed.
</P>
<P>
On the CPO physicals market, palm oil was traded lower on
Monday but rebounded on Tuesday on short covering. The market,
however, plunged on Wednesday and continued its downtrend until
the end of the week as it was pressured by technical selling.
</P>
<P>
March-South dropped sharply to 1,282.50 ringgit (about 513 U.S.
dollars) per ton, down 32.50 ringgit from last week's close of
1,315 ringgit (about 526 U.S. dollars) per ton.
</P>
<P>
The CPO physicals are expected to continue to trade lower on
lack of significant indicators to lead trading activities next
week.
</P>
<P>
On the Kuala Lumpur Tin Market (KLTM), the metal closed the
week higher on heavy buying with support from European, Japanese
and local buyers throughout the week.
</P>
<P>
It closed at 14.27 ringgit (about 5.708 U.S. dollars) per kg,
up eight sen to 14.19 ringgit (about 5.676 U.S. dollars) per kg
last week.
</P>
<P>
Accumulated turnover for the week stood at 625 tons as compared
to 514 tons last week.
</P>
<P>
The price differential between the KLTM to the London Metal
Exchange (LME) stood at a premium of 15 U.S. dollars per ton
against 80 U.S. dollars per ton the previous week.
</P>
<P>
The price on the Malaysian rubber market was in a very tight
range throughout the week, but trading was active.
</P>
<P>
At the week's close, RSS One rose two sen to 304.00 sen (about
121.6 U.S. cents) per kg against 302.00 sen (about 120.8 U.S.
cents) last week.
</P>
<P>
But SMR 20 shed 3.50 sen to 294.50 sen (about 117.8 U.S. cents)
per kg from 298.00 sen (about 119.2 U.S. cents) per kg last week.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian rubber market should trade firmer next week as
production is expected to drop due to the current wintering season
coupled with the easing rubber stocks, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
However, the full impact of the rubber shortage had yet to be
seen as the demand was covered by existing stocks, a dealer said,
adding "by April or even next week, there should be significant
shortage, mainly on the RSS grades as production is anticipated to
have eased 40 percent to 60 percent."
</P>
<P>
Next week, the situation of the price in a very tight range but
active trading this week is expected to continue as the market
would be flooded with demand from China and Europe, the dealer
said.
</P>
<P>
India is also expected to approach and Iran is inquiring for
2,000 tons a month for the SMR 20 grade, he said.
</P>
<P>
Another dealer said players were confident that there would be
a correction on last week's price, based on the expectations of
production shortage.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Privatization of Zambian Copper Mines in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- With the bids for the mines and assets
of the Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) opened recently, the
privatization of the country's copper mines has culminated in its top
grear.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen foreign mining companies or bidding groups, including
the world's biggest ones, have submitted a total of 26 bids.
These companies are from the United States, Canada, Britain,
South Africa, India and Australia, among others. The mines
offered for sale are Nchanga division and Nkana division,
Luanshya division, Mufulira Undergound Mine and Concentrator and
Chambishi Copper Mine.
</P>
<P>
The copper mine privatization is expected not only to
resuscitate the country's ailing copper production but also to
boost the economic growth of other related sectors, which supply
the mines with various goods and services.
</P>
<P>
Zambia, one of the biggest copper-producing countries in the
world, boasts 15 percent of the world's copper ore reserves. The
copper mining earns Zambia 80 percent of its exporting earnings.
Copper had once made Zambia one of the richest countries in
southern Africa and its gross domestic product per capita reached
700 to 800 US Dollars in the 1970s when its output reached
700,000 tons a year.
</P>
<P>
The ZCCM, the sole copper mining corporation in Zambia,
monopolizes the production, transport and market of copper and
dominates its social services as well.
</P>
<P>
However, due to copper price falls in the international market
and outdated equipment, lack of investments and mismanagement,
Zambia's yearly copper output has decreased gradually to about
300,000 tons in recent years.
</P>
<P>
When the current government took power at the end of 1991, the
copper mining and the economy as a whole had plunged into crises. To
drag the ailing economy out of the quagmire, the government began to
resort to liberalizing its economy and 165 of the 271 companies have
been privatized ever since.
</P>
<P>
To attract foreign investments, advanced technology and management
to revive its stagnating copper production, the government invited both
domestic and foreign tenders for the ZCCM mines and assets.
</P>
<P>
In January this year, 80 percent interest of ZCCM Kansanshi Mine was
awarded to a giant US mining company, Cyprus Amax Minerals Company.
The U.S. company, which will pay Zambia a total of 2.8 million U.S.
dollars in three phases, is expected to spend another two million
dollars in a feasiblity study. It estimated the annual copper output
of Kansanshi at 50,000 to 100,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.S. company signed an agreement with Zambia under
which it will invest about 50 million dollars in Nchanga Mine in
Copperbelt Province.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the government and the Angol Ameraican
Corporation-led consortium signed a memorandum of understanding
on feasibility study on Konkola Deep Mine. Under the memorandum,
the American consortium will carry out the feasibility study
exclusively. It will decide whether or not to acquire 80 percent
of the interest of the mine by the end of June this year. The
Konkola Mine contains 340 million tons of ore resources and can
sustain mining operations for 30 years. Once it comes into full
operation the annual copper output will reach 180,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Under a government plan, the privatization of the ZCCM will be
completed in two stages. The first stage will be completed by the
end of this year and the second stage in the first half of 1998.
To protect the national interests, the govenment will retain a
"gold share" in the ZCCM so that it can exercise the veto when
it is necessary. enditem

<HEADLINE> Efforts to Industrialize Agriculture in Central, Western China Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- A member of China's top advisory
body today calls for accelerating efforts to industrialize farm
production in central and western China in the interest of the
growth of rural economy in the region.
</P>
<P>
Huang Qixing, vice-chairman of the Central Committee of the Jiu
San (September 3) Society, made the call in a speech on the fifth
meeting of the Fifth Session of the Eighth National Committee of
the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC).
</P>
<P>
Terming it anther great creation by the Chinese farmers after
the "household responsibility" system and rural enterprises
introduced in the late 1970s and the early 1980s, Huang said the
the business of industrializing farm production and farm produce
processing first appeared in the Pearl River Delta area in south
China, and later spread to southern Fujian province, Shanghai,
Jiangsu, Shandong and Beijing, which are the more developed
regions in the country.
</P>
<P>
However, the process is still at the initial stage in some
parts of the central and western region, he acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
Huang went on to note that in the mid-western region,
agricultural development is imbalanced, key enterprises are small
in scale with a low level in their application of science and
technology, the distribution of interests between the enterprises
and farmers is irrational, the input of capital is inadequate, and
operation mechanism is not standardized.
</P>
<P>
To further advance this process that helps to gear agricultural
production to the market demand, Huang suggested that leading
processing enterprises with high technical standards, engaged in
in-depth farm produce processing, and operating an extensive
network, which link farmers and market, should be added and
developed.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, local resources should be tapped and developed to
make products that suit the market demand, he noted, and
production, processing and marketing should be operated as a
whole. And such bases should be set up.
</P>
<P>
It is necessary to set up a mechanism that connects production,
processing and marketing, coordinate the interests of all those
involved in the whole process, and resolve problems that crop up
in the distribution of interests, he said.
</P>
<P>
Finally, Huang Qixing called for the input of more funds, the
participation of large and medium-size enterprises in projects
concerning the business of industrializing farm production,
tightening of macro-economic controls, carrying out in-depth
structural reform, and formulation of relevant policies, laws,
rules and regulations.

TIANJIN, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The telephone number of this
northern China's largest port city has risen to eight digits from
seven digits since the beginning of today.

stage for its telecommunication development.
</P>
<P>
It is the city's third telephone digital rise in a decade. The
city's program-controlled switch boards have a capacity of 1.6
million telephones. It also has switch boards for 180,000 mobile
telephones.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Assures Businessmen of Investment Safety in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Visiting South African
President Nelson Mandela today assured Malaysian businessmen of
the safety of their investments in his country.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said the investments in the republic will be safe and
secure even after he steps down.
</P>
<P>
"I assure you that there is no reason to be concerned because
the government is a democratically-elected one...You shouldn't
worry," he told the Second South Africa-Malaysia Forum here
today.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, who recently announced his intention to step down,
said the new leadership would ensure that all investments,
including Malaysia's, in the republic are safe.
</P>
<P>
"We have extremely capable leaders in the African National
Congress (ANC). They have qualities and the virtues far beyond
myself," Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
Describing his deputy Thabo Mbeki as a well-educated and
exemplary leader, Mandela said Mbeki would be able to develop the
country with his far-sighted vision.
</P>
<P>
"We have a collective leadership in the ANC...I believe if I
step down, it will bring fresh blood (into the administration) and
the phase of development will also be doubled," he said.
</P>
<P>
South Africa has found Malaysia "a reliable ally" in the
Commonwealth of Nations, the Non-Aligned Movement and the United
Nations, he said.
</P>
<P>
"...That is why we place such a high premium on our relations
with Malaysia and other countries of Southeast Asia," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mandela arrived here on March 6 for a five-day state visit to
Malaysia, the last leg of his 10-day four-nation Southeast Asian
tour. He had already visited the Philippines, Brunei and
Singapore.

WASHINGTON, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Chris Woodruff got third seed
Carlos Moya out of his way to the title while Jonas Bjorkman upset
fourth seed Albert Costa on Friday at 328,000-U.S.-Dollar ATP
men's tennis tournament in Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
Woodruff, 64th-ranked, defeated Moya, the Australian Open
finalist, 7-6 (10-8), 5-7, 6-3 in two hours and nine minutes to
earn a spot in the semi-finals Saturday. This was his first
semi-final of the year.

Bjorkman eliminated Costa 6-4, 2-6, 6-4 to set up a semi-final
clash with eighth seed Richey Reneberg, a 6-4 6-2 winner over
French qualifier Jerome Golmard.
</P>
<P>
Bjorkman's match had a embarrassing ending. The Swede claimed
victory while serving at 6-5, 40-0 following his eighth ace, and
his Spanish opponent made an obscene gesture, which made chair
umpire Norm Chryst to call a second code violation, ending the one

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The portrait of the first chief
executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Tung
Chee-hwa, will be painted on a dozen snuff bottles.
</P>
<P>
The job will be done by Wang Xisan, a master painter and a
member of the Eighth National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference, the country's top advisory body
that has been in session here.
</P>
<P>
Wang, 58, painted the portrait of former US President Ronald
Reagan on a snuff bottle years ago for the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs, which gave it to the US president as a gift. Reagon wrote
Wang a letter of thanks.
</P>
<P>
Tung's portraits will be based on pictures showing he was
delivering speeches or running for election, with scenes of Hong
Kong or patterns of bauhinia. The snuff bottles will be sent to
Hong Kong for exhibition after July 1.
</P>
<P>
The snuff bottles measure nine cm high, six cm wide and 2.5
cm thick.
</P>
<P>
Wang's works include a set of portraits of former US presidents.
He was invited to paint overseas six times, with one of his
works auctioned for 240,000 Hong Kong dollars.
</P>
<P>
Snuff was first introduced into China from Europe in the Ming
Dynasty (1368-1644) and the Chinese then replaced snuffboxes with
snuff bottles and painted them inside.

<P>
CANBERRA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Jacques Villeneuve of Canada took
the pole position of the season-opening Australian Formula One
Grand Prix at Melbourne on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Villeneuve clocked the fastest time of one minute 29.369
seconds in the qualifying session, took his fourth pole position
in a career which started only in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Villeneuve switch to Formula One after winning the 1995 IndyCar
Series title and achieved immediately success. He also took the
pole position in last year's Australian Formula One Grand Prix.
</P>
<P>
He won four races last season and finished second behind Damon
Hill.
</P>
<P>
Villeneuve's Williams teammate Heinz-Harald Frentzen drove the
second fastest time of 1:31.123, 1.754 seconds behind Villeneuve.
</P>
<P>
Two-time world champion Michael Schumacher of Germany came
third at 1:33.472 in a Ferrari. David Coulthard of Scotland was
fourth at 1:31.531 in his McLaren-Mercedes.
</P>
<P>
Reigning world champion Damon Hill nearly failed to qualify for
Sunday's race. He managed to produce a qualifying time with some
5 minutes left in the one-hour qualifying session.
</P>
<P>
The 20th place in the qualifying session was surely an
embarrassment to Hill who now drives for Arrows-Yamaha team. It
will be the first time since October 1995 that Hill is off the
front row of the grid.
</P>
<P>
Three of 23 drivers failed qualify for the Sunday's race.

<HEADLINE> Slowdown in Indian Industrial Growth Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The slowdown in Indian
industrial growth continued unabated in November 1996, pushing
cumulative growth in the first eight months of fiscal 1996-97
(April-March) to 9.1 percent as compared to 11.7 percent in the
previous corresponding period.
</P>
<P>
According to the Times of India today, although the slowdown
was widespread in all the sectors and most of the sub-groups in
the manufacturing sector, the major cause for the decline in
growth rates remained to be the poor performance in electricity
and mining.
</P>
<P>
Electricity generation grew at only 3.7 percent as against 9.7
percent, the mining sector posted a 2.5 percent growth compared to
8.9 percent, with the all important manufacturing sector showing
relatively high growth at 11 percent, slightly down from 12.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
However, in the month of November 1996, manufacturing sector
growth dropped sharply to 3.2 percent as against 14.2 percent in
November 1995.

<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian champions Gremio
went down to Peru's Sporting Cristal 0-1 in their away-match at
the South American Libertadores Cup on Friday in Lima.
</P>
<P>
Gremio's Dinho was sent off in the first half while the host
team also finished with ten men after having Marcelo Asteggiano
sent off for a second yellow card.
</P>
<P>
Gremio, Libertadores champions in 1995 and riding high on the
4-0 demolition of Alianza on Tuesday, didn't find their form and
wasted too much time struggling with the referee.
</P>
<P>
Norberto Solano scored the winner for Sporting with a penalty
in the sixth minute, the only goal of the dull but bad-tempered
match.
</P>
<P>
Gremio, currently second in the group behind Sporting, still
has much possibility of qualifying, as only last of the four teams
in each group will be eliminated in the first round. Cruzeiro of
Brazil had lost their all three games.
</P>
<P>
In Montevideo, Uruguayan champions Penarol edged Millonarios of
Colombia 2-1.
</P>
<P>
Coaches of both teams were sent off by the referee. Gregorio
Perez of Penarol was ordered to leave the bench for arguing in the
75th minute and his counterpart Angel Castelnoble suffered the
same fate in the 85th minute, after his team had just pulled a
goal back.
</P>
<P>
It was their second win in two games in the group. Last week,
they hammered local rivals Nacional 4-1.
</P>
<P>
Bolivian champions won 3-1 at home over Cerro Porteno, the
champions of Paraguay, in La Paz.
</P>
<P>
Cerro Porteno's defeat was their third in three games,
leaving them firm favourites to be knocked out of a group
which also includes Oriente Petrolero of Bolivia and Guarani
of Paraguay.
</P>
<P>
Bolivar top group one, having won all three outings with eleven
goals.

<HEADLINE> Nepal's Major Parties in Race to Form New Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's two major political
parties are vying in forming a new coalition government through
negotiations with others in the wake of Thursday's resignation by
the present three-party government.
</P>
<P>
The government under Sher Bahadur Deuba of the Nepali Congress
(NC) party quit Thursday night after failing to win majority
support in the lower house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the NC party and the main opposition Communist party
initiated their separate talks with other parties for establishing
an alternative government that would secure majority support of
the house.
</P>
<P>
The outgoing main ruling NC party also decided to expel two
rebel MPs, whose absence from Thursday's house voting directly led
to the unexpected fall of the 18-month-old government.
</P>
<P>
The 205-seat lower house Thursday rejected a confidence motion
tabled by Prime Minister Deuba for his government with a vote of
101 for and 92 against. The prime minister resigned hours later.
</P>
<P>
Deuba's NC party said Friday that it wants to remain in power
by forging alliance with other parties even including the main
opposition Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist Leninist,
CPN-UML).
</P>
<P>
But the CPN-UML on the same day decided to consider the
possibility of joining hands with the NC only if the party is
offered the prime ministership.
</P>
<P>
The CPN-UML and the NC, the two biggest parties in parliament
with 90 and 88 lower house seats respectively, have been arch
rivals in the country's political arena since they jointly
struggled for the introduction of the multi-party parliament
system in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The present NC-led government came to power in September, 1995
when a minority CPN-UML government was overthrown by an alliance
of the NC and two small parties in the house through a
no-confidence vote.
</P>
<P>
It is expected the National Democratic Party (RPP), with its 19
MPs in the hung parliament, will play a crucial role in the
formation of the future government, observers here said.
</P>
<P>
The Deuba government's fall was also attributed to one RPP
faction's earlier withdrawal from the coalition.
</P>
<P>
The shape of the new government will likely emerge by Saturday
evening after extensive negotiations, a leader of the main
opposition CPN-UML said Friday.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Vetoes Draft Urging Israel to Stop Housing Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The United States today
vetoed a United Nations Security Council draft resolution calling
on Israel to stop its plan to build a Jewish neighborhood in east
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The voting of the 15-member UN Security Council resulted in 14
countries for, and one, the United States, against the draft
resolution proposed by the European Union.
</P>
<P>
The draft resolution was not passed as the United States is one
of the five permanent members of the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Under the draft, Israel was asked to "refrain from all actions
or measures" that "alter the facts on the ground, preempt the
final status negotiations, and have negative implications for the
Middle East peace process."
</P>
<P>
Israel was also asked to "abide scrupulously by its legal
obligations and responsibilities" under international law.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Liberation Organization representative Nasser
Al-Kidwa said the Arabs would ask for an emergency meeting of the
185-member U.N. General Assembly, where there is no veto.
</P>
<P>
Al-Kidwa thanked the Europeans for their support. He said that
despite the U.S. veto, the council vote showed a "clear, unified
international position" critical of the Israeli decision.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador Bill Richardson to the UN told the council that
the United States regretted Israel's decision to build the 6500
housing complex in Har Homa.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that Washington believes the Security Council
resolution "would not have helped" the peace process. He pointed
out that Palestinians and Israelis themselves should resolve the
Middle East issue and not the Security Council.

<HEADLINE> UN Council Calls for Ceasefire in E. Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The UN Security Council
Friday called upon the Tutsi-led rebels, the Alliance of
Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo/Zaire, to declare
publicly their acceptance of a five-point peace plan, in
particular an immediate cessation of hostilities.
</P>
<P>
A ceasefire is the first point of the peace plan drafted by the
UN/OAU Special Representative Mohmmed Sahnoun and endorsed by the
Security Council in its resolution 1097.
</P>
<P>
The other points include withdrawal of all external forces,
reaffirmation of respect for the national sovereignty and
territorial integrity of Zaire and other states of the region,
protection for all refugees and the eventual holding of an
international conference.
</P>
<P>
The Zairean government accepted the peace plan on 5 March 1997.
</P>
<P>
The council also expressed concern about the effect which the
continued fighting is having on the refugees and inhabitants of
the region and called upon all parties to allow access by the
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and humanitarian agencies to
refugees and displaced persons and to guarantee their safety, as
well as that of U.N. and humanitarian aid workers.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Opposition Warns of Tougher Movement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Opposition Bangladesh Nationalist
Party (BNP) chairperson Khaleda Zia Friday warned of a tougher
movement against the government if what she called the "reign of
killing" was not stopped immediately, the local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a huge public meeting at Keshabpur county, about 160
km southwest of the capital Dhaka, the BNP leader also alleged
that the government was making all arrangements to make the
country a vassal state of India by providing it with transit
facility.
</P>
<P>
A certain quarter in the government was trying to create a
market for Indian goods by closing down local mills and factories,
alleged Khaleda Zia, adding that "the economy has already been
ruined."
</P>
<P>
The opposition leader denied that her party does not want to
launch a movement. "We are already in a movement. But we do not
want to bring suffering to the people."
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the BNP announced that it would launch a
month-long agitation program, which includes countrywide mass
contact until March 29 and processions at all county headquarters
on March 30, against the eight-month-old government of Sheikh
Hasina.

<HEADLINE> China Not Interested in Alliances: Senior Military Officer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brussels, March 7 (Xinhua) -- China would never establish a
military alliance with other countries, nor station soldiers or
set up military bases in other countries, a senior Chinese
military officer said today.
</P>
<P>
Fu Quanyou, the Chief of General Staff of the Chinese People's
Liberation Army (PLA), made the remarks in meeting with Belgian
Defense Minister Jean-Pol Poncelet.
</P>
<P>
Fu, also member of China's Central Military Commission, arrived
in Brussels with a delegation on Wednesday for an official visit,
at the invitation of Admiral Willy Herteleer, chief of the General
Staff of the Belgian Army.
</P>
<P>
Fu and the defense minister held talks today on relations
between the two countries and the two armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the Belgian minister on achievements in China's
economic reforms, Fu said China would make continuous efforts and
move ahead along the road of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics.
</P>
<P>
Elaborating on China's independent foreign policy and national
defense policy, the Chinese official said China's national defense
policy was defensive and China opposed hegemonism, power politics
and aggression in any form.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian minister talked about the economic and national
defense policies of his country, and about Belgium's membership of
NATO and the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Touching upon NATO's eastward expansion, he said the
organization should adjust itself to the developing situation in
Europe, and the whole world, and establish a stable relationship
with Russia.
</P>
<P>
Both sides voiced their desire to further the existing friendly
ties between the two armed forces.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Belgium, Fu also talked with chief of the
General Staff of the Belgian army on Thursday before visiting the

<HEADLINE> Hostage Talks Between Peru's Government, MRTA Suspended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Talks to end Peru's 80-day hostage
crisis was suspended today after Tupac Amaru Revolutionary
Moverment (MRTA) accused the Peruvian authorities of building a
tunnel in an attempt to storm the besieged Japanese ambassador's
residence.
</P>
<P>
The negotiation process was thrown into confusion on Thursday
when Nestor Cerpa, who leads the occupation of the Japanese
ambassador's residence, said he had evidence that the
Peruvian government was digging a tunnel for troops to rescue the
hostages while holding talks with him at a safe house across the
street from the diplomatic residence.
</P>
<P>
"We are not going to attend the negotiations because the right
conditions do not exist," he said in a walkie-talkie interview
from within the residence.
</P>
<P>
President Alberto Fujimori and his chief negotiator Domingo
Palermo withheld comments on the accusations. Defense Minister
Tomas Meza Castilo denied Cerpa's accusations during a visit to
Bolivia.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that it is the result of the MRTA members'
nervousness, nothing else," said the defense minister, adding that
the government is seeking a peaceful solution.
</P>
<P>
There is no news about when the talks will be resumed.
</P>
<P>
MRTA stormed the building on December 17 and seized hundreds of
cocktail party guests. They released most in the following weeks
but still hold 72 persons, including Fujimori's brother, two
government ministers, the ambassadors of Japan and Bolivia and
two dozen Japanese diplomats and businessmen.

WASHINGTON, March 7 (Xinhua) -- A new survey found that more
than half of female psychologists in the United States are being
sexually harassed by their patients.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey conducted by the American Psychological
Association, 53.4 percent of the 354 female psychologists surveyed
said they had been sexually harassed at least once by a patient.
</P>
<P>
One psychologist reported 29 such incidents in her career. Ten

<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
economic briefs from Latin American countries:
</P>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA -- Colombian cattle breeders registered
annual production losses of at least 100 million U.S. dollars due
to inadequate animal management practices, poor sanitary
conditions and technological backwardness.
</P>
<P>
Lack of training for rural workers has also affected the
productivity of the cattle industry, said sector sources.
</P>
<P>
HAVANA -- Cuba's hydroelectric energy generation increased 15
percent in 1996, compared to 1995 figures, according to the
National Hydraulic Resources Institute.
</P>
<P>
The 1,644 mini, micro and small-scale hydroelectric plants
operating in the country last year produced more than 22,000
megawatts/hour by transforming the kinetic energy of rivers,
brooks and other water currents, mainly in the mountain areas of
the island.

</P>
<P>
The bloc's GDP growth was accompanied by a reduction in
regional inflation, which registered 7.6 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
The BID study showed that the acceleration in economic growth
caused an imbalance in Mercosur's foreign accounts, more
noticeable in its two biggest members -- Argentina and Brazil --
who account for 97 percent of the bloc's GDP. The other two
members of the trading bloc are Uruguay and Paraguay.
</P>
<P>
SAN JOSE -- Costa Rica registered a 0.63 percent inflation rate
in February of this year, the lowest since March 1996, announced
Finance Minister Jose Leon Desanti.
</P>
<P>
The figure reflects the variation seen in the index of prices
for some 264 goods and services, he said.
</P>
<P>
Most affected by February's inflation are footwear, potatoes,
primary and secondary school fees, house rents, milk, and beer.
</P>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO -- The Interamerican Development Bank (BID) approved
three loans worth 169.6 million U.S. dollars for the modernization
project of Uruguay's central government.

by the BID, worth a total of 115 million dollars, have a 20-year
maturity period, while the third, for 54.6 million dollars, has a
25-year term.
</P>
<P>

directed to finance agriculture and livestock producers during the
present agricultural cycle.
</P>
<P>
MEXICO CITY -- Mexico's mining industry will invest a total of
1.071 billion dollars in 1997, a reduction on the 2.527 billion
dollars invested between 1995-1996.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce and Industrial Development (Secofi) Ministry
announced in a communique that during the first quarter of the
year bidding was opened for the first two packages of projects for
the exploitation of gold, silver and copper in several states.

The company was affected by prolonged strike in the middle of
1996.

<HEADLINE> Italy's Banks to Suffer Single European Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Italy's banks will suffer a huge loss
of nearly 14 trillion lire (about 8.2 billion U.S. dollars) if the
Italian lira joins the European single currency Euro, a report by
by an Italian association of private banks said here today.
</P>
<P>
The association, known as Assbank, said that with the adoption
of the European single currency, the loan credit is expected to be
brought down significantly, which would be a heavy blow to the
Italian banks.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that Italian banks at present earn little from
financial services. It predicted that the implementation of the
European single currency will a bring radical transformation of
the banking sector of Italy.
</P>
<P>
At present, the majority of Italy's banks remain in the public
sector, but some privatizations are in the offing this year, it
said.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 100 foreign banks had advised the Bank of Italy that
they intend to open their businesses in Italy, it said.
</P>
<P>
Bank of Italy Governor Antonio Fazio has warned the Italian
banks that they need to lower their costs if they are to remain
competitive in the new environment.
</P>
<P>
The Maastricht treaty, signed in December, 1991, called for
establishing an economic and monetary union including a single
currency among the EU member states.
</P>
<P>
The European single currency, which will come into effect in
1999, set several conditions including rates of budget deficit,
debt, inflation and unemployment for the EU member states.
</P>
<P>
As few countries have met the demands set in the treaty,
analysts here said the implementation of the single currency is
likely to be postponed.

Hong Kong will return to China in just a few months and this is
the success of Deng's theory, said Kavaldziev.
</P>
<P>
"The passing away of Deng Xiaoping is a great loss to the
Chinese people," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kavaldziev, 63, who was elected vice president in last
November's election, said that Bulgaria, which sticks to the "One
China" policy, always attaches great importance to developing
friendly and cooperative relations with China.
</P>
<P>
He added that it was a wonder that China, with a population of
1.2 billion, has not only solved the problem of eating but also
changed the face of the country's rural areas.
</P>
<P>
It was the achievement of China's reform and a contribution to
the whole world, he said.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Refuses to Bury Marcos at Heroes' Cemetery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
has categorically rejected the renewed request of the family of
the late president Ferdinand Marcos for the burial of his remains
at the Manila Heroes' Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
Today's local press quoted Ramos as saying Friday that the
Marcos family is free to bury the remains of the late strongman
"anywhere in the Philippines, but not at the heroes' cemetery."
</P>
<P>
Ramos, who is on a 10-day visit to South Asia and the Middle
East, made the statement in Dhaka, Bangladesh. He said that
whether Marcos can be buried at the heroes' cemetery "is still a
divisive issue."
</P>
<P>
"It is still a largely divisive issue," he said, adding that
Marcos could not be buried at the heroes' cemetery without the
permission of the national government.
</P>
<P>
Ramos was also reportedly keeping his hands off on the cutting
of power supply to the air-conditioned mausoleum in Marcos'
hometown of Batac, Ilocos Norte, the northern Philippines, where
Marcos' remains were being preserved prior to burial.
</P>
<P>
Local power corporation cut off the supply on Monday following
the Marcos' refusal to pay a five-million-peso (190,000 U.S.
dollars) bill. The family had failed to pay power bills since
Marcos' remains was returned to his hometown from Hawaii, the
United States in 1993.
</P>
<P>
"It's strictly a business decision. The President had nothing
to do with it," Ramos said.

<P>
ROME, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Italian Defense Minister Beniamino
Andreatta today indicated that Italy was likely to turn down an
Albanian request for the extradition of its two pilots, who flew a
reconnaissance plane across the Adriatic to Italy on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Andreatta said the extradition request was being studied and
he could not express the defence ministry view right now.
</P>
<P>
But he added that on a purely personal view, Italy was not
likely to meet the request if the two pilots had skipped Albania
for what he called a "question of conscience."

<HEADLINE> China's NPC Deputies Call for More Organ Donation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Deputies to the on-going annual
session of the National People's Congress, the legislature, today
made a proposal urging more people to donate their organs and
bodies posthumously.
</P>
<P>
This will directly benefit others and help raise the standards
of China's medical researches, noted the proposal, which was set
forth by Yan Renying and Hu Yamei, both women medical experts from
Beijing. They have signed the proposal for the contribution.
</P>
<P>
What they proposed has drawn enthusiastic response from some of
their fellow deputies in the Beijing delegation. Fang Huijian,
Tong Yingzheng, Jiang Xiaoke, Ma Yaoji, Yang Zhounan and a number
of other deputies have seconded and signed the motion.
</P>
<P>
Yan, 83, a professor of the Beijing Medical Sciences
University, said: "In view of the present medical attainment, some
organs and tissues of the diseased can be transplanted to the sick
people or the disabled so as to relieve their pains."
</P>
<P>
Autopsy will enable researchers to study some knotty, pending
medical problems and sort out methods for their treatment, she said.
</P>
<P>
"This kind of donation epitomizes progress in social
civilization and displays the spirit of devotion to others," Yan
said.
</P>
<P>
Deng Xiaoping, who died on February 19, offered his cornea and
remains for autopsy.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that organ contributions are in still extremely
short supply in China today. The transplanting of cornea can help
some eye patients to restore their eyesight. But, since there are
not enough organ contributions to go round, many people in need of
transplantation have to be registered and wait, possibly for
years.
</P>
<P>
Yan explained: "The reasons that there are only few organ
contributors are psychological and mental barriers and a lack of
relevant publicity and promotion."
</P>
<P>
She called for people from all strata of society to increase
their awareness in contributing organs and remains, so as to
expand the donators' ranks steadily.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The Fifth Session of the Eighth
National Committee of the Chinese People's Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), China's top advisory body, held its fifth
plenum today.
</P>
<P>
Ten members of the CPPCC National Committee spoke at the plenum
on a wide range of issues, which include rural economic
development, reunification of the motherland, protection of farm
land, and educational development in poverty-stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
Li Ruihuan, chairman of the CPPCC National Committee, was
present.
</P>
<P>
Wang Lianzheng, vice chairman of China Association of Science
and Technology, speaking at the meeting, called for enhanced
efforts to apply agro-technology in broader areas, strengthening
the role of county-level science and technology associations, and
increasing investment in the dissemination of agro-techniques.
</P>
<P>
Lu Ming, vice-chairman of the China Democratic National
Construction Association Central Committee, called for greater
efforts to halt farmland decrease amid economic expansion and
population growth.
</P>
<P>
Lin Donghai, a member of the standing committee of the Central
Committee of Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, spoke on
behalf of his party. In the past year, he said, the Chinese people
achieved great successes in opposing separatism and "Taiwan
independence."
</P>
<P>
He said the Taiwan authorities, with double-faced tactics, are
engaged in activities to split the motherland, which have resulted
in a low ebb for across-strait relations.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his intention to make greater contributions to
moving forward cross-strait relations and the reunification of the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
Chen Zongde, a research fellow from the Chinese Academy of
Social Sciences, said China is a country suffering from water
shortage, drought and flood. Soil and water erosion and serious
water pollution are also plaguing the country.
</P>
<P>
Chen called for more coverage of resources protection by the
mass media and accelerated formulation of policies and regulations
by the government aimed at protecting water resources.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Huang Qixin, vice chairman of Jiu San Society Central
Committee, Lu Maozeng, chairman of the CPPCC Shandong Provincial
Committee, Shi Ningsun, a standing committee member of the China
Democratic National Construction Association Central Committee and

<HEADLINE> Italy Favors Delay in Decision on NATO Southern Command </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Italy said it favored a delay of five
to seven years in deciding who should command the NATO's southern
command based in Naples, Italy.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini, who spoke after talks with
visiting U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen, said that a
proposal to defer a decision on the issue for at least five years
had already been accepted by the rest of the Western military
alliance.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident that France may also find it acceptable,"
Dini told a joint press conference with Cohen.
</P>
<P>
The dispute over the command first came up on February 17 when
diplomatic sources at the NATO's headquarters in Brussels said
French President Jacques Chirac was ready to reverse France's
recent decision to enter the NATO's military command structure
unless the United States handed over the southern command to a
European.
</P>
<P>
NATO's southern command covering the volatile Mediterranean
region is now led by an American admiral.
</P>
<P>
The United States has so far refused to surrender the command
to a European officer. However, Cohen said Tuesday in Bonn it was
willing to review control of the command in five to seven years.
</P>
<P>
Dini and Cohen also discussed NATO's plan to expand to eastern
Europe and its relations with Russia.
</P>
<P>
"Russia does not like NATO's eastward expansion, but it would
accept this on defined conditions," Dini said.

<HEADLINE> EU Should Stick to Monetary Integration Timetable: Austria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Austrian Chancellor Viktor Klima
today urged the European Union (EU) to stick to its agreed
timetable set for monetary integration among all its member
nations.
</P>
<P>
Klima made this statement during a breakfast with Marcelino
Oreja Aguirre, visiting EU official in charge of preparatory work
for the bloc's next intergovernmental conference.
</P>
<P>
The chancellor said the deadline EU set for the economic and
monetary union must not be postponed and the new single currency,
Euro, must be issued on the agreed date of January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Any postponement would hurt the overall plan for integration
and lead to financial and economic disasters, he warned.
</P>
<P>
He insisted that the issue of employment be included in EU
treaties.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that EU's institutional reforms should not be
carried out at the expense of small member nations and that the
15-member alliance should open its door to eastern Europe
gradually and carefully.
</P>
<P>
Austria will hold EU's rotating six-month presidency in the
second half of 1998, giving it a key role in the decision to adopt
the single currency.

SOFIA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Bulgarian Foreign Minister Stoian
Stalev today announced visa exemptions for European Union citizens
who come to Bulgaria as tourists or for business purposes.
</P>
<P>
Stalev said that the government on Thursday officially approved

Under the resolution, which is effective immediately, citizens
of the EU and countries of the European Free Trade Union no longer
need visas if they stay in Bulgaria for less than a month.

fulfil certain requirements as an associate country of the EU and
strengthen its ties with EU countries.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Russia Duma Approves Amnesty for Chechen Fighters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The Russian State Duma (lower
house) passed a decree today to give amnesty to Chechen fighters
in a bid to win freedom for Russian prisoners-of-war.
</P>
<P>
Itar-Tass news agency reported that the decree, approved by 235
votes to 39, would become law after a final vote on March 12.
</P>
<P>
Under the decree, criminal cases would be dropped against those
who committed anti-law acts in the breakaway republic and
surrounding regions between December 1994 and December 1996.
</P>
<P>
The amnesty gives carte blanche to a presidential commission to
free Chechen and other detainees whenever they can be exchanged
for those in captivity in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
But excluded from the amnesty are those considered responsible
for a number of crimes including "banditry" -- which could have a
very broad interpretation.
</P>
<P>
The decree also does not apply to those who stole fire arms,
ammunition and explosives and sold them to illegal armed groups
and to other people involved in the confrontation.
</P>
<P>
The document does not apply either to particularly dangerous
repeat offenders, to foreigner and people without a nationality,
as well as to those involved in spying, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the Communist Party of Russia, Our Home is
Russia party and the Russian regions voted for the amnesty draft
while the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, Yabloko factions and
People's Power voted against it.
</P>
<P>
The draft decree was passed in principle in February, but has
been amended in order to ensure the possibility of the exchange of
detainees.
</P>
<P>
According to the federal authorities, as many as 1,346 people,
including Russian servicemen, are being detained in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
The exchange of prisoners, agreed in last August's ceasefire,
is one of the trickiest issues in continuing the peace process,
which is believed to be smoothed by today's adoption of the
decree.

<HEADLINE> Italy Likely to Turn Down Albania's Extradition Request </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March (Xinhua) -- Italian Defense Minister Beniamino
Andreatta today indicated that Italy was likely to turn down an
Albanian request for the extradition of its two pilots, who flew a
reconnaissance plane across the Adriatic to Italy on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Andreatta said the extradition request was being studied and
he could not express the defence ministry view right now.
</P>
<P>
But he added that on a purely personal view, Italy was not
likely to meet the request if the two pilots had skipped Albania
for what he called a "question of conscience."

PARIS, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Gail Devers won the 60 meters title

the event at the World Indoor Athletics Championship here on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Devers tied on 7.15 seconds with Ekaterini Thanou of Greece in
the semi-final. She was then put second behind world indoor
record holder Irina Privalova of Russia who clocked 7.10 in the

In the finals that followed, Devers clocked a winning time of
7.06 seconds. She was followed by Chandra Sturrup of the Bahamas
in the second place at 7.15. Frederique Bangue of France came

<HEADLINE> Mohe Considered Best Place for Observing Total Solar Eclipse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Mohe County in the northernmost
corner of China is believed to the world's best place to observe
the simultaneous occurrence of a total solar eclipse and the close
encounter of the Hale-Bopp comet on March 9, Chinese astronomers
said.
</P>
<P>
The total solar eclipse is to begin at 8:44 am between the
south of Biysk in Russia and Altay Prefecture in Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region, continue across Mongolia and achieve totality
in Mohe, Heilongjiang Province at 9:08 and will pass over the
eastern part of Russia and the Siberian Sea before concluding
above the Arctic Sea.
</P>
<P>
The total eclipse coincides with the arrival of the Hale Bopp
comet, which occurs once every 3,000 years.
</P>
<P>
Fang Cheng, an astronomer and an academician of the Chinese
Academy of Sciences, told Xinhua that when the solar eclipse just
starts, the sun's elevation angle is only 10 degrees and the
evaporation of surface atmosphere would prevent people from
clearly observing the scene.
</P>
<P>
However, when the solar eclipse comes to Mohe, the sun's
elevation angle will reach 20 degrees, far more convenient for
observation of the solar eclipse, while the Hale-Bopp comet
arrives at its best position for viewing during the two minutes
and 46 seconds of total solar eclipse.
</P>
<P>
He said, most of the 300 to 400 kilometer wide area over which
the solar eclipse occurs is in high mountains and deserts, only
Mohe, a larger city, could provide basic communications and
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The departments concerned have established three observation
sites and is to run "star observing trains" for star-gazers from
Harbin, the provincial capital, to Mohe.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-one experts from Japan, the United States, Germany, Hong
Kong and Taiwan are on their way to Mohe.

<HEADLINE> Consumer-rights Activities Set for March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Domestic activities to mark
International Consumers' Rights Day which falls on March 15 have
started earlier this year and are planned to last longer for the
benefits of consumers, the "China Daily" quoted the China
Consumers' Association (CCA) as saying.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, most national newspapers, radio and TV
stations started special columns and programs featuring serial
reports on consumer protection and important consumer and
complaint issues, a step taken to popularize china's consumer
protection movement.
</P>
<P>
Marking the international event, the State Bureau of Technical
Supervision yesterday publicized about 50 national and local
hotlines that hear complaints from consumers on a regular basis.
</P>
<P>
The bureau is also busy collecting the results of inspections
of different products, including tea, micro-wave ovens, milk,
cosmetics and glasses. The results will be unveiled on
International Consumers' Rights Day.
</P>
<P>
Many other government departments have also arranged special
activities for consumers' day. The State Administration for
Industry and Commerce will give consumer protection a high profile
this March with a month-long campaign to further publicize the
three-year-old law on consumer protection and inform the public of
their legal rights.
</P>
<P>
The ministries of health, post and telecommunications,
transportation, internal trade and civil aviation have set out
short-term and/or long-term goals to improve product quality and
services.
</P>
<P>
Similar activities will take place in other areas of the
country, according to CCA, which will underscore its
consumer-protection efforts through the theme "providing honest
services and anti-cheating activities."

<HEADLINE> Ukraine, Slovakia Sign Free Trade Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The prime ministers of Ukraine and
Slovakia today signed an agreement on free trade in a border town
in southwestern Ukraine, the Ukrainian Interfax news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
After two days of talks in Uzhgorod with his Ukrainian
counterpart Pavel Lazarenko, Slovak Prime Minister Vladimir
Meciar said his country supported Ukraine's admission to the
Central European Free Trade Association (CEFTA).
</P>
<P>
The signing of the agreement today was the first step to
Ukraine's membership of the CEFTA, Meciar added.
</P>
<P>
The two countries also signed seven other agreements on
bilateral cooperation in the fields of employment, industry,
transport, customs and security.
</P>
<P>
Lazarenko told a news conference that joining CEFTA would help
Ukraine's economic integration with Europe. His country, he said,
would also gradually lift trade barriers with Poland, Hungary, the
Czech Republic, Slovenia, Bulgaria and Romania, who are all eager
to join CEFTA.
</P>
<P>
Trade between Ukraine and Slovakia increased to 392.9 million
U.S. dollars in 1996, up from 113.8 million dollars in 1993. Raw
materials accounted for about 67 percent of Ukrainian exports to
Slovakia.
</P>
<P>
Meciar said Slovakia was interested in helping Ukraine repair
gas pipelines running to his country. Ukraine is expected to pipe
40 billion cubic meters of gas annually to Slovakia after the
repair project is completed.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Member on Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- China should set up a system of
agricultural macro-controls to achieve a reasonable distribution
of agricultural production, and to ensure a sustained, steady and
sound development of agriculture, a senior advisor said in Beijing
today.
</P>
<P>
Lu Maozeng, a member of the National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), China's top
advisory body, made this remark at a plenary meeting of the Eighth
CPPCC National Committee.
</P>
<P>
"Agriculture is the base of the national economy," said Lu. "We
should by no means neglect the importance of agriculture just
because of one or two years of bumper harvests."
</P>
<P>
In order to usher in effective agricultural macro-controls, he
suggested, a number of systems should be set up, he said.
</P>
<P>
These systems should cover the protection of basic farm land,
price protection for key farm products, storage and regulation of
agricultural products, risk funds for agricultural products, and
the easing of farmers' burden.
</P>
<P>
"Practice has proved that it is appropriate for the central
government to set the goal of controlling farmers' burden within 5
percent of their per-capita net income of the previous year," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
He also suggested that the existing agricultural management
system be strengthened to meet the demand of a market economic
structure, and a regulatory and control system with a legal basis
be gradually completed.
</P>
<P>
"The government should also try to set up a new and
comprehensive system for agricultural input, and optimize the
structure of agricultural investment," he said, adding that
agricultural input should include not only money from the
government, the collective and the individual farmer, but also bank
credit and foreign investment.

<HEADLINE> China's New Criminal Code to Protect Human Rights Better </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- China is amending its 17-year-old
criminal law to provide a more comprehensive guarantee for the
individual rights of its citizens, legal experts and legislators
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Draft amendments to the Criminal Law have been presented to the
Fifth Session of the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC),
China's top legislature, for deliberation and approval.
</P>
<P>
"Citizens' personal, democratic, property and other rights are
protected in an all-round way and provided for in detail" by the
draft amendments, said Gao Mingxuan, vice-president of the China
Law Society and a renowed expert on criminal justice.
</P>
<P>
"Detailed stipulations on the protection of individual rights
are the most distinctive characteristics of the draft amendments,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He held that the concept of safeguarding people's rights
permeates the whole piece of legislation.
</P>
<P>
Citizens' rights to safety, health, personal freedom, work,
election, religious freedom, free communication, property,
marriage freedom, and rights related to the family are all
protected by the draft law.
</P>
<P>
There are new stipulations or improvements on citizens' rights
to work, to religious freedom, private property and privacy, the
legal expert said.
</P>
<P>
To deal with forced labor which has emerged of late, the draft
amendments contain an additional provision stipulating that those
convicted of forced labor that has caused serious consequences may
face a jail term of up to three years.
</P>
<P>
State functionaries who illegally deprive citizens of the right
of religious freedom and those who violate the customs of ethnic
minorities may be sentenced to two years in prison, according to
the draft law.
</P>
<P>
Gao said that with the development of a market economy in the
country, individual and private economic operations have increased
in number, resulting in a broader range of private properties,
which need protection.
</P>
<P>
All aspects of the property rights of citizens are covered in
this draft law, Gao said.
</P>
<P>
The existing law does not mention the right to privacy. But
according to the amended draft law, those who violate the privacy
of others may be given a prison term of up to two years.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the establishment in the draft law of a major
principle of criminal justice -- that crimes and punishments must
be judged and meted out in accordance with specific provisions of
the law -- demonstrates that the draft law will better protect
individual rights if it is adopted, Gao said.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the most important task of the criminal law
is to protect people and punish criminals.
</P>
<P>
But, he stressed that the premise of punishing criminals must
be based on what constitutes a crime and that behaviors that are
not crimes must not be punished.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of this important juridical principle will
restrict willful practices in law enforcement and ensure that
criminals be punished while the innocent be free from prosecution,
Gao said.
</P>
<P>
The draft law is much more detailed than the existing law, with
258 articles added.
</P>
<P>
These, in the final analysis, are effective guarantees for the
rights of the people, he added.

<HEADLINE> Diesel Price to Dramatically Go Down in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Starting from 12 a.m. on Monday,
the prices of diesel and five other oil products in the
Philippines will be brought down by an average of 30 centavos (1.1
U.S. cents).
</P>
<P>
Local press said that the move was taken by the country's three
oil giants: Petron, Caltex and Pilipinas Shell Petroleum
Corporation. The price reductions were said to be the biggest in
the last four years.
</P>
<P>
The reductions include diesel, kerosene, fuel oil, and premium
and unleaded gasoline. After the adjustment, diesel, which is
heavily used by a kind of popular passenger vehicle in the
country, will sell at 7.6 pesos (29 U.S. cents) per liter.
</P>
<P>
However, the price of regular gasoline will go up by two to
three centavos, selling at 11.19 pesos (42 cents) per liter.
</P>
<P>
The price cuts are being made following the continued downtrend
in world crude prices and the country's full deregulation of the
oil industry last Month.
</P>
<P>
Industry sources were quoted as saying that no significant
changes in the country's oil prices are expected in the near
future, unless the international prices of crude and finished oil
products register dramatic increases this month.

<P>
NEW YORK, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Technology shares on New York
continued to struggle, but the broad market rose today as interest
rates fell after a key report revealing a sharp rise in new jobs.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 56.19 to 7,000.89,
finishing above the 7,000-mark by less than a point. For the week,
the blue-chip barometer gained 123.15, or 1.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by nearly a 2-to-1
margin on the New York Stock Exchange, with NYSE volume totaling
505.79 million shares down from 522.48 million in the previous
session.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list rose 6.41 to 804.97, and
the NYSE's composite index rose 3.59 to 423.83.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index fell 3.65 to 1,311.78, and the
American Stock Exchange composite index rose 1.75 to 602.06.
</P>
<P>
Broader measures were mostly positive, but the technology-laden
Nasdaq market turned lower near the close as leading
computer-industry shares surrendered most of the day's gains.
</P>
<P>
The inflation-sensitive bond market initially tumbled after this
morning's report on February employment, sending interest rates
soaring, but quickly bounced back.
</P>
<P>
As bond prices fell in the morning, the yield on the 30-year
Treasury bond jumped as high as 6.94 percent from late Thursday's
6.88 percent. But after the Treasury market rebounded, the
long-bond yield backed down to 6.81 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department reported that the nation's unemployment
rate dipped to 5.3 percent in February as the surprisingly robust
economy created 339,000 new jobs, at least 100,000 more than many
economists had projected.
</P>
<P>
Job market conditions are considered a key factor in the Fed's
deliberations on the economy.

permanent members of the Security Council, the draft resolution,
which was proposed by the European Union, was not passed in the
council.

<HEADLINE> Chinese PLA General Staff Chief Meets Belgian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 7 (Xinhua) -- General Fu Quanyou, the visiting
chief of the General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation
Army, met here today with Belgian Minister of Defense Jean-Pol
Poncelet.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting held in a cordial and friendly atmosphere,
General Fu briefed the Belgian minister on the situation of
China's domestic economy and its prospect.
</P>
<P>
He also briefed his host on China's independent foreign policy
and its defensive national defense policy.
</P>
<P>
The general said that the Chinese government and armed forces
attach great importance to developing their relationship with
Belgium. Developing such relationship is both in the fundamental
interests of the people of both countries and also in the
interests of world peace and development, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Minister Poncelet stated that both Belgium and China want to
make efforts to safeguard world peace, though in different ways.
</P>
<P>
He then briefed the Chinese guest on the economic situation and
defense and security policy of his country which is a member of
the European Union and NATO.
</P>
<P>
Poncelet said he was of the opinion that the issues of
NATO-Russia relations, that the planned NATO enlargement should be
dealt with properly and that NATO should adapt itself to the
security situation both in the world and in Europe. He said he was
very glad to be invited to visit China in October.
</P>
<P>
At the invitation of Vice-Admiral Willy Herteleer, chief of the
General Staff of the Belgian armed forces, General Fu Quanyou
arrived here Wednesday for a five-day visit to Belgium. This is
the first official visit paid by a chief of the General Staff of
the Chinese People's Liberation Army to Belgium.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, General Fu has also held talks with
Vice-Admiral Herteleer. Both sides expressed the hope to further
strengthen bilateral contact and cooperation between the armed
forces of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Belgium is the first leg of General Fu's four-nation Europe
tour. He will leave here Sunday to visit France, Italy and the
United Kingdom.

<HEADLINE> US, Japan Make No Progress Over Civil Aviation Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The United States and Japan
have made no breakthrough in their latest talks on an agreement
over civil aviation, the State Department said today.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Nicholas Burns said that in their second round of
talks this week in Washington, "the United States explained again
our proposal. The Japanese government discussed the basis for
their own June 1996 proposals. We exchanged ideas."
</P>
<P>
Burns agreed with a reporter's comment that "exchange of ideas"
was the diplomatic code for "no progress."
</P>
<P>
The United States and Japan have agreed to have another
informal exchange of views, which will be held "at the earliest
available opportunity," he said.
</P>
<P>
But it might be neither at Tokyo, which was the venue of the
first round of talks, nor Washington, Burns said. The new talks
may be held at "a place between the United States and Japan."

<HEADLINE> US: NATO Allies Still Differ on New NATO Membership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The United States said today
that the 16 members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO) still differ on which countries should join the alliance
first.
</P>
<P>
"NATO has not yet decided which countries will be invited to
participate, to negotiate NATO membership after Madrid," Nicholas
Burns, a State Department spokesman, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Briefing on the meeting between U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright and Hungarian Foreign Minister Laslo Kovacs
late Thursday, Burns said that the U.S. will not say what
countries to endorse for NATO membership until late spring or
early summer.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the two foreign ministers had a "very
long and detailed conversation" about NATO's expansion.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the U.S.-Hungarian ties, Burns said, "We have an
excellent relationship, there are no problems in our
relationship."
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that Albright made no commitment to back
Hungary as a NATO member. Hungary, together with Poland and the
Czech Republic is high on the list of the first group most likely
to be accepted by the alliance.
</P>
<P>
"The secretary cannot give any commitments on NATO membership
to Central European countries. The United States will not make
this decision alone. Sixteen countries will," Burns said.
</P>
<P>
"You've seen a lot of our European allies publicly say we
support this country, we support that country. The United States
has never done that," he said.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that Burns' statement suggests differences remain
on which countries should first join NATO. France, a major member
of the alliance, has indicated that it supports Romania to be
among the first group.
</P>
<P>
NATO is expected to decide at its special summit in Madrid in
July which new countries to be invited into membership.

<HEADLINE> UN Investigates Overpayments for Construction Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Sixteen current and former
U.N. employees are under investigation for 6 million U.S. dollars
in overpayment for construction projects in nine African
countries, a U.N. official said.
</P>
<P>
James Gustave Speth, administrator of the U.N. Development
Program (UNDP), told a news conference that sanctions will be
applied to staff members wherever warranted and these could range
from dismissal to reprimand, as well as recovery of funds.
</P>
<P>
The administrator asked for a full investigation last year
after becoming aware of evidence that accounting and financial
improprieties may have occurred in the construction of UNDP
premises.
</P>
<P>
The investigation discovered that during an eight-year period
the organization overpaid as much as 6 million U.S. dollars and
this amount represented 13 percent of the construction project.
</P>
<P>
Speth told the press that the construction work was done in
Zambia, Uganda, Maldives, Ghana, Mozambique, Comoros, Sao Tome and
Principe, Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verde. But he added that the
scandal did not necessarily involve the governments or people in
these countries.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
today deplored disruptive activities by some elements of political
agitation and uncertainty in Eastern Slavonia, on the eve of the
scheduled April 13 elections.
</P>
<P>
It called upon all residents of the region to follow wise
leadership, to stay in the region, and to take up their future
as citizens of the Republic of Croatia.
</P>
<P>
In a presidential statement, the Security Council also stressed
that, to a large measure, the long-term success of peaceful
reintegration will be determined by the commitment of the
government of Croatia to reconciliation and to ensuring that those
Serbs who are currently resident in the region will enjoy equal
rights as Croatian citizens.
</P>
<P>
It strongly urged the Croatian government to issue, as a
gesture towards reassuring the Serb community, formal public
confirmation of the oral guarantee made to the U.N. on the
international monitoring of the implementation of the commitments
and a favorable consideration of application for second period of
deferment of military service to Serb local youths.
</P>
<P>
The council also expressed concern over the fact that no

<HEADLINE> Clinton to Change Rule for Veterans Compensation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said today that he wants to change a rule concerning the
compensation claim by sicked veterans of the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference at the White House, Clinton said
he will allow the new regulations for compensation claim to
"extend the time frame through the year 2001."
</P>
<P>
"This is 10 years after the cessation of hostilities in the
Gulf War," he said.
</P>
<P>
Under current rules, veterans are required to prove that their
illnesses showed up within two years of the time they returned
from the war.
</P>
<P>
After the Gulf War in 1991, thousands of U.S. veterans have
reported they got illnesses from the war which they said involved
chemical and biological weapons. But, many of them are not allowed
to enjoy benefits because their sicknesses weren't immediately
apparent.
</P>
<P>
The cause for the range of illnesses reported by Gulf War
veterans has not been determined by doctors and scientists.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that he has accepted a Comprehensive Action Plan
on the issue from the secretaries of defense, health and human
services, and veteran affairs.
</P>
<P>
"The plan addresses outreach, medical and clinical issues,
research, coordination, investigations, and chemical and
biological weapon," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It will help us to do an even better job of caring for Gulf
War veterans and finding out why they're sick," Clinton added.

<HEADLINE> US, Canada, Mexico to Post Solid Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The economic resurgence in North
America will continue through 1997 and into 1998, according to a
three-nation study released today by the Conference Board.
</P>
<P>
"Growth will remain solid across North America in 1997," said
Gail D. Fosler, senior vice president and chief economist of the
New York based research group.
</P>
<P>
The year 1997 will be the first year since 1994 that the
domestic markets in the U.S., Canada and Mexico will grow at
significant rates simultaneously, according to the economist.
</P>
<P>
Mexico will outpace its major economic neighbors, with growth
rates well above 4 percent this year and next. Mexican growth is
driven almost entirely by a domestic economy that is still
recovering from a dramatic slide resulting from the 1994 peso
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The United States will grow as well, with Gross Domestic
Product projected to expand by 2.9 percent, fueled by low interest
rates and strong consumer and business confidence. The Canadian
economy will grow at about the same rate as the U.S. Although
driven largely by exports, Canada's domestic economy is showing
some modest signs of life for the first time this decade.
</P>
<P>
But the group said the three North American economies will
face growing regional trade deficits, concentrated in the U.S.,
and the threat of higher U.S. inflation and rising interest
rates.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Meeting With Yeltsin Will Be Extremely Candid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today said that his meeting with Russian President Boris Yeltsin
scheduled later this month will be "extremely candid."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his second post-inauguration press conference,
Clinton said that the summit, which is scheduled on March 19-20,
will be "very important" and that the meeting will be "extremely
candid, extremely self-straightforward."
</P>
<P>
He indicated that Moscow's opposition to the expansion of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is understandable.
</P>
<P>
"When they say things that we find offensive, I would ask the
American people to understand their sensitiveness," Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
"We were never invaded by Napoleon or Hitler, and they were.
So they're a little sensitive about the prospects of their
borders," he added.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, Clinton vowed in his inaugural speech that
NATO should accept new members from the central and eastern
European countries by 1999. A special summit of the alliance is
to be convened in July in Madrid on the issue.
</P>
<P>
However, the alliance's expansion plan has met strong
opposition from the Russians, who insist that the move will
threaten their national security.
</P>
<P>
The heatly-disputed issue will be high on the agenda of the
two-day Clinton-Yeltsin summit, which was originally planned to
start on March 20 but now scheduled to begin on March 19.
</P>
<P>
"I expect that the Helsinki meeting will be positive," Clinton
said. "But you should understand this is a tough debate and that
they have reasons in their own psyche and circumstances that make
it a difficult one."
</P>
<P>
Western analysts say that Russia is considering to ask for a
better compromise in the areas of economic aid and arms control by
acquiescing to NATO's expansion. Bilateral economic relations and
disarmament will be also on the agenda of the U.S.-Russian summit.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said, "I hope it will deal with not only the question
of Russia's relationship to Europe, but also what we can do... to
reduce the nuclear threat."
</P>
<P>
"And there are lots of things we can do with Russia," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton claimed that the aim of enlarging NATO is to help
achieve a Europe that is "united, democratic and free" in the 21st
century.

LONDON, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Major European stock markets ended
the week's trading mixed today, with London and Paris extending
their gains and climbing to new record territories and Frankfurt
down sharply.
</P>
<P>
British shares soared to another record high today after Wall
Street shook off lingering interest rate rise fears in the wake of
strong employment data.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE 100 index broke through the 4,400 barrier after
Thursday's record showing to end up 21.0 points at 4,420.3, a new
record closing high for the fourth consecutive session, and a gain
of 112 points over last week.
</P>
<P>
On the Paris bourse, shares shrugged off news of
stronger-than-expected US jobs growth to move off their day's lows
after the Dow headed higher in early trading. The CAC-40 index
finished the session 9.36 points higher at 2,708.28, a third
consecutive record closing and a rise of 100.73 on last Friday.
</P>
<P>
However, unlike London and Paris, the Frankfurt market, which
ended before Wall Street opened, closed sharply lower as the
market consolidated after three successive record highs, with the
DAX-30 index down 41.40 points at 3,376.20, but still 116.56
points higher on last week.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Claudia Nolte, German minister for
the women, today called for "continuous social dialogue" in order
to promote the equality of men and women.
</P>
<P>
"Only when all social groups, all leaders in government,
business community and society cooperate, can we make headway in
promoting the equality of men and women," Nolte said in a speech
addressed in Bonn to mark International Women's Day on March 8.
</P>
<P>
She said that Germany has never before had so many women's
institutions in the federal, state and local levels as today, and
never before had so legal regulations guarding women's status.
</P>
<P>
But despite of all the measures and progress in the past few
years, people still fail to achieve the goal of equal rights and
chance of women and men.
</P>
<P>
"Equal chance cannot be realized only through laws and
regulations when it did not take roots in people's mind," Nolte
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Baerbel Sothmann, a German parliament member in charge of
women's affairs, also noted today that in Germany, only 7 percent
of decision-makers in government bodies and 3 percent in business
management are women.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, women in the country often have a job which does not
match their education quality, and on average, they are paid
one-third less than men.
