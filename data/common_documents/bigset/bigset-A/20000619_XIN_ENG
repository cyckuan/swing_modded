<P>
BRUSSLES, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Spain struggled to beat Slovenia
2-1 on Sunday and left the tiny nation on the brink of elimination
in the Euro 2000 Group C match in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Midfielder Joseba Etxeberria scored the crucial goal for a
disappointing Spanish team, beating Slovenian goalkeeper Mladen
Dabanovic at his near post on the hour, just a minute after
Slovenia had tied.
</P>
<P>
Spain is now equal on three points with Norway who meets
Yugoslavia later on Sunday. Slovenia and Yugoslavia have a point
each.
</P>
<P>
Slovenian Zlatko Zahovic claimed the 2-2 equaliser in the 66th
minute - his third goal of the tournament - after both he and
teammate Milan Osterc went for a cross.
</P>
<P>
They appeared to impede each other but the ball bobbled past
wrong-footed Spanish goalkeeper Santiago Canizares and television
replays showed Zahovic had got the vital touch.
</P>
<P>
The goal woke up the Spaniards, who had been cruising after
Raul shot them into a fourth minute lead. The Spanish striker
cracked home a half volley from 16 meters when a loose ball
dropped to him.
</P>
<P>
Spanish coach Jose Antonio Camacho made four changes to his
starting line-up following that defeat, introducing goalkeeper
Canizares, defender Abelardo, midfielder Gaizka Mendieta, and
Alfonso to partner Raul up front.
</P>
<P>
Slovenia was unchanged from the side which had led Yugoslavia
3-0 in its opener before being pegged back to 3-3 in a remarkable
match.

<P>
BRUSSELS, June 18 (Xinhua) -- UEFA chief executive Gerhard
Aigner announced a statement on Sunday, threatening to kick
England out of Euro 2000 if its fans continue their violence after
incidents at Brussels and Charleroi, Belgium:
</P>
<P>
"The UEFA Executive Committee has today called on the UK
government and the FA London to take the necessary steps to stop
English hooligans from traveling abroad. Following the violence in
Brussels and Charleroi, the UEFA executive Committee stated that
these English hooligans are a disgrace to their country and a
blight on the national team. The action over the last 48 hours
have left a scar on the tournament and left us wondering why more
was not done to prevent them from traveling.
</P>
<P>
"The scenes in the last two days cannot be allowed to continue.
Euro 2000 is a celebration of European football, not an excuse for
a small minority of English fans to cause havoc.
</P>
<P>
"The UK government owes it to everyone concerned to take steps,
similar to those taken in other parts of the European Union, to
stops these so-called fans from traveling abroad.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot allow more people to spoil international
tournaments for genuine fans.
</P>
<P>
"Other governments have shown that it can be done and we call
on the UK government to take the necessary steps as a matter of
urgency.
</P>
<P>
"UEFA will have to determine whether the presence of the
English national team at this tournament may be maintained should
there be a repetition of similar incidents."

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Slovenia's coach Srecko Katanec
said he thought his team was unlucky to lose 2-1 to Spain at Euro
2000 on Sunday.

best they could," Katanec quoted by Slovenian television as saying.

<P>
"Once more we all have to take our hats off to our boys," he
said referring to their brilliant performance in the 3-3 draw with
Yugoslavia on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We played a very good match again. We proved we can be very
dangerous opponents to anyone if we start with an offensive
playing style. Every team will always have problems against our
attacking play."

Asked about Slovenia's next match with Norway which his team
must win to have a chance of reaching the quarter-finals,Katanec
said: "We will try to beat Norway, that is our duty."

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Refuses to Approve Israeli Withdrawal Complete </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Resisting pressure from the United
States, Lebanese President Emile Lahoud on Sunday again refused to
approve that Israel's withdrawal from south Lebanon is complete.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese National News Agency reported Lahoud said in a
statement released Sunday that "Lebanon will not lose its hard-
earned victory with resistance and sacrifice after just several
hours of talking."
</P>
<P>
Lahoud made the statement after U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright made intensified efforts earlier in the day to
try to convince Lebanon to accept a U.N. Security Council statement
that could indicate Israel has completed its 22-year occupation of
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The president stressed that Israelis are still on Lebanese
territory in several border areas and Lebanon objects to the U.N.
line of withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon insists on its position not to give its approval until
its team, together with the U.N. team, verifies the complete
withdrawal on the border, Lahoud was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon will regard the Israeli withdrawal as incomplete and
will not accept any false line as an alternative to its
internationally recognized borders, Lahoud added.
</P>
<P>
Lahoud met with the ambassadors of five permanent members of the
Security Council in Beirut on Sunday, asking them to convey the
Lebanese position and requesting support from their governments.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lebanon asked the 15 member states of the Security
Council to put off their meeting until it could check to ensure
Israeli forces are gone, local media said.
</P>
<P>
Most members did not want to give Lebanon more time to verify
the border line, whereas Russia backed Lebanon's stance.
</P>
<P>
The dispute has delayed the deployment and reinforcement of the
U.N. peacekeeping force and impeded the Lebanese army to fill into
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Annan is scheduled to arrive here Monday from Cairo. He will
talk with Lebanese leaders on verifying Israeli withdrawal and
reinforcing the peacekeeping force in south Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> EU Envoy Upbeats for Mideast Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Visiting European Union (EU) Middle
East peace envoy Mieguel Muratinos on Sunday expressed optimism
over the Middle East peace process, saying he expects breakthroughs
in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
In a press conference in Amman, Muratinos said he believes the
Middle East is more closer than ever to a solution to the decades-
old Arab-Israeli conflicts.
</P>
<P>
However, he did not mention the fact the Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators failed to make substantial progress in their final
status talks after their resumption earlier this month in
Washington, and the Syrian-Israeli talks remains deadlocked since
they broke off in January.
</P>
<P>
He said he believes there will be solutions that will satisfy
all parties in the following weeks which he described as crucial,
and he believes the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations are serious
and all parties remain committed to peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
The envoy described as fruitful and constructive his talks
during his one-day visit with King Abdullah and Jordanian officials
over ways of promoting the peace process in the region as well
consolidating bilateral cooperation between Jordan and the 15-
member EU.
</P>
<P>
He said the EU and Jordan share similar stands in supporting the
rights of Palestinian refugees to return home.
</P>
<P>
Currently the kingdom is hosting over 1.2 million Palestinian
refugees who fled their homeland during successive Middle East
wars, most of them having been granted Jordanian citizenship. But
Jordan supports their rights of either returning home or asking for
compensations from parties concerned.

<HEADLINE> Thorough Probe into Gas Explosion Promised </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 19 (Xinhua) -- A special committee would be
formed to investigate a gas explosion, which killed two Kuwaiti
engineers and lightly wounded four workers Sunday, said a Kuwaiti
official.
</P>
<P>
Oil Minister Sheikh Saud Nasser Al-Sabah told a parliamentary
session on Monday that "There will be a thorough investigation into
the accident," which happened to Unit Eight of the Shoeba Refinery.
</P>
<P>
The oil plant was established in l968 as one of the biggest
Hydrogen-operated oil purification plants in the world.
</P>
<P>
He promised to brief the parliament and the National Oil
Corporation (NOC) Staff Union on the investigation proceedings and
submit a detailed report upon conclusion of the probe.
</P>
<P>
NOC Chairman Hani Hussein said the accident occurred when one of
the engineers was trapped to death in an underway aircraft-fuel-
producing deposit and another died as he tried to rescue him.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Health, Social and Labor Affairs Committee under
the parliament was authorized to launch an inquiry into the general
situation in the oil refineries nationwide and submit a report in
three months to the parliament on its findings.

<HEADLINE> Condition for Clinton-Barak-Arafat Summit Mature: Adviser </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The situation for a peace summit
between U.S. President Bill Clinton, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat is ripe, Barak's top
aide said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Such a summit aimed at resolving outstanding disputes and
wrapping up a framework peace deal between Israel and the
Palestinians, would be convened for several days in Washington in
the next few weeks, said Danny Yatom, security adviser of the prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news briefing organized by Israel's Foreign Press
Association, Yatom said the remaining disputes between Israel and
the Palestinians could only be resolved through personal
involvement of the two leaders, who can make decisive decisions.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the role U.S. President Bill Clinton could play in
the expected Washington summit, Yatom said that the U.S. president,
the most ardent sponsor of the Middle East peace process, could
ideally act as a broker between Barak and Arafat.
</P>
<P>
The inner-circle adviser expressed Israel's yearning for such a
summit, saying that Israel thinks it should take place as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
Yatom also said that Israel is ready to make brave concessions
in the peace talks with the Palestinians, but he accused that the
Palestinians have no equal inclination to make any serious efforts
for reaching a deal.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian talks are trying to resolve their
disputes over a series of final-status issues, such as the fate of
Jerusalem, the return of Palestinian refugees, Jewish settlements,
borders, water and security.
</P>
<P>
The latest round of such talks ended Sunday in Washington
without making any tangible progress.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts had promoted a Camp David-style summit for
breaking the deadlock and reaching a framework agreement for a
final accord this September.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the United States, Egypt and Israel met in Camp David
in 1978 and hammered out a treaty, the first between an Arab
country and the Jewish state, to realize peace between the two
Middle East powers.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the month, Barak said that he thought the condition
for such a summit is still not mature.
</P>
<P>
But at Sunday's security cabinet meeting, Barak stressed the
importance of convening the three-way summit as soon as possible to
try to close the gaps between him and Arafat.
</P>
<P>
In response, Palestinian International Cooperation Minister
Nabil Shaath reportedly said on Monday that the Palestinians do not
want a summit at the current stage as the condition is not mature.
</P>
<P>
Such a summit should only be used to finalize an accord, but
there were no signs that the two sides were close to agreement on
any of the main issues, Shaath added.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will arrive in the
Middle East either by the weekend or next week, and U.S. Middle
East special envoy Dennis Ross is also expected to be here on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The two American top diplomats reportedly will meet Barak and
Arafat respectively, trying to determine whether to arrange a
three-way summit in the near future.

<HEADLINE> Syria Holds Peace as Strategic Option: Acting President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Acting President Abdel
Halim Khaddam said on Monday his country sticks to the Middle East
peace process as a strategic option as long as there are proper
conditions for achieving such an option.
</P>
<P>
Syria's position on establishing a fair and comprehensive peace
in the region is firm if Israel responds positively to Syria's
fundamentals defined by the late President Hafez al-Assad, Khaddam
said at the ongoing Ninth National Congress of the ruling Arab
Socialist Baath Party (ASBP), which opened Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"Syria is for fair and comprehensive peace based on the U.N.
Security Council resolutions and the land-for-peace principle that
ensures Israel withdraw to the border lines of June 4, 1967," he
said.
</P>
<P>
On the domestic situation in Syria, he pointed out the necessity
of practising the freedom of expression in a high sense of
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
The new national leadership to be elected by the ASBP national
congress will face various tasks, said Khaddam, Syria's first vice
president who served as the acting president after Assad's death on
June 12.
</P>
<P>
Atop the tasks are consolidation of the party bases and and
enhancement of its leading role as the country is in need of
change, development and modernization to cope with the developments
of the world today, he added.
</P>
<P>
It is necessary to work out an all-round economic reform program
that ensures the prosperity of the country, strikes balance among
the social categories, enhances the role of the public and private
sectors, opens the door wider for foreign investments, and develops
the banking activities, he underlined.
</P>
<P>
The acting president urged for supporting Bashar al-Assad and
his coming leadership.
</P>
<P>
The ASBP national congress, to be concluded on Tuesday, has
elected Bashar, Assad's second son, new leader of the party.
</P>
<P>
Bashar has pledged on various occasions that he will continue
the policy of his father on the peace process.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said after attending
the funeral of Assad last Tuesday that she "sensed encouraging
signs" in Bashar's remarks on his father's policy toward the
regional peace process.

<HEADLINE> WTO: Free Trade Helps Reduce Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Trade liberalization helps poor
countries to catch up with rich ones and this faster economic
growth helps to alleviate poverty, the World Trade Organization (
WTO) said in a new study published here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"This report confirms that although trade alone may not be
enough to eradicate poverty, it is essential if poor people are to
have any hope of a brighter future," WTO Director-General Mike
Moore said on publishing the study entitled "Trade, Income
Disparity and Poverty",by Dan Ben-David of Tel Aviv University and
L. Alan Winters of Sussex University.
</P>
<P>
For example, Moore said, 30 years ago, South Korea was as poor
as Ghana. Today, thanks to trade-led growth, it is as rich as
Portugal.
</P>
<P>
Major highlights of the study include:
</P>
<P>
- Extreme poverty is a huge problem. 1.2 billion people survive
on less than a dollar a day. A further 1.6 billion, more than a
quarter of the world's population, make do with one to two dollars
a day;
</P>
<P>
- To alleviate poverty, developing economies need to grow
faster, and the poor need to benefit from this growth. Trade can
play an important part in reducing poverty, because it boosts
economic growth and the poor tend to benefit from that faster
growth;
</P>
<P>
- The study finds that, in general, living standards in
developing countries are not catching up with those in developed
countries. But some developing countries are catching up. What
distinguishes them is their openness to trade. The countries that
are catching up with rich ones are those that are open to trade;
and the more open they are, the faster they are converging.
</P>
<P>
The study also finds that poor people within a country
generally gain from trade liberalization. It concludes that "trade
liberalization is generally a strongly positive contributor to
poverty alleviation-it allows people to exploit their productive
potential, assists economic growth, curtails arbitrary policy
interventions and helps to insulate against shocks".
</P>
<P>
That concurs with a new World Bank study which, using data
from 80 countries over four decades, confirms that openness boosts
economic growth and that the incomes of the poor rise one-for-one
with overall growth.
</P>
<P>
However, the WTO study acknowledges that some people do lose in
the short run from trade liberalization. Some are well-off, others
not. The report argues that the plight of the losers should not be
ignored, but that the right way to alleviate their hardship is
through social safety nets and job retraining rather than by
abandoning reforms that benefit most people.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq-Japan Inaugurates Trading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eight Japanese companies, mostly of technology, pharmaceuticals
and multimedia, were listed on Nasdaq-Japan during the opening
ceremony, NASD Chairman and CEO Frank Zarb said in Tokyo, viewed
here at a televised press conference.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq-Japan is operated in partnership with the Osaka
Securities Exchange, a 51-year-old securities exchange which
recently introduced a fully-automated computerized trading system.
</P>
<P>
Nasdaq-Japan President and CEO Tatsuyuki Saeki expects the
average listed companies to number 10 per month, but Zarb
emphasized the need to develop high quality companies instead of
pursuing the listing number.
</P>
<P>
Zarb believed that the opening of Nasdaq-Japan sets the stage
for a common technology platform linking Asia with Europe and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
In its three-phase development strategy, Nasdaq-Japan uses its
current technology and maintains the standards of order-driven
market functions.
</P>
<P>
In 2001, the market is going to operate its own market
structure and bring together firm quotations and market orders
into an integrated electronic system.
</P>
<P>
And finally, after Phase 2, the market will start cross-border
trading forming a link to Nasdaq Europe, with 24-hour electronic
and internet-based trading expected.
</P>
<P>
Nasdaq, established in 1971, is a fast growing stock market
with close to 5,000 companies listed. The world's largest
electronic market has been striving to expand its business
overseas.

By midday Monday, one of the fires, about 60 kilometers
southwest of Denver, had burned 4,200 hectares of forest and
destroyed 51 houses scattered through subdivisions built into the
steep mountainside.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted local officials as saying that there was a
chance a wind could help fire crews by driving what remains of the
blaze into an area already burned by a 1996 fire, halting its
advance.

The second fire, the 4,240-hectare Bobcat Gulch blaze east of
Rocky Mountain National Park about 80 kilometers northwest of
Denver, had destroyed 22 structures, which include houses and
other buildings.
</P>
<P>
In spite of the latest weather forecast, officials at that fire
still hoped to contain it on Monday.

Some 1,600 firefighters continued to battle both fires,

<HEADLINE> Saudi Cabinet Ratifies Border Agreement with Yemen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIYADH, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The Saudi cabinet on Monday ratified
the permanent treaty on international land and sea borders with
Yemen signed on a week ago, which ended their long-running
territorial dispute.
</P>
<P>
The official Saudi News Agency reported this was done in a
cabinet meeting Monday afternoon in Jeddah, a Red Sea port city.
</P>
<P>
Information Minister Foad al-Farsi said after the cabinet
meeting that King Fahd had expressed appreciation for the treaty
which he said would be conducive to promoting the friendly and
brotherly ties between the two countries and the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
The king praised the treaty as an ideal pattern of joint work
between neighbors in terms of resolving such issues, al-Farsi said,
adding that the monarch expressed hope that it would enhance
comprehensive cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Consultative Council, or parliament, approved the treaty
on Sunday. The king is expected to give an official endorsement to
the treaty before it goes into effect.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia and Yemen, with a 2,500-kilometer common border,
had been locked in a territorial dispute, which in 1998 flared up
into a border conflict.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the information minister praised the just concluded
ceasefire deal between Ethiopia and Eritrea to end their two-year-
long border dispute as a step towards re-establishing peace and
stability and stepping up development in the Horn of Africa region.
</P>
<P>
He also hailed the efforts made by current Chairman of the
Organization of African Unity, Algerian President Abdelaziz
Bouteflika, and other parties concerned for the deal.
</P>
<P>
Brokered by the OAU, foreign ministers of Ethiopia and Eritrea
signed the accord Algiers, capital of Algeria, Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
The two countries had been engaged in a border dispute since May
6, l998 when Eritrean troops invaded and seized some Ethiopian
territories. Fighting renewed last May along their 1,000-kilometer
border, with Ethiopian troops marching into Eritrea beyond disputed
border regions which were at the root of the border war.

<HEADLINE> Israel Considering Purchasing Water from Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- A high level Israeli delegation
arrived in Turkey on Monday to discuss purchasing water from the
Manavgat river near Turkey's Mediterranean port city of Antalya.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, led by Israeli Water Affairs Director Amos
Epstein, was paying the visit in an effort to find a way out of the
severe water shortage crisis in Israel, Anatolia News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Turkey offered to sell water to drought-stricken Middle East
countries from the Manavgat. In Antalya, facilities are ready for
exporting 180 million cubic meters of water annually.
</P>
<P>
Israel, Turkey's main regional ally, has shown strong interest
in the project but has yet to take a final decision because of
domestic objections.
</P>
<P>
Prior to his visit, Epstein said that Israel is starving for
water, and "the urgent solution is to import water. It is
inevitable to purchase water from Turkey."
</P>
<P>
The delegation, composed of officials from Israeli Foreign
Ministry, Health Ministry, and the Treasury as well as leading
water experts, will discuss the issue of buying 50 million cubic
meters of water from Turkey annually.
</P>
<P>
The delegation will visit the Manavgat and bargain with Turkish
authorities over the cost. Turkey is asking 23 U.S. cents for one
cubic meter of water.
</P>
<P>
However, water purification and transfer are increasing the cost
to 55-60 cents, similar to that of purifying the sea water.
</P>
<P>
This is one of the reasons that have drawn oppositions in Israel
to purchasing water from abroad, and the government was urged to
use the money to purify sea water by itself.
</P>
<P>
Israel's leading newspaper Jerusalem Post, in an article
published on Sunday, voted against water purchase from Turkey,
claiming that it was an inefficient and expensive way of solving
the water problem.
</P>
<P>
The only solution is to set up purification facilities, it said.
</P>
<P>
Despite this powerful lobby, the visit showed that the Turco-
Israeli talks about water purchase have entered its final stage.
</P>
<P>
The water to be purchased from Turkey is expected to be
transported to Israeli port of Askelon by oil tankers with a
capacity of 250,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
But analysts said that even if the two sides sign an agreement
during the visit, the water transfer will not start until next year
due to delay by the construction of facilities.
</P>
<P>
Turkey with rich water resources is trying to play a major role
in "water diplomacy" in the Mideast, where experts claimed that
competing for water resources could become a flashpoint in the next
regional war.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has long been planning to supply fresh water to dry
Middle East countries in a move to boost its relations with Israel
and Muslim nations in the region, saying water can be a means for
an Arab-Israeli rapprochement.
</P>
<P>
Israel and Jordan, along with many other regional countries,
have been suffering from serious water shortages due to depleting
resources and an acute drought over the past two years.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Minister Warns against Forest Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Forestry Minister Nami Cagan
has sounded an alarm about the ever-increasing danger of forest
fire as heat builds up, reported the Anatolia News Agency on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Cagan urged people particularly in the Mediterranean, Aegean and
Marmara regions to heighten vigilance against breakout of forest
fires as summer has set in.
</P>
<P>
Some 20 to 30 fires have erupted in these regions due to
carelessness and negligence of people, Cagan said, adding that fire
brigades have found it difficult to extinguish the fires when winds
happened to start blowing.
</P>
<P>
Although technical and administrative measures are being taken
against forest fires, he said, they still need the assistance of
the radio and television in raising awareness of the citizens
living in these three regions against forest fires.
</P>
<P>
Cagan appealed to the local people to use the fire hotline
whenever they detect a cloud of smoke and sparks of fire.
</P>
<P>
He asked the mass media to give more publicity to fire reports
prepared by the ministry's Fire Action Center in their programs and
to repeat the warning by the Forestry Ministry that special
attention must be paid in the period between June 1 and October 1.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a total of 15 hectares of forest was burned in a fire
that broke out in Mugla, an Aegean province, on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Four helicopters, 18 spraying vehicles and 150 fire brigades
joined forces in a fight against the fire, which was brought under
control after eight hours since its outbreak.
</P>
<P>
Turkey boasts of more forests than most countries in the Middle
East. According to official statistics, a total of 26 percent of
the lands in Turkey are included under the forestry regime. The
total area covered by good quality, productive forests amounts to
13 percent.

SANAA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Yemen said on Monday it is optimistic
about the implementation of a truce accord that Ethiopia and
Eritrea signed on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In a news briefing here on Monday, a foreign source stressed the
accord will create a favorable environment for a final
comprehensive solution for the border dispute between the two Horn
of African neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The source said Yemen spared no efforts toward approximating the
viewpoints of the two countries, adding Yemen is keen on the
stability of the Horn of Africa region and holds that dialogue is
always the ideal way to deal with such problems between neighboring
countries.
</P>
<P>
The accord will help tap the potential of both countries and
allow them time to handle the more pressing issues of development
and construction, the source stressed.
</P>
<P>
Yemen also regards the peace deal between Ethiopia and Eritrea
as a success by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in settling
African conflicts peacefully, he hailed.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia and Eritrea signed in Algiers on Sunday morning a peace
deal to put an end to their two-year-long border dispute which left

<HEADLINE> Ragheb Sworn in as Jordan's Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's prime minister designate Ali
Abu Ragheb and his cabinet were sworn in on Monday before King
Abdullah Bin Hussein.
</P>
<P>
The 29-member new cabinet, including Ragheb himself and four
low-ranking ministers of state, marked wider representations of
veteran career politicians and young technocrats.
</P>
<P>
As a tradition, Prime Minister Ragheb concurrently holds the
portfolio of defense.
</P>
<P>
Ten of the 23 members of the outgoing cabinet headed by former
Prime Minister Abdel Rauf Rawabdeh kept their portfolios. Among
them are Minister of Foreign Affairs Abdel Ilah Khatib and Minister
of Finance Michel Marto.
</P>
<P>
As required by the constitution, the new government will submit
itself for a confidence vote in the parliament in the coming weeks,
and analysts believe Ragheb will have little difficulties in
winning support from the parliament, given his strong background in
the lower house.
</P>
<P>
Ragheb, 54, has been a member of the house since 1993. He had
been heading the economic and financial affairs committee before he
was named prime minister on Sunday King Abdullah who accepted the
resignation of Rawabdeh a bit earlier.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah has the constitutional rights of appointing, dismissing
governments or dissolving the parliaments.
</P>
<P>
The business-and-reform-minded monarch picked up Ragheb in an
apparent bid to speed up economic reforms in the kingdom based on
understanding with the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund
and other major world creditors.
</P>
<P>
Ragheb is expected to inherit part of Rawabdeh's reform
packages, including the measures to trim public expenditures and
budget deficits, privatize key but non-profitable state enterprises
and to pave the way for more foreign investments into the cash-
strapped kingdom.

<HEADLINE> Israel Release Three Palestinian Prisoners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Israeli prison authority Monday
released three Palestinian security prisoners in accordance with
Prime Minister Ehud Barak's order issued earlier.
</P>
<P>
The three prisoners, freed from Israel's Shata and Shikma
prisons, were all sentenced before Israeli courts for their
allegedly involvement in attacks against Israelis, Israeli
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Mahmoud Juma, from Palestinian main-stream Fatah movement,
caused five Israelis injured in a bombing attack in Great Jerusalem
area in 1993, and had been serving an eight-and-a-half-year jail
term since then.
</P>
<P>
Shadi Aziz Ali, from the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestinians, was sent to jail in May 1994 with a 16-year sentence
for his role in an attack wounding two Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Juma and Aziz Ali are both from East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The third released prisoner, Balal Abdel-Karim, was sentenced to
27 years in prison in 1990 for several grenade attacks on Israeli
soldiers and civilians, causing at least 25 Israelis wounded.
</P>
<P>
Barak announced the release as a good-will gesture to the
Palestinians at last Wednesday's security cabinet meeting, citing
the good cooperation with the Palestinians on security matters as
the reason.
</P>
<P>
Media reports claimed that Palestinian security forces arrested
eight Islamic Jihad activists, who are against the Israeli-
Palestinian peace process and reportedly plot terrorist attacks on
Israeli targets, over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
However, the release encountered unexpected rebuff from the
Palestinians, who claimed that the number of released prisoners is
just not acceptable and not conducive to the peace between the two
sides.
</P>
<P>
Since the peace process began between Israel and the
Palestinians with the signing of the Oslo Accord in 1993, Israel
has freed batches of Palestinian prisoners as confidence-building
measures.
</P>
<P>
However, there are still 1,650 Palestinian security prisoners
remaining in Israeli prisons. The Palestinians have urged Israelis
to release them at once, which was rejected outright by the
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Barak is also facing great pressure for the release from
Israel's Terror Victims Association, who earlier asked the prime
minister to suspend the release in order to enable them to appeal
it to Israel's Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
The powerful lobbyists group said the release is in violation of
Israel's traditional criteria for releasing Palestinian prisoners,
which prohibit releasing Palestinians who had Jewish blood on their
hands, or prisoners who have not served most of their terms.

to restore its authority in the south and clear mine fields in some
areas in the former occupied zone.

develop the economy in the south, saying relevant organizations of
the U.N. have studied the issue. He also promised to suggest other

<HEADLINE> Welfare Overhaul Make One Million Lose Medicaid in U.S.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 19 (Xinhua) -- A new Study released here
Monday found that welfare overhaul has caused nearly one million
low-income parents lose their Medicaid coverage in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
The study, released by Families USA, an advocacy group that
lobbies for universal health coverage, has examined Medicaid
figures in 15 states with most of the uninsured low-income
population, including Texas, Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
A total of 945,880 adults with children had been dropped from
the program from 1996 to 1999, a decline of 27 percent, the study
said.
</P>
<P>
The study accused the states of mismanaging the implementation
of the 1996 welfare reform law and improperly kicking people off
Medicaid once they left welfare.
</P>
<P>
"The basic thrust of welfare is to move people to jobs, but
unfortunately when they do so they are considered to have too much
income for Medicaid," said Ron Pollack, executive director of
Families USA. "So the reward of moving off welfare is getting no
health insurance."
</P>
<P>
The 15 states in the study are those with the largest number of
uninsured poor people and represent 70 percent of all low-income
uninsured Americans.
</P>
<P>
Medicaid cost an estimated 181 billion dollars in the Untied
States last year.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Reports Its Current Financial Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 19 (Xinhua )-- The United Nations reported
on Monday that as of May 31, 2000, Member States owe the
Organization over 2.9 billion U.S. dollars for current and past
assessments.
</P>
<P>
Among the arrears, 2 billion for peacekeeping, 821 million for
the regular U.N. budget, and 83 million for international
tribunals, U.N. said
</P>
<P>
The largest debtor, the United States, owes the U.N. 1.8
billion for past and current assessments, two-thirds of the total
due, and this debt includes over 460 million for the regular
budget and just over 1.3 billion for peacekeeping and
international tribunals, according to U.N.
</P>
<P>
The U.N., in order to deal with current regular budget cash
deficits, has been periodically forced to borrow from peacekeeping
funds.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the Organization unable to reimburse promptly
those countries that provide troops and equipment to peacekeeping
operations. At the end of 1999, the U.N. owed 72 countries a total
of 800 million for troops and equipment.
</P>
<P>
But because there have been fewer peacekeeping operations in
recent years, there has been less and less cash in the
peacekeeping account to cover the regular deficit. Last year,
peacekeeping assessments fell to 800 million from a high of 3
billion in 1995, leaving a shrinking financial cushion for the
Organization.
</P>
<P>
The new U.N. missions in Kosovo, Sierra Leone, East Timor and
the Democratic Republic of the Congo are likely to raise
substantially peacekeeping assessments and cash figures for 2000.
</P>
<P>
On the positive side, more Member States are paying their
regular budget assessments in full each year and 126 countries had
paid up at the end of 1999, compared with 75 nations in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Under Article 19 of the United Nations Charter, if at the
beginning of the year a country owes the same or more than its
total gross assessments for the previous two years, it
automatically loses its right to vote in the General Assembly.
The United Sates paid just enough by the end of 1999 to avoid this
scenario.

<HEADLINE> EU Tax Reform Discussion Deadlocked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTA MARIA DA FEIRA, Portugal, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The first
day of the European Union summit went into a critical hitch on
Monday when the much-peddled tax reform discussion was deadlocked.
</P>
<P>
With no agreement reached at Sunday's European council of
finance ministers, the discussion was extended into the course of
the two-day summit proper by the heads of state and government of
EU member states.
</P>
<P>
Yet the extended discussion failed again to produce any
agreement though it finished half an hour later than scheduled and
another extra session was scheduled for late Monday.
</P>
<P>
Austria, Britain and Luxembourg were opposed to the tax reform
proposals that requires either direct taxing of cross-border
savings by non-national residents or providing information on bank
accounts to member states whose residents save their money
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
Germany has been leading calls for a common withholding tax on
interest earning from savings accounts held in banks anywhere in
the 15-nation union. But the withholding tax idea has later been
dropped by a large majority.
</P>
<P>
All sides, however, agreed that something has to be done about
the cross-border tax dodge via which citizens in one EU member
state can earn interest on savings in another member state without
paying taxes, resulting in billions in loss of tax revenues.
</P>
<P>
Some nations supported allowing a choice between a 20-percent
withholding tax or sharing information on foreign money savers.
</P>
<P>
But Britain opposed to the tax reform proposals as it saw the
proposals as a potential threat to the Eurobond market based in
the City of London.
</P>
<P>
Austria and Luxembourg opposed to the idea of information
exchange as the two nations have a tradition of banking secrecy.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Remains Largest Debtor to United Nations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Monday
reported that the United States remains the largest debtor to the
world body by owing 1.8 billion U.S. dollars in back dues.
</P>
<P>
What Washington owes the U.N. accounts for two-thirds of the
total due, which has been plunging the United Nations into a
lengthy financial crisis. The U.S. debt includes more than 460
million dollars for the regular budget and just more than 1.3
billion dollars for peacekeeping and international tribunals.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations, a nonprofit body, fully relies on
contributions from Member States. The assessment, which includes U.
N. regular budget, peacekeeping and international tribunals, is
made in accordance to a country's share of its Gross National
Product in the world's total.
</P>
<P>
As of May 31, Members States owe the United more than 2.9
billion dollars for current and pass assessments -- 2 billion
dollars for peacekeeping, 821 billion dollars for the regular U.N.
budget, and 83 million for international tribunals.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations, in order to deal with the recurrent
regular budget cash deficits, has been periodically forced to
borrow from peacekeeping funds. As a result, the Organization is
unable to reimburse promptly those countries that provide troops
and equipment to peacekeeping operations. At the end of 1999, the
United Nations owed 72 countries a total of 800 million dollars
for troops and equipment.
</P>
<P>
However, on the opposite side, more Member States are paying
their regular budget assessments in full each year -- 126
countries had paid up at the end of 1999, compared with 75 in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Under Article 19 of the U.N. Charter, if at the beginning of
the year a country owes the same or more than its total gross
assessments for the previous years, it automatically loses its
right to vote in the General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The United States saved its face by paying just enough by the
end of 1999 to secure its right to vote at the General Assembly,
but its level of unpaid assessments remains high at nearly 1.8
billion dollars at the end of May this year.
</P>
<P>
The United States is repeatedly under fire at the United
Nations for its reluctance to pay its back dues in full, on time
and with conditions.

<HEADLINE> U.N.to Issue Report on ICT Conditions in Developing Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations is to
issue the first authoritative global plan to fully incorporate
public and private sector viewpoints on overcoming the information
and communication technology (ICT) lag found in most developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
The report and action plan is drawn up by a panel of 17
independent experts from government, business and civil society
who have led successful ICT campaigns in developing and transition
economies.
</P>
<P>
Convened by the U.N. General Assembly, the panel is sending
their report to the U.N. Millennium Assembly, scheduled to open in
September here. The report will also be considered at the July
high-level meeting of the U.N. Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC)
, and representatives of the panel are taking part in preparations
for the mid-July Summit of the Group of 8 countries, which will be
held in Okinawa, Japan, and will focus on ICT issues.
</P>
<P>
The independent experts propose measures to heighten
dramatically the priority given to ICT by countries and
international agencies, and suggest means and leverage funding.
Drawing from their own experiences, the panelists document do-it-
yourself campaigns that have worked even in countries contending
with extreme poverty or complex political situations.
</P>
<P>
"The international community, working in concert with national
governments, private business and civil society, is fully capable
of reversing the current alarming trend of the growing digital
divide," enabling internet access to either home, work place or
community by 2004 for the 80 percent of the world's population who
are currently unconnected, the report proposes.
</P>
<P>
The report, among other things, also suggests that the United
Nations should create, under the leadership of the U.N. Secretary-
General but outside the regular U.N. organizational structures,
and ICT Task Force charged with bringing together international
agencies, private industry and foundations and trusts to
facilitate the expansion of the ICT market in developing countries.

<HEADLINE> 22 Killed in Traffic Accidents in Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, June 19 (Xinhua) -- A total of 22 people were killed
and 300 others injured in traffic accidents around Greece between
Friday and Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
A total of 230 traffic accidents were recorded since Friday,
police said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Greece's traffic accident rate is among the highest in the 15-
member European Union (EU) countries, with nearly 3,000 people
killed and 30,000 others injured annually in accidents.
</P>
<P>
Police attribute the high accident rate mainly to Greeks'
aggressive-driving, drunk-driving and careless driving.
</P>
<P>
To reduce traffic accidents in the country, Greece has since
Thursday launched a campaign to bolster the traffic police and
monitor the dangerous stretches of the major national highways,
such as Athens-Thessaloniki highway and Athens-Corinth highway.
</P>
<P>
The surveillance radar at four sites along the highways went
into effect as of Thursday and other measures included the
installation of extensive monitoring equipment and granting
greater autonomy to regional police headquarters.

<HEADLINE> 50,000 Appeal for Full Employment in Porto </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTA MARIA DA FEIRA, Portugal, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Some 50,000
people gathered in Porto on Monday for a demonstration appealing
to the European Union summit for full employment.
</P>
<P>
The two-day EU summit was being held at this nearby town.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators, coming mainly from Portugal with thousands
from Spain, Italy and Greece, formed a six-kilometer-long
procession that marched through the northern Portuguese city of
Porto, demanding fulfillment of the promises the last EU summit
had made.
</P>
<P>
The heads of state and government of the EU member states
promised to increase employment by various measures and promised
the creation of some 30 million jobs in a time span of 10 years to
guarantee sustainable development of the economy of the 15-nation
bloc.
</P>
<P>
Participating in the demonstration were some 150 trade unions
from the European Union member states.
</P>
<P>
Emilio Gabaglio, president of the European Trade Union
Confederation that organized Monday's demonstration, said that the
moment had come for Europe to open up a new stage of employment.
</P>
<P>
"Europe has not been governed in favor of workers but rather in
favor of big businesses and financial capitals," he added.
</P>
<P>
Demonstrators displayed banners that read "Jobs in Quantity", "
Work With Dignity" and "For a Europe With Full Employment".
</P>
<P>
Though the unemployment rate for the European Union has been on
a slight drop, there are still 16 million men and women of working
age and ability, or almost one out of 10, without a job. The
highest jobless rate was found in Spain with more than 14 percent
of the country's working force unemployed.

<HEADLINE> Dutroux Sentenced to 5 Years in Jail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Marc Dutroux had been in prison since August 1996 for abusing
and killing four little girls but he escaped from jail in April
1998 when being escorted to a local court for pre-trial hearings.
</P>
<P>
He broke loose from two armed police officers and snatched a
pistol from one of the police escorts and then grabbed a car
parked outside the local court at Neufchateau in southeastern
Belgium.
</P>
<P>
Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, France and Germany
mobilized more than 5,000 police and gendarmerie in the ensuing
manhunt that took three and a half hours before a forest police
patrol caught Dutroux not far away from Neufchateau.
</P>
<P>
The escape attempt was considered so scandalous that two
government ministers resigned to take the responsibility. The
incident triggered off a loud outcry due to a public perception
that the police had bungled the original investigation into the
disappearance of little girls.
</P>
<P>
Dutroux was accused of being at the center of a child sex ring
and the trial of his case is not expected to start before next
year.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Dutroux was found guilty of threatening behavior and
theft. Attempt to escape from prison itself is not a crime in
Belgium.

UNITED NATIONS, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Security
Council on Monday urged Iraq to return the remaining Kuwaiti
properties in its possession and to cooperate to ensure the
repatriation or the return of all Kuwaiti and third country
nationals or their remains.
</P>
<P>
The move came after the 15-member Security Council this
morning reviewed U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's recent report
on the matter. The Security Council also heard the briefing on
that matter by the High Level Coordinator appointed by the
Secretary-General Ambassador Yuli Vorontsov.

The members of the Security Council reiterated their strong
support for Mr. Vorontsov's efforts and agreed with the Secretary-
General's conclusion that understanding and goodwill were of
critical importance for the success of Mr. Vorontsov's mission.
</P>
<P>
They noted that Iraq had returned a substantial quantity of
property over a nine-year period of time but there remained many
items, of fundamental importance for Kuwait, which Iraq was under
obligation to return to Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The members of the Council approved the recommendations of the
Secretary-General contained in his report and stressed the
importance of dialogue among parties.

<HEADLINE> EU Deplores Criminal Act of Human Trafficking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTA MARIA DA FEIRA, Portugal, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The
European Union on Monday deplored the criminal act of trafficking
human beings that led to 58 deaths in an air-tight truck at the
British port of Dover.
</P>
<P>
"It deplored the criminal acts of those who profit from such
traffic in human beings and committed the European Union to
intensified cooperation to defeat such cross-border crime," said
an EU written statement issued during a two-day European Union
summit of heads of state and government.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation bloc called on France, that is taking over from
Portugal the rotating presidency of the union, and the European
Commission to work out measures, close cooperation in particular,
for EU member states and the Europol to detect and dismantle the
criminal networks involved in this human trafficking by adopting
severe sanctions against those involved in this serious and
despicable crime, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The European Union earlier expressed its shock at the incident
when bodies of 54 men and four women were found from a
refrigerated truck at Dover, a major landing point for ferries
from France and Belgium.
</P>
<P>
The truck was a Dutch-registered vehicle and the driver was
already detained by police.
</P>
<P>
The truck reportedly left the Belgian port of Zeebrugge on
Sunday, the hottest day of the year so far in northwestern Europe
with the temperature hovering at 33 degrees Celsius. Suffocation
has been suspected to be the cause of death.
</P>
<P>
Jonathan Faull, spokesman of the European Commission, the
executive body of the 15-nation bloc, told the press that the
union was "profoundly and deeply shocked by the incident".

<HEADLINE> Experts Urge Access of Poor Africans to Essential Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Medical experts have
proposed a parallel importation of drugs and a compulsory
licensing system to enable poor people in Africa to have access to
essential drugs, Tanzanian newspapers reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The experts at a conference in the Kenyan capital Nairobi
argued over the weekend that current international regulations in
regard to drugs importation or production tend to bar poor
countries from access to essential drugs.
</P>
<P>
"The causes of high prices of medicines in Africa included
strong patent protection, high tariffs, taxes and lack of generic
competition," Professor Carlos Correa, an intellectual property
expert, told the representatives of the East African countries
attending the conference on the Campaign for Access to Essential
Drugs organized by Medicines Sans Frontieres and Health Action
International.
</P>
<P>
The experts said that compulsory licensing would enable
governments to issue licenses to national producers without the
permission of the patent- holders.
</P>
<P>
This would make prices of medicines drop by about 75 percent,
they said, adding that with parallel importation, buyers would be
allowed to purchase the cheapest patented medicines.
</P>
<P>
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), essential
drugs are those that satisfy the health care needs of the majority
of the population.

<P>
Although some parts of areas have rained recently, the drought
is lingering without signs of abating, Bellamy told a press
conference in the kenyan capital after concluding a five-country
trip, which took her to Ethiopia, Eritrea, Djibouti, Somalia and
Kenya. The drought is threatening the survival and
health of 13 million people, the U.N. official noted.
</P>
<P>
"Half measures will not do," Bellamy said. "The children and
women of the Horn of Africa need our total commitment in order to
help them survive."
</P>
<P>
Currently donor countries have delivered some food, but
non-food aid, such as basic medicine and clean water, is urgently
wanted, she said.
</P>
<P>
She noted that in northern Kenya, the malnutrition rate is
going up when the drought looks worse than those in the 1980s and
1990s.
</P>
<P>
The senior U.N. official also welcomed the cease-fire agreement
signed Sunday between Ethiopia and Eritrea, saying that it would
shift the attention to the drought from the bloody border war.
</P>
<P>
Bellamy began her visit to the Horn of Africa last Thursday in
a bid to draw renewed attention to the desperate circumstances
facing children across the region.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has appealed for more than 378 million U.S.
dollars to address the immediate humanitarian needs in the region.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF estimates that some 70 percent of all those hurt by the
drought are children and women. And children are most vulnerable
to the malnutrition and disease associated with drought.

<HEADLINE> S. African Parliament Passes Taxation Laws Amendment Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The South African National
Assembly Monday unanimously passed the complex Taxation Laws
Amendment Bill, which includes tax cuts of 9.9 billion rands (
about 1.45 billion U.S. dollars) and measures to tax
foreign-sources dividends.
</P>
<P>
The bill was described as the most comprehensive tax reform
legislation in 30 years, the South African Press Association
reported.
</P>
<P>
It will be submitted to the National Council of Provinces for
approval.
</P>
<P>
The bill and particularly measures to tax foreign-sourced
dividends came under fire during public hearings last month, and
were described by private sector tax experts as "draconian".
</P>
<P>
The bill also includes proposals to grant "public benefit
organizations" tax-exempt status, reduce company tax rates for
small businesses, and introduce a 100 rands (about 15 U.S.
dollars) departure tax on international air travel from November
1.
</P>
<P>
Legislation on the shift to a residence-based taxation system
is expected to come before Parliament later this year, and
proposals to tax capital gains earlier in the new year.

NEW DELHI, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The Indian central government is
targeting a growth rate of at least 10 percent for the next decade
to eliminate poverty in the country, Indian Finance Minister
Yashwant Sinha was quoted by the Press Trust of India (PTI) as
saying Monday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a seminar in the northeastern state of Assam, Sinha
regretted that the growth rate in 1999-2000 was expected to go
down to only 6 percent as against 6.8 percent in the previous year,
the PTI reported.
</P>
<P>
The fall in the growth rate was largely due to a decline in
agriculture's growth rate, Sinha noted.
</P>
<P>
"To make the economy stronger, the government is targeting 10-
percent growth rate for the next 10 years to give agriculture its
due share," he added.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture is the key economic sector for the whole
northeastern region of India, which also tops the country in

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Restructure State-Owned Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania will restructure
three state- owned banks soon in a bid to make them profitable,
local newspapers reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted the Bank of Tanzania (BoT) as saying in its
latest Monetary Policy statement that it is about to complete
studies for restructuring the Tanzania Investment Bank, Tanzania
Postal Bank and the People's Bank of Zanzibar.
</P>
<P>
The restructuring program is aimed at building a sound banking
system in the country in line with the BoT Act of 1995, the
central bank said.
</P>
<P>
According to BoT, it has facilitated the sale of 51 percent of
the shares of the Trust Bank of Tanzania Limited to Driscoll
Investments Limited.
</P>
<P>
"The new owners changed the bank's name to Delphis Bank
(Tanzania) Limited in a strategy to boost depositor confidence
after separating itself from the Trust Bank (Kenya) Ltd.," BoT
said.
</P>
<P>
It said the Greenland Bank (Tanzania) Ltd. would soon be handed
over to the Deposit Insurance Fund for liquidation.
</P>
<P>
"Efforts to rescue the bank by finding a buyer ended in vain,
therefore BoT instituted measures to pay depositors and terminate
staff," the central bank explained.
</P>
<P>
It further added that almost all depositors and staff have been
paid and the remaining depositors will have their accounts
transferred to BoT where they would continue to be paid.
</P>
<P>
The central bank disclosed that during 2000/2001 financial
year, it would continue to strengthen its supervisor capacity and
improve on the reporting standards of the commercial banks to
minimize systemic failures.
</P>
<P>
In March this year, Tanzania sold its biggest commercial bank,
the National Bank of Commerce (1997) Limited, to the Amalgamated
Banks of South Africa Group (ABSA).
</P>
<P>
ABSA bought 700,000 shares, equivalent to 70 percent of the
bank's value, leaving 300,000 shares or 30 percent to the
Tanzanian government.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania admitted its failure to operate the bank profitably,
hoping it would be successful after the privatization which
started in November 1998.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Submits Answers to IOC Questions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAUSANNE, Switzerland, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Beijing submitted
its answers to the 22 questions raised by the International
Olympic Committee (IOC) here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
At the main hall of the IOC headquarters today, Secretary
General of the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games Bid Committee Wang Wei
presented 50 documents containing Beijing's preliminary plan to
host the Olympic Games to IOC Sports Director Gilbert Felli and
Head for the IOC's Candidate Cities Relations Jacqueline Barret.
</P>
<P>
At Felli's proposal, the Chinese delegation took some pictures
together with the IOC officials in the hall and in front of the
IOC building to mark the event.
</P>
<P>
After briefing the Chinese delegation about the new procedure,
Ms Barret said that the IOC would send a fax to the Beijing 2008
Olympic Games Bid Committee to confirm the IOC has received
Beijing's answers in one or two days.
</P>
<P>
Beijing is one of the ten cities bidding for the 29th Olympiad
in 2008. The others include Bangkok, Cairo, Havana, Istanbul,
Kuala Lumpur, Osaka, Paris, Seville and Toronto.
</P>
<P>
The cities have to submit their answers by June 20, 2000.
</P>
<P>
Through the questionnaire, the IOC will assess each city's
capacity to organize the Olympic Games, the world's largest
sporting event. The IOC administration will collect the completed
questionnaires, analyze them and report to the IOC Executive Board,
who will meet on August 28-29 to make a final decision as to which
applicants will be accepted as bid cities. The announcement will
be made by August 31.
</P>
<P>
"The new procedure is a concrete evidence that our reforms are
in place and working. The rules and procedures are clear and
transparent. This benefits both the cities and the IOC," said
Francois Carrard, IOC director general, on February 24 when the
IOC distributed the questionnaire to the applicant cities.
</P>
<P>
"Bidding to host the Olympic Games requires a major commitment
by each city and its National Olympic Committee," said Felli on
the same occasion. "Today we did two things to help. We
highlighted several areas the cities need to focus on early in the
process, and we gave the IOC a mechanism by which to measure each
city's capacity to host the Olympic Games."

XINING, June 19 (Xinhua) -- An anti-poaching patrol squad
attached to the Hoh Xil Nature Reserve in northwest China's
Qinghai Province became trapped in the reserve's vast "no man's
land" on June 18.

Autonomous Region, an area where the poaching of Tibetan antelopes
is most rampant.

<P>
The nature reserve administration is now busy preparing a
rescue plan.

<P>
The poaching of rare wild animals such as Tibetan antelopes is
rampant in the Hoh Xil area, known as China's largest "no man's

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Rejects Allegations of Intrusion in Kashmir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Monday rejected Indian
allegations that thousands of Muslim militants are preparing to
cross into the India-controlled part of Kashmir from the Pakistani
side.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan military spokesman Major General Rashid Qureshi also
denied that his country is supporting separatist Muslim movements
in India-controlled Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters here, Qureshi called the Indian
allegations rubbish. He said the move is part of India's
propaganda campaign to portray the 11-year old uprising in Indian
Kashmir as Pakistan-inspired rather than an indigenous revolt.
</P>
<P>
"Every time they have a problem inside India-held Kashmir,the
Indians ... always want to externalize it and put the blame on
Pakistan," the spokesman charged.
</P>
<P>
He further said India might be preparing for some adventurism
on the Line of Control (LoC) of Kashmir under the cover of such
allegations. He said Pakistani troops are alert and necessary
measures have been taken to meet any such eventuality.
</P>
<P>
According to Pakistani media reports, military authorities in
India said more than 2,000 Kashmir separatists are waiting to
infiltrate Indian territory from Pakistan-controlled Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
India said the militants are spread out at different locations
along the 720-kilometer Line of Control that divides Kashmir
between the two arch rivals
</P>
<P>
Last summer large-scale fighting was triggered along the LoC
after thousands of Muslim militants infiltrated India-controlled
Kashmir and occupied some strategic positions.
</P>
<P>
The disputed Himalayan region has caused two of the three full-
fledged wars between India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
In the two-thirds of Kashmir under New Delhi's control,Muslim
militants have been combating the Indian troops for the past years.
</P>
<P>
New Delhi accused Islamabad of arming Kashmiri insurgents, but
Islamabad maintains that it only provides diplomatic and moral
support to what it calls Kashmiri freedom fighters.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The Romanian national telephone
company, Romtelecom, will invest 6.1 billion U.S. dollars in the
country's rural areas this year in order to extend the public
telephony system, the local Romania Libera Daily reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to an investment project, Romtelecom will install 3,
700 pay phones in localities with more than 1,000 inhabitants and
725 pay phones in localities with more than 500 inhabitants. At
the same time, the network in urban areas will be extended by 3,
400 pay phones.
</P>
<P>
Besides these, 400 pay phones with booth for handicapped

Romtelecom was privatized in November 1998 through the purchase
of 35 percent stake by OTE, a Greek national telephony operator.
Under the contract, OTE would gain the usufruct right over another
16 percent of Romtelecom shares in five years, which ensures its
control over the company.
</P>
<P>
According to the statistics released under the European Survey
of Information Society about communications and information
technology in Central and Eastern Europe, Romania had no more than
20 telephone lines per 100 inhabitants in 1998.

<HEADLINE> French Court Refuses to Release Frozen Russian Bank Accounts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The Tribunal of Grand Investigation
of Paris on Monday rejected a request by the Russian government to
release the 180 million U.S. dollars of Russian bank accounts
France has frozen since May 18.
</P>
<P>
The tribunal said that the Russian government failed to make
proper judicial procedure.
</P>
<P>
France applied a decision by a Swedish tribunal of arbitration
to freeze the bank accounts of 70 Russian government organs, after
a Swiss company, Noga, accused Russia of failing to pay for the
food products it sent to Russia in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Noga claimed that Russia owed it 800 million U.S. dollars and
asked for an immediate payment of 63 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The French judicial authorities have frozen the accounts in the
Eurobank of the Russian embassy in Paris, the Russian commercial
representation in France and the Russian representation in the U.N.
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.

<HEADLINE> Greek Entry Into Euro Zone Approved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FEIRA, Portugal, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Greece became the 12th
member of the European Union's single currency mechanism after the
EU summit on Monday gave the final approval for its entry.
</P>
<P>
On January 1 next year, the euro is set to replace the Greek
currency of drachma to end the run of a 2,500-year-old currency.
</P>
<P>
EU heads of state and government, who are meeting in the
northern Portuguese resort, approved the Greek entry bid which has
been studied and assessed by the EU council of finance and foreign
ministers respectively.
</P>
<P>
"Greece will be more European with the euro," said Greek
central bank official Emmanuel Emmanuel, "let the drachma remain
in history. What's more important is the stability that the euro
has to offer."
</P>
<P>
Monday's final approval more than rewarded Greece for its years
of belt-tightening to reduce inflation, deficit and public debt as
against government budgets.
</P>
<P>
Greece's state mint has been planning to print euros later this
year, way ahead of the January 1, 2002 -- the target date when
euro will formally enter circulation in all the euro zone
countries that also include Austria, Belgium, France, Italy, the
Netherlands, Luxembourg, Ireland, Spain, Portugal, Germany and
Finland.
</P>
<P>
Greece, the poorest country within the 15-nation bloc, failed
to qualify two years ago for the initial group of euro countries
although more than 70 percent of the Greek population supported
the Greek joining the single currency.
</P>
<P>
Drachma was believed to be the first international currency.
After first minted about 650 B.C. in what is now western Turkey,
the currency was widely used among different city-states in the
ancient world.

<HEADLINE> Iran Stresses Peaceful Solution to Regional Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
on Monday urged the countries in the Persian Gulf region to resolve
their problems "through negotiations and goodwill."
</P>
<P>
Iran believes that no problem in the region cannot be resolved
through negotiations and goodwill, Khatami told visiting Qatari
Minister of Finance, Economy and Trade Yussef Hussein Kamal.
</P>
<P>
The president explained that the Gulf states are inter-related
in maintaining security and they therefore should explore common
status in the modern world on the basis of mutual respect, mutual
interests and non-interference in each other's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Tehran has long been against foreign presence in the strategic
region rich in energy resources, insisting that the Gulf belong to
regional nations and their future generations.
</P>
<P>
As chairman of the Organization of the Islamic Conference since
1997, Iran will hand over the post to Qatar at the ninth OIC summit
due in December in Doha. Khatami said Iran has held good
negotiations with Qatari officials on conveying its experience to
them.
</P>
<P>
On the bilateral front, Khatami said there are extensive grounds
for boosting economic, scientific and technical cooperation. He
called for the activation of a Tehran-Doha joint economic
commission.
</P>
<P>
The Qatari minister arrived here on Sunday. He told Khatami that
Qatar attaches special importance to its relations with Iran and
expressed hope that Gulf states would strengthen cooperation to
bring about peace and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
He has held talks with Iran's First Vice President Hassan Habibi
and Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi on bilateral relations and
regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Iran has been steadily improving relations with its Gulf
neighbors since President Khatami took office in 1997.

Foreign Minister Amr Moussa told reporters following the session.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Iran, EU to Hold Another Round of Dialogue in Tehran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Iran and the European Union (EU)
will hold their fifth round of "comprehensive dialogue" here on
Wednesday at the level of deputy foreign ministers, Iranian Foreign
Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi announced on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"During the talks, the two sides will exchange views on
bilateral politico-economic cooperation as well as all regional and
international issues," Asefi was quoted by the Islamic Republic
News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister for European and
American Affairs Morteza Sarmadi will head the Iranian delegation
and a Portuguese deputy foreign minister will lead the EU team as
Portugal currently holds the EU rotating presidency.
</P>
<P>
The EU and Iran started their so-called "comprehensive dialogue"
in July 1998, instead of the previous "critical dialogue,"
following a warm-up between the two sides after President Mohammad
Khatami initiated a new policy of detente in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The EU launched the so-called "critical dialogue" with Iran in
December, 1992 with an aim to soften Iran's policies on the Middle
East peace process, international terrorism and production of
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The dialogue was suspended in April 1997 after a Berlin court
verdict accused Iranian leaders of being behind a terrorist
assassination of Iranian dissidents in Germany.
</P>
<P>
The EU decided to resume talks with Iran in March 1998 after the
two sides ended the diplomatic row over the Berlin court ruling.

<HEADLINE> Iran Denies Change in Policy toward Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Iran has not changed its policy
toward Israel though the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei told
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan that Tehran is seeking peace in
the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
"Although a number of Western media were trying to misuse the
vivid attitudes Iran has adopted in this case, the U.N. chief was
informed that Iran has not changed its attitude toward the illegal
Zionist (Israeli) regime", Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza
Asefi said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei said in a meeting with Annan here on Sunday that Iran
demands full withdrawal of Israeli forces from south Lebanon and is
seeking a peace that does not ignore the rights of the
Palestinians, the Islamic Republic News Agency quoted him as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei also underlined the Lebanon-Israel dispute "has not
come to an end" and Israel must withdraw from other Lebanese lands,
including the Shebba farms on Lebanon's border with Syria.
</P>
<P>
Some western media claimed a change in Iran's policy toward the
Middle East peace process as Khamenei talked about peace in the
region for the first time.
</P>
<P>
Iran has strongly opposed peace talks with Israel and supported
armed struggle against Israeli occupation of Islamic and Arab
lands. It also refuses to recognize the existence of Israel and
termed it as a "usurper of Islamic and Arab territories."
</P>
<P>
Terming Annan's one-day visit to Tehran as "important," Asefi
said the U.N. chief sought Tehran's support and help to solve the
issues in the Middle East during his talks with high-ranking
Iranian officials, including Khamenei, President Mohammad Khatami
and Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi.

<P>
LUSAKA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has blamed
South Africa for delay in signing a agreement with the five-member
Southern African Customs (SACU), the Times of Zambia newspaper
reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The majority of issues that arose last year between Zambia and
Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia and Swaziland have been resolved, but
South Africa remains the major stumbling block, Zambian Commerce,
Trade and Industry Minister William Harrington said here at the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is reluctant to conclude the agreement, he added.
</P>
<P>
Harrington, who was scheduled to attend a meeting for ministers
on the Southern African Development Community (SADC) Trade
Protocol, said he would use the opportunity to persuade his South
African counterpart to make a commitment.
</P>
<P>
It is prudent that the SACU agreement is signed before the SADC
Trade Protocol to pave the way for easy trade in the region, he
said, showing confidence that all issues would be ironed out soon.

<HEADLINE> Danube Traffic Severely Impaired by Yugoslav Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The freight transport on the
Danube River in the first five months of the year has dwindled by
almost 95 percent from the 1990 level due to conflicts in the
region, the local Curentul daily reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the corresponding periods, the Danube freight
transport in the first five months of this year was below 10
percent of the figure for 1997 and at around 5 percent of the
volume for 1990.
</P>
<P>
What is more, the traffic was limited to goods carried between
Romanian ports, the paper cited sources of the Romanian River Port
Administration as saying.
</P>
<P>
With poor freight transport, port operators and shippers will
not be able to pay their debts to the River Port Administration
which, in turn, is unable to implement its program of improving
port infrastructures in Romania.
</P>
<P>
The administration is aimed at modernizing the river port of
Cernavoda in eastern Romania this year.
</P>
<P>
During NATO's war against Yugoslavia last year several bridges
over the Danube were destroyed, blocking the waterway and caused
heavy economic loss to the countries along the river. Traffic was

<HEADLINE> No Lifting of Sanctions Unthinkable: Austrian FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FEIRA, Portugal, June 19 (Xinhua) -- A senior Austrian official
said on Monday that no lifting of sanctions against Austria at the
European Union summit was unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
Austrian Finance Minister Karl-Heinz Grasser told the press
after the European council of finance ministers from the EU member
states failed to strike an accord on the proposed tax reformation.
</P>
<P>
He said: "It was unthinkable for Austria's EU partners not to
lift the sanctions imposed on my country."
</P>
<P>
He said that even the people of the EU member states have been
appealing for the lifting of the sanctions imposed after the
Austrian coalition government incorporating the far-right Freedom
Party was swore in on February 4.
</P>
<P>
A recent EU-wide survey found that most of the respondents were
in favor of normalizing bilateral relations between Austria and
its EU member states.
</P>
<P>
"Why not use open discussions to find a solution toward the
issue of sanctions," said the finance minister who added that he
was confident that a final solution would be found in that there
was no legal basis for the current sanctions established by the 14
other EU member states to protest against the incorporation of
Joerg Haider's far-right Freedom Party in the coalition government.
</P>
<P>
"No base at all," said Grasser, "so I am confident that an
agreement will be reached in the end on lifting the sanctions."
</P>
<P>
Austria has become a tricky problem for the two-day EU summit
of heads of state and government by becoming a ball that has been
kicked around by Portugal, which is holding the rotating
presidency of the 15-nation bloc, the EU member states and the
European Commission, the executive body of the EU.
</P>
<P>
All seemed to have been shunning the responsibility of
initiating to lift the sanctions that have no legal base in the
European Union treaty. Portugal said that it was the decision by
all the 14 EU member states.
</P>
<P>
The EU commission said that the issue was not at the EU level
and that it had to be settled at bilateral level.
</P>
<P>
Some member states have been moving toward the lifting of the
sanctions but France and Belgium, the hardliners in the matter,
still opposed to the lifting of sanctions.

<HEADLINE> China-made Air-Conditioners of High Quality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Some 96 percent of China-made air
conditioners are up to the required standard, according to a
report issued here today by the State Bureau of Quality and
Technical Supervision.
</P>
<P>
The bureau has conducted quality checks on over 25 brands of
air-conditioners produced by 24 enterprises in eight provinces and
municipalities, including Beijing, Shanghai and Guangdong.
</P>
<P>
Of the 25 brands, only one brand, with the trademark "Huiyang"
and produced by a Nanhai-based company in Guangdong Province, was
unqualified.
</P>
<P>
The report said the majority of air-conditioner manufacturers
in China have established quality control systems.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that the installation of air-conditioners also
affects their operation, and on March 1 the bureau enacted
provisions to regulate the fixing of air-conditioners.
</P>
<P>
The report also pointed out that air-conditioner manufacturers
in China rely too much on introducing foreign technologies.
</P>
<P>
There are some 70 air-conditioner makers in China, with a total
annual capacity of 22.5 million units.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, China produced more than 13 million air-conditioners,
making it one of the world's leading air-conditioner makers.

<HEADLINE> Beijing, Main Maker of Own Air Pollution: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese capital should mostly
take the blame for its own air pollution, though deserts in the
Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and some other areas in the
country are the main cause of the 10 severe dust storms that hit
the city this spring.
</P>
<P>
This was the judgment of Song Xiyou, head of the Capital
Afforestation Committee and director of the Municipal Forestry
Bureau. He was speaking here today at the launching ceremony of
international company Unilever's tree-planting program. Unilever
is pouring seven million yuan into the program.
</P>
<P>
Song revealed that 80 percent of pollutants in the atmosphere
at the higher level above the city comes from outside, while 80
percent of pollutants in the air at the lower altitude are
produced locally. This shows that the problem of air pollution
remains critical, he said.
</P>
<P>
The city government attaches great importance to the issue, and
so far its urban afforestation plan, known as "Covering up the
Yellow Soil," has been completed by planting trees and covering
pavements with concrete bricks.

<HEADLINE> Most Chinese-Made Pressure Pots Qualified: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 19 (Xinhua) -- An official survey conducted in
the first quarter of this year found that 91.3 percent of China-
made pressure pots are up to the required standards, according to
the State Quality and Technical Supervision Administration.
</P>
<P>
The administration published the results of the investigation
here today. It revealed that 87.5 percent of the domestic pressure
pots made of aluminum are of good quality, while 100 percent of
the pressure pots made of stainless steel passed the official
tests.
</P>
<P>
The stainless steel products, which are more stable in quality
and safer, are likely to take over the urban market from their
aluminum counterparts. Currently, stainless steel pressure pots
have a 20 percent share of the market.
</P>
<P>
The administration has urged the manufacturers to pay attention
to the quality of rubber seals, saying that poor quality rubber
seals are detrimental to human health.
</P>
<P>
Pressure pots used to be a headache for local quality
supervisors. In 1994, only 29 percent of the pressure pots
surveyed by the administration were up to standard. In 1997, the
percentage of qualified pressure pots reached 80.9, thanks to
efforts made by the departments concerned.

<HEADLINE> Developing Nations Urged for Common Ground in Facing Globalization  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Developing countries must work
together to forge a unified stance in facing the challenges of
globalization which has proven harmful to the world's poorest
nations.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made here Monday at the opening session of the
10th summit meeting of the Group of 15 (G-15) developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the inaugural session of the two-day summit meeting,
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said globalization should lead to
improving standards of living in developing countries, however, "
imbalance in the world economy is increasing instead of
decreasing."
</P>
<P>
The developing nations are concerned with the developments of
globalization because the average growth rates in the developing
countries have decreased from six percent to two percent since the
1997 Asian financial crisis, Mubarak told leaders of the G-15 at
his presidential palace in northern Cairo.
</P>
<P>
To cushion the negative effects of globalization, Mubarak said,
developing nations should enhance their cooperation with
international partners to build a new world economic order based
on "equality, justice and democracy."
</P>
<P>
Echoing Mubarak's worries about globalization of free trade,
Jamaican Prime Minister Percival James Patterson said at the
opening session that globalization may be proven a challenge to
developing nations in the years to come.
</P>
<P>
"Globalization requires greater, not less, global governance. It
demands greater and more genuine democratic governance. This may
turn out to be our greatest singe challenge," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he acknowledged that globalization does have one
positive effect, which has brought people around the world closer
together.
</P>
<P>
"We must draw strength from this precious unity," he added.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo said in his speech on
behalf of G-15 members from Africa that developing countries are
overwhelmed by the "strident" consequences of globalization, which
caused the collapse of commodity prices, "a mockery" of efforts to
raise output.
</P>
<P>
He also renewed appeals by summit participants to the West, such
as the G-8 industrialized countries, for helping release the burden
of billions of dollars in debt, which has hindered their efforts to
build modern economies.
</P>
<P>
The two-day G-15 summit was held one month before the meeting of
the G-8 industrialized nations in Japan in July. And Mubarak will
contact the G-18 leadership to convey the G-15 position once it is
adopted.
</P>
<P>
The president called on the developed countries to write off
some 350 billion dollars in African debts which required African
countries to set aside some 40 percent of their budgets.
</P>
<P>
Nations of the G-15, which has grown to 17, account for one
third of the world's population and produce 2 trillion U.S. dollars
in goods. Their combined exports last year stood at 361.4 billion
dollars and imports at 357.2 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The G-15, founded in 1989 to boost South-South cooperation,
groups Algeria, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Egypt, India, Indonesia,
Kenya, Jamaica, Malaysia, Mexico, Nigeria, Peru, Senegal, Sri
Lanka, Venezuela and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Monday's summit meeting also coincided with the tenth
anniversary of the founding of the group.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Asks U.N. to End Israel's Continuous Occupation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss
said here on Monday Lebanon wants U.N. peacekeeping force to end
Israel's continuous occupation on some parts of the Lebanese-
Israeli border.
</P>
<P>
Speaking prior to meeting U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan,
Hoss also said Lebanon holds the continuation of the Israeli
violation of the international border represents a violation
threatening the safety and sovereignty of Lebanese territories that
must not be allowed by the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council decided on Sunday to certify Israel
has ended its 22-year occupation of south Lebanon despite Lebanese
complaint that about 13 areas are under Israeli control.
</P>
<P>
"U.N. peacekeeping must be responsible for removing the Israeli
violation on the international border immediately", Hoss added.
</P>
<P>
Annan said in Beirut Airport after he arrived Monday noon that "
the U.N. has not been demarcating the border between Lebanon and
Israel and between Lebanon and Syria, but it is necessary for the
U.N. to mark a withdrawal line on the ground, the so-called blue
line."
</P>
<P>
He admitted both Israel and Lebanon have their problems with the
withdrawal line, but the line is not the border and should be
respected by both sides.
</P>
<P>
The secretary general pointed out that Israel has withdrawn its
troops from Lebanon in line with Resolution 425 and verifying
Israeli withdrawal is his responsibility with a "neutral and
impartial manner".
</P>
<P>
As for the alleged Israeli violation on Lebanese border, Annan
said "it is another matter".
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Annan stressed that "if the Lebanese government
believes that there has been violation of the withdrawal line,
there should be immediately report of the matter to the United
Nations. Since the line has been established, any cross of the line
is a violation."
</P>
<P>
Annan also expressed the hope that the Lebanese government will
deploy its army in the south and reassert its authority there.
Lebanese President Emile Lahoud said on Sunday Lebanon will not
approve the council's statement until Lebanese teams and U.N.
peacekeepers will have verified the withdrawal is complete.

<HEADLINE> Fear for Sharia Prompts Exodus in Northern Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of people have been
fleeing Kano and Kaduna, two of Nigeria's northern states, for
fear of another scourge over the implementation of the Islamic law
Sharia, as an earlier one in February in Kaduna had killed nearly
1,000 people.
</P>
<P>
The Muslims in Kano had reportedly threatened a showdown if the
Sharia did not come into force on Wednesday as promised by state
governor Rabiu Kwankwaso last week, Lagos-based newspaper reported
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some Christians in the two states have also vowed
that the implementation of Sharia would mean disaster to the
country. They accused the Muslims of using the law to drive them
out.
</P>
<P>
To forestall possible violence, police in the states have
beefed up their patrols, while an army unit stationed near Kaduna
warned last week that it would take "violent" actions to crack
down on trouble-makers.
</P>
<P>
Kano and Kaduna are two most popular and influential states in
the northern part of Nigeria. Unlike other northern states, which
are dominated by Muslim population, the two states have a large
Christian population.
</P>
<P>
Two other northern states, Zamfara and Sokoto, have already
introduced Sharia into their criminal code earlier in the year
despite the opposition from the Christian dominated southern
states and the federal government.
</P>
<P>
Sharia, mainly implemented in Islamic countries, is a code of
living for Muslims. Apart from its religious contents, the code is
known for its regulations that women must cover themselves and
different sexes must be segregated.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Threatens Another War Over Land Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 19 (Xinhua) -- British citizens who own vast
tracts of land in Zimbabwe should choose between acceding to the
government's land redistribution program or facing another armed
struggle, according to Zimbabwean Vice President Joseph Msika.
</P>
<P>
Addressing his party's supporters in Mutare North of east
Zimbabwe Sunday, Msika said the land issue was a thorny one, over
which Zimbabweans would not hesitate to wage another armed
struggle.
</P>
<P>
He, however, hoped that things would not degenerate to that
extent and urged the minority whites to genuinely embrace the hand
of reconciliation extended to them by the government and the
people of Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
About 4,000 white commercial farmers own two-thirds of the
country's prime land while more than 10 million blacks are
struggling to eke out a living on infertile soils.
</P>
<P>
Critics of the government would never detract the government
from resolving the land imbalances, Msika said, noting that while
the war of liberation had brought about political freedom,
economic independence would remain a pie in the sky if the land
issue was not resolved.
</P>
<P>
There would be no going back on land redistribution, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean government has since independence acquired 3
million of a targeted 8 million hectares of land for resettlement.
To date, 73,000 families have been resettled while another 44,177
landless families have been earmarked for resettlement under the
new Land Acquisition Act.
</P>
<P>
The Act enables the government to take land without paying
compensation,
except for improvements made on the farms.

<P>
LONDON, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The bodies of 58 people were found
in the back of a lorry at the English port of Dover early on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The driver of the Dutch-registered lorry, which arrived from
Zeebrugge, Belgium, just before midnight, has been arrested.
</P>
<P>
The 54 men and four women presumably of oriental origins were
thought to have been illegal immigrants. A Home Office spokeswoman
told Xinhua that the identities and nationalities of the dead were
still unknown, and an investigation was under way.
</P>
<P>
Two survivors, both men, have been taken to hospital and have
not yet been questioned.
</P>
<P>
A Customs and Excise spokeswoman said the bodies were
discovered by a single officer during a routine search of the
lorry.
</P>
<P>
So far, there was no official statement on the cause of death.
The lorry was an airtight 18-meter-long container which was only
partially loaded with fresh tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
Its refrigerating unit was not switched on and it remains
unclear what the interior temperature would have been, said the
spokeswoman.

<HEADLINE> Interest Tax, Austria Overshadows EU Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FEIRA, Portugal, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of European Union
(EU) countries Monday began a two-day summit in the Portuguese
resort of Feira, which is expected to be overshadowed by a debate
on a uniform interest tax plan and sanctions against Austria.
</P>
<P>
Finance ministers from the 15-member bloc held a special
meeting before the summit to try to strike a deal on Portugal's
proposal that EU members unify their policy on savings interest
tax, which should not be below 20 percent of the savings interest.
</P>
<P>
Cross-border tax dodge costs EU countries billions of dollars
as citizens of one country may earn tax-free interest on savings
in another.
</P>
<P>
No deal was reached at the finance ministers' meeting and
Portuguese Finance Minister Joaquim Pina Moura has vowed to push
for the proposal during the summit.
</P>
<P>
Although the question of Austria was not on the agenda of the
summit, Vienna is expected to raise the issue in its fresh bid to
get rid of the sanctions imposed by its 14 partners after the
formation of its new government incorporating the far-right
Freedom Party in February.
</P>
<P>
France, which will take over the EU's rotating presidency on
July 1, has made clear that it would not take up the issue during
its six-month presidency. However, some other EU countries are
eager to solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
Other topics of the summit include the enlargement of the EU to
take in Eastern European countries, the EU's institutional reform,
a common foreign and defense policy, and relations between Europe
and Africa.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the interest tax and Austria issues will
cast a shadow over the discussion of these topics.

<HEADLINE> Leading Officials, Their Families Urged to Be Honest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, June 19 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese Party leader has
reminded leading officials to be honest and law-abiding and not to
involve family members in any illegal activities.
</P>
<P>
Wei Jianxing, a member of the Standing Committee of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee Political Bureau,
made the call during a trip in southwestern Yunnan Province from
June 13-18. During the week, Wei visited local factories and
villages.
</P>
<P>
In talks with local officials, Wei emphasized the importance of
CPC General Secretary Jiang Zemin's recent instructions on the
Party roles, calling for firmly fighting against corrupt elements
and waste of people's money because of dereliction of duty.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that in recent years, some middle- and high-
level leading officials have used their power to benefit their
spouses and children. The problem has become acute and ordinary
people are voicing their complaints.
</P>
<P>
He said it is right that the central government has banned
spouses and children of officials from engaging in businesses
within the domination scope of the officials.
</P>
<P>
Leading officials or their family members who violate the rules
must be punished, he warned.

<HEADLINE> Paper Urges Medical Reform in Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 19 (Xinhua) -- People's Daily, the leading
newspaper in China, will publish a commentary Tuesday calling for
speedier reforms of the medical care system in cities and
townships.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, the State Council issued a directive on the
reform issue, jointly written by eight central government
departments.
</P>
<P>
It says that the reform, together with the establishment of a
basic medical insurance system for urban employees, is aimed at
building up an urban medical care system up to the requirements of
the socialist market economy, boosting the healthy development of
the medical and pharmaceutical industry, and enabling the people
to enjoy fair-priced and quality medical services.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper criticizes the poor services offered by some
hospitals in urban areas, their waste of resources, generally poor
financial performance, disorder in the production and marketing of
medicine, lack of a competitiveness among public hospitals, and
skyrocketing medical costs.
</P>
<P>
The commentary urges to introduce a mechanism for competition
into hospitals and drug stores; separate government departments in
charge of the sector from medical care institutions; allow the
setting-up of hospitals in various forms; and bring the production
and marketing of medicine back to order.

</P>
<P>
The program, titled the "Unilever Living Environment Initiative:

<HEADLINE> Israeli Settlers Stage Mass Protests Against Territorial Concessions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of students from Jewish
settlements are gathering Monday in the Rose Garden just opposite
the Israeli Knesset (parliament) to protest further territorial
concessions to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Protestors are also staging a mass rally outside Prime Minister
Ehud Barak's home in Jerusalem to protest his plans to transfer to
the Palestinians over 90 percent of the West Bank territory,
dismantle Jewish settlements in the areas to be handed over or
leave the settlers under Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrations are part of a day-long strike declared by the
extreme right-wing Yesha Council of Jewish Settlements.
</P>
<P>
All the schools in the Jewish settlements in the West Bank,
which the Israelis call Judea and Samaria according to biblical
tradition, and Gaza are closed Monday after a call by the council
so that teachers and students could participate in the anti-
government demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
Many politicians and Education Ministry officials condemned the
inclusion of students in the demonstrations, noting that this would
set a negative precedent for other groups.
</P>
<P>
Education Ministry Director-General Shlomit Amichai said on
Sunday that removing children from school to attend political
demonstrations would constitute a disciplinary violation, and
warned that school principals and teachers who do not comply will
have their pay withheld according to the number of days students
were out of school.
</P>
<P>
As the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations entering a critical
stage, Barak has met increasing domestic opposition and pressure
against his plans to transfer land to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The Yesha Council of Jewish Settlers has been frequently staging
demonstrations in front of Barak's home, with demonstrators voicing
their security worries once their settlements are put under
Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
At the cabinet security meeting on Sunday, the ministers
expressed the concern that if a framework agreement is not reached
with the Palestinians, there is a danger of direct military
confrontation between the Israeli army and the Palestinian National
Authority.
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators are engaged in intensive
negotiations in Washington, aimed at settling the interim issues
and reaching a framework agreement for the final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
Barak has sought to delay the third deployment of Israeli forces
on the West Bank and make it part of a framework accord for a
final-status agreement. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat insists on
settling the interim issues first, which also includes the release
of about 1,600 Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails.
</P>
<P>
As a good-will gesture to ease the tense negotiating atmosphere,
the Israeli side has offered to set free three Palestinians. The
offer, however, was rebuffed by the Palestinians who said the
number fell much short of their demands.
</P>
<P>
There are also reports that the Israeli government is
considering handing over two Arab towns, Abu Dis and Azariya, on
the outskirts of Jerusalem to full Palestinian control on Friday,
when the third West Bank redeployment under the interim accords is
to take place.
</P>
<P>
In renewed efforts to boost the lagging Israeli-Palestinian
talks, United States special envoy on Mideast peace talks Dennis
Ross is expected to travel to the region on Thursday while U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is expected to arrive by
weekend or next week.

<HEADLINE> Mozambican Aluminium Smelter Casts First Ingot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The Mozambique Aluminium Fabricator
(MOZAL), located at Beluluane on the outskirts of Maputo, took
another step towards full production on Sunday when it cast its
first aluminium ingot, said a press release reaching here on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to the release, which was made available in London by
one of the major shareholders in the smelter, the British company
Billiton, the first aluminium was produced 25 months after work on
the smelter began, and six months ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
"The production of MOZAL's first aluminium, under budget and
ahead of schedule, is a remarkable engineering and managerial
achievement, and testimony to the technical capacity and
investment merits of southern Africa," said Billiton chairman
Brian Gilbertson in the release.
</P>
<P>
"It was always our hope that MOZAL, and its unique public and
private sector partnership, would be a powerful catalyst for
economic development in the region," Gilbertson said.
</P>
<P>
"The success of the project thus far, and the benefits that
have already begun to flow from it, have reaffirmed this hope. The
partners of MOZAL now look forward to a safe and successful
ramp-up of production to the smelter' s 250,000 tons per annum
capacity," the chairman said.
</P>
<P>
The production of metal ingots indicates that MOZAL has started
 commission its 288 reduction cells -- the furnaces in which
aluminium is produced from alumina through electrolysis.
</P>
<P>
"Activity will now focus on completing the remaining facilities
and on conducting trials and tests," the MOZAL release said,
adding that production will be raised gradually until it reaches
the 250,000 tons per year figure in the first quarter of 2001.
</P>
<P>
The smelter is expected to be officially inaugurated sometime
later in September and be fully put into production in 2001. All
the raw materials will be imported from Australia and the United
Kingdom while the products will be exported to Asia and Europe.
</P>
<P>
MOZAL, a project kicked off in July of 1998, boasts of an
investment of about 1.3 billion U.S. dollars. The largest
stakeholder is South Africa accounting for 43 percent of the
share, followed by the United Kingdom for 23 percent, while the
rest capital came from Japan and the World Bank.

</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the Economic Information Center under SETC

<HEADLINE> China Cracks Down on Pyramid Schemes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The three-month campaign to ban
the long-prohibited pyramid schemes that staged a come-back in
April has been successful, the State Administration of Industry
and Commerce said today.
</P>
<P>
From April 1 to June 10, local administrations at various
levels uncovered 1,206 cases of pyramid-type sales and other
similar cases, 187 of which are under judicial review.
</P>
<P>
More than 2,000 illegal spots, headquarters for the schemes,
were closed down and more than 10 million yuan was fined.
</P>
<P>
Notoriously fraudulent pyramid sales were abolished by the
State Council, China's cabinet, in its "Notice on Prohibition of
Pyramid Sales" issued in April 1998.
</P>
<P>
However, such schemes continue to operate in disguised forms,
such as sales in chain stores and via the Internet, and are
spreading fast in China.
</P>
<P>
These lucrative and quick-yielding schemes have cheated many
people. For example, in Nanyang City in central China's Henan
province, a man had conned people out of more than 1.6 million
yuan in a few months through pyramid sales before he was caught by
the local administration.

<HEADLINE> Israel Seeks Emergency Water Imports From Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 19 (Xinhua) -- A high-level "emergency panel" of
Israeli water experts and government officials is to leave for
Turkey on Monday to discuss possible import of Turkish water.
</P>
<P>
"In view of the present state of water resources, importing
water from Turkey this summer appear an unavoidable solution," the
Israeli daily Ha'aretz quoted a member of the delegation as saying.
</P>
<P>
The panel is to meet officials of the Turkish national water
company to assess the possibility of importing 50 million cubic
meters of water in an initial phase.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli national water company, Mekorot, warned on Sunday
that by fall, Israel's three main reservoirs, namely the Kinneret
(the Sea of Galilee), the mountain reservoir and the coastal
reservoir, would drop to "unprecedented low levels."
</P>
<P>
Under current proposals, says the Ha'aretz, Turkish water would
be transported in old, specially converted 250,000-ton oil tankers.
The tankers are to be discharged at a terminal to be built in
Ashkelon, in southern Israel. The water would then be piped to a
reservoir to be part of Mekorot's national water system.
</P>
<P>
The system, which would also require laying a 13-kilometer
pipeline, would cost an estimated 20 million U.S. dollars. The
imported water itself would cost about 65-75 cents per cubic meter.
But experts said that imported water is comparatively cheaper than
desalinized water.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said there are serious potential problems facing
the nation's aquifers. There has been a gradual decline since 1994
in the output of the Banyas and Dan springs in the northern part of
the country, and in the levels of water wells in the mountain
regions.
</P>
<P>
The continued drop in rainfall throughout Israel has also caused
an average drop of one meter per year in the level of the Dead Sea.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Urges Japan to Take Actions for Bilateral Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's Republic
of Korea (DPRK) on Monday urged Japan to take concrete moves to
push forward the talks between the two countries, the Korean
Central News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
After the historic summit between the leaders of DPRK and South
Korea, Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori has more than once
said "Japan has strong will and eagerness to improve the relations
with DPRK," said a commentary published by the news agency.
</P>
<P>
Some senior Japanese officials also formally expressed the
similar ideas such as "the chance is ripe" for the two countries
to hold talks.
</P>
<P>
DPRK always keeps the door of talks with Japan open, said the
commentary.
</P>
<P>
"If the Japanese authorities have a sincere and strong will for
improved (DPRK)-Japan relations, there is no need for them to
hesitate over the issue," the commentary added.
</P>
<P>
It has always been the stance and attitude of DPRK to sincerely
hold talks with Japan and improve the bilateral ties on the basis
of conforming to the interests of two peoples, said the commentary.
</P>
<P>
DPRK and Japan held a first round of high-level talks in
Pyongyang in April, marking a resumption of normalization
negotiations that collapsed in 1992.

<HEADLINE> More Foreign Tourists Flock to S. Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 19 (Xinhua) -- A total of 472,849 foreigners
visited South Korea in May, a 18.5 percent rise from the same
month of last year, the Korea National Tourism Organization said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The May figure, which was also a record monthly high, brought
the total number of foreign tourists in the first five months of
this year to 2.15 million, a 17.29 percent growth over the same
time last year.
</P>
<P>
Of the tourist figure in May, the number of Chinese visitors
rose 51 percent from the year before and that of Japanese
increased 15.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The organization attributed the sharp increase in Asian
tourists to the steady economic recovery of the region which
suffered a financial crisis in late 1997.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to increased number of foreign tourists, the state-run
organization was quite optimistic that this year's goal of
attracting 5.1 million foreign tourists will be easily met.

<HEADLINE> EU, Euro Zone Inflation Rates Remain Stable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTA MARIA DA FEIRA, Portugal, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The average
inflation rates for both the European Union and the euro zone
remained stable between April and May, Eurostat reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Luxembourg-based statistical office of the European
Community said that the annual inflation rate for the 15-nation
bloc stayed at 1.7 percent while that for the 11-nation euro zone
remained at 1.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Twelve months ago, the average inflation rate was 1.1 percent
for the European Union and 1.0 percent for the euro zone.
</P>
<P>
Ireland registered the highest inflation of 5.1 percent,
followed by Spain at 3.2 percent while Britain posted the lowest
inflation rate at 0.5 percent, followed by Sweden at 1.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Compared with April 1999, the annual inflation rate rose in 10
of the 15 EU member states and fell in five. The biggest relative
rise was found in Sweden where inflation rose from 0.3 percent to
1.3 percent in the past 12 months.
</P>
<P>
The European Union set 2.0 percent as the ceiling for the 15-
nation bloc and the rise of the inflation in the past year was
mainly attributed to the fall of the exchange rate of the single
currency to the United States dollar.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Intensifies Contacts With Iraqi Kurds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Turkey, afraid of an independent
Kurdish state in northern Iraq, is increasing its contacts with
Iraqi Kurdish oppositions for a reconciliation between Iraqi Kurds
and the Baghdad administration, local media reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
In a recent visit to Baghdad, Turkish Foreign Ministry
Undersecretary Faruk Logoglu suggested that the Iraqi authorities
attach importance on providing administrative services in the
Kurdish-populated northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has been plagued by the Abdullah Ocalan-led Kurdistan
Workers Party (PKK), which had waged a 15-year armed campaign
against Ankara since 1984 demanding Kurdish self-rule in
southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
However, after his arrest in February, 1999, Abdullah Ocalan has
called on his followers to lay down arms and make peace with
Ankara.
</P>
<P>
Turkey expects to play a role in promoting the reconciliation in
Iraq due to its close relations with Iraqi Kurdish oppositions,
including the Massoud Barzani-led Kurdistan Democratic Party and
the Jalal Talabani-led Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that leaders of all Iraqi opposition groups,
including Iraqi Kurds, will go to Washington to meet U.S. Vice
President Al Gore next week. The United States has been seeking to
topple the Iraqi regime of Saddam Hussein.

<HEADLINE> EU Ready to Recognize Palestinian State: Israeli Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) is
getting ready to recognize a Palestinian state if one is declared
in September, whether by agreement with Israel or unilaterally,
local daily Ha'aretz reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
A special committee of EU officials is currently discussing the
status of the European consulates in Jerusalem after the EU
recognizes a Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital, the
paper added.
</P>
<P>
In the Berlin Declaration of March 1999, the EU expressed
support to the founding of an independent Palestinian state in the
territories and called on Israel to conclude final-status
negotiations with the Palestinians within one year.
</P>
<P>
In turn for Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's willingness to
postpone the declaration of an independent Palestinian state in the
territories, set for May 1999, most of the EU countries promised to
recognize a Palestinian state even if Israel and the Palestinian
side failed to reach agreement by the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
United States officials denied that the Berlin Declaration had
been coordinated with it, but American sources have said the
declaration was preceded by a favorable nod from Washington, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Ministry fears that France's assumption of the
rotating EU presidency at the beginning of July will further
promote the Palestinian efforts to invoke the Berlin Declaration.
</P>
<P>
It did not escape Israeli attention that President Jacques
Chirac was the only Western leader to attend Syrian President Hafez
al-Assad's funeral last week.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The Israeli government is considering the possible handover
of the Jerusalem suburbs of Abu Dis and Ayzaria to full Palestinian
control on Friday, when the third West Bank redeployment under the
interim accords is to take place.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian sources said Sunday that the move may be aimed at
calming the atmosphere for U.S. special peace envoy Dennis Ross'
expected arrival on Thursday, and U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright's arrival either by the weekend or next week.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Knesset (parliament) last month endorsed to transfer
of three Arab villages outside Jerusalem to the Palestinian control
as an "advance payment" prior to the third deployment. The move was
frozen by Prime Minister Ehud Barak in protest against the violence
on the Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- After the announcement Sunday night that the Israeli
government would meet this week, it seems unlikely that Barak would
postpone, yet again, Tuesday's cabinet meeting in an effort to buy
more time and avoid an eruption of the crisis with the ultra-
orthodox Shas party.
</P>
<P>
Shas insisted Sunday that they would not support any further
postponements and warned that if no agreement is reached by Monday,
their ministers would resign.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to Barak said that if the prime minister believes
that more time is necessary for negotiations between his One Israel
party and Shas, he will opt to postpone the meeting. Barak delayed
the cabinet meeting from Sunday to Tuesday in a bid to settle the
coalition crisis.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv
</P>
<P>
-- A serious water shortage is likely to force Israel to order
emergency water shipments from Turkey this summer, Mekorot water
utility chief Amos Epstein said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A top-level inter-ministerial delegation is to leave for Turkey
on Monday to examine water sources and discuss possible timetables
for delivery of imported water.
</P>
<P>
Mekorot has warned that by fall, Israel's three central
reservoirs would sink to "unprecedented low levels."
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Tens of thousands of settlers are expected to travel to
Jerusalem on Monday with their children as part of a day-long
strike declared by the right-wing Yesha Council of Jewish
Settlements.
</P>
<P>
The protest follows reports that Barak plans to give the
Palestinians over 90 percent of the West Bank territory,
dismantling Jewish settlements in the areas to be handed over, or
leaving them under the Palestinian rule.
</P>
<P>
Protests in Jerusalem began Sunday with the Samaria local
council busing students to demonstrate outside the prime minister's
home.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief Urges Eritrea, Ethiopia to Respect Peace Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 19 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Secretary General Kofi
Annan on Monday urged Eritrea and Ethiopia to honor the peace
agreement they have just signed and U.N. member states to send
peacekeepers to the region.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after meeting Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak, Annan said he hopes Eritrea and Ethiopia would respect the
agreement and stop their fighting.
</P>
<P>
Annan came to Egypt from Iran, the first leg of his ongoing
Mideast tour, on Sunday. He left for Lebanon soon after meeting
with Mubarak. He will also travel to Jordan, Syria, Israel and the
Palestinian self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea and Ethiopia signed the peace deal on Sunday in Algiers,
Algeria, pledging to halt two years of border war that has killed
tens of thousands of people and displaced more than a million
others, and caused heavy losses of properties on both sides.
</P>
<P>
Aside from a commitment to stop armed attacks, one of the key
points of the agreement, brokered by the Organization of African
Unity, is the deployment of a U.N. peacekeeping force in a strip of
land running parallel to the border inside Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
Annan called on the U.N. member states to provide troops as
quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
Following troop deployment, the U.N. will demarcate the border
for the two parties as asked in the peace agreement, and Addis
Ababa and Asmara have promised to respect the line that the U.N.
will draw, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia and Eritrea have been engaged in a border dispute since
May 6, l998 when the Eritrean troops invaded and seized some
Ethiopian territories. Fighting renewed in May 2000 along their 1,
000-kilometer border, with Ethiopian troops marching into Eritrea,
beyond disputed border regions.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Govt Urged to Liberate Bonded Laborers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Twenty Nepal-based international
non-governmental organizations (INGOs) appealed the Nepali
government to immediately take measures to liberate the bonded
laborers in the country, a report said Monday.
</P>
<P>
In a joint appeal issued on Sunday, the INGOs requested the
Nepali government to make provisions in writing for relieving the
bonded laborers of the debts and obligation to their alleged
masters, facilitate compensation to them for their unpaid wages
and provide land for cultivation, the Rising Nepal newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
"Even 70 years after the abolition of slavery and 10 years
after the restoration of democracy, there are still more than 25,
000 Nepalese citizens enslaved by their owners in bonded labor,"
the appeal said.
</P>
<P>
"Not only does such a practice trap them into a life of
unrelieved poverty, the continued existence of these illegal and
inhumane practices would undermine Nepal's standing in the
international community," it added.
</P>
<P>
Women and children have suffered miserably under this
exploitative system, said the appeal, urging the government to act
positively and immediately to eliminate the existence of bonded
labor practice.
</P>
<P>
Many farmers in Nepal's remote villages are forced into bondage
after borrowing money from landlords and are never able to get out
of it because of their ignorance and illiteracy.
</P>
<P>
Unofficial estimates put the number of bonded laborers at 40,
000.
</P>
<P>
The 20 INGOs include Handicap International, Swiss Association
for International Cooperation, Save the Children Norway, World
Neighbors among others.

<HEADLINE> Thailand, S. Korea to Hold Talks on Free Trade Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will soon negotiate with
South Korea on a plan to set up a free trade area between the two
countries, as the Republic of Korea (South Korea) and the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea have tentatively reached a
historic agreement on unification, The Thai News Agency (TNA)
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Director-General of the Department of Export Promotion of the
Commerce Ministry Banpot Hongtong was quoted as saying that the
Commerce Ministry through the Department of Business Economics was
studying the feasibility of establishing a free trade area between
Thailand and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The plan would be possible if South Korea eliminated measures
hindering Thai exports to the republic, including tariff barriers,
import restrictions, and strict sanitary inspections, particularly
on agricultural products, he said.
</P>
<P>
Thai authorities will negotiate with their South Korean
counterparts on more opening up of South Korean market for Thai
farm products in exchange for the Thai government's investment
incentives and technological transfer for South Korean enterprises,
which will pave the way for an agreement on free trade area
between the two countries, Banpot disclosed.
</P>
<P>
It was likely that South Korea would accept the Thai proposal,
as food and other agricultural products were significant for the
economic stability in South Korea, projected the senior Commerce
Ministry official.
</P>
<P>
South Korea is reportedly considering concluding free trade
area agreements with the United States, Japan, Chile and Thailand.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Rebel Group Postpones Talks with Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The Moro Islamic Liberation Front (
MILF), the biggest Muslim rebel group in the southern Philippines,
has postponed its scheduled fifth round of formal talks with the
government on June 28.
</P>
<P>
MILF military affairs chief Al Haj Murad said in a press
statement available Monday that continuous military offensive
against MILF camps in Mindanao and the military attention to
arrest top leaders of the rebel organization were the main reasons
why they are temporarily deferring the said talks.
</P>
<P>
According to Murad, the government has issued arrest warrants
against the three top MILF leaders, namely himself, MILF chairman
Hashim Salamat and MILF political affairs chief Ghadzali Jaafar.
</P>
<P>
Murad added that the time frame given to them by the government
to submit comments on its proposed political package on June 21,
cannot be met on time by them.
</P>
<P>
During the government-MILF fourth round of talks on May 30, the
MILF negotiating panel initially agreed to submit their comment on
June 21.
</P>
<P>
"But it was unanimously decided in a special meeting by the
Majlis As-Shoora, the MILF's parliament, to ask the government
peace panel to defer the said talks," Murad explained.
</P>
<P>
Murad, however, clarified that the MILF is not closing its door
on the ongoing peace talks. He stressed that the peace talks would
determine the political destiny of the Muslim people in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
But Edgardo Batenga, government chief peace negotiator, was
reported as saying that he is yet to receive an official
declaration from the MILF regarding the matter.

<HEADLINE> Manila Vows to Increase Job Opportunities in Countryside </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will
strive hard to provide rural residents enough employment and
livelihood opportunities in a bid to spur economic growth and
increase their incomes, the Philippine News Agency said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Vice Chairman Donna Gasgonia of the National Anti-Poverty
Commission (NAPC) was quoted as saying that this aims to stop and
eventually reverse the trend of rural folk flocking to crowded
urban centers to seek employment.
</P>
<P>
"We are reversing the trend. We know the poor are concentrated
in the rural areas, so we are focusing our assistance there
instead of in the cities," Gasgonia said.
</P>
<P>
With government assistance, the NAPC, which is chaired by
President Joseph Estrada, hopes to help residents in the
countryside generate their own employment by starting their own
businesses, Gasgonia said.
</P>
<P>
Secretary Horacio Morales of the Department of Agrarian Reform
(DAR) was also reported as saying that President Estrada has
thrown his full support behind food security through agricultural
modernization as his administration's primary weapon against
poverty.
</P>
<P>
Food security is one of the Estrada administration's five
centerpiece programs, alongside peace and order, mass housing, the
fight against graft and corruption, and electoral reforms.

<HEADLINE> COMESA, EU Remain Zambia's Major Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Zambia continues to earn over 60
percent of its total exports within the Common Market for Eastern
and Southern Africa (COMESA) region and the European Union (EU),
the Zambia Daily Mail newspaper reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Export Board of Zambia (EBZ) as saying in its
April 2000 report on the exporter audit 1999 that the country's
overall exports to the EU region had increased by about 10 percent
in the period under review.
</P>
<P>
EU was the largest market for non-traditional exports (NTEs),
accounting for about 38 percent or 117,000 U.S. dollars of the
total NTE earnings.
</P>
<P>
The largest market in the EU region was the Netherlands
accounting for 34.61 percent of the total EU exports. The products
to this market included cut-flowers, live fish and wet-blue
leather, EBZ said.
</P>
<P>
The United Kingdom (UK) was the second largest market in the EU
region, accounting for 31.86 percent, followed by Germany for
18.17 percent. The main items of Zambia's exports to the UK
included speciality vegetables, cotton yarn and cut flowers.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, COMESA was the second largest regional
market for Zambia's exports in the year under review and accounted
for 26.88 percent of the total NTE earnings.
</P>
<P>
The principal export products in 1999 to the region included
sugar, petroleum, maize, fresh eggs, chemicals, asbestos piping,
roofing sheets, electricity, cement and cotton, EBZ said.
</P>
<P>
It said South Africa is increasingly becoming an important
market for Zambia's electricity, scrap metal, cotton, soya beans,
gemstones, tobacco and chemicals.
</P>
<P>
However, the report noted that the overall total exports
earnings for 1999 including sugar and cobalt had reduced by 18.14
percent from 1998's 943 million dollars to 772 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The decline was attributed to the decline in production and
prices of copper and cobalt, the report said, noting that the
average price of copper had declined by 5.3 percent from 0.75
dollar per pound in 1998 to 0.71 dollar in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Rwandan Troops Accused of Planting Mines in Kisangani </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan Army Spokesman Phinehas
Katirima Monday accused Rwandan army of planting landmines to blow
up the Tchopo bridge in Kisangani, the scene of six days of
clashes between Ugandan and Rwandan troops recently.
</P>
<P>
"The wire connected to the battery that was to be used to
detonate the mines ended up in the Rwandan army defenses,"
Katirima told Xinhua, saying that it is a clear indication of the
Rwandan motives.
</P>
<P>
"Our positions were in north of the bridge and the wires
connecting the landmines to the batteries are south of the bridge
where the Rwandans were," he said.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Observer Mission in the Democratic Republic
of the Congo (DRC) has sent experts from Kinshasa to clear the
mines from the bridge and civilians have been stopped from using
it, according to sources here.
</P>
<P>
The situation is a bit complicated now with the entry of a
landmine war into this conflict, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan and Rwandan troops fought each other at the Tchopo
bridge in Kisangani, a northeast city of the DRC. The six-day
clashes, which started on June 5, killed 150 civilians and wounded
more than 1,000 others.

<P>
KAMPALA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program (WFP) has
sent a first consignment of 350 tons of maize meal to the
Kisangani station after receiving a request for 1,500 tons from
the WFP Kisangani mother office in Kinshasa, the New Vision
newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Food demands in Kisangani from international aid agencies have
increased sharply following the six-day clashes between Ugandan
and Rwandan troops in the northeast city of the Democratic
Republic of Congo, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"We have just been asked to increase the food dispatches to
Eastern Congo and we are organizing the food for them. Some of the
food is bought here and some is got from Mombasa," said Alvira
Ferreira, WFP Uganda head of Reporting Section.
</P>
<P>
"By our calculations, if given other supplements, 1,500 tons
should be enough for 100,000 people for about a month," she said,
adding that "somewhere at the end of last month they asked for 630
tons, so this request is a sharp increase."

<HEADLINE> Booming Tourism Threatens Mogao Grottoes: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DUNHUANG, (Gansu), June 19 (Xinhua) -- Fan Jinshi has devoted
half of her life to Dunhuang studies. After decades of working on
manuscripts and books and burying herself in archives, she is now
turning to computers to preserve the famous Mogao caves located in
northwest China.
</P>
<P>
The 62-year-old director of the China Dunhuang Studies
Institute envisages people being able to see the caves with the
help of CD ROMS and by doing so preserve some of the most precious
and priceless Buddhists artifacts in the world.
</P>
<P>
"Although the world's most advanced technology is being used to
protect the Mogao Grottoes, the caves are nonetheless
deteriorating amidst booming tourism in the area," said Fan.
</P>
<P>
This year marks the centennial anniversary of the discovery of
the Mogao caves located in Gansu Province along the trade route
known as the "Silk Road".
</P>
<P>
Huang said that over the past two decades, Chinese
archeologists have worked hard to protect the 492 well-preserved
caves, which have frescoes covering an area of 45,000 square
meters, more than 2,000 colored sculptured figures and five wooden
eaves overhanging the caves.
</P>
<P>
The institute is working hard on an engineering and ecological
project to curb desertification around the relic site.
</P>
<P>
With some 530,000 Chinese and foreign tourists visiting
Dunhuang last year, the density of carbon dioxide in the Mogao
caves increased, with the acid content in the air causing further
erosion.
</P>
<P>
"Our senior experts are shocked to see the accelerating erosion
of many rock paintings," Huang said. She cited a Tang Dynasty (618-
907 A.D.) inscription of the memoir of the building of the Mogao
Grottoes. It was clearly seen in the 1960s, but today it has
become blurred.
</P>
<P>
Huang's institute is working with local tourist authorities to
ensure that the caves are not inundated with tourists at any one
time.
</P>
<P>
Huang also expects that CD ROMS will help reduce the influx of
tourists into the caves because people can see the caves more
clearly on a computer than actually visiting the caves.

<P>
HEFEI, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Anhui Province in east China now can
provide 1.54 million tons of freshwater aquatic products a year,
increasing by more than 27 percent annually in the past seven
years.
</P>
<P>
The amount is 4.2 times the figure in 1993, the year the
province launched a project to help local peasants make money by
developing freshwater fishery.
</P>
<P>
The fishery sector alone generated an output value of 8.3
billion yuan in 1999, with a total of 17 million yuan paid in
fishery taxes.
</P>
<P>
The development of the fishery sector has greatly increased the
income of both local peasants and governments, according to
officials.
</P>
<P>
In Huoqiu County, the per capita income of local peasant
averaged 260 yuan last year. Other counties like Zongyang, Dangtu
and Susong earned more than 10 million yuan in annual revenue each
from the fishery industry.

<HEADLINE> Foreigner Found to Help Protect Chinese from Nanjing Massacre </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, June 19 (Xinhua) -- B. A. Sindperg, a Dane who worked
in Nanjing, capital of east China's Jiangsu Province, in the 1930s,
was among a group of foreigners who worked to protect Chinese
civilians during the Nanjing Massacre in 1937.
</P>
<P>
This was discovered by Gao Xingzu, professor of history with
Nanjing University while in an archive looking at material
concerning the Anti-Japanese War (1937-1945).
</P>
<P>
Sindperg was working at the Jiangnan Cement Plant on the
outskirts of Nanjing when war broke out.
</P>
<P>
Together with John D. Rabe, a representative of the Siemens
Company in Nanjing, and some other foreigners, Sindperg helped
pass on petitions of Chinese refugees to the Japanese Embassy in
China. He also tried to send several Chinese injured by Japanese
soldiers to hospitals in the city.
</P>
<P>
Gao said that several people are trying to locate the
whereabouts of Sindperg in Denmark and his family members.
</P>
<P>
Historical records indicate that at least 300,000 Chinese were
butchered and more than 20,000 women raped by Japanese invaders in
December 1937, known as the "the Rape of Nanking" or the "Nanking
Massacre".

<HEADLINE> GCC-Japan Trade Up in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The overall trade volume between
the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries and Japan rose by 4.6
percent in 1999 to 33.2 billion U.S. dollars, reported Monday's
Dubai based daily Gulf News.
</P>
<P>
The hike was mainly attributed to the rise in the price of crude
oil, the major commodity of Japanese imports from Gulf countries,
</P>
<P>
GCC-Japan trade constituted nearly 5 percent of Japan's world
trade in 1999 which amounted to 727.2 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Japan's exports to the GCC stood at 7.56 billion dollars in
1999, down by 22.7 percent from 9.78 billion dollars in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Japanese imports from the GCC surged by nearly 17 percent to
over 25.59 billion dollars in 1999, compared to 21.92 billion
dollars in 1998. Mineral fuels, including crude oil, petroleum
products, petroleum gas and other gaseous hydrocarbons, constituted
98 percent of the imports.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia emerged as Japan's largest trading partner among
the GCC in 1999, pushing previous No.1, the United Arab Emirates,
down to the second position. Japan's trade with all GCC countries
rose with the exception of Bahrain - which declined mainly due to a
70-percent fall in Japan's exports.
</P>
<P>
Bahrain is the only GCC country that does not export crude oil
to Japan.
</P>
<P>
The GCC, which groups six Gulf Arab countries, namely Saudi
Arabia, the UAE, Qatar, Bahrain, Oman and Kuwait, supplies nearly
71 percent of Japan's crude oil needs.

<HEADLINE> Arab Town May be Transferred Soon: Israeli Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli government is
considering carrying out a much postponed decision to transfer an
Arab town near Jerusalem to full Palestinian control later in the
week, Jerusalem Post quoted senior Palestinian sources as reporting
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The town, Abu Dis, may be handed over on Friday when the third
Israeli troop redeployment in the West Bank is to take place.
</P>
<P>
A Palestinian source indicated that the Israeli move may be
aimed at calming the atmosphere for U.S. special peace envoy Dennis
Ross' arrival on Thursday, and preparing the visit to the region by
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright by the weekend or next
week.
</P>
<P>
Albright is to seek a way out of the crisis in the Israeli-
Palestinian talks and "the Americans are trying to convince us to
accept a delay of the third withdrawal and there is talk that
Israel may transfer Abu Dis...but no decision has been taken yet,"
the source added.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has sought to delay the
redeployment and make it part of a framework accord for a final-
status agreement, but Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat insists that
Israel implement the withdrawal, mandated by the Sharm el Sheikh
peace deal signed last September, before signing a framework
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Officials in the Prime Minister's Office did not deny that
consideration is being given to handing over Abu Dis, which the
security cabinet decided in principle to do last month.
</P>
<P>
The transfer of Abu Dis has been postponed due to the violent
anti-Israel protests in the West Bank and Gaza Strip last month.
</P>
<P>
Israel would probably withdraw from Abu Dis to give the
impression that it is keeping its part of the bargain, another
Palestinian source said.
</P>
<P>
However, the source added, the gesture is long overdue and the
Palestinian side would continue to insist that Israel withdraw from
all the West Bank, except specified military locations, and land
left for the final-status, like borders, Jerusalem and settlements.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli security cabinet was presented on Sunday with a
gloomy picture of the negotiations with the Palestinians, as high-
level intelligence officials warned of possible future violence in
the West Bank if no progress was made in the talks.
</P>
<P>
Barak stressed during the cabinet meeting the importance of
holding a summit between himself and Arafat as soon as possible to
try to close the gaps.
</P>
<P>
Barak said he feels the Israeli-Palestinian peace march is
coming to its end and that the hour of real decision-making is
near.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the Palestinians signed the Oslo accord in 1993,
which underlined the principles for solving the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli delegation to the final-status talks with the
Palestinians, headed by Public Security Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami,
returned home on Monday after winding up their week-long talks in
the United States. No substantial progress was made during the
talks.

<HEADLINE> Australian Diplomat Stands for Lifting Sanctions Against Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The Australian diplomat formerly
in charge of disarming Iraq, Richard Butler, Monday argued that
continued sanctions against Iraq are a failure, but are deeply
harming its 22 million people.
</P>
<P>
Butler, who was head of the United Nations Special Commission
on Iraq (UNSCOM), said the Iraqi population was being hurt deeply
by the decade-old sanctions that no longer had any effect.
</P>
<P>
"They (the sanctions) are today a failure, but because they
still exist today, they are deeply harming 22 million people,"
Butler told the Australian National Press Club.
</P>
<P>
Butler, now a diplomat in residence at the Council of Foreign
Relations in New York, said he had not been able to criticize the
U.N. sanctions until he quit his UNSCOM post early last year.
</P>
<P>
Butler also attacked the U.S. missile defense shield program as
a mistake that would lead to a new way of nuclear weapon
proliferation.
</P>
<P>
"I think this is a disaster," he said.

<HEADLINE> 2 Killed, 7 Wounded in Shoot-out in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Two people were killed, seven
others wounded, when alleged rebels of the Moro Islamic Liberation
Front (MILF ) figured in a shoot-out with an army sergeant in
north Mindanao Sunday night, Philippine News Agency (PNA) said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Local police chief Bernardo Vasquez was quoted as saying that
the dead and wounded were all local residents.
</P>
<P>
The shoot-out occurred after 7:00 p.m. Sunday when local army
sergeant Valentin Caluton went home from a night duty, Vasquez
added.
</P>
<P>
Initial investigation disclosed that Caluton was attacked by
six unidentified "Maranaos" or local tribesmen who reportedly
mauled him while walking along a street in Cagayan De Oro city,
Misamis Oriental province in north Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Police said they could not ascertain the owner of the pistol
but were certain that the firearm was fired from an unknown gunman.
</P>
<P>
Investigators are not discounting reports about the possible
involvement of MILF rebels in the shoot-out since some witnesses
alleged that "Maranaos" are actually armed with high caliber
firearms such as M-16 and M-14 rifles.
</P>
<P>
This came after intelligence reports that a number of MILF
rebels who abandoned their camps in the Lanao provinces have taken
refuge with "Maranao" relatives in Cagayan de Oro, the PNA said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Economy to Grow by 4-4.5 Percent Next Year: Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesia's Central Bank (Bank
Indonesia) predicted here Monday that the country's economy will
grow by between 4 to 4.5 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a hearing with the House of Representatives (DPR)
Commission IX on state budget, finance and banking, Governor of
Bank Indonesia Syahril Sabirin said: "We predict that Indonesia's
economy in the year 2001 will grow by between 4 to 4.5 percent in
line with the economic growth in the medium term which is expected
to reach between 5 to 6 percent."
</P>
<P>
He believed that foreign investors' confidence will also
recover next year.
</P>
<P>
Sabirin also estimated that inflation rate in the year 2001
based on consumer price index will stand at the level of 5 to 7
percent.
</P>
<P>
"And the exchange rate of rupiah (Indonesian currency) will
stand at the level of 6,800 to 7,800 rupiah per U.S. dollar in the
year 2001," the governor said.
</P>
<P>
"The strengthening of the rupiah in the year 2001 is due to the
success of corporate debt restructuring program," he added.
</P>
<P>
Sabirin also predicted that crude oil price in the
international market will reach 18 to 19 U.S. dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
However, Minister of Finance Bambang Sudibyo predicted earlier
that crude oil price will reach 17 to 22 U.S. dollars per barrel
next year.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Sabirin urged the government "to realize the
social and political stability in order to attract foreign
investors back to Indonesia."

<HEADLINE> Girl Abducted, Raped for 5 Days in N. Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- A couple from a north Philippine
town has sought local police help for the arrest of three men who
abducted their 13-year old daughter and took turns in abusing her
for five days, Philippine News Agency (PNA) said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The call for help came from the couple living in a village of
Bayambang in Pangasinan province shortly after their daughter was
abducted in a local town Basista on June 8, the PNA said.
</P>
<P>
The couple sought the arrest of the three abductors, all
allegedly local residents of Bayambang, who reportedly dragged the
little girl to a waiting tricycle on June 8.
</P>
<P>
This allegedly happened at the tricycle parking area in Basista
from where the victim passed through on her way to the Basista
Public Market to buy a short pant.
</P>
<P>
The girl was found five days later in a third place called
Malasiqui, dazed and in a state of shock. Through the help of a
passer-by, she was able to return home.
</P>
<P>
The girl said the suspects also forced her to drink a liquid
placed in a soft drink which caused her to have abnormal feelings.
While in that state, her abductors repeatedly abused her.
</P>
<P>
The victim has been brought to the Pangasinan Provincial
Hospital by her parents where doctors confirmed her ordeal from
the hands of her abductors.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Bars Britain-Sponsored Election Observers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe has barred election
observers from Kenya and Nigeria who had apparently been planted
by Britain to subvert the ban by the government on the former
colonial power not to send observers, the daily Herald reported on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Britain was sponsoring 10 Kenyans and seven Nigerians who had
arrived in Zimbabwe as part of the European Union observer team to
this weekend's parliamentary elections, the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to Zimbabwean government officials, although the
observers of Kenyan and Nigerian nationalities had been travelling
on their own countries' documents, it had been discovered that
they were in Zimbabwe to observe the elections on behalf of
Britain.
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately clear whether the Kenyans and Nigerians
had left the country by Sunday afternoon, but a government
spokesman confirmed that the observers had been denied
accreditation.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe barred the British from
monitoring this weekend's polls, citing heightened tension between
the two countries over disagreements on Zimbabwe's land reform
process.
</P>
<P>
The president told Commonwealth Secretary-General Don Mckinnon
last month that "we will welcome any observer team, as long as
they don't include a single Briton."
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe will hold its fifth parliamentary elections on June 24
and 25.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Ready for Court Fight on Reparations for Kisangani War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Uganda is ready to go to court if
the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) files a case for
reparations following the Friday resolutions by the United Nations
Security Council, the New Vision reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Kinshasa has already taken us to court before. We are waiting
if they will file a fresh application after the Friday
resolutions," Attorney General Bart Katureebe was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council resolved that Uganda and Rwanda should pay
for the loss of life and the property damaged in the Kisangani
fighting.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan and Rwandan troops, based in the eastern part of the
DRC to support rival rebel factions fighting against the DRC
President Laurent Kabila, fought each other in the northeast
Congolese city of Kisangani.
</P>
<P>
The clashes, which started on June 5 and lasted six days,
killed150 civilians and wounded 1,114 others.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council also voted unanimously for a
resolution ordering all foreign forces to leave the DRC, but did
not set a deadline.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people in the Rwandan capital Kigali on Thursday
demonstrated against U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's proposal
to the Security Council to adopt a resolution calling on Rwanda
and Uganda to withdraw troops from the DRC, said the New Vision.
</P>
<P>
The Kinshasa government last year filed a case against Uganda
and Rwanda in the International Court of Justice in the Hague,
accusing the two countries of plundering its resources and killing
its citizens. Kinshasa asked for reparations and the withdrawal of
both countries' troops.

<HEADLINE> Dunhuang Studies Need Collaboration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DUNHUANG, (Gansu), June 19 (Xinhua) -- A famous Chinese expert
on Dunhuang studies,today stressed the importance of collaboration
in the research on the 100-year-old branch of learning in the new
millennium.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua, 84-year-old Duan Wenjie,
also honorary president of the Institute of Dunhuang Studies, said
materials and references that are still locked away in archives
will be no good to the development of Dunhuang studies.
</P>
<P>
"Murals, statues and cultural relics in the Sutras Cave at
Dunhuang are perfectly matched and embody the essence of Dunhuang
culture," said Duan, who has devoted more than 50 years to
studying the grottoes at Dunhuang.
</P>
<P>
Duan has copied 340 pieces of murals since he graduated from an
art school in 1945 and published a great number of academic papers
and books.
</P>
<P>
In 1900, a Taoist priest, Wang Yuanlu, discovered a cave at
Mogao Grottoes in Dunhuang which contained more than 50,000 sutras,
documents and paintings of nearly 10 dynasties from the 4th to the
11th century. The Mogao Grottoes was included by the United
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)
onto the World Heritage List in 1987.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 research organizations on Dunhuang Studies have
been built with a dozen universities and institutes in China. The
Institute of Dunhuang Studies located near the site of the
Dunhuang Grottoes, is the largest research organization on
Dunhuang Studies in China. It has 240 research fellows.
</P>
<P>
From July 29 and August 3, China will hold a series of grand
ceremonies in both Beijing and northwest China's Gansu Province to
mark the centenary of the discovery of the Sutras Cave and the
beginning of Dunhuang Studies.
</P>
<P>
A ceremony will be held in Gansu on July 29 to commend Chinese
and foreign individuals, including Duan Wenjie, and research
institutes and organizations which have made outstanding
achievements in Dunhuang Studies.
</P>
<P>
"I hope to see in my lifetime more Dunhuang cultural relics
abroad returned to China," said Duan, adding that he also hoped
that a well-equipped museum to be built to house and protect
cultural relics from Dunhuang.

SHANGHAI, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Retail sales in Shanghai amounted
to 13.96 billion yuan in May, a 13.3-percent rise from the same
month in 1999, according to Shanghai Municipal Statistics Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The increase is partly due to the week-long Labor Day holiday
and an international garment fair in the city from May 10-18.

A survey shows that 139 of the local supermarkets, department
stores, restaurants and food shops brought in 970 million yuan in

"Court verdicts records the full course of the trial and how
evidences was presented and analyzed," the spokesman said, noting
that "the public can see for themselves whether the court judgment
is fair or not once it is publicized."
</P>
<P>
Open court verdicts also help the public to understand the law,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Along with today's reform, the form of court papers is also
undergoing dramatic changes in this country, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
Judges used to announce that a judgment was made based on a
certain part of a certain article of a certain law, without even
citing the specific contents of the law. Court papers were just
three to five pages long in the past decades, and few people could
understand how the judgments were made.
</P>
<P>
But today, these papers have ballooned to 20 and 30 pages to
detail all the evidence, arguments and analysis included in the
trials, and are understandable to the general public, he said.
</P>
<P>
Sources say that today's publication of court verdicts
unprecedented in the history of the Supreme Court, with only one
exception: the full-text verdicts on the Lin Biao and Jiang Qing
counter-revolutionary cliques were published in the People's Daily
in 1981.

<P>
BEIJING, June 19 (Xinhua) -- For the first time in its history,
China's Supreme People's Court posted transcripts of its lengthy
court verdicts today on the Internet, in another move to further
open trials to the public and encourage public participation in
the legal process.
</P>
<P>
"As of today, the Supreme Court will select some of its court
verdict papers for publication in full every week," said Liu
Huisheng, SPC spokesman, at a press conference held here today.
</P>
<P>
The publication will be selective because some verdicts involve
privacy of litigants, especially women and minors, and others are
just judgments on procedural matters, in which the public "has no
interest," Liu said.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, court verdicts on the most
important and nationally-known cases will be published in the
national media, while other important and common cases will be
issued in government documents, and most of the typical cases will
be available on the Internet at www.court.gov.cn or www.rmfyb.com.
</P>
<P>
The first batch of six court verdicts had been posted on the
net by press time.
</P>
<P>
A special library has also been set up by the Supreme Court for
the public to look through all the publicized court papers.
</P>
<P>
According to law, court verdicts should be announced publicly,
but in practice this has been done for only the litigants and
their attorneys.

<HEADLINE> Fiji Trade Ban Counterproductive: New Zealand FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, June 19 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Foreign Minister
Phil Goff has warned a that a trade ban could entrench a racist
government in Fiji and expose Fijian-Indians to increased violence,
a Wellington-based newspaper, the Evening Post, reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Goff has called on New Zealand's Council of Trade Unions (CTU)
to stop plans to impose a trade ban on Fiji, saying the New
Zealand government "can not condone an action that is illegal."
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister noted trade bans on Fiji would be
counterproductive and more likely to hurt the people.
</P>
<P>
"The Fijian economy is on the verge of collapse and if it does
many people will lose their livelihoods, both low-income
indigenous Fijians and Indian-Fijians," Goff said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister noted that a trade ban on Fiji would also
jeopardize the economies of Tuvalu and Kirabati. The two island-
states, he added, ship most of their goods through Fiji.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, the CTU announced it will impose a seven-day cargo
bans on Fiji from Tuesday. In the announcement CTU President Ross
Wilson called on all New Zealand workers to refuse to handle goods
destined for or received from Fiji at all points of the production
and transport chain.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Goff has spoken to Wilson by phone and they
expect to meet to discuss the issue this week.

Chen now has started her own fast food take-out business. The
couple get up at 4:00 or 5:00 a.m. washing vegetables in the
morning and preparing for the next day's food late into the night.
They are satisfied though.
</P>
<P>
Chen said,"We don't have to worry much about money now." She
said the four-member family used to live on 700 yuan every month.
Besides food and daily necessities, the couple have to pay for
their son's tuition and medical charges of their father in his
eighties, who is now paralyzed in bed.
</P>
<P>
By starting her own business, their monthly income has
increased to about 2,000 yuan. "We wish to pay off the debt of
some 30,000 yuan to our relatives this year," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
According to the regulations, the loan acceptors have to pay
back the money on 24 terms within one year, with the interest rate
of about 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Guo is satisfied with the progress, saying that the project,
though small in size, is expected to give the Chinese government
some advice on how to help the laid-of workers, women in
particular, during the going-on nationwide campaign to bring many
State-owned enterprises out of debt.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has been continuing its efforts to aid
the laid-off people by opening training programs, seeking job
opportunities, distributing unemployment pensions and issuing the
lowest living standard insurance.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Ministry of Labor and Social Security shows
that 11.74 million people lost jobs last year in the State-owned
enterprises reform, and 4.92 million of them were re-employed
after taking specific skill training programs.

regarding personal hygiene among the public and improve sanitation
situations in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the National Sanitation Action Steering Committee

infectious diseases in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
A survey issued here Sunday by NSASC said about 28,000 children
die from diarrhea each year and Nepal bears the damage of about 10
billion rupees (144 million U.S. dollars) in this respect.

The survey identified lack of toilets, use of uncleaned toilets
and unsafe drinking water as some of the reasons for deaths of
thousands of Nepalese children.

It said 80 percent of Nepalese do not use toilets and 80
percent of communicable diseases are caused by unsafe drinking
water.

<P>
TIANJIN, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Chen Meirong, a laid-off woman in
north China's port city of Tianjin, had never given a thought that
she could have connection with the United Nations when she was 48
years old.
</P>
<P>
With the 4,000 yuan (about 480 U.S.dollars) in small loans from
the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) six months ago, Chen
has been self-employed after two years' staying at home.
</P>
<P>
Guo Ruixiang, a UNDP official, said the project, carried out by
the All-China Women's Federation (ACWF), is the result of a joint
effort by three parties, UNDP, Australian Agency for International
Development, and the Chinese government. It is expected to use
circulation funds of 900,000 U.S. dollars to help re-employ 1,800
Chinese laid-off women.
</P>
<P>
Ma Jinping, an official with the ACWF Tianjin Branch, said
Tianjin has been selected as China's only experimental city as it
is the largest industrial city in north China. The number of women
layoffs account for 30 percent of some three million laid-of
workers in the municipality, Ma said.
</P>
<P>
According to Ma, 118 applicants have been chosen in Tianjin so
far, all of whom are between 25 to 50 years old. It is hard for
them to be re-employed due to their low educational level and
scant technical skills. Moreover, it is usually the women in China
to take care of the whole family.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Sees No Immediate Threat to Apparel Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The government of Bangladesh held
the view that an immediate threat to the country's apparel export
to the United States is unlikely, the Independent newspaper
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
It was feared that the country's garment exports to the United
States might be badly affected due to the passage of the "Trade
and development Act of 2000" in the U.S. Congress last month
providing easy trade facilities to 48 sub-Saharan African,
Caribbean and Central American states.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a senior official of the Ministry of Commerce
as saying that there might not be an immediate threat to
Bangladesh apparel exports to the United States since only eight
of those 48 countries produce ready-made garments (RMG) while
others are yet to develop infrastructure for such industry.
</P>
<P>
"The total RMG produced by those eight countries are much below
that of ours," the official said.
</P>
<P>

<P>
BANGKOK, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Thailand has initiated a website
to provide anti-crime information to the general republic, and
hopes it will help nab more criminals, the Bangkok Post reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Thanks to the internet, we now can use the website in
garnering public participation in law enforcement," Thai Police
General Nathathorn Prousunthorn, the webmaster of the site, was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Public participation through the website "http:// www.
specialcrime.go.th/" is hoped to be a means of cornering crime
suspects, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Big-time criminals are not the only ones targeted by the
website," the police official remarked, "lost passports and
registered boats are also posted in it."
</P>

Besides serving the public, the website is part of a larger
program to create a database server for the police force, he added.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Taliban Close Militant Camps: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Responding to increasing
pressure from outside, Afghanistan's ruling Taliban have closed
down three military training camps and placed new restrictions on
Arabs associated with Saudi exile Osama bin Laden, a report here
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Local newspaper The News quoted Pakistani officials as saying
that Mullah Abdul Akhund, Taliban's interior minister, ordered the
immediate closure of the camps following his visit to Islamabad in
mid-May.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,300 militants from the banned Harakatul Mujahideen,
a group involved in the movement of the independence of Kashmir,
and many Arabs were ordered to vacate the Riskor military garrison,
25 kilometers to the south of the Afghan capital of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
The garrison, once housing the seventh division of the Afghan
army, served as the largest military training camp for radical
Arabs and other groups, The News said.
</P>
<P>
Two other camps, including one at Kargha, some eight kilometers
to the northwest of Kabul and a relatively smaller training
facility, were also ordered to close down.
</P>
<P>
"We have verified now that all the three camps have been closed
down," an anonymous senior Pakistani official was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani sources said the Taliban militia had suffered
immensely from international sanctions imposed on Afghanistan last
November for its refusal to hand over Osama bin Laden, who is
suspected of being the mastermind behind the deadly 1998 bombings
of American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Pressure was exerted through Pakistan which faced repeated
calls to use its influence over the Taliban to close down "
terrorist training camps" in Afghanistan.

BANGKOK -- Thailand will likely record the highest rate of
retail sales growth in Southeast Asia in the second half of this
year, the Bangkok Post reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Fueled by the economic recovery, retail sales in Thailand are
likely to rise by 15 percent from the same period of last year to
126.5 billion baht (3.24 billion U.S. dollars), Suthichart
Chirathivat, president of the Thailand Retailers' Association, was
quoted as forecasting.
</P>
<P>
He based his forecast on talks with presidents of retailers'
associations in the region, where most consumers are continuing to
restrict their purchases because of economic difficulties. (

ISLAMABAD -- Pakistan's Finance Minister Shaukat Aziz said
Sunday the government has decided to deregulate the furnace oil
imports and the prices of Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG).
</P>
<P>
With this decision the private sector will be allowed to freely
import and distribute furnace oil, he said at the post-budget
press conference here.
</P>
<P>
He said the price of LPG will be deregulated from September
2000 with the commencement of production in the PARCO Refinery
that would add 450 tons of LPG to the existing supplies of 540
tons in the market.
</P>
<P>
With this development Pakistan might be in a position to export
LPG, as the expanded supplies would be more than the local demand.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Denies ILO's Accusation of Forced Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Official newspaper The New Light of
Myanmar Monday denied the accusation of the International Labor
Organization (ILO) that there is forced labor in the country,
arguing that it is called "contribution of voluntary labor."
</P>
<P>
The denial came four days after the International Labor
Conference (ILC) passed an unfavorable resolution regarding
Myanmar's labor issue last Wednesday at its 88th session held in
Geneva, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
The article emphasized the need not to lose sight of various
aspects, gaps and ownership levels due to the differences existing
between one country and another in trying to accept the
globalization concepts and aspirations.
</P>
<P>
It said that each country has its own rights fully to maneuver
within the framework of its sovereign powers to practice flexible
policies in following the development trend without any dictates
from outside.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar government rejected the resolution passed on
Wednesday by the current session of the ILC, affirming that there
are no practices of forced labor in the country.

<HEADLINE> Reactions to Sri Lankan Rebels' New Thinking Mixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Tamil Tiger rebels'
new thinking to have a independent state shared by Tamils and
Muslims received mixed reactions in the country, officials said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Tamil United Liberation Front Leader Annadasagari told Xinhua
that rebels' latest attempt to woo the Muslims in Sri Lanka's
Eastern Province is a "good sign."
</P>
<P>
Annadasagari, who is a member of Parliament, said that "Muslims
have been pushed out from the areas and are not allowed to live
together with the Tamils in North and the East. But, now with this
change of attitude of the LTTE , both the Tamils and the Muslims
can live together."
</P>
<P>
The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels, fighting a
17-year war against the government to carve out a separate Eelam
or state for minority Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and east, last
week distributed a leaflet in an attempt to woo the Muslims living
in the province.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has a population of 19 million, of which the majority
Sinhalese constitute 74 percent while Tamils and Muslims
constitute 18 and 8 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE calls on Muslims to be vigilant against a campaign to
foment divisions between them and the Tamil people in the east.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE leaflet said that Muslims need not be concerned about
"the imminent war of liberation that is soon to engulf the east."
</P>
<P>
"Tamil Eelam belongs to the Muslim and Tamil people," it said.
</P>
<P>
However, a senior member of Parliament of the Sri Lanka Muslim
Congress, who requested not to be named due to threats for his
life, brushed off the LTTE's attempt as a mere tactic.
</P>
<P>
"Muslims are not for Eelam. It is a tactic by the LTTE to woo
the Muslims before the referendum," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lankan government reached an agreement with the main
opposition United National Party (UNP) last week that referendum
would be the means of deciding whether the currently merged North-
East Province should be merged as one province or should be
separated.
</P>
<P>
The referendum will be conducted in the Batticaloa and
Trincomalee districts where a considerable number of Muslims live.
</P>
<P>
A.H.M. Azwer, a Muslim member of Parliament in UNP, did not see
the new signals of the LTTE as very welcome to the Muslims of Sri
Lanka.
</P>
<P>
"Muslims live in the entire island peacefully. Let our future
not be jeopardized by these things," he said.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Lags Behind Rivals in IT Economy: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's efforts to develop a
knowledge-based economy and apply new telecommunications
technologies lag behind those of other members of the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the Bangkok Post Monday quoted
Thai Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda as saying.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to Thailand Retailers' Association on Sunday, Tarrin
said supporting development of information technology is crucial
for the country to maintain global competitiveness in the "new
economy."
</P>
<P>
"We must give priority to this issue, just as 100 years ago
when Thailand first began to lay tracks for the country's rail
network," he said, adding "Development of the Internet and
communications links will form a critical piece of the country's
infrastructure for the future."
</P>
<P>
According to the National Electronics and Computer Technology
Center, Thailand has only 16.7 computers per 1,000 people,
compared with 42.8 in Malaysia, 131.7 in South Korea and 216.8 in
Singapore. Internet usage in Thailand is also far behind that in
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Tarrin said that Internet would lead to new businesses and
industries, affecting companies not only in e-commerce, but also
in financial and supply management.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government has moved to set up a legal infrastructure
to support e-commerce and electronic payments. Other measures are
in place to lower telecommunications costs within the country.
</P>
<P>
As Thailand emerges from the economic crisis which began three
years ago, Tarrin said it is crucial for policy makers to look to
the future.
</P>
<P>
Tarrin said the government expected the economic growth this
year to be at 4.5 to five percent, compared with 4.2 percent last
year.
</P>
<P>
Still, he said, the economy would require at least another year
before recovering to pre-crisis levels.

<HEADLINE> Head of InterAction Council Slaps NATO for Operation in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the InterAction
Council Malcolm Fraser strongly condemned here Sunday the
operation launched in Kosovo by the U.S.-led NATO last year as an
ironical scheme.
</P>
<P>
Fraser, former Australian Prime Minister, made the condemnation
at the opening ceremony of the 18th annual meeting of the
InterAction Council, an organization of former heads of state and
government.
</P>
<P>
He noted that before NATO's military intervention in Kosovo, a
Yugoslav province plagued by ethnic problems, the number of
refugees in the region was only 70,000. But it rose to 1.2 million
at the end of the war, and 90 percent of the killed were civilians.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led western military bloc launched an airstrike
against Yugoslavia from March to June last year, wantonly bombing
the Balkan country for 78 days and destroying countless civilian
buildings and lives.
</P>
<P>
Also speaking at the meeting, Vice Chairman of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference Song Jian echoed
Fraser's view on Kosovo. He pointed out that the Kosovo war NATO
launched under the excuse of "safeguarding humanism" actually
brought about the biggest catastrophe of humanism in Europe since
the end of the Second World War.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the end of the war has not eased ethnic conflicts
in Kosovo still tormented by prominent refugee problems and has
far from achieved peace and stability in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
This well proves that bombs cannot produce peace, Song said.
Any attempt to dominate the international affairs and build a
single-polar world in its own interest by any country with its
strong economic and military power would threaten the world peace
and security and trample on international norms.
</P>
<P>
Finnish Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen also spoke at the opening
ceremony of the three-day meeting attended by nearly 50 former
heads of state and government and other VIPs from over 20
countries.

<HEADLINE> More Peacekeeping Force Soldiers Fall Ill in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, June 18 (Xinhua ) -- The North Atlantic Treaty
Organization's bombing in Yugoslavia last year has caused serious
environmental contamination there, which is "paying off" the NATO-
led peacekeeping force and members of the U.N. Mission in Kosovo,
the Yugoslav news agency Tanjug said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The news agency published an article Sunday, saying that lead
was found in the blood of a Danish soldier after he suddenly lost
consciousness last week. Doctors deemed that there was no doubt
that it was caused by chemical and nuclear radiation pollution
from the NATO bombing.
</P>
<P>
The article accused the U.N. Mission and international
humanitarian organization in Kosovo of trying to hide the facts
that more and more soldiers in the peacekeeping force have
suffered from diseases caused by contamination.
</P>
<P>
NATO dropped about 31,000 depleted uranium bombs in Kosovo last
year, 10 times more than that in other Yugoslav areas, according
to NATO figures.

BERLIN, June 18 (Xinhua)-- Berlin municipal police smashed an
international cocaine trafficking ring here Sunday during a
coordinated operation with their French counterparts.
</P>
<P>
About 90 policemen made 12 arrests and seized 10 kilograms of
cocaine, worth 1 million Marks (about 0.5 million U.S. dollars),
when they stormed 18 residential houses and stores, police sources
said.
</P>
<P>
Under arrest were Lebanese, Turkish Kurds and three Germans,
two of them being women aged between 19 and 24. Several vehicles
used for transporting drugs were also confiscated during the
operation.
</P>
<P>
After the preliminary interrogation, the police have linked
the case to a public security company in Berlin, which provides
security services to big shots from Arab countries. The director
of the company, a 28-year-old Lebanese agent, is suspected to be
the hidden organizer.
</P>
<P>
The drugs, believed to have originated from South America, were
put in a suitcase and brought here from Paris by a German staff of
the company last night.

<HEADLINE> Woods Wins Open with Records </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Tiger Woods won the 100th U.S.
Open in Pebble Beach, california, on Sunday by 15 strokes in the
most lopsided triumph in major championship golf history.
</P>
<P>
Woods fired a final-round score of four-under-par 67 for a 12-
under 272 total to put a magnificent finishing touch in the
tournament.
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old Woods tied the Open mark for low total score,
broke the record for lowest score in relation to par and the mark
for widest margin of victory in the most complete rout ever seen
in major golf.
</P>
<P>
The victory brought 800,000 U.S. dollars to Woods, the all-time
leading money winner in golf.
</P>
<P>
Two-time Open champion Ernie Els of South Africa and Spain's
Miguel Angel Jimenez finished tied for faraway second at three
over par.
</P>
<P>
The previous widest margin of victory in the history of the
majors was 13 strokes, set by Tom Morris Sr. at the 1862 British
Open in Prestwick, Scotland.
</P>
<P>
In an Open championship where no other player even matched par
the tournament, Woods finished four strokes better than the
previous record for best score in relation to par.
</P>
<P>
The original mark of eight under par had been shared by Jack

<HEADLINE> Foreman's Daughter Makes Boxing Debut with Knockout Victory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Freeda Foreman, daughter of
former heavyweight champion George Foreman, floored her opponent
with the first punch she landed, then knocked her out at 1:44 of
the second round in her boxing debut.
</P>
<P>
Her father refused to attend the bout in Las Vegas as he did
not want his daughter to begin a boxing career. He offered her 15,
000 U.S. dollars - the same amount as the purse for her first bout
- not to go into the ring.
</P>
<P>
Foreman, a 23-year-old former UPS worker from Greenville, South
Carolina, did not cash the check but went ahead Sunday as a pro at
Regent Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
She knocked down LaQuanda Landers, a hairdresser from Milwaukee,
with a looping left in the opening seconds of the fight.
</P>
<P>
Landers, who also had not fought as a pro, was no match for
Foreman, who was hit only a couple of times before she trapped
Landers on the ropes in the second round and began pounding her.
Landers crumpled to the canvas and was counted out.
</P>
<P>
Foreman weighed 82 kilograms for the light heavyweight bout,
scheduled for four rounds of two minutes each, and Landers weighed
76 kilos.
</P>
<P>
In another debut by the daughter of a former heavyweight
champion, Maria Johansson of Sweden fought bravely but was
battered in a split decision loss to Karrie Frye, of LaPorte,
Indiana, in their super middleweight bout.
</P>
<P>
Johansson, a teacher and former bouncer whose father is Ingemar
Johansson, dropped to her knees after receiving an overhead right
in the second round. But Johansson, a 34-year-old mother of two,
regained her feet and was competitive the rest of the four-round
bout.
</P>
<P>
Two judges gave Frye the bout by scores of 39-36 and 40-35,
while one judge favored Johansson 38-37.
</P>
<P>
Johansson had her nose bloodied in the second round and had a
number of welts on her face by the end of the fight with Frye.
</P>
<P>
Johansson weighed 76 kilos while Frye 75 kilos.

<HEADLINE> Six Ethnic Gene Banks Established in Northeast China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Six ethnic gene banks have been
established in the Harbin Medical Sciences University in northeast
China's Heilongjiang Province.
</P>
<P>
The genes of six ethnic minority groups including the Mongolian
and the Xibo are currently frozen in liquefied nitrogen at minus
273 degrees Celsius, awaiting for deciphering.
</P>
<P>
The gene banks are set up to preserve genes of the ethnic
minority groups so that scientists may have the opportunity to get
to know the secrets behind some special anti-disease genes in such
ethnic groups and find a cure for such diseases someday, said Li
Pu, a professor on genetics in the university.
</P>
<P>
Such banks are necessary since those special genes of Chinese
ethnic minority groups are gradually disappearing as more and more
most ethnic minority people marry into other ethnic groups, he
explained.
</P>
<P>
"Once needed for research, the original genes could be
reactivated and duplicated," Li said.
</P>
<P>
Li added that his university also plans to provide 50 sample
cells for an international gene bank so that it might purchase
sample cells of foreign ethnic groups someday for research.

BEIJING, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The following are the major
national news Xinhua released from June 10 to June 18:
</P>
<P>
--Singaporean Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew arrived in Beijing
to pay a working visit to China at the invitation of the Chinese
government. During his stay, Lee attended Conference 2000-21st
Century Forum sponsored by the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference National Committee.
</P>
<P>
This year marks the 10th anniversary of Sino-Singaporean
diplomatic ties. Chinese President Jiang Zemin said at his meeting
with Lee that he hopes the two countries will take this
opportunity to push forward the mutually-beneficial cooperation
between the two countries in various fields.
</P>
<P>
-- The dam of the Yigung Lake in the Nyingchi Prefecture of
Tibet Autonomous Region breached, seriously damaging roads and
bridges in areas at the lower reaches of the lake.
</P>
<P>
No casualty has been reported due to precautionary evacuation
of local residents, local sources said.
</P>
<P>
The breach was caused by surging water level as a result of
piled-up mud and stones in the lake from the landslide of a nearby
mountain in April.
</P>
<P>
-- By drilling three keyhole-size holes on the patient's right
chest, Chinese doctors have successfully conducted non-thoracotomy
surgery to treat auricular septal defects, a common congenital
heart disease. The doctors inserted a thoracoscope through the
hole with a less than one centimeter in diameter to guide a
blockade device into the cardiac atriums.
</P>
<P>
-- A 36-year-old hacker was sentenced to death by the Ningbo
Intermediate Court in east China's Zhejiang Province for
embezzling over one million yuan of public money from a bank
account. A senior official said that this is the most severe
punishment that a Chinese judicial organization has given to a
hacker.
</P>
<P>
-- China's financial sector continued its momentum of smooth
operation in the first five months of this year, with banking
loans increasing at a faster step and corporate deposits
registering marked increases.
</P>
<P>
Statistics released by the People's Bank of China (PBOC), the
country's central bank, shows that by the end of May, the
outstanding amount of loans by all financial institutions stood at
9.6175 trillion yuan (about 1.23 trillion U.S. dollars), up 13.9
percent from the same period last year in constant terms.

<HEADLINE> Ministry Set to Curb Locust Plague </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Saturday, locusts had swarmed over 3.66 million hectares of
mostly uncultivated land in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and
nine other provinces and municipalities including Henan, Shandong,
Hebei and Tianjin, today's China Daily quoted the ministry's
statistics as saying.
</P>
<P>
China, whose earliest locust disasters date back more than 2,
700 years, has accumulated enough experience and expertise to
eradicate locusts, said Zhu Enlin, division director of the
National Agro-Technical Extension and Service Center under the
ministry.
</P>
<P>
So far, eight crop-dusting aircraft and 50,000 people have
sprayed insecticide on 800,000 hectares of land, and the ministry
has urged localities to destroy locusts in their breeding areas
and stop them from migrating to farmlands.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural experts said that they are ready to wage
biological warfare against locusts. Metarhizium-flavoviride, a
kind of epiphyte, will be favored over chemical pesticides.
</P>
<P>
The epiphyte grows as a parasite in locusts' bodies, absorbing
their nourishment until the insects die, said Zhang Zehua, a
researcher with the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhu, lack of funds may hinder eradication efforts.
About 30 million yuan (3.61 million US dollars) has been allocated
for this summer's locust prevention work. However, another 30
million yuan (3.61 million US dollars) is still needed.

U.S. plans to deploy a national missile defense(NMD) system by
2005, including doubts whether interceptors can yet distinguish
between armed warheads and decoys, The Washington Post reported.
</P>
<P>
The report was given to Defense Secretary William Cohen last
week by an independent panel headed by retired General Larry Welch,
former Air Force chief of staff, the newspaper said in Sunday
editions.
</P>
<P>
It questioned the current maturity of the technology, raising
concerns about the problem of dummy decoys launched with attacking
missiles, and about pressure from the U.S. Congress for fast-track
2005 deployment of a yet-unproved system. (US-Pentagon-Missile

<HEADLINE> Former Japanese PM Takeshita Dies at 76 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Former Japanese Prime Minister
Noboru Takeshita died of respiratory failure at 00:53 local time
Monday (1553 GMT Sunday) at a Tokyo hospital, Kyodo News reported.
He was 76.
</P>
<P>
Takeshita, a member of the House of Representatives for the
ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), served as Japan's prime
minister from 1987 to 1989.
</P>
<P>
A native of Shimane Prefecture, western Japan, Takeshita had
been elected to the House of Representatives 14 times.
</P>
<P>
The English-teacher-turned-politician began his political
career as a member of the Shimane prefectural assembly in 1951 at
the age of 27. In 1958, he debuted in national politics at 34,
winning a seat in the lower house as an LDP member.
</P>
<P>
He became a political heavyweight in 1964, when he was chosen
deputy chief cabinet secretary in the first cabinet of late Prime
Minister Eisaku Sato.
</P>
<P>
Takeshita continued to exert a strong influence on Japanese
politics long after he resigned as Japanese prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Takeshita had been hospitalized since early April last year
with spondylitis.
</P>
<P>
Following the sudden hospitalization of the late Japanese Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi on April 2, Takeshita said on May 1 in a
tape-recorded message that he would not seek reelection in the
upcoming general election for the lower house and retire from
politics.

OTTAWA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Germany's Michael Schumacher won
his fourth victory in the Canadian Grand Prix and his fifth of the

Coulthard, who started second on the 22-car grid, stayed with
Schumacher early. He stopped on lap 14, falling out of contention
and leaving Schumacher more than 17 seconds ahead of local
favorite Jacques Villeneuve, who had made a sensational start,
moving from sixth to third in the first turn of the race.

Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Castroneves, the seventh different winner in seven FedEx

Juan Montoya went out with a broken driveshaft on the 62nd lap of
the 84-lap race and steadily pulled away over the 3.7-kilometer,
14-turn road course.
</P>
<P>
It was the fourth time this season that Montoya, the
sensational Colombian who won the points series as a rookie last
year and took the Indianapolis 500 last month, has been unable to
finish.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Paul Tracy, this season's points leader going into the
Detroit race, was pulled from the competition late in the race for

TIANJIN, June 19 (Xinhua) -- This north China port city has
basically completed the construction of a new harbor area covering
five sq. km.
</P>
<P>
The project involved a total investment of two billion yuan (
about 360 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The area has berths for petrochemicals, coke, non-metallic ore
and coal, and 12 warehouses.
</P>
<P>
The new harbor area will have a handling capacity of 20.5
million tons of cargo when it is completed next year.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Chongqing Discourages dumping Bone Ashes in River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The government of this
municipality in southwest China has appealed to its citizens not
to dump bone ash into the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
"Bone ash pollutes the river," said Zeng Guangming, a civil
affairs official with the municipal government.
</P>
<P>
Zeng said that although dumping of bone ash into the sea or
rivers is a form of burial advocated by the central government to
save wasting arable land, it is not suitable in Chongqing, which
is at the lower end of the 600-km-long Three Gorges Reservoir,
which is now under construction.
</P>
<P>
The reservoir will store water and generate electricity by the
year 2003, when the speed of the current will slow down, making it
easier for pollutants to stagnate in the world's third-largest
river.
</P>
<P>
The official said that it should be quite satisfactory to bury
bone ash under trees or place urns in towers.
</P>
<P>
He urged Chongqing citizens to follow the example of the city
of Harbin in northeast China, where a number of people have
sprayed bone ash of their deceased relatives over flower beds.

<HEADLINE> Red Tide Hits Zhejiang Fisheries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Infestation of red tide over the
past few weeks has dealt a heavy blow to the fisheries industry in
east China's Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
Dead fish, shrimps, crabs and clams can be seen all along the
coast, and the economic losses are said to be in the millions of
dollars.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the East China Sea Monitoring Center affiliated
with the State Oceanic Administration said that the scale of the
red tide this year has been unprecedented.
</P>
<P>
The red tide, which manifested itself from May 3, was formed by
Prorocentrum dentatum and Prorocentrum minimum, both poisonous
substances.
</P>
<P>
Fisheries departments in the province have urged people to
control the flow of sea water to breeding ponds.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang has traditionally been vulnerable to red tides,
oceanographers said. In 1993 and 1997, the province reported 132
red tide sightings, ranking first in all coast provinces of China.
</P>
<P>
A 1993 red tide caused an economic loss of 385 million yuan (
about 45 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Researchers have appealed to the government to tighten
monitoring of red tides using both boats and satellite systems.

<HEADLINE> Survey: Split Up Shows No Impact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The order for the breakup of the
Microsoft by a United States federal court last week had little
impact on Chinese computer users' choices for hardware and
software, a survey conducted by an independent market researcher
in Beijing has indicated.
</P>
<P>
And many of those surveyed believed splitting up the giant
software manufacturer would be conducive to creating a fair market
competitive environment, today's China Daily quoted a report by
the Beijing Consumer Research Co. as saying.
</P>
<P>
The survey, based on inquiries from 109 persons in China's
information technology industry, found that 56 percent favored US
District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's order to split Microsoft
into two companies.
</P>
<P>
Only one-fifth of those surveyed opposed the breakup, while the
rest took a wait and see attitude.
</P>
<P>
Seventy-six percent of the respondents said that Microsoft had
monopolistic power in the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, a high-ranking official from Microsoft China said
that the judicial ruling will not produce any impact on its
Chinese business in the near future.

<HEADLINE> New Technology to Make Yangtze River Clear Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The recent invention of nitrogen
fixation for trees has made it possible for the muddy Yangtze
River to become clear again.
</P>
<P>
The 8-year Experiments have shown that shelterbelts of three-
year-old nitrogen fixation trees can reduce soil erosion by 98
percent, according to Prof. Chen Keming of the Chengdu Biological
Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
The branches and leaves of the trees can be used as green
manure or forage. One ha of nitrogen fixation plants, for example,
can produce 10 tons of high-quality green manure annually.
</P>
<P>
With this technology, local soil erosion can be effectively
brought under control, and the Yangtze River will become clear
again, as soil erosion on the upper reaches of the Yangtze is the
major cause of the turbidity of its water, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
"It is a practical technology that involves less investment
while bringing more benefits," he said, adding that farmers would
be likely to accept the new technology as it can better preserve
soil and raise their incomes.
</P>
<P>
Now, the invention has been put into use in some counties of
Sichuan Province, where the institute has set up a base of 4,000
ha of nitrogen fixation plants.
</P>
<P>
"If the technology is applied to the 11 million ha of slopes
along the upper reaches of the Yangtze, the river will be safe
from soil erosion," Chen said.

LONDON, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Australian Lleyton Hewitt defeated
six times Wimbledon champion Pete Sampras of the United States 6-4,
6-4 to win the London grass court men's tennis tournament on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian, nine years younger than Sampras, has announced
himself as a serious contender for Wimbledon after the victory.
</P>
<P>
"I got off to good start and that's the best I've ever returned.
</P>
<P>
"It was fantastic. Not to drop a set (all tournament) is great
preparation going into Wimbledon. I was seeing the ball out there
like a football," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sampras struggled on his forehand and had no answer as Hewitt
out-aced him nine to five and produced some wonderful service
return winners.
</P>
<P>
It was Hewitt's fourth ATP title of the year, his sixth in all,
and gave him revenge for his three-set loss against Sampras, whom
he had never previously beaten, in the Queen's semifinals last
year.

<P>
LONDON, June 18 (Xinhua) -- American doubles specialist Lisa
Raymond defeated Tamarine Tanasugarn of Thailand to win the
Edgbaston women's tennis tournament in Birmingham on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Raymond, who dismissed third seed Jennifer Capriati and top
seed Nathalie Tauziat, beat the Thai outsider 6-2, 6-7 and 6-4 in
the final.
</P>
<P>
The American cruised to the opening set in a flurry of aces but
let her concentration slip in the second as Tanasugarn, who
reached the fourth round at last year's Wimbledon, showed her
pedigree on the grass surface.
</P>
<P>
The number six seed eventually lost the set during a close
fought tie-break and received a code violation when she sent a
ball spiralling over in the grandstand in frustration.
</P>
<P>
The deciding set went with serve but Raymond's impressive
service game and mixed array of groundshots finally overcame the
determined Tanasugarn in the 10th game.
</P>
<P>
Despite a host of doubles triumphs, including last year's
Wimbledon mixed crown with Leander Paes, Raymond had previously
won only one singles tour title.

<HEADLINE> Popov Misses World Record in 100m Freestyle at Nationals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Russia's world and Olympic champion
Alexander Popov narrowly missed breaking a second world record in
two days at the national swimming championships here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Popov, who set the 50 meters freestyle world record of 21.64
seconds on Friday, clocked 48.27 in his 100m freestyle semi-final
heat, missing his own world mark of 48.21 set at the 1994 world
championships in Rome. Popov's performance showed he is close to
his top form in time for his third Olympics, in Sydney in
September.
</P>
<P>
But he stopped short of predicting he would break the 100m
record in Monday's final.
</P>
<P>
Popov won the 50m and 100m freestyle events at both the 1992
and 1996 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Roman Sludnov, who on Friday won the 100m breaststroke final
while setting a world record, added the 200m title with a time of
two minutes 12.26 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Dual 1996 Olympic butterfly champion Denis Pankratov had his
200m butterfly world record of 1:55.22 broken on Saturday by
American Tom Malchow who lowered it by four hundredths of a second
in Charlotte, North Carolina. And Pankratov was beaten into
second place by Anatoly Polyakov in the 200m final. Polyakov won
the race in 1:57.31, beating Pankratov by a full second.
</P>
<P>
Pankratov won both the 100m and 200m at the Atlanta Olympics.

<HEADLINE> Tyson Arrives in Britain for Second Bout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Former world heavyweight boxing
champion Mike Tyson arrived in London for his bout against fellow
American Lou Savarese in Scotland next week.
</P>
<P>
Wearing a black and white open necked shirt and dark trousers,
Tyson arrived on a Concorde flight from New York and had his
documents checked onboard the plane by immigration officials. A
car met him on the tarmac and took him to London, a Reuters report
said.
</P>
<P>
Tyson made no comment to reporters.
</P>
<P>
Under British immigration rules, anyone who has been convicted
of an offence that carries a jail sentence of more than 12 months
is refused entry unless there are "strong compassionate or
exceptional reasons" for the visit.
</P>
<P>
Tyson served three years in jail for rape.
</P>
<P>
The boxer was supposed to arrive in Britain on Wednesday but
delayed his departure to attend the funeral of a friend in New
York. He will stay in London for two days before moving north to
Scotland next Wednesday. He fights Savarese in Hampden Park
stadium, Glasgow, on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Tyson's low-key arrival was in marked contrast to the last time
he came to Britain earlier this year. On that occasion he was the
center of a scrum of media, fans and police.
</P>
<P>
"In the interest of public safety it was decided that we didn't
want a repeat of the scenes when he arrived earlier this year. So
both the police and airport authorities decided that he should be
driven straight from his plane," an airport official said.
</P>
<P>
The decision by police and officials meant that Tyson also
missed the delays that are hindering other travellers after a
computer glitch caused chaos on Saturday and Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In January, Tyson beat local boxer Julius Francis in four
minutes in front of a packed arena in Manchester.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Has Authority in Verifying Lebanese-Israeli Border: Annan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 18 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan
said here Sunday that it is the U.N. that has the authority to
verify the Lebanese-Israeli border, not the two parties involved.
</P>
<P>
Annan made the remark during a news conference with Egyptian
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa following their talks, in which they
discussed the Middle East peace process and the situation in
Lebanon, and other Mideast issues.
</P>
<P>
Verification of Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon and
certification of the move is the job of the U.N., not either party,
Annan said.
</P>
<P>
Annan said on Friday that Israel's May 24 withdrawal from south
Lebanon was complete under the U.N. Security Council Resolution
425. Lebanon, meanwhile, disputed the confirmation, insisting that
the Jewish state still occupies Lebanon in several areas.
</P>
<P>
Annan, however, played down the disagreement between the U.N.
and Lebanon, saying he would not describe it as a dispute. He
expressed hope that it was only a hiccup that will soon be
resolved.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said he had talked to Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss
before meeting Annan, and Cairo took Lebanon's position seriously.
</P>
<P>
But he voiced confidence that things will be further clarified
after Annan flies to Beirut on Monday and meets with Lebanon's
president, prime minister and senior officials.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the outcome would be very positive," he added.
</P>
<P>
Annan came to Egypt from Iran, the first leg of his ongoing
Mideast tour. After Lebanon, he will also travel to Jordan, Syria,
Israel and the Palestinian self-rule areas.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Tops Group C after Winning over Norway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Savo Milosevic scored his third
goal of Euro 2000 on Sunday in Liege, Belgium as Yugoslavia
defeated Norway 1-0 to top Group C.
</P>
<P>
It was Yugoslavia's first victory at the European championship
in 16 years.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic scored in the seventh minute, standing with his back
to goal and deflecting a low freekick from Ljubinko Drulovic into
the corner of the net.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav substitute Mateja Kezman was sent off a minute from
coming on for a late tackle on Erik Mykland in the 88th minute.
But even with a man down, Yugoslavia survived a Norwegian
challenge.
</P>
<P>
The win over the early group leaders, coupled with Spain's 2-1
defeat of Slovenia, left Yugoslavia top on four points with one
match against Spain to come.
</P>
<P>
Spain and Norway each has three, Slovenia one.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia, making five changes to their starting line-up,
looked a totally different side to the toothless team that was 3-0
down to Slovenia in the first 60 minutes of its opening match
before drawing 3-3.
</P>
<P>
With defender Sinisa Mihajlovic suspended after being sent off
against Slovenia, Yugoslavia revamped its highly suspect defence
with only fullback Miroslav Djukic retaining his place.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic, who came on as a second-half substitute against
Slovenia to score two goals, started and looked immediately lively
in the area.
</P>
<P>
He was back on the scoreseheet in the eighth minute with the
slightest of deflections off a Vladimir Jugovic free kick on the
right near the edge of the area.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia could have had more goals, with goalkeeper Thomas
Myhre tipping Predrag Mijatovic's shot over the bar and Milosevic
denied his second by Bjorn Otto Bragstad when his 17th minute shot
was blocked.
</P>
<P>
Norway, without injured captain Henning Berg, left Chelsea
striker Tore Andre Flo as its main striker and he always looked
dangerous without finding that final scoring touch that has eluded
him since October.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after half-time, Vladimir Jugovic came close with
a thunderous shot which was well saved and Mijatovic almost added
a second in the 50th minute. At this stage, it was Myhre who kept
Norway in touch.
</P>
<P>
Then Norway could have equalized once again when Flo, noticing
that Kralj is way out from his goal, broke away through the middle
but Djukic deflected the ball away from his foot in the last
moment.
</P>
<P>
Gradually however, the game degenerated into an ill-tempered
affair with crunching tackles and clashes of the head. Yellow
cards came flying, with six bookings in total.
</P>
<P>
Norway finally started relying on its superior physical
conditioning to launch a final onslaught. Substitute John Carew
came closest in the 90th minute but his tap past Kralj went just
wide.
</P>
<P>
"It was a fantastic victory, my players died on the pitch,
they fought all the way," Yugoslavia's coach Vujadin Boskov said.

<HEADLINE> England FA Concerned by UEFA Procedure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June (Xinhua) -- England's Football Association said
on Sunday it had concerns about how UEFA made its decision to warn
England it might be kicked out of Euro 2000 if hooliganism
continued, according to Spa, Belgium.
</P>
<P>
Most of the fans who caused the trouble in Belgium over the
past two days were "unknown" to the authorities, a senior FA
official said.
</P>
<P>
"Clearly we have significant concerns about the way events
today have unfolded," David Davies said.
</P>
<P>
No senior FA official was asked to attend the UEFA meeting,
Davies said. The FA's security adviser did attend the meeting but
he was asked no questions, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The question of how far the FA is responsible for so-called
fans ... is a matter we will seek to discuss at an urgent meeting
we will be requesting with (UEFA chief executive) Gert Aigner
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
"The vast majority of those causing problems were not
previously known to the authorities," said Davies.
</P>
<P>
Earlier UEFA threatened to kick England out of Euro 2000 on
Sunday following two days of street violence by hooligans in
Belgium and slammed the British government for failing to stop
them travelling abroad.

<HEADLINE> Statement of England FA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 18 (Xinhua) -- After UEFA's threat to throw
England out of Euro 2000 if its fans misbehave again, the Football
Association on Sunday issued a statement, read at a news
conference by executive director David Davies:
</P>
<P>
"The FA takes today's statement by UEFA very seriously indeed.
</P>
<P>
"More than anything else, we want to be part of a safe and
secure festival of football, similar to Euro 96 in England.
</P>
<P>
"Let us be absolutely clear straight away. We condemn utterly
and without reservation the actions of thugs and criminals we have
seen on our television sets, and some of you have seen in person,
in Brussels and in Charleroi.
</P>
<P>
"We know the British government shares in that condemnation.
Their response to today's statement by UEFA is for them.
</P>
<P>
"But as far as the FA is concerned, it is public knowledge
that we called for emergency legislation to remove passports from
potential troublemakers.
</P>
<P>
"We are bound to point out then that all the evidence
available suggests that the vast majority of those causing trouble
in Belgium this weekend were not previously known to the
authorities.
</P>
<P>
"The FA, as you know, has worked tirelessly to prepare for
this tournament. We have made all our resources available to our
opposite numbers in Belgium and Holland.
</P>
<P>
"We have restricted the sale of tickets to members of the
England Members' Club, all of whom are subject to official vetting.
They have played, as I'm sure you will agree, a significant part
in creating the excellent atmosphere in the stadia both in
Charleroi and Eindhoven.
</P>
<P>
"Kevin Keegan, our coach, has appealed, before we came here to
Belgium, for all supporters to recognize their responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
"His job tonight and tomorrow is to prepare the national team
for an absolutely crucial game for our country.
</P>
<P>
"But we repeat his appeal, that appeal, tonight, on behalf of
Kevin, on behalf of every single player who is here in Spa, and
particularly on behalf of English football.
</P>
<P>
"Clearly though, we have significant concerns about the way
today's events have unfolded.
</P>
<P>
"Neither our chairman, nor our chief executive, nor any other
senior FA employee attended today's UEFA meeting. Our security
adviser, Sir Brian Hayes, was invited to make a very brief
statement late in the proceedings but had no other input to the
discussion.
</P>
<P>
"He was asked no questions and was asked to leave before a
media statement was issued just minutes later.
</P>
<P>
"The issue of how far a football association is responsible
for so-called fans well away from any stadium _ something UEFA has
always rejected in the past _ is a matter that we will seek to
discuss at the urgent meeting we will be requesting with Gerhard
Aigner, the chief executive of UEFA, tomorrow."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Appeals Court Procedural Ruling Favors Microsoft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The federal appeals court here
Monday made a ruling in favor of Microsoft Corp. by rejecting a
request by the U.S. government that it stay out of the huge
antitrust case against the giant software maker.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Court of Appeals for Washington, D.C., in a second
victory for Microsoft, turned down a Justice Department motion to
summarily dismiss the company's requested stay of a federal judge'
s June 7 order to break it into two companies and restrict its
business practices.
</P>
<P>
The department had sought to have the appellate court bypassed
in the appeals process following U.S. District Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson's earlier this month. The department wants the
case sent directly to the Supreme Court for review.
</P>
<P>
The decision Monday thwarting that attempt was the latest in a
series of legal skirmishes between Microsoft and the government in
the wake of Jackson's order that Microsoft be split in two as a
remedy for violating antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
The appeals court Monday said the Justice Department now had 10
days to respond to its ruling on the stay request, after which
Microsoft would have seven days to reply.
</P>
<P>
But it cautioned that if Judge Jackson agreed to a government
request and sent the entire case directly to the U.S. Supreme
Court, the proposed schedule "would be automatically suspended."
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department issued a statement applauding that part
of the ruling.
</P>
<P>
"We're very pleased with the court's ruling that it would stay
further proceedings if the district court certifies the case for
direct appeal to the Supreme Court," said department spokeswoman
Gina Talamona.
</P>
<P>
Jackson postponed his split of Microsoft from taking effect
until the case makes its way through the appeals process. However,
the restrictions he ordered on company business practices would
start taking effect on September 5.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Microsoft asked the appellate court for a stay after
Jackson deferred a decision on a stay. On Thursday, Microsoft
filed a brief in the appellate court arguing that it was not
required to wait for Jackson's ruling.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the department told the federal appeals court that
Microsoft violated federal rules of procedure by asking it to stay
antitrust penalties before the trial judge ruled on the same
request.
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department has requested that Jackson send the case
directly to the Supreme Court, bypassing the appellate court,
which has reversed Jackson's decisions regarding Microsoft in the
past. The past record of the appellate court toward Microsoft is
the reason the software-maker maneuvered to get the case heard by
that court.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft said Monday it expects slower growth in sales and
operating margins in its 2000 fiscal year, partially as the result
of its legal battles with the government.
</P>
<P>
The company, in a document filed with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission, also cited stepped-up competition in its
traditional sectors.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Discovers New Oil Field </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, June 19 (Xinhua)-- A consortium of Colombian,
Brazilian and Canadian companies discovered a petroleum field with
reserves believed above 200 million barrels in Colombia,
President of Colombian Petroleum Company (Ecopetrol) Alberto
Calderon Zuleta said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"This is the third most important oilfield discovered in
Colombia in the last 20 years after Cusiana-Cupiagua and Cano
Limon, and removes possibilities of importing petroleum again,"
indicated the Ecopetrol official.
</P>
<P>
Ecopetrol is participating with a 50 percent of investments and
earnings from this oilfield; Petrobras of Brazil, with 25 percent;
and Canadian of Canada, with another 25 percent. Operator of the
Association's Contract is the Brazilian company.
</P>
<P>
Colombia produces nowadays 700,000 barrels per day (bpd), which
are the national economy's main product, with an income from
exports calculable for this year of high prices, at about 5
billion dollars. In 1999, production was 800,000 bpd.

<HEADLINE> CIS Defense Ministers Move to Expand Military Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The Commonwealth of Independent
States (CIS) defense ministers decided here Monday to strengthen
their nations' military cooperation by developing a unified air
defense system.
</P>
<P>
The CIS states unanimously agreed to enhance the commonwealth's
inner military cooperation, which is of strategic character,
Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev told a news conference
after a session of the Council of Defense Ministers of the CIS
here.
</P>
<P>
He said the ministers discussed the program on the development
of the military cooperation in the framework of the CIS by 2005
and agreed to unite their forces to cover "the arc of instability"
from the Pamir to the Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
The joint actions will be aimed at preventing weapons, drugs
and bandit groups from penetrating CIS countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
At Monday's session, Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov urged
CIS countries to pool their efforts to consolidate international
stability.
</P>
<P>
"Our coordinated actions have a special significance against
the background of a mounting new global challenge -- the danger of
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of
delivery," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The most topical task today is to strengthen international
strategic stability, the cornerstone of which is the 1972 Anti-
Ballistic-Missile treaty," Ivanov said. "This is the only
efficient way to counteract the peril of nuclear missile
proliferation without destroying the whole system of disarmament
accords."
</P>
<P>
"Russia has proposed a constructive alternative to the
unilateral undermining of the ABM treaty: establishing a European
system of non-strategic missile defense," he said, urging CIS
states to support this program.
</P>
<P>
He also called on CIS countries to jointly fight against
increasing threats of "various extremist forces and groups" and "
international terrorism."

<HEADLINE> Key Witness Talks of Detonation in Lockerbie Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAMP ZEIST, Netherlands, June 19 (Xinhua) -- An electronics
manufacturer on Monday admitted in court that his company had
fitted out briefcases with the gadgets for detonating bombs.
</P>
<P>
Edwin Bollier, owner of the Geneva-based electronics
manufacturer MEBO AG, told Scottish judges that his company had
converted Swiss Telekom and Motorola pagers into radio-controlled
detonators and secured them into the suitcases prepared to contain
bombs.
</P>
<P>
The man is a critical witness for prosecutors hoping to link
the two Libyan defendants to the mid-air bombing of the Pan Am
Flight 103 on December 21, 1988.
</P>
<P>
Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah are
accused of conspiracy for murder and breach of international
aircraft safety law.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution alleged that the two Libyan defendants had"
ordered and attempted to obtain" 40 electronic timers from MEBO AG
from November 20 to December 20, 1988.
</P>
<P>
Investigators found a piece of circuit board from one timer in
the aircraft wreckage which they believed was made by Bollier's
company.
</P>
<P>
Bollier spoke for less than an hour before the court was
adjourned. His testimony continues on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The defense team, however, sharply cross-examined Irwin Meyer,
MEBO's co-owner who was accused of lying, forging documents,
fabricating evidence and blackmailing the Libyan government. Meyer
denied the charges.
</P>
<P>
Meyer denied a defense claim that MEBO AG had offered to cover
for Libya by saying it had supplied electronic timers to an
extremist group in Beirut.

<HEADLINE> Ghana, Nigeria to Lead Regional Integration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Ghana and Nigeria vowed on Monday to
move towards integration even without the full endorsement of
other members of the Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS).
</P>
<P>
After 25 years of existence, ECOWAS should be running instead
of crawling, especially in the face of increasing globalization
and the challenges associated with it, Ghana News Agency quoted
high-ranking Ghanaian and Nigerian officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
Ghana's trade and industry minister Dan Abodakpi and his
Nigerian counterpart Mustafa Bello made the remarks at the opening
of a meeting of trade ministers from the ECOWAS nations held in
the Ghanaian capital Accra on the "Trade Liberalization Scheme."
</P>
<P>
The meeting is a follow-up to the fast-track approach adopted
by Ghana and Nigeria at the last ECOWAS summit last December in
Lome, Togo, on the accelerated implementation of strategies for
attainment of a free trade area.
</P>
<P>
Abodakpi said globalization is about securing larger markets,
adding that regional integration is the most viable way to address
the requirements of globalization and its challenges.
</P>
<P>
Bello said Ghana and Nigeria could not wait if the other
countries in the region were not ready to move on, hence the fast
track approach.
</P>
<P>
"If the other countries are not ready, we will go on with the
integration process. There is no reason to postpone things
anymore," he explained.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks rose broadly
Monday in hope that the monetary tightening cycle, which started
last June, is nearing an end.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 108.54 or 1.04
percent at 10,557.84 and the technology heavy Nasdaq composite
index rose 129.27 or 3.35 percent at 3,989.83.

<P>
Broader stock indicators were mostly higher. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index rose 21.54 at 1,486.00.
</P>
<P>
The market rallied as investors sought technology and financial
stocks in hope that the Federal Reserve will remain on hold at the
monetary policy meeting on June 27-28.
</P>
<P>
Merrill Lynch, the Global Securities Research &AMP; Economics Group,
said in its latest weekly report that with inflation remaining
tame, it's almost certain that the Federal reserve won't act at
the forthcoming meeting. "Beyond that, we are increasingly
convinced that the current Federal tightening cycle is at an end,"
the report said.
</P>
<P>
Intel rose sharply after the company announced that it will
invest 2 billion U.S. dollars in a new plan in Ireland. Hewlett-
Packard and Rambus were also higher.
</P>
<P>
The financial stocks rebounded from a fall on Friday. Investors
sold stocks on that day in fears that higher rates would take a
toll on profit earnings.
</P>
<P>
Optimism over interest rates helped the market overcome an
earnings warning from Honeywell International. The company said it
will miss expectations of earnings in the second quarter.

<HEADLINE> Survey Shows Most Americans Lack Understanding of Science </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 19 (Xinhua) -- A 1999 survey on the U.S.
public's understanding of science shows that while Americans'
confidence and interest in science and technology is high, their
understanding of basic science facts and principles remain quite
low.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey supported by the U.S. National Science
Foundation (NSF), public understanding of certain scientific
principles has slightly improved over the last two decades.
However, NSF said, the improvement has been paralleled by a
widespread belief in pseudosciences such as astrology, alien
abductions and extrasensory perception.
</P>
<P>
"Even if they don't understand it," said NSF in a report, "
Americans respect science." In 1999 a record 82 percent voiced
support for federal funding of basic research. While 14 percent
thought the government was spending too much on research, 37
percent said not enough. Americans consistently believe that the
benefits of scientific research outweigh any harmful results.
Public confidence in the medical and scientific communities, the
report said, is higher than in other American institutions
including education, the Supreme Court, television and the media.
</P>
<P>
The vast majority of Americans say that science and technology
are making their lives better. In contrast, only 17 percent of
them described themselves as well informed about new scientific
discoveries and the use of new inventions and technologies.
</P>
<P>
Answering a series of 20 questions designed to test basic
knowledge, only 50 percent of Americans know how long it takes
Earth to circle the sun, and most still can't correctly describe
in their own words some basic scientific terms such as molecules,
the Internet and DNA. Only 21 percent of those surveyed were able
to explain what it means to study something scientifically.
</P>
<P>
Most of what Americans know about science comes from television
and newspapers, the report said.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The foreign minister of the
Democratic Republic of Congo (D.R.Congo), Yerodia Abdoulaye
Ndombasi, said here Monday that the three African countries which
support the D.R.Congo government will pull out their troops as has
been asked by the United Nations Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council asked last Friday Angola, Namibia and
Zimbabwe, which support the D.R. Congo government, and Uganda and
Rwanda, which support the rebels of the D.R. Congo, to pull out
without delay their troops from the D.R.Congo.
</P>
<P>
Ndombasi arrived here Sunday after attending the session of the
U.N. Security Council in New York last Friday, during which the
council members adopted Resolution 1304 urging the withdrawal of
all foreign troops from Congo.
</P>
<P>
The resolution first asked Uganda and Rwanda to pull out troops,
while demanding the three other countries follow suit in each step
of the process.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan and Rwandan troops have recently fought with each other
in the city of Kisangani in the eastern D.R. Congo, killing at
least 160 civilians and wounding hundreds of others.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held at the D.R. Congo embassy here,
Ndombasi said that the U.N. Security Council resolution has "
finger-pointed the aggressors -- Rwanda and Uganda."

because of a "certain evolution" among some countries in the "
rogue state" category.
</P>
<P>
"Some places that were described that way have embarked upon
more democratic internal life," Boucher said. "Others have been
willing to address some of the issues that are of primary concern
to the United States."
</P>
<P>
He said the term had actually been dropped some time ago
without announcement. Just as there was no official list of rogue
states, there is none for states of concern, either.
</P>
<P>
Boucher stressed that the change in terminology does not
necessarily mean a change in policy.

<HEADLINE> France Sends New Ambassador to Chad to Mend Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 19 (Xinhua) -- France has sent a new ambassador to
Chad to mend relations which were hurt by the pullout of the
French oil group Elf-Aquitaine from an oil project in the central
African state, reported Agence France-Presse.
</P>
<P>
The new ambassador, Jacques Courbin, presented on Monday his
letter of credentials to Chadian President Idriss Deby in N'
Djamena.
</P>
<P>
Courbin was quoted as saying that his objective is to ``
reaffirm,consolidate and develop the whole of relations existing
between the two countries in the framework of France's new policy
based on partnership (with Africa).''
</P>
<P>
Chad asked France to recall immediately its former ambassador,
Alain du Boispean, after the latter announced in November 1999 the
decision of Elf to pull out of Chad.
</P>
<P>
But the World Bank approved on June 6 a 3.7 billion U.S. dollar
loan for the oil project of Doba in Chad, after the U.S. oil group
Shevron and the Malaysian group Petronas have agreed to replace
Elf and the Dutch Royal Shell to develop the project.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Federal Regulators Approve Merger of Two Big Drug Makers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Trade
Commission (FTC) on Monday cleared the way for the merger between
Pfizer Inc. and Warner-Lambert Co., a deal valued at 90 billion U.
S. dollars is expected to make the new Pfizer the largest drug
maker in the world.
</P>
<P>
The merger leaves the combined company dominating many U.S.
medicine cabinets. Together, they hold many of the world's best-
known brands, including Halls, Benadryl, Sudafed, Listerine,
Schick, Visine, Ben Gay, Lubriderm, Zantac and Cortizone.
</P>
<P>
The FTC agreed to the merger after the companies consented to
divest themselves of some businesses that federal regulators
believed might otherwise constitute a monopoly.
</P>
<P>
Pfizer, which makes the male impotence drug Viagra, and Warner-
Lambert, which manufactures the cholesterol drug Lipitor, first
announced they intended to merge February 6. But shortly
thereafter, the FTC filed a complaint contending the corporate
marriage would lessen or eliminate competition.
</P>
<P>
The commission voted unanimously in favor of the proposed
consent agreement but the commissioners will accept public comment
on the proposal until July 19. The agency is expected to make the
agreement final sometime after that.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Pfizer had profits of 3.38 billion dollars on sales
of 16.2 billion dollars. Warner-Lambert's earnings for the year
were 1.73 billion dollars while sales were 12.93 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The FTC order says the companies must divest in four areas:
treatments for depression, lice, Alzheimer's and cancer.
</P>
<P>
Pfizer said it did not expect the divestitures to have much
effect on the current or future performance of the company.
Company officials also said they expect to realize at least 1.6
billion dollars in merger-related cost-savings by 2002.

<HEADLINE> A0006042 Worldwide Online Ad to Reach $28 Billion by 2005 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Total online advertising
revenues are expected to grow to 28 billion U.S. dollars worldwide
by 2005, up from 4.3 billion dollars in 1999, a new study said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Internet, as the first marketing medium to offer global
reach, will account for almost 6 percent of all worldwide
advertising revenue by 2005, according to a report by Jupiter
Communications, a U.S. Internet research firm. However, the firm
said, the majority of companies that market globally will be ill-
prepared to leverage the Internet to communicate with consumers
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Jupiter said that the growth will partly be driven by the rise
of the online population worldwide, which will more than triple
within the next five years, rocketing from 200 million users today
to 600 million in 2005.
</P>
<P>
North America accounted for nearly 75 percent of ad revenues
globally, totaling 5.4 billion dollars this year. Europe is the
second largest market with 900 million dollars, followed by Asia
with 500 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Jupiter's findings were based on research from public financial
filings and extensive interviews with online ad sellers.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, creating a global brand via the
Internet is not easy. Regionally focused media buying and the
unwillingness to adopt new pricing models are factors that will
stop advertisers from fully taking advantage of the Web. New
advertising platforms such as wireless devices are another hurdle
to cross among international markets.
