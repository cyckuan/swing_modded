<HEADLINE> House Votes on China's Trade Status </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Furor over China's alleged theft of nuclear  
secrets and human rights abuses ensures a fiery debate as the House 
takes up the annual question of extending for another year China's 
trade status. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration joined Republican leaders today in appealing  
to members to support engagement with China. Revoking normal trade, 
the administration said in a statement, would ``signficantly damage 
America's relationship with a fifth of the world's population.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That relationship ``is very fragile now,'' said House Ways and  
Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas. Using trade to 
punish China ``risks far greater consequences for America, for 
China and for the entire world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As it has in every year since 1980, Congress is expected to go  
along with the president's decision to grant China the same low 
tariffs enjoyed by virtually all other trading partners. But with 
anti-China feelings running high, today's House vote is likely to 
be closer than last year's, when lawmakers voted 264-166 for normal 
trade. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before we grant China special trade privileges, let's  
condition their behavior on something other than promises,'' said 
Rep. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, with Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., a 
leading opponent of normal trade status. ``We can't tolerate 
continued Chinese Communist promises that they will behave, that 
they will play fair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The stakes are unusually high this year as the two countries  
strain to repair frayed relations and revive negotiations under 
which China would open its markets to U.S. goods and services as a 
condition for entry into the World Trade Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, in his June 3 decision for another year's  
extension of normal trade status -- formerly called 
most-favored-nation status -- said he is convinced that engagement 
with China is in America's economic and security interests. 
</P>
<P>
	``A policy of disengagement and confrontation would only  
strengthen those in China who oppose greater openness and 
freedom,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress has 60 days after the actual extension date, July 3, to  
reject the president's decision. Even if the House were to vote 
against normal trade, it's unlikely that the Senate would go along. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the thorns in U.S.-China relations are a Chinese trade  
surplus -- aggravated by alleged unfair trading practices -- expected 
to top $60 billion this year, allegations of illegal Chinese 
political contributions in the 1996 presidential campaign and 
suspicions that China stole U.S. nuclear secrets. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, 10 years after the Tiananmen Square crackdown there  
remains frustration with a perceived lack of improvement in China's 
human rights record and displeasure over recent arrests of members 
of the Falun Gong, a banned meditation group. China's weapons 
proliferation policies and its threats against Taiwan also anger 
many lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chinese, in turn, remain bitter over the mistaken bombing of  
the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, which some in the Chinese 
leadership see as part of a U.S. effort to hamstring China's 
political and military influence.

<HEADLINE> Alexander Bashes Bush in TV Spot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Republican Lamar Alexander debuts his  
opening television commercial of the presidential campaign this 
week, warning that ``big money'' is threatening the Republican 
contest. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-second television spot begins airing in most Iowa  
television markets Thursday and is a direct shot at the Republican 
presidential front-runner, Texas Gov. George W. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	One scene features cigar-smoking bidders on the White House lawn  
wearing cowboy hats and bidding for the GOP presidential 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``This just in -- the Iowa caucuses have been canceled,'' a mock  
television reporter says in opening the spot. ``An auction is 
underway on the White House lawn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Big money is a big issue,'' said Alexander's political  
director Brian Kennedy. ``There is a risk the Republican nomination 
will not be decided on the issues, rather it will be nothing more 
than a fund-raising contest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The television commercial closes with Alexander speaking  
directly to the camera. 
</P>
<P>
	``The presidency ought to be about raising children, farm prices  
and standards ... not just raising money,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has dominated the Republican presidential race. He reported  
having $30 million in cash on hand, 10 times more than his closest 
GOP rival. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, Alexander reported having about $100,000 in the  
bank, and has scaled back his campaign to focus virtually 
exclusively on the key early states of Iowa and New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy declined to say how much the campaign was spending on  
the television effort, but said it was a ``significant buy.'' He 
said fund raising has picked up since the latest report and the 
campaign's shift in tactics. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had a pretty good June and July and that's allowed us to  
bring in advertising earlier than expected,'' said Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
	While the commercial doesn't mention Bush by name, he is clearly  
the target. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ad speaks for itself,'' said Kennedy. ``Governor  
Alexander's strategy is to focus on Iowa and the issues. His 
competition focuses on raising money and doesn't pay attention to 
Iowa.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While summer is traditionally a low viewership period, Kennedy  
said there are solid reasons to begin an advertising campaign now. 
</P>
<P>
	There's a high-profile straw poll scheduled Aug. 14 and the  
state has been flooded with candidates for weeks building toward 
that event, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The straw poll has created kind of a window of opportunity for  
us,'' said Kennedy. ``Our sense is voters are tuning into the race 
because of all the activity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy said that while voters across the country have yet to  
focus on the election, the hectic Iowa campaign schedule and news 
reports about campaign visits have gotten the attention of voters 
in that state. 
</P>
<P>
	Publisher Steve Forbes is also running television commercials in  
Iowa and New Hampshire.

<HEADLINE> Handyman Admits to 4 Killings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK, Calif. (AP) -- A motel handyman described  
in detail for the FBI and a television reporter how he killed a 
naturalist and three Yosemite sightseers, saying he had dreamed of 
such crimes since childhood. 
</P>
<P>
	Cary Stayner told a reporter from KNTV of San Jose in an  
off-camera jailhouse interview Monday how he killed Joie Ruth 
Armstrong last week and Carole Sund, her daughter Juli and family 
friend Silvina Pelosso last winter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am guilty,'' the station quoted Stayner as saying. ``I did  
murder Carole Sund, Juli Sund, Silvina Pelosso and Joie Armstrong. 
... None of the women were sexually abused in any way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, he gave the FBI details only the killer would know, in  
such specificity that agents were able to recover evidence 
confirming his confession, the Los Angeles Times quoted sources as 
saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Knives were used in the slayings, and the weapon suspected in  
Ms. Armstrong's death was recovered, the Times reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The stunning admission was the latest twist in a strange case  
dating to mid-February, when the sightseers vanished. 
</P>
<P>
	Only days ago, authorities had said they believed those  
responsible for the high-profile slayings near one of the nation's 
premier national parks were already behind bars. Stayner, who had 
worked and lived at the lodge where the three were last seen alive, 
was questioned months ago and ruled out as a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner, 37, told KNTV that he had fantasized about killing  
women for 30 years before acting on his dreams. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he strangled Ms. Sund, 42, and Silvina, 16, in their  
rented cabin at the Cedar Lodge in El Portal, just outside 
Yosemite's western boundary. He said he then took 15-year-old Juli 
to a lake, where he killed her the next morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The women were reported missing on Feb. 17. It was more than a  
month before their bodies were found. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner told KNTV he abandoned the group's rental car with the  
bodies of Ms. Sund and Silvina inside, returning two days later to 
burn evidence and to retrieve Ms. Sund's wallet, which he dumped in 
Modesto to confuse authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner said he was the person who tipped the FBI to the  
whereabouts of Juli's body by sending an anonymous letter. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspect also said he thought he had gotten away with the  
crimes and did not leave the area for fear of drawing attention to 
himself. Everything changed when he struck up a chance conversation 
with Ms. Armstrong last week and was unable to resist killing her 
when he realized she was alone, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Her decapitated body was found last Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	To the victims' families, Stayner said, ``I am sorry their loved  
ones were where they were when they were. I wish I could have 
controlled myself and not done what I did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	FBI agent Nick Rossi said he could not say whether Stayner's  
statements were consistent with what he has told investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	Sources speaking on condition of anonymity told The Associated  
Press earlier Monday that Stayner confessed to beheading Ms. 
Armstrong and killing the other women. One source said 
investigators are trying to corroborate his story and determine 
whether others were involved. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner said nothing at a court appearance Monday in Sacramento,  
where a federal magistrate ordered him held pending arraignment 
Aug. 6 in Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
	A grand jury is reportedly looking into whether a loose-knit  
group of methamphetamine users were involved in the sightseer 
killings. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're not off the hook yet,'' an unidentified source told  
the San Francisco Chronicle. ``It's very difficult to believe he 
(Stayner) did this on his own.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner, an avid outdoorsman with youthful, clean-cut good  
looks, worked and lived at the Cedar Lodge where the sightseers 
stayed and Ms. Armstrong was an occasional visitor. His sport 
utility vehicle was spotted near her remote cabin Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Twice Thursday, park rangers and sheriff's deputies questioned  
Stayner and searched his car. Once, they grabbed his backpack to 
look for Ms. Armstrong's head, but found nothing and let Stayner 
go, according to an FBI affidavit. Ms. Armstrong's head was later 
found near her body. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner failed to show up for work Friday -- his first absence in  
a year and a half -- and FBI agents sought him again. He was found 
at a nudist colony near Sacramento after someone there recognized 
him from news reports and called authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner then confessed to the agents, the FBI said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Stayner name already is part of the annals of California  
crime. Stayner's younger brother, Steven, was kidnapped in Merced 
in 1972 and held for seven years by a man who sexually abused him. 
He escaped and was reunited with his family, but died in 1989, age 
24, in a hit-and-run accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner's uncle Jesse Stayner died a year later after being shot  
by his own gun. The Merced County sheriff's office has reopened the 
case, considering Cary Stayner as a suspect.

<HEADLINE> Athletes Sue Over Hidden Cameras </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Athletes at eight universities say they were  
secretly videotaped in locker rooms and the tapes were sold through 
Internet sites advertising ``hot younger dudes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Louis Goldstein, a lawyer representing the athletes in a  
lawsuit, said Tuesday he has eight tapes and he contends the 
practice of secretly taping athletes in locker rooms is widespread. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a whole industry,'' he said. ``They send people all  
over the country to do videotaping.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tapes, with names such as ``Straight Off the Mat'' and  
``Voyeur Time,'' began to come to light in April, when the Chicago 
Tribune reported that hidden-camera videotapes, including footage 
taken during a 1995 wrestling tournament at Northwestern, were 
being marketed online and by mail. 
</P>
<P>
	Hidden-camera videos are also known to have been made at  
Illinois State, Eastern Illinois and the University of 
Pennsylvania, Goldstein said. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, filed Monday, alleges invasion of privacy, unlawful  
use of the plaintiffs' images for monetary gain, and mail and wire 
fraud under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt 
Organizations Act. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs, who have been granted anonymity by the court,  
are described in the lawsuit as 28 ``John Does'' and ``unknown 
Illinois State University football players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit says they are past or present athletes at  
Northwestern, Illinois, Illinois State, Eastern Illinois, Indiana, 
Penn, Iowa State and Michigan State. It names several companies, 
people and Internet service providers as defendants. 
</P>
<P>
	David Sobel, general counsel for the Electronic Privacy  
Information Center in Washington, said the Communications Decency 
Act gives Internet service providers immunity from responsibility 
for what their customers put on their Web sites. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the law goes a little further than it probably ought  
to in shielding ISP's, particularly in cases where they have 
knowledge of what's there,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a little ironic in a case like this that it's a law  
called the Communications Decency Act,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldstein said it was time for the federal government to take  
action. 
</P>
<P>
	``The government's got to realize they've allowed a Wild West to  
develop on the Internet,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Internet is full of sites offering secretly made videos,  
many claiming to have been made in women's rest rooms or health 
club locker rooms. Others offer so-called ``upskirt'' or ``down 
blouse'' videos taken secretly but in public places. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal eavesdropping laws apply to videotaping, but Randall  
Samborn, spokesman for the U.S. attorney in Chicago, said he could 
not confirm or deny whether an investigation has begun. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit names distributors Franco Productions, Rodco,  
Hidvidco, Hidvidco-Atlas, Video release, AMO Video, Logan Gaines 
Entertainment, D.I.Y./Triangle Video, Cal Video and TVRP; and Dan 
Franco, George Jachem, Logan Gaines, Alan Gould, Brad Theissen and 
Kevin Gleason. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldstein said Franco Productions was based in San Diego,  
Hidvidco in Boston and Logan Gaines Entertainment in Hawaii. 
Telephone listings could not be found for any of them.

<HEADLINE> Cadillac's Future in Question </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCHESTER, Mich. (AP) -- Even as luxury car sales have boomed  
with a thriving economy, foreign automakers have steadily eroded 
Cadillac's U.S. market share like rust on a junked Coupe de Ville. 
</P>
<P>
	As the luxury division of General Motor Corp. showed off its  
newest model Tuesday, questions persisted about the No. 1 
automaker's ability to restore a nameplate that many affluent 
drivers today still associate with the finned luxo-barges of the 
'50s and '60s. 
</P>
<P>
	``As their market share declines, the task of rebuilding it  
becomes more and more difficult,'' said independent analyst Susan 
Jacobs. ``Cadillac's not accustomed to getting lost in the crowd, 
which is what it faces in today's luxury car market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cadillac's recent efforts to lure crowds of younger buyers to  
its showrooms have not been successful: Sales of the imported 
Catera entry-level sedan have been a disappointment, while demand 
for the larger Seville, redesigned for the '98 model year, was down 
23 percent in the first half of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Its late entry in the luxury sport utility vehicle segment, the  
Escalade, is little more than a gussied-up GMC Denali with a larger 
price tag. GM executives admit they underestimated the demand for 
big-ticket SUVs. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year ended with the ultimate humiliation for Cadillac: It  
lost the U.S. luxury sales crown it held for 48 years to rival Ford 
Motor Co.'s Lincoln division. 
</P>
<P>
	Through the first half of this year, Cadillac's U.S. car sales  
declined 15 percent while overall luxury car sales increased 7 
percent. Including SUV sales, Cadillac now trails Lexus, 
Mercedes-Benz and BMW -- all of which are benefitting from fresher, 
more innovative models. 
</P>
<P>
	Cadillac's overall share of the luxury market fell to just under  
16 percent last year from its peak of 51 percent in 1976, according 
to Autofacts. 
</P>
<P>
	Against this backdrop, Cadillac unveiled the 2000 DeVille. The  
DeVille, in its 50th year, is a key model for Cadillac: It has been 
the top-selling luxury car in the United States for 14 straight 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2000 DeVille is full of new technology that Cadillac hopes  
will lure Lexus, BMW and Mercedes-Benz drivers. Top on the list is 
the optional ``night vision'' infrared system that alerts the 
driver to hazards well beyond the range of the car's headlights. 
The car also is available with ultrasonic sensors in the rear 
bumper that will warn the driver of obstacles while backing up. 
</P>
<P>
	The night vision option will be priced between $1,000 and  
$1,500; list prices for the new DeVille, which goes on sale in the 
fall, are expected to be close to the current model's range of 
$38,500 to $44,500. 
</P>
<P>
	Slightly shorter and slimmer than its predecessor, the new  
DeVille borrows styling cues from the smaller Seville but still 
retains the conservative, big-sedan look that distinguishes it as 
an American luxury car. 
</P>
<P>
	That's the problem, critics say. Cadillac tried hard not to  
offend its loyal customers, who are getting older and fewer, while 
betting the new technology would impress younger buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The DeVille looks too much toward yesterday and not enough  
toward Cadillac's future,'' Jacobs said. ``It's an evolution in the 
right direction, but it's still grounded on the demands of their 
traditional buyers. The concept, the size, the look is still the 
traditional look of Cadillac.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Hall, an analyst with AutoPacific Inc., said the new DeVille  
is intended to compete more with the Lincoln Town Car than the 
Mercedes S-class. With its bigger trunk and rear seating, it may 
steal some Lincoln customers and a piece of the stretch-limo 
business that the Town Car has owned for years. 
</P>
<P>
	The new DeVille will make more money for GM even if sales stay  
flat, because of cost savings designed into the car, said analyst 
Alan Baum of IRN Inc. As GM has replaced old models, it has made 
the new ones easier to build, with fewer parts, and has increased 
the number of models built off common ``platforms'' -- the chassis 
and major mechanical parts. 
</P>
<P>
	The DeVille is built from the same platform as the Seville,  
Pontiac Bonneville, Buick Park Avenue, Buick LeSabre and Oldsmobile 
Aurora. 
</P>
<P>
	Cadillac executives are looking to 2001 and beyond for the  
models they hope will finally restore the marque's prominence. The 
later models will be based on Caddy's new ``art and science'' 
styling theme evident in the edgy Evoq roadster concept car on 
display at this year's major auto shows. 
</P>
<P>
	The first evidence of that will show up in the redesigned  
Escalade, which will debut in 2001 for Cadillac's centennial model 
year of 2002. That will be followed by a redesigned Catera, an 
all-new, car-based SUV that's smaller than the Escalade, the next 
generation Seville that will return to a traditional rear-drive 
setup, and the limited-production Evoq. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem is Cadillac needs those models now.  
</P>
<P>
	``The delay in transforming their lineup is costing them  
business long-term'' Jacobs said. ``They are coming too late to 
make Cadillac stand out from the crowd and sustain a leading 
position in luxury.''

<HEADLINE>  Kamerling Sets 50m Butterfly Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- Sweden's Anna-Karin Kammerling lived up  
to her reputation as the women's fastest swimmer in the butterfly 
Tuesday by breaking her world record in 50-meters. 
</P>
<P>
	The 19-year Kammerling was timed in 26.29 seconds, bettering the  
26.39 she swam July 1 at the Swedish national championships. 
</P>
<P>
	She led all the way, beating Swedish teammate Johanna Sjoberg of  
Sweden, who was timed in 26.93. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't expect to break the world record again because in two  
races yesterday I didn't go very fast or feel very good,'' 
Kammerling said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first world record broken in Istanbul's Atakoy  
Olympic pool on the European side of this city spanning two 
continents. 
</P>
<P>
	In the men's 50-meter butterfly, Pieter Van den Hoogenband of  
the Netherlands nearly set a world record of his own, clocking the 
world's third all-best time of 23.89. 
</P>
<P>
	He later took away Alexander Popov's championship record by  
swimming a blazingly 48.70 in the semifinals of the 100-meter 
freestyle, just one day after he swam the world's all-time fastest 
leg in the 4x100 in 47.31. Popov holds both the world and European 
record of 48.21 set in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Holland's 4x100 team win also broke a streak held by Popov, who  
chased Hoogenband on the last leg. It was Popov's first silver 
medal in the Euros. 
</P>
<P>
	Coupled with Hoogenband's performance in the semis, the Dutchman  
has become Popov's biggest threat as he tries for a fifth 
consecutive gold in Wednesday's 100-meter freestyle final. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 100-meter backstroke, European champion Stev Theloke of  
Germany handily took his race in a time of 55.16, followed by 
Gordan Kozulj of Croatia in 55.84. Israel's Eithan Urbach, third in 
55.87, gave his country its second ever European Championship 
medal. 
</P>
<P>
	Italy's Domenico Fioravanti won the men's 100-meter breaststroke  
in a time of 1:01.34.

<HEADLINE> Forbes Seeks Rivals' Inconsistencies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Steve Forbes' Republican presidential campaign  
is poring through mounds of public records about his White House 
rivals -- on a quest to find inconsistencies that he can use against 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	Opposition research has become a widely used political tool.  
Rival campaigns research candidate's positions, and in the extreme 
some may even hire private investigators to pick through a 
candidate's personal life. 
</P>
<P>
	What they turn up becomes fodder for political advertisements,  
campaign speeches and debates, and leaks to the media. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes' department, which includes veteran opposition researcher  
Gary Maloney, has turned up a few good nuggets, among them tax and 
spending increases proposed by Texas Gov. George W. Bush, said Bill 
Dal Col, Forbes' political director. 
</P>
<P>
	``They go through legislative records and public records to see  
where there is a difference in voting records and public 
statements, (but) no personal stuff,'' Dal Col said. ``We have not 
hired private investigators and never will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes has a six-person research team. Maloney and staff  
researcher Brian McNeil are tasked solely with researching Forbes' 
presidential rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	Maloney, a consultant with John McLaughlin and Associates,  
studied under political strategist Lee Atwater and in 1996 helped 
boost New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore 
into office. According to financial disclosure reports filed this 
month, the Forbes campaign paid $647,884 to McLaughlin. 
</P>
<P>
	Dal Col's relative frankness about Forbes' research activities  
is unusual. Almost every national campaign conducts some type of 
opposition research, though few like to discuss it. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore's campaign will not reveal the size of  
his research staff, what they are looking into or how long they 
have been on the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do have some people on staff, and we do have some people  
who are consultants,'' said Gore spokesman Roger Salazar. ``We 
could get the other campaigns on the phone and discuss this, but 
I'd rather not give away our strategies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republican front-runner George W. Bush's campaign has two staff  
members doing opposition research, said spokesman Andrew Malcolm. 
``Governor Bush has always run positive issue-oriented campaigns 
with the focus on his issues and what he would do, not what others 
have done,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	For many candidates, sophisticated research teams are too  
pricey. Elizabeth Dole's campaign often relies on volunteers to 
scan the papers and legislative materials to pin down opponents' 
positions. 
</P>
<P>
	Opposition research ``is a very small part of the issues  
research division. The lion's share is on the issues'' for her 
platform, said spokesman Ari Fleischer. ``Mrs. Dole has made it 
clear that she is going to run a positive campaign. She is going 
follow Ronald Reagan's 11th commandment'' -- Thou shall not speak 
ill of another Republican. 
</P>
<P>
	But Reagan was not always so kind, said Karen Johnson Cartee, a  
University of Alabama professor who focuses on politics. His 
campaign perfected opposition research by bringing computers into 
the political arena. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, ``it is more sophisticated,'' she said. But ``I don't think  
it's any worse than its ever been. In American politics, it's 
always been anything goes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walter Dean Burnham, a government professor at the University of  
Texas at Austin, said the negative side of opposition research hit 
its peak during the 1988 presidential campaign, when Gary Hart 
withdrew from the race following accusations of marital infidelity. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly, it's gotten more developed in recent elections,''  
Burnham said. ``I always consider these matters as equivalent to 
arms races or wars, of course at a much lower volume -- combatants 
looking for ways to attack the enemy and preempt the enemy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That war often starts at the party level. The Republican  
National Committee now has about a dozen researchers looking into 
Democratic candidates, said committee spokesman Mark Pfeifle. 
``We're looking at quotes, we're looking at votes,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do everything possible to find out what people stand for,''  
he said. But to talk about it ``would be like the Redskins having 
an open practice and inviting the Cowboys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than 60 RNC researchers worked on ``Shameless,'' a 1996  
campaign ``fact book'' about President Clinton's alleged misdeeds. 
</P>
<P>
	Research priorities shift with the political climate.  
</P>
<P>
	In May, David Israelite, the head of the RNC research  
department, proposed investigating Democratic presidential 
candidate Bill Bradley ``a full 50 percent of the time.'' In a memo 
to RNC Chairman Jim Nicholson, he cited Gore's declining -- and 
Bradley's rising -- poll numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Democratic National Committee, ``We do what we consider  
public records research,'' spokesman Rick Hess said. 
</P>
<P>
	That is business as usual, said David Rohde, political science  
professor at Michigan State University. 
</P>
<P>
	Opposition research ``goes back to the dawn of the republic,''  
he said. ``There may have been no opposition research on George 
Washington, but there was some on Thomas Jefferson and John 
Adams.''

<HEADLINE> Iran, Libya, Sudan Sanctions Eased </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sanctions against Iran, Libya and Sudan are  
being eased today to allow American companies to sell them food, 
medicine and medical equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	All three countries are listed by the State Department as  
exporters of terrorism and remain subject to military and business 
sanctions. It is embargoes that bar other dealings, including 
humanitarian aid, that are being eased. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sanctions on food, medicine and medical equipment do not  
generally advance our policy goals and may have adverse 
consequences in the humanitarian realm,'' Stuart Eizenstat, the 
deputy Treasury secretary, said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	He said companies selling humanitarian goods would need licenses  
from the Treasury Department. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the new policy offers U.S. companies,  
particularly farmers, an opportunity to boost exports. American 
farmers, feeling lingering effects of a global financial crisis, 
are suffering their worst economic period in a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	The new policy offers farmers the opportunity to sell more than  
13 million tons of grain, worth as much as $2 billion, to Iran, 
Libya and Sudan, administration officials estimated. 
</P>
<P>
	Agricultural items permitted for export would include raw,  
processed and packaged foods, animal feeds, live food animals and 
seeds for food crops, Eizenstat said. 
</P>
<P>
	The regulations do not allow sale of nonfood agricultural  
commodities such as cotton or tobacco, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department first announced the intended policy change  
in April.

	LEFT-CLICK IF YOU THINK HE'S GUILTY: You can look for a job over  
the Internet, buy things, find long-lost friends -- now, how about 
serving on a jury? Dell Computer commissioned a survey to find out 
what people want from their PCs and the Internet, and it seems that 
they believe cyberspace can help them deal with some of life's 
civic nuisances. Ninety percent of the 1,000 PC users surveyed want 
to be able to renew their driver's licenses and get new license 
plates over the Internet. Seventy percent want to be able to pay 
parking and speeding tickets online. Looking at other civic duties, 
78 percent want to be able to vote in major elections via the 
Internet. And 53 percent think they should be able to serve their 
jury duty online. The poll doesn't say how this would be 
accomplished.

	FLEX TIME PAYS OFF FOR EVERYONE: If you're looking for workers  
and you think your small company doesn't stand a chance against big 
corporations and their big benefits, you might be able to get and 
keep good people by just giving them some time off, advises Inc. 
magazine. In its August issue, Inc. profiles Dawson Personnel 
Systems, a family-owned temporary staffing agency that gives 
employees time off for meeting work goals. For example, the owners 
told the sales staff at the Columbus, Ohio, firm that once they hit 
their monthly productivity goals, they could go home at 2 p.m. each 
afternoon for the rest of the month. If the business has a 
productive week, everyone gets to go home early on Friday. Workers 
who meet goals get to set their own schedules. The company says the 
policy helped it have its best year ever in 1998.

<P>
	HELLO, ANYBODY STILL THERE?: Mutual fund investors with busy  
schedules may find it's hard to get hold of a fund company 
representative by phone unless they call by 8 p.m. Eastern time 
weekdays. Mutual Fund magazine surveyed 14 big fund companies and 
found that only one, Fidelity, has a 24-hour-a-day, 
seven-day-a-week phone operation. Most others shut down their 
phones at 8 p.m.; a few stay open till 9, 10 or 11 p.m. The early 
closing makes it hard for some California or Hawaii investors to 
get their questions answered. But the magazine says it finds that 
the companies work hard to be sure their phone reps provide good 
service.

<HEADLINE> Autogrill To Buy Host Marriott </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BETHESDA, Md. (AP) -- An Italian company that controls Europe's  
largest restaurant group catering to travelers plans to offer $529 
million in cash for Host Marriott Services Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Autogrill SpA said Monday its offer would start Aug. 2 and must  
be accepted by two-thirds of Host Marriott shareholders. Autogrill 
said Host Marriott's board has unanimously approved the buyout 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Bethesda-based Host Marriott, a major presence in U.S. airports,  
is the national leader in restaurant concessions, operating in 
almost 200 locations. It has concessions in 18 of the nation's 20 
largest airports and has the rights to the Burger King, Pizza Hut 
and Starbucks brands. 
</P>
<P>
	Mario Cibelli, who follows Host Marriott for Robotti &AMP; Co., a  
New York investment banking firm, said shareholders had been 
pressuring directors to make some kind of move. 
</P>
<P>
	``The stock was so undervalued. That's partly why they did  
this,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The $15.75 a share cash offer represents a nearly 62 percent  
premium over Host Marriott Services' closing price of $9.75 a share 
Friday on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	``With smaller companies, that's not a surprising premium,''  
Cibelli said. 
</P>
<P>
	Autogrill, controlled by the apparel retailer Benetton, said the  
merger of the two companies would make it the world's biggest 
restaurant operator catering to travelers. It would have activities 
in North America, Europe, Australia and Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	Autogrill has 652 restaurants and bars in Europe. It recently  
won the rights to use the Burger King brand in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	It plans to operate in five main areas: highway restaurants,  
airports, shopping centers, railway stations and quick-service 
urban outlets. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, the combined sales of the two groups reached an  
equivalent of over $2.6 billion.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Women on Medicare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Women stand to lose more than men if  
government surpluses aren't used to bolster Medicare, President 
Clinton said today in an attempt to stir up opposition to a big 
Republican tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
	``I ask you to help me send the word to the Congress that let's  
do first things first. Let's fix Medicare. The women of America 
especially need it,'' Clinton said at the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said Congress is ``resorting to accounting gimmicks'' to  
conceal the fact that the tax cuts Republicans want would squeeze 
out necessary spending. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can tell you that if this tax cut passes there will be  
breathtaking cuts in every area of our national life that you would 
believe was important,'' said Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't eat the cake until the vegetables and soup are out of  
the way,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the tax-writing House  
Ways and Means Committee, said Republicans also want to help women 
by strengthening the nation's retirement programs, but also with 
tax cuts that benefit them, such as eliminating the tax penalty 
that affects many working couples. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's sad that the president is trying to divide Americans and  
stir up discontent and anger rather than work with us,'' said 
Archer. 
</P>
<P>
	First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton joined the president to  
highlight a study by a women's advocacy group concluding that women 
rely more than men do on Medicare -- the nation's health insurance 
program for the elderly and disabled -- mainly because the average 
woman lives longer and has a lower income. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes these debates have ways of making our eyes glaze  
over as hundreds of billions of dollars are talked about. So let's 
make sure to keep a human face on this,'' said Mrs. Clinton. 
``Women rely more on Medicare than men and are therefore more 
vulnerable to changes in Medicare policies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The study, by the Older Women's League, also found that elderly  
women spend an average of 20 percent more on prescription drugs 
than do men. Medicare doesn't cover that, but the administration 
says it should. 
</P>
<P>
	``Medicare is a women's health plan,'' said the league's  
executive director, Deborah Briceland-Betts. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore, a contender for the 2000 Democratic  
presidential nomination, is expected to tout the statistics about 
women and Medicare today at a separate rally against GOP tax cuts 
with Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democrats also singled out Americans living in rural areas  
in their pitch. The administration says nearly half the older 
Americans in rural areas lack health insurance covering 
prescription drugs, compared to about a third of all retirees 
nationally. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has proposed, and congressional Democrats are  
backing, new universal Medicare coverage for prescription drugs -- 
at a 10-year cost to the Treasury of $118 billion. Clinton's plan 
also would waive out-of-pocket fees for preventive medical care 
such as mammograms to detect breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``For too many seniors on fixed incomes, especially low-income  
women, the cost of a modest co-payment is prohibitive,'' said 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	To pay for the new benefits and buttress Medicare against the  
coming wave of baby boom retirements, Clinton wants to use $794 
billion of the federal budget surpluses projected over the next 15 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican leaders also have endorsed the idea of a Medicare  
overhaul and new drug benefits. But they are trying to earmark much 
of the future surplus for a tax cut costing $792 billion over 10 
years, saying plenty would be left for other priorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has pledged to veto the GOP tax cut, which passed the  
House last week and is up for consideration on the Senate floor 
this week, indicating Democrats and Republicans probably will try 
to work out a compromise later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, the two political parties are competing to  
exploit debate over the surplus as a symbol of their different 
visions for the country leading up to the 2000 elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Women are expected to play a pivotal role in the elections, and  
Gore wants to inherit the support Clinton has enjoyed among them. 
Clinton's focus on family issues helped him win the 1996 women's 
vote 55 percent to 37 percent.

	Three out of five Medicare beneficiaries are women. Among the

	Women also have a greater financial need for help in paying  
medical bills in old age. Nationally, seven in 10 retirees who live

<HEADLINE> Prayer Books Stolen by Nazis Sought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A collection of rare prayer books stolen by the  
Nazis from the French home of a Jewish art collector during World 
War II have resurfaced in a Manhattan gallery, a lawsuit alleges. 
</P>
<P>
	The eight books, valued at $15 million, belonged to Alphonse  
Kann, who collected more than 1,200 pieces of art, including 
paintings by Picasso, Manet and Matisse. He left his home in 1939, 
ahead of the Nazi occupation of France. 
</P>
<P>
	In a lawsuit filed Tuesday in state Supreme Court, descendants  
and heirs of Kann said the 15th, 16th and 17th century manuscripts, 
known as ``Books of Hours,'' are currently at the Wildenstein 
Gallery. They estate was made aware of their location in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The hand lettered manuscripts contain colorful religious  
illustrations by renowned artists of the period. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit alleges that Kann's collection was stolen from his  
St. Germane-en-Laye home outside Paris in October 1940 after Kann 
moved to London for what he thought would be a temporary stay. He 
never returned and died in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit was filed in the name of Francis Warin, the  
surviving son of Kann's nephew, Charles Weil, and En Memoire 
D'Alphonse Kann, an association in France comprised of Kann's 
heirs, beneficiaries and descendants. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit said the association tried unsuccessfully to  
negotiate the return of the manuscripts from the gallery. A message 
left with the gallery Tuesday was not returned.

<HEADLINE> Handyman Admits to 4 Killings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK, Calif. (AP) -- A motel handyman described  
in detail for the FBI and a television reporter how he killed a 
naturalist and three Yosemite sightseers, saying he had dreamed of 
such crimes since childhood. 
</P>
<P>
	Cary Stayner told a reporter from KNTV of San Jose in an  
off-camera jailhouse interview Monday how he killed Joie Ruth 
Armstrong last week and Carole Sund, her daughter Juli and family 
friend Silvina Pelosso last winter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am guilty,'' the station quoted Stayner as saying. ``I did  
murder Carole Sund, Juli Sund, Silvina Pelosso and Joie Armstrong. 
... None of the women were sexually abused in any way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, he gave the FBI details only the killer would know, in  
such specificity that agents were able to recover evidence 
confirming his confession, the Los Angeles Times quoted sources as 
saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Knives were used in the slayings, and the weapon suspected in  
Ms. Armstrong's death was recovered, the Times reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The stunning admission was the latest twist in a strange case  
dating to mid-February, when the sightseers vanished. 
</P>
<P>
	Only days ago, authorities had said they believed those  
responsible for the high-profile slayings near one of the nation's 
premier national parks were already behind bars. Stayner, who had 
worked and lived at the lodge where the three were last seen alive, 
was questioned months ago and ruled out as a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner, 37, told KNTV that he had fantasized about killing  
women for 30 years before acting on his dreams. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he strangled Ms. Sund, 42, and Silvina, 16, in their  
rented cabin at the Cedar Lodge in El Portal, just outside 
Yosemite's western boundary. He said he then took 15-year-old Juli 
to a lake, where he killed her the next morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The women were reported missing on Feb. 17. It was more than a  
month before their bodies were found. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner told KNTV he abandoned the group's rental car with the  
bodies of Ms. Sund and Silvina inside, returning two days later to 
burn evidence and to retrieve Ms. Sund's wallet, which he dumped in 
Modesto to confuse authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner said he was the person who tipped the FBI to the  
whereabouts of Juli's body by sending an anonymous letter. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspect also said he thought he had gotten away with the  
crimes and did not leave the area for fear of drawing attention to 
himself. Everything changed when he struck up a chance conversation 
with Ms. Armstrong last week and was unable to resist killing her 
when he realized she was alone, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Her decapitated body was found last Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	To the victims' families, Stayner said, ``I am sorry their loved  
ones were where they were when they were. I wish I could have 
controlled myself and not done what I did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	FBI agent Nick Rossi said he could not say whether Stayner's  
statements were consistent with what he has told investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	Sources speaking on condition of anonymity told The Associated  
Press earlier Monday that Stayner confessed to beheading Ms. 
Armstrong and killing the other women. One source said 
investigators are trying to corroborate his story and determine 
whether others were involved. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner said nothing at a court appearance Monday in Sacramento,  
where a federal magistrate ordered him held pending arraignment 
Aug. 6 in Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
	A grand jury is reportedly looking into whether a loose-knit  
group of methamphetamine users were involved in the sightseer 
killings. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're not off the hook yet,'' an unidentified source told  
the San Francisco Chronicle. ``It's very difficult to believe he 
(Stayner) did this on his own.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner, an avid outdoorsman with youthful, clean-cut good  
looks, worked and lived at the Cedar Lodge where the sightseers 
stayed and Ms. Armstrong was an occasional visitor. His sport 
utility vehicle was spotted near her remote cabin Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Twice Thursday, park rangers and sheriff's deputies questioned  
Stayner and searched his car. Once, they grabbed his backpack to 
look for Ms. Armstrong's head, but found nothing and let Stayner 
go, according to an FBI affidavit. Ms. Armstrong's head was later 
found near her body. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner failed to show up for work Friday -- his first absence in  
a year and a half -- and FBI agents sought him again. He was found 
at a nudist colony near Sacramento after someone there recognized 
him from news reports and called authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner then confessed to the agents, the FBI said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Stayner name already is part of the annals of California  
crime. Stayner's younger brother, Steven, was kidnapped in Merced 
in 1972 and held for seven years by a man who sexually abused him. 
He escaped and was reunited with his family, but died in 1989, age 
24, in a hit-and-run accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner's uncle Jesse Stayner died a year later after being shot  
by his own gun. The Merced County sheriff's office has reopened the 
case, considering Cary Stayner as a suspect.

<HEADLINE> Colorado Teams Get a New Owner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- A group headed by billionaire banker Donald Sturm  
purchased the Colorado Avalanche and the Denver Nuggets for $461 
million on Tuesday after a Wal-Mart heiress dropped out of an 
auction for the teams. 
</P>
<P>
	The move ended a four-month tug-of-war over Ascent Entertainment  
Group's efforts to sell the teams and the Pepsi Center arena, due 
to open next fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Sturm, who is a major shareholder in telecommunications giant  
Level 3 Communications, did not return telephone messages seeking 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, Bill Laurie and his wife, Nancy, an heiress to  
the Wal-Mart fortune, said they weren't prepared to match the Sturm 
group's offer, backing out of an open auction set Wednesday that 
would have pitted the Lauries against the Sturm group. 
</P>
<P>
	``While we remain committed to the Denver sports teams as fans,  
we have made the difficult decision not to pursue ownership 
further,'' the Lauries said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sturm offer is not subject to the approval of shareholders,  
an Ascent spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We look forward to working with Donald L. Sturm and The Sturm  
Group to ensure there is a smooth transition of ownership,'' said 
Chuck Neinas, interim chairman and chief executive officer for 
Ascent. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, the Lauries purchased the Ascent assets for $400  
million, triggering two shareholder lawsuits that claimed other 
potential bidders were not solicited and the teams and arena should 
have fetched a higher price. 
</P>
<P>
	Sturm was part of a group initially rebuffed in favor of the  
Lauries. 
</P>
<P>
	A third suit was filed by a businessman who said the Lauries  
backed out of an agreement to sell the Avalanche to them for $80 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	To appease shareholders, Ascent withdrew the planned sale,  
reopened bids and set up the auction process. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Sturm won the right to compete against the Lauries by  
edging Saudi Princess Thara Al Saud, who offered $450 million, and 
a group made up of retired Denver Broncos quarterback John Elway, 
Denver financier Bjorn Erik Borgen and Colorado ski mogul George 
Gillett, whose bid wasn't disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Some shareholders said they were satisfied with Sturm's purchase  
price, while others believed the price could have been higher. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it could have fetched a higher price if the auction  
were structured differently, if they had not picked just one winner 
in the first round to go against the Lauries,'' said Ken Goldman, 
the principal of the Denver-based Entermedia Growth Partners, which 
has a stake in Ascent. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it's nice to get 15 percent premium over the original  
deal,'' he said. ``Basically it's benefited Ascent shareholders to 
the tune of north of $1 per share incremental value.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marc Ganis, president of Sportscorp, a Chicago-based sports  
consulting firm, said, ``Five years from now, people are going to 
look back and conclude that Donald Sturm got a bargain. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think right now the assets are worth in the $500 million  
range plus or minus $20 million, but in four or five years they are 
going to be worth much more than that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lauries will receive $8.2 million from Ascent as part of an  
agreement reached when the bidding process was reopened last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Sturm, who lives in Denver but was raised in the New York  
borough of Brooklyn, started as a tax lawyer. He branched into 
construction, banking and telecommunications, amassing a 
diversified portfolio that Forbes magazine valued at about $1.7 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Sturm was a part of an investor group that rescued Continental  
Airlines from bankruptcy in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, he is a major shareholder of Level 3, the  
Broomfield-based telecommunications giant, and owns a group of nine 
banks, including the Bank One of Cherry Creek. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a relief,'' Avalanche general manager Pierre Lacroix  
said. ``The fact that we have leadership as of today and the fact 
that we're going to be able to sit down and learn Mr. Sturm's 
philosophy, it's sure going to be great because he's an excellent 
businessman.''

<HEADLINE> Manipulated Trees Said Less Harmful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Scientists in Michigan say they are cultivating genetically  
modified trees that grow almost twice as fast as normal trees and 
may be a more environmentally friendly raw material for paper. 
</P>
<P>
	If the trees can be grown commercially, they could increase the  
timber output of forests and reduce the amount of chemicals used in 
bleaching paper pulp. 
</P>
<P>
	The scientists at the Michigan Technological University were  
looking for a way to grow trees with less lignin, a glue-like 
substance that has to be separated from wood fibers before they can 
be used to make paper. 
</P>
<P>
	The lignin is bleached out with chemicals containing chlorine, a  
costly process blamed for damaging rivers and wildlife habitats 
near paper mills. 
</P>
<P>
	In their study, to be published in the August issue of the  
journal Nature Biotechnology, the scientists describe how they 
knocked out a gene involved in lignin production in aspen cells. 
They then cultivated the cells into saplings in a greenhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	``What really surprised me is that they grow much faster,'' said  
Vincent Chiang, one of the researchers and the director of the 
Plant Biotechnology Research Center at the university. 
</P>
<P>
	He is not sure why the trees grow faster, but says the reduced  
production of lignin may leave the tree more energy for growth. 
</P>
<P>
	The aspens that were most affected by the gene treatment  
contained about 50 percent less lignin and 15 percent more 
cellulose, the fibrous component of wood used to make paper, 
chemicals and fuel alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very impressive demonstration of what tree  
biotechnology may be capable of,'' said Dr. Robert Eckert, director 
of strategic technology at timber giant Weyerhaeuser, based in 
Tacoma, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
	But what works in aspens may not work in the softwoods or  
conifers that are the main source of pulp. Eckert said such trees 
are harder to manipulate genetically. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, he said he wanted to see that the trees can survive and  
that the reduction of lignin persists. 
</P>
<P>
	``If all that falls in place, you have what could be kind of a  
watershed event in terms of its impact on the pulp and paper 
industry,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chiang said a new crop of more than 400 modified aspens is in  
two fields in Michigan and Wisconsin, and that his team has started 
trying out the same genetic treatment on other hardwood species.

<HEADLINE> Japan Auto Output Falls Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's production of cars, trucks and buses fell  
in June for the third straight month, dropping 2.5 percent from a 
year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first six months of the year, output has fallen 3.3  
percent to 4.93 million units, the Japan Automobile Manufacturers' 
Association said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	For the month of June, production of passenger cars declined 1.2  
percent to 265,172 units, truck output slumped 7.9 percent to 
157,261 and bus production fell 2.5 percent to 4,331. 
</P>
<P>
	However, mini-car production soared 59.1 percent to 112,881,  
reflecting a continuing boom in that sector of the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's automobile output has been falling all year amid poor  
sales and declining exports. 
</P>
<P>
	Production fell in June at all of Japan's top five carmakers.  
</P>
<P>
	Ailing Nissan Motor Co., which this year received a massive  
capital injection from France's Renault, recorded a particularly 
steep fall of 18.3 percent to 112,734 units. 
</P>
<P>
	Production at Japan's largest automaker, Toyota Motor Corp. fell  
3.8 percent to 265,940. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitsubishi Motor Co. production fell 8.5 percent to 86,919,  
while that at Honda Motor Co. dropped 4.3 percent to 106,163. Mazda 
Motor Corp. output fell 5.0 percent to 68,651. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first six months of the year, vehicle demand fell 0.2  
percent to 3.04 million, and exports are estimated to have fallen 5 
percent, the association said.

<HEADLINE>  Abbott Says Career Is Likely Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Jim Abbott has concluded in the past few weeks he  
can no longer pitch effectively, and says his career likely is 
over. 
</P>
<P>
	Abbott, who was born without a right hand, was released Friday  
by the Milwaukee Brewers. 
</P>
<P>
	The 31-year-old Abbott said it's time to ``look in other areas  
and aspects of life. It's time to admit reality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After he allowed five runs in 3 2-3 innings in front of friends  
and family July 8 at Tiger Stadium, he said would contemplate his 
future after the All-Star break. Against the Philadelphia Phillies 
on July 14, he gave up four hits and three runs in the ninth inning 
in a 7-0 loss, surrendering two walks and two wild pitches. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I've come to the end, baseball-wise,'' Abbott told the  
Detroit Free Press from his home in California on Monday. ``I feel 
fulfilled. I feel satisfied.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abbott had a 2-8 record and a 6.91 earned-run average when he  
was released by the Brewers. 
</P>
<P>
	``My career wasn't always great, but it was wonderful. I learned  
so many lessons and had so many great friends and experiences. I 
don't feel the emptiness that I felt after I was released by the 
Angels a few years ago,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Abbott was a collegiate star at Michigan.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'll always be looked at as having played with one hand,''  
Abbott said. ``There's an accomplishment to that that I can be 
proud of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He played for the United States team that won the baseball  
tournament at the 1988 Olympics in Seoul. He then skipped the 
minors and went straight to the California Angels. 
</P>
<P>
	He spent four seasons with the Angels, compiling a 47-52 record,  
before being traded to the New York Yankees. He pitched a no-hitter 
against Cleveland on Sept. 4, 1993, at Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Abbott opened the 1995 season with the White Sox and later was  
traded back to the Angels, who released him after a series of shaky 
starts in spring training in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, he signed a minor league deal with the White Sox and  
worked his way through the farm system. He was 5-0 in the final 
month of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	On Jan. 27, Abbott signed a one-year, $600,000 contract with the  
Brewers, who promised him a spot in the starting rotation. But he 
struggled. 
</P>
<P>
	Abbott said he no longer had the fastball to be a power pitcher  
and the adjustment to becoming a finesse pitcher was too much. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't able to make the transition to throw a formidable  
off-speed pitch,'' he said. ``You have to be able to do that. For 
me, it was a tough transition to make. Unfortunately, I wasn't able 
to do it.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	MUSSELSHELL, Mont. (AP) -- A forecast of rising wind, higher  
temperatures and lower humidity spelled trouble for firefighters 
battling a 33,000-acre fire threatening a ranching community in 
central Montana. 
</P>
<P>
	Wildfires also burned in California and several other Western  
states. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents of Musselshell, population 50, had been put on alert  
in case shifting wind fans the flames this afternoon, said fire 
information officer Mary Lunsford. 
</P>
<P>
	Conditions today were little changed from Monday, when the fire  
had charred 33,000 acres of grassland and gotten to within a mile 
of town. 
</P>
<P>
	About 300 firefighters have fought the flames, which were  
started by lightning Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said containment might be possible by Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	Ranchers in some areas spent much of Monday moving livestock to  
safer areas. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been no injuries. Lunsford said one small house  
outside town was destroyed during the weekend with several 
outbuildings and a garage. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters in California have finally completed containment  
lines around big fires in San Bernardino and Santa Barbara 
counties.

<P>
	The San Bernardino fire, which started Sunday, burned 4,000  
acres near Cajon Pass before it was contained this morning. The 
fire destroyed three homes and killed some livestock. 
</P>
<P>
	The Santa Barbara fire, skirting the Los Padres National Forest  
west of New Cuyama, burned for nine days across 14,500 acres before 
firefighters encircled it Monday evening, said Charlie Johnson, 
spokesman for the Santa Barbara County Fire Department.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Several Republican presidential candidates  
will be attending Florida's GOP convention this fall, state party 
officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Letters to each Republican presidential hopeful were mailed last  
week, said state party Chairman Al Cardenas. Many candidates 
already have accepted the invitation, but Cardenas did not know 
specifically who would be attending. 
</P>
<P>
	The state GOP convention will be held Oct. 8-9 in Orlando. ABC  
News and its congressional analyst, Cokie Roberts, will host a 
``presidential primary forum.'' Its format will be determined soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Several members of Florida's congressional delegation joined  
Cardenas at a news conference at the National Press Club to 
formally announce the convention. 
</P>
<P>
	``Florida will play a major role, a key role, in the election of  
the next president of the United States,'' said Sen. Connie Mack, 
R-Fla., mainly because the state's diverse population, electorate 
and ideals mirror those of the country.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals  
began airing a television commercial Tuesday attacking Vice 
President Al Gore for his support of a program that researches the 
effect of chemicals on humans. 
</P>
<P>
	The study tests the toxicity of about 3,000 widely used  
chemicals. Gore called for such experiments in an Earth Day speech 
last year after the Environmental Defense Fund began pressuring the 
chemical manufacturing industry on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Beth Sweetland, PETA's research director, said the program  
focuses on chemicals already recognized as hazardous, such as 
turpentine and rat poison. 
</P>
<P>
	``The vice president is encouraging bad science and making bad  
policy,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The organization's ``Gore No More'' compaign has included full  
page advertisements in The New York Times and other newspapers. Its 
new commercial features actor Bea Arthur. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore spokesman Chris Lehane said chemical testing is conducted  
on animals ``only when necessary,'' and usually on rats. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is that the goal and focus of this public  
health program is to help protect children and adults from coming 
into contact with possible dangerous chemicals,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lehane said that children were exposed to lead paint for years  
before researchers determined how dangerous it was. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's just pray there's nothing like that now, but we just  
don't know,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Report: Gas Additive Can Be Harmful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After receiving a report today that the  
smog-fighting gasoline additive MTBE is getting into drinking 
water, the Environmental Protection Agency reversed course and 
urged a prompt and significant rollback in use of the chemical. 
</P>
<P>
	The methanol-based additive in ``reformulated gasoline,'' used  
in about a third of the nation's motor fuel in 16 states, once was 
touted as key to cutting air pollution from automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal research shows the compound causes tumors in rats and  
may do so in humans. A University of California study concluded 
that MTBE has affected at least 10,000 groundwater sites in the 
state. Recently California announced it would ban MTBE use, and 
Maine state officials pulled out of the reformulated-gasoline 
program because of concern about MTBE. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel Greenbaum, president of the Boston-based Health Effects  
Institute, said today that MTBE does not yet pose health concerns. 
The panel he chaired found only trace levels of MTBE in 5 percent 
to 10 percent of the drinking water in areas where reformulated 
gasoline is sold. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not an issue of health and safety,'' Greenbaum said.  
``But when you cannot use a water supply because your consumers 
will not drink it, that is a huge loss to a community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	EPA Administrator Carol Browner said Monday that the EPA ``must  
begin to significantly reduce the use of MTBE in gasoline as 
quickly as possible without sacrificing the gains we've made in 
achieving cleaner air.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said the EPA would ask Congress to develop new legislation  
designed to maintain the reformulated-gas program that has been 
credited with cutting air pollution from cars, but with an aim 
toward phasing out MTBE use to protect water supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the nation's air quality and its water supply must be  
protected but ``never one at the expense of the other,'' Browner 
said in a statement on the findings of an EPA advisory panel on the 
future of the gas additive. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Perciasepe, EPA's assistant administrator for air and  
radiation, said today that any changes to the program must also 
protect American consumers from fluctuations in gas prices and 
preserve the use of renewable fuels, such as corn-based ethanol. 
</P>
<P>
	The advisory panel, comprising diverse interests from  
environmentalists to oil industry executives and state regulators, 
found that while reformulated gasoline has contributed to 
significant air quality improvements, MTBE poses a growing threat 
to drinking water. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel found that MTBE molecules travel unusually fast  
through soil and into ground water once gasoline gets into the 
environment. That can happen through leaks in underground tanks as 
well as spills while refueling motor vehicles, boats and other 
equipment such as lawn mowers. 
</P>
<P>
	Coinciding with the advisory panel report's release, a coalition  
of government, environmental and industry groups was to announce 
today a nationwide education campaign on the need to protect 
against gasoline leaks and spills. 
</P>
<P>
	Each year 9 million gallons of gasoline -- the equivalent of a  
full supertanker -- are spilled in the United States from leaks, 
inefficient engines and carelessness, said the Alliance for Proper 
Gasoline Handling, the coalition spearheading the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear what a change in MTBE use would have on gasoline  
prices, but some experts expect it may cause increases at the pump 
as refiners find other ways to reduce toxic chemical releases. It 
also may boost ethanol prospects because that is one of the major 
alternative additives for pollution control. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress in 1990 required that gasoline sold in areas with  
severe air pollution contain a higher amount of oxygen so gasoline 
would burn more completely. Oil companies responded by using MTBE, 
methyl tertiary butyl ether, a methanol-based additive. While other 
additives such as ethanol also could be used, MTBE has been by far 
the widest choice. 
</P>
<P>
	Reformulated gasoline is required to be sold in all or part of  
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, 
Massachusetts, Maryland, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, 
Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas, Virginia and Wisconsin. Arizona 
also uses the fuel because the state's gasoline supplies primarily 
come from California refineries. 
</P>
<P>
	The EPA advisory panel, formally called the Blue Ribbon Panel on  
Oxygenates and Gasoline, concluded that MTBE use in reformulated 
gasoline ``should be reduced substantially.'' Two of the panel's 
members recommended it be banned entirely, and the group said 
Congress should give states clear authority to do just that. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenbaum emphasized that the panel does not call for the  
outright banning of MTBE, but that alternatives to MTBE be more 
widely brought into use as additives to gasoline to ensure the air 
quality gains made under the program are not eroded. 
</P>
<P>
	Northeast states have been pushing for greater flexibility to  
ban MTBE in reformulated gasoline. Jason Grumet, executive director 
of the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management, said 
the MTBE experience makes one thing clear: ``We better be pretty 
careful where we're leaping before we make profound changes in the 
nation's fuel supply again.''

<HEADLINE> Spin Magazine Loves Nirvana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The folks at Spin really love Nirvana and P.J.  
Harvey: The two artists were the only ones to get two albums listed 
on the magazine's top 90 of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Editors in a new issue ranked ``Nevermind'' from the Kurt  
Cobain-led Nirvana at No. 1, while the follow-up, ``In Utero,'' was 
No. 18. 
</P>
<P>
	``The songs on `Nevermind' are sad, cryptic, hostile, childlike,  
and yeah, funny,'' the magazine noted. ``And for a minute in the 
early '90s, Cobain's corrosive plaints rasped like the truth -- the 
wisdom of an abused, smart-alecky white kid with a downturned 
guitar and a dream.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The top five albums also included Public Enemy's ``Fear of a  
Black Planet,'' Harvey's ``To Bring You My Love,'' Beck's 
``Odelay,'' and Pavement's ``Slanted and Enchanted.'' Harvey also 
had No. 37, with ``Rid of Me.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks Push Ahead; Dow Up 140.89 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks posted solid gains today as the  
technology shares that have been beaten down in recent sessions 
rallied anew. 
</P>
<P>
	At 2 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 140.89 at 11,004.05. On Monday, the blue-chip index fell 47.80 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's  
500 index was up 17.44 at 1,365.20, and the Nasdaq composite index 
was up 56.76 at 2,675.95. 
</P>
<P>
	A market slump that began last week had hit the  
technology-dominated Nasdaq most sharply. The index dropped 172.08 
points last week, a loss of 6.1 percent, and shed an additional 
73.21 points Monday. By today, technology shares were beginning to 
look like bargains to some traders. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors moved away from technology stocks for diverse reasons.  
The shares were bid to record highs at the start of July on the 
promise of strong corporate earnings. As a majority of high-tech 
companies met or beat expectations, investors tended to sell off 
their shares, hoping to lock in profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks also have been threatened after Federal  
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan indicated that the Fed remains 
willing to raise interest rates if it determines that doing so 
would hold off inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, a wide range of technology companies rose. Chip maker  
Intel was up 4 5/8 at 67 1/2 and computer maker IBM was up 2 7/8 at 125 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Online auctioneer eBay Inc. extended the pattern of  
post-earnings losses, however. EBay fell 1/2 to 103 7/8 a day after 
announcing that its profits in the recent quarter beat analysts' 
expectations by a penny. 
</P>
<P>
	American Express rose 6 5/8 to 143 1/8 following its strong earnings  
report, released Monday. Analysts said growth prospects for the 
credit-card provider are robust. 
</P>
<P>
	A modest rise in bond prices helped stocks today. This  
afternoon, the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond was at 6.01 
percent, compared with 6.03 percent late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks and bonds received some support from a Conference Board  
report that showed consumer confidence declined in July, after 
eight months of consecutive gains and a rise to a 30-year high. 
Analysts said the report suggested that the nation's continued 
economic growth may not be reaching inflationary levels. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, market watchers are more interested in upcoming reports  
on the employment costs index and the gross domestic product, both 
scheduled for release Thursday. Also, Greenspan will address a 
Senate panel on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Until then, analysts remain unconvinced of the market's  
strength. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is still a market laboring under the lack of real  
momentum in either direction,'' said Gregory Nie, technical analyst 
at Everen Securities in Chicago. He said modest volume indicated 
that many traders are staying out of the market for now. 
</P>
<P>
	On the New York Stock Exchange, volume came to 478.15 million  
shares at midday, ahead of Monday's quiet pace but still fairly 
light. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-3 margin on 
the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was up 5.96 to 641.86, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index was up 1.01 to 791.80. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies was up 3.12 at  
445.99.

<HEADLINE> Columbia Prepares To Head Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) -- NASA's first female shuttle  
commander says she is looking forward to bringing Columbia back to 
Earth tonight, closing out a brief mission that had a fitful start. 
</P>
<P>
	Eileen Collins, who became the first woman to command a U.S.  
spacecraft, said she was not disappointed that the five-member 
crew's short flight -- which included the flawless release of the 
world's most powerful X-ray telescope -- was about to end. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just coming up here in space and getting five days to look at  
the Earth is really great,'' she said during a Monday night news 
conference beamed from Columbia. ``I would never say that I could 
possibly be anything but extremely happy with this flight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The mission began roughly, with two scrubbed launches, a short  
circuit in the control systems just five seconds into liftoff and a 
suspected hydrogen fuel leak that may have lasted through the 
8 1/2-minute ride to orbit. If the leak had become worse, it could 
have caused a premature engine shutdown that would have forced a 
first-ever emergency landing attempt. 
</P>
<P>
	But the trouble ended as soon as Columbia reached orbit on  
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven hours after launch, astronauts Cady Coleman and Michel  
Tognini completed the mission's main objective by releasing the 
$1.5 billion Chandra X-Ray Observatory. The telescope continued a 
smooth flight today, awaiting a third rocket firing this weekend to 
push it farther into space. 
</P>
<P>
	The weather forecast was favorable for a landing tonight at Cape  
Canaveral, Fla. If Columbia lands on time, it will have been the 
shortest planned shuttle flight since Atlantis flew a five-day 
military mission in November 1990. However, Columbia flew just four 
days in April 1997 when a defective fuel cell forced an early 
landing. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins said she has no trepidation about making just the 12th  
night landing in 95 shuttle flights. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm actually looking forward to the landing,'' she said. It  
``will be especially challenging and I think everyone will be up to 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman, asked Monday night about risk, said the telescope ``is  
worth every single thing it took us to get it up there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``As you know in the space program, it is a risky business and  
we understand that,'' she said.

<HEADLINE>  49ers Gamble, Signing Phillips </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STOCKTON, Calif. (AP) -- The 49ers sifted through Lawrence  
Phillips' troubled past, considered his potential, analyzed their 
own needs and came to a hopeful conclusion: maybe he wasn't so bad. 
</P>
<P>
	In any event, the 49ers determined he was a risk worth taking  
and signed Phillips on Monday to a two-year contract worth $1.75 
million, reviving a career shattered by serious brushes with the 
law and a failure to live up to expectations on the field. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Bill Walsh conceded it was a decision that could  
alienate some fans and ticket holders and maybe infuriate a few to 
the point where they would no longer have anything to do with the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	For the 49ers, though, emotion never really entered into the  
equation. It was strictly business. 
</P>
<P>
	And it was based on the belief that Phillips, for all the past  
behavioral problems that cost him jobs with the St. Louis Rams and 
Miami Dolphins, gave the 49ers their best shot at adequately 
replacing injured running back Garrison Hearst. 
</P>
<P>
	``I expect and understand totally fans who would have a concern,  
would be disturbed or even in a case or two, never want to hear the 
word 49ers again or see another game,'' Walsh said at the 
University of the Pacific, where the team opened its training camp 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a calculated decision on our part. We're going to go  
forward from here. It is my hope and expectation that as he 
performs and you become acquainted with him, so much of this 
history will dissipate and dissolve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips' signing culminated more than a week of intense  
negotiations and a monthlong pursuit by the 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a great opportunity. I don't intend to screw it up,''  
Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
	He added he's doing his best to turn a new leaf and leave his  
past problems behind him. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a terrible thing for everyone involved,'' Phillips  
said. ``I don't think anyone involved feels great about it. I 
definitely don't. I'm sure everybody is looking forward and just 
trying to be positive and optimistic about what's forthcoming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At least some of Phillips' money will be going to the league to  
pay a fine for violating the NFL's violent crime policy. 
Commissioner Paul Tagliabue, in a meeting with Phillips two weeks 
ago, cleared him to play but told him he would be subject to the 
fine. 
</P>
<P>
	He pleaded no-contest to assaulting a former girlfriend in  
college, was arrested three times during 19 months with the Rams 
and got released by the Miami Dolphins four weeks after he 
allegedly struck a woman who refused to dance with him in a 
nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
	But Phillips' strong performance in NFL Europe sparked renewed  
interest, and the 49ers edged Buffalo in bidding for him. Some 
teams in need of running backs, Cleveland and Baltimore among them, 
were leery and chose to not pursue him. 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh said he thinks the 49ers can provide a good environment  
for Phillips. But he also said he has warned Phillips he will be 
cut at the first sign of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if this is his last chance but it's very evident  
to him and to everyone that he's running out of time to establish 
himself,'' Walsh said. ``If he doesn't fit in ... he's history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh refused to characterize Phillips' signing as a panic move  
in response to the loss of Hearst to a potentially career 
threatening injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is this a desperate move? Hardly,'' Walsh said. ``It's a  
business move, one we've thoroughly researched.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To those who continue to believe he'll only bring problems,  
Phillips said, ``All you can do is try to prove them wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 24-year-old running back will try to fill the void left by  
the loss of Hearst. Hearst had surgery Saturday to treat 
circulatory complications following a broken left ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	Hearst was San Francisco's most dynamic threat last season,  
rushing for a team-record 1,570 yards. He was hurt on the first 
play during last January's playoff loss at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	The 49ers hope Hearst can return in early December, but coach  
Steve Mariucci said the team must be prepared to play this season 
without him. 
</P>
<P>
	With no capable backup -- the team allowed Terry Kirby to leave  
as a free agent -- the 49ers added running backs Charlie Garner and 
Travis Jervey and put aside their misgivings about Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rams made Phillips the sixth overall selection in the 1996  
draft despite his record of violence at Nebraska. While on 
probation at Nebraska, he was arrested for drunken driving in 
California, leading to a 23-day jail sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Rams, he was a bust on the field and coach Dick  
Vermeil, tired of repeated fines for missed meetings and other 
disciplinary problems, cut Phillips in November 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips signed with Miami in December 1997, but never  
established himself. He was cut a year ago, soon after the 
nightclub episode. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've definitely been humbled,'' Phillips said.  
</P>
<P>
	Trying to save his career, Phillips joined Barcelona of NFL  
Europe and became the league's first 1,000-yard rusher. He has 
embraced religion and become a vegetarian, dropping more than 20 
pounds to become a lighter, faster back. 
</P>
<P>
	The 49ers also settled with their top draft pick. Defensive  
tackle Reggie McGrew, the former Florida star, signed a seven-year, 
$7.4 million contract. The deal included a $2.5 million signing 
bonus and will void after four years if McGrew meets certain 
playing time clauses.

<HEADLINE>  49ers Gamble, Signing Phillips </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STOCKTON, Calif. (AP) -- The 49ers sifted through Lawrence  
Phillips' troubled past, considered his potential, analyzed their 
own needs and came to a hopeful conclusion: maybe he wasn't so bad. 
</P>
<P>
	In any event, the 49ers determined he was a risk worth taking  
and signed Phillips on Monday to a two-year contract worth $1.75 
million, reviving a career shattered by serious brushes with the 
law and a failure to live up to expectations on the field.

<HEADLINE> S&AMP;P 500 Funds: Not All Alike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It seems pretty straightforward -- a mutual fund  
that invests in stocks that are part of the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 
Index. Buy shares of that fund and you'll get a return pretty close 
to that of the S&AMP;P. 
</P>
<P>
	But if you look at the more than 100 funds that focus on the S&AMP;P  
500, you'll find it's more complex than that. Not all S&AMP;P 500 funds 
are alike, mostly because of a variation in returns. 
</P>
<P>
	So far this year, the GE Institutional S&AMP;P 500 Index fund has  
returned nearly 12 percent, while the Pillar Equity Index Fund has 
returned just over 10 percent, according to Lipper Inc. Over the 
same period, the S&AMP;P 500 itself has returned 11.49 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The divergence largely results from fees, the bite taken out of  
an investor's return to pay the costs of running a fund. That 
includes salaries for fund managers and staff, commission for 
buying and selling stocks and printing and mailing costs for 
reports. The disparity can also come from differences in the way 
funds buy and sell S&AMP;P 500 stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Fees are a big issue for funds, investors and the Securities and  
Exchange Commission, which wants fund companies to be more upfront 
about fees. 
</P>
<P>
	The key number for investors trying to size up a fund's fee is  
its expense ratio, which for the average stock fund is about 1.45 
percent. The GE Institutional S&AMP;P fund has an expense ratio of 0.15 
percent; at the Pillar fund, it's 1.8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Does a percentage point or two matter all that much? Over time  
it absolutely does, according to The Independent Adviser, a 
newsletter for Vanguard investors that says it has no ties to the 
mutual fund company. 
</P>
<P>
	The newsletter calculated that $100,000 invested under an  
expense ratio of 0.18 percent -- the ratio for Vanguard's Index 
Trust 500 fund -- would grow to $794,810 over 15 years. That's 
$122,132 more than the amount returned under a 1.45 percent expense 
ratio. 
</P>
<P>
	``It might cost you quite a bit in the long run,'' said Jeremy  
Siegel, a professor of finance at the Wharton School at the 
University of Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	``Either they don't care that much or they're not aware of the  
differences,'' he said of investors who are getting a lower return. 
</P>
<P>
	Many investors do care, and that has helped Vanguard's Index  
Trust 500 fund grow to $92.64 billion in assets, placing it just 
behind the biggest mutual fund, Fidelity Magellan, which has $97.59 
billion (The Magellan, a growth fund, has a 0.62 percent expense 
ratio). 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past five years, Vanguard's Index Trust 500 fund and  
its Institutional Index fund, which also tracks the S&AMP;P 500, have 
been the top two funds in the S&AMP;P 500 category, according to 
Lipper. The Vanguard 500 Index fund has had an annualized return of 
27.08 percent, while the Institutional fund has returned 27.24 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The difference in their returns is due in part to the lower  
costs of an institutional fund -- because it has a different 
investor base, it doesn't need to send reports and newsletters to 
individual investors that can drive up costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Vanguard's edge comes in part from the fact that unlike most  
mutual fund companies, it is owned by the investors in its funds. 
Most other companies are owned by stockholders, and so part of the 
returns generated by a fund must be diverted to them. 
</P>
<P>
	For some investors, there may be good reasons for investors to  
accept a lower return. The choice may be based on convenience -- 
they're already invested in a fund family such as Fidelity and like 
the ease with which they can switch money from one fund to another. 
</P>
<P>
	If they have brokerage accounts with firms like Morgan Stanley  
Dean Witter or Merrill Lynch, they might be more inclined to follow 
the advice of a broker they trust -- and who's likely to steer them 
toward his or her company's own funds. In such cases, brokers are 
also getting a piece of the return. 
</P>
<P>
	While all S&AMP;P 500 index funds focus on the same stocks, there  
are some differences in how they buy those stocks that also affect 
returns, said Jim Folwell, a consultant with the firm Cerulli 
Associates in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	``An index fund does not buy all 500 stocks,'' Folwell said.  
``They buy securities that will represent and track to some 
extent'' the S&AMP;P 500. 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that if when a fund receives money from investors, it  
buys according to an investment model it has set up. 
</P>
<P>
	The best way to find out the differences among funds is to read  
their prospectuses or look them up on their Web sites. Also, the 
Securities and Exchange Commission has a mutual fund cost 
calculator on its Web site (www.sec.gov/mfcc/mfcc-int.htm) to help 
investors estimate how much it costs to own a mutual fund, and to 
compare those costs with other funds.

<HEADLINE>  U.S. Will Respect, Not Fear, Brazil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GUADALAJARA, Mexico (AP) -- Insisting last year's game is a  
distant memory, U.S. coach Bruce Arena wants to take a realistic 
approach to the showdown with Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously it's a great challenge playing against the best team  
in the world,'' he said. ``We don't have fear. We have great 
respect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The teams meet Wednesday night in the FIFA Confederations Cup,  
their first encounter since the United States beat Brazil 1-0 last 
year in the CONCACAF Gold Cup, the championship of soccer's North 
and Central American and Caribbean region. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've never discussed that game,'' Arena said. ``That was a  
long time ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In that game, goalkeeper Kasey Keller was a barrier in what  
Brazilian forward Rivaldo called the best performance by a 
goalkeeper he had ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether Keller, who will probably start Wednesday, still  
knew how to stop Brazil, Arena said, ``No goalkeeper knows how to 
stop Brazil.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Brazilians said Tuesday they are concerned about the U.S.  
team's defense and expect the Americans to be fast and mark 
closely. Brazil coach Wanderley Luxemburgo said his strategy will 
be to ``mark them before they can mark us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good team that knows how to close down the opponent,''  
star forward Ronaldinho said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the players had seen some of the last U.S.-Brazil game,  
and the coach had told them about Brazil's mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll try to do on offense what we didn't do last time,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brazilians do not anticipate a repeat performance from  
Keller. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a good goalie,'' said Brazil's reserve goalkeeper,  
Marcos. ``But Brazil and the United States have played many times. 
The United States won once and they were lucky to get that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the Brazilian players have a lot of respect for the  
up-and-coming American team. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every year they're getting better in general terms,'' team  
captain Emerson said. ``United States, Nigeria, Japan -- you see a 
lot of the national teams are evolving. The United States is one of 
them. They're growing a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Brazilian team came to the Confederations Cup without many  
of its big stars. Much of the attention has been focused on 
Ronaldinho, a 19-year-old forward who many see as the future of 
Brazilian soccer and whom Luxemburgo said he sees as a son. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I was 10 my dad drowned,'' Ronaldinho said. ``I always  
think about him when I play. He's always in my prayers. I wish he 
could see me play.''

<HEADLINE>  Kosovo Albanians Return Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Exhausted but excited, the first  
group of Kosovo Albanian refugees to return from the United States 
finally reached their homeland today, eager to resume lives 
interrupted by war. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like a rebirth,'' Eshref Latifi, 49, said after arriving  
in Kosovo. ``I may not be showing it on the outside, but this is my 
biggest happiness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The nearly 300 refugees flew to neighboring Macedonia and then  
were bused to Kosovo's provincial capital, Pristina, where many 
were greeted with long embraces from relatives who hadn't seen them 
for months. 
</P>
<P>
	Latifi, who spent time at Fort Dix, N.J., and then St. Louis,  
said the refugees were tired after flying all night. But their 
excitement was evident as soon as their plane arrived in Skopje, 
where they piled happily into buses for the short trip home. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can never feel better than in your homeland,'' said  
Shukran Fushnica, 45, one of an extended family of 15 on the plane, 
which arrived from New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The refugees got a jarring early reminder of the harsh reality  
of life in Kosovo. During a stop at a roadblock about 20 miles 
southwest of Pristina, a loud explosion sounded off the road, 
sending them back into the buses at the urging of an immigration 
official. 
</P>
<P>
	The reason for the blast wasn't immediately clear -- it likely  
was a controlled explosion by NATO peacekeepers who now patrol the 
province. The buses then proceeded to Pristina, where they were met 
by a small but emotional crowd at the bus station. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the ethnic Albanians returning from the United States  
were headed for homes in the capital, while others traveled on to 
other towns. 
</P>
<P>
	Tensions in the province have been especially high since  
Friday's killings of 14 Serb farmers near the farming village of 
Gracko, 10 miles south of Pristina. NATO security remained tight in 
and around the village. 
</P>

not derail efforts to steer the province back to normalcy after 
more than a year of bloodshed. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors finished their autopsies on the 14 bodies today, and the  
funerals were scheduled for Wednesday. While British troops kept 
watch, Serbs from elsewhere in Kosovo mowed the grass in the 
cemetery and dug the graves today. Serbian Orthodox Church leaders, 
including Patriarch Pavle, began arriving for the burials.

were shot by Kalashnikov rifles, Dr. Fadil Batalli said.

<P>
	Italian Capt. Gianluca Corsini, a military pathologist who  
supervised the autopsies, said that because of the way the bodies 
were found in a circle, it appeared the victims were trying to flee 
when they were shot. 
</P>
<P>
	The killings -- which Gracko villagers blamed on ethnic Albanians  
-- have increased fear among Kosovo's dwindling Serb population, 
prompting more than 20 Serbs to request escorts to flee the 
province. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 100,000 Serbs are believed to have fled the province  
since the end of the NATO air campaign, leaving no more than about 
60,000 behind.

southwestern village of Kusnin, near Prizren, said Maj. Jan 
Joosten, a spokesman for the peacekeeping force.

<P>
	Local commanders of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army called the  
dump an oversight, acknowledged that it violated a disarmament 
agreement and apologized, Joosten said.

<P>

explanation, and the Germans removed the ammunition to a protected 
storage site, Joosten said.

from the United States. 
</P>

<HEADLINE>  Kosovo Albanians Return Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Exhausted but excited, the first  
group of Kosovo Albanian refugees to return from the United States 
finally reached their homeland today, eager to resume lives 
interrupted by war. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like a rebirth,'' Eshref Latifi, 49, said after arriving  
in Kosovo. ``I may not be showing it on the outside, but this is my 
biggest happiness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The nearly 300 refugees flew to neighboring Macedonia and then  
were bused to Kosovo's provincial capital, Pristina, where many 
were greeted with long embraces from relatives who hadn't seen them 
for months. 
</P>
<P>
	Latifi, who spent time at Fort Dix, N.J., and then St. Louis,  
said the refugees were tired after flying all night. But their 
excitement was evident as soon as their plane arrived in Skopje, 
where they piled happily into buses for the short trip home. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can never feel better than in your homeland,'' said  
Shukran Fushnica, 45, one of an extended family of 15 on the plane, 
which arrived from New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The refugees got a jarring early reminder of the harsh reality  
of life in Kosovo. During a stop at a roadblock about 20 miles 
southwest of Pristina, a loud explosion sounded off the road, 
sending them back into the buses at the urging of an immigration 
official. 
</P>
<P>
	The reason for the blast wasn't immediately clear -- it likely  
was a controlled explosion by NATO peacekeepers who now patrol the 
province. The buses then proceeded to Pristina, where they were met 
by a small but emotional crowd at the bus station. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the ethnic Albanians returning from the United States  
were headed for homes in the capital, while others traveled on to 
other towns. 
</P>
<P>
	Tensions in the province have been especially high since  
Friday's killings of 14 Serb farmers near the farming village of 
Gracko, 10 miles south of Pristina. NATO security remained tight in 
and around the village. 
</P>
<P>
	International officials, however, asserted that the slayings did  
not derail efforts to steer the province back to normalcy after 
more than a year of bloodshed. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors finished their autopsies on the 14 bodies today, and the  
funerals were scheduled for Wednesday. While British troops kept 
watch, Serbs from elsewhere in Kosovo mowed the grass in the 
cemetery and dug the graves today. Serbian Orthodox Church leaders,

<HEADLINE> MGM Reports $249.8 Million Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) -- Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. lost $249.8  
million during the second quarter as the company took charges to 
cover the cost of layoffs and other restructuring activities. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss, forecast by the company last month, amounted to $1.65  
per share. That compared to a loss of $55 million, or 84 cents per 
share, during the year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
	Restructuring charges included $85 million in severance and  
other personnel costs and $140 million in film-related writedowns. 
</P>
<P>
	The company reported revenues of $212.2 million in the three  
months ended June 30, down from $281.2 million in the year-ago 
period. 
</P>
<P>
	Film and television revenues also declined during the period, in  
part because MGM released only one theatrical film during the 1999 
quarter, compared to three a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The studio laid off 80 employees last year in a cost-cutting  
program. MGM also has said it would halt development of new 
television shows to focus its limited resources on 10 programs 
already scheduled to air this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	For the six months ending June 30, MGM lost $556 million, or  
$3.69 per share, on revenue of $470.9 million. In the first six 
months of 1998 the studio lost $73.7 million, or $1.12 per share, 
on revenue of 597.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The studio has struggled financially for more than a decade as a  
result of ownership changes and the sale of key assets. 
</P>
<P>
	MGM went public in 1997, a year after billionaire Kirk Kerkorian  
purchased the studio for a third time. In documents filed at the 
time of the public offering, MGM officials said they did not expect 
to turn a profit for several years. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week MGM said it was seeking approval from the Securities  
and Exchange Commission to sell $750 million in stock to pay debts, 
cover restructuring costs and raise working cash. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the money will go toward a $112.5 million payment MGM  
owes Warner Home Video to cover costs from the early termination of 
a video-distribution deal. Tracinda Corp. has agreed to buy any 
shares not purchased by existing stockholders and the public, MGM 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	MGM shares were down 93 3/4 cents to $19.43 3/4 in trading on the New  
York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> TV Guide Results Meet Expectations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TULSA, Okla. (AP) -- TV Guide Inc.'s second-quarter earnings  
dropped 45 percent from last year, when results were boosted by a 
joint venture involving Turner Vision. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tulsa-based media and communications company had profits of  
$9.8 million, or 6 cents a share, compared with $17.9 million, or 
21 cents a share for the same period in 1998. The results met 
analysts expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	The company formerly operated as United Video Satellite Group.  
The cable channel-guide operator became TV Guide Inc. in March with 
its acquisition of TV Guide Magazine from Rupert Murdoch's News 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The company attributed the decline primarily to the one-time  
gain that came last year with the addition of Turner Visions' 
C-band business to the company's Superstar/Netlink group. 
</P>
<P>
	The issuing of shares of common stock in March and other costs  
associated with the acquisition of the nation's best-selling weekly 
magazine also cut into profits, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	But TV Guide reported that income from operations soared 94  
percent in the second quarter, climbing from $34.2 million in the 
year-ago period to $66.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``The company is superbly positioned for future growth,'' Joe  
Kiener, chairman and chief executive officer said in a news 
release. ``Our stable core of businesses continues with solid 
financial performance and we are well positioned to capture a 
variety of exciting business opportunities that are both content 
and technology driven.'' 
</P>
<P>
	TV Guide has three primary business units: TV Guide  
Entertainment Group, TV Guide Magazine Group and United Video 
Group. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of TV Guide rose $1.75, or 5 percent, to $33.75 in  
trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market.

<HEADLINE> Smoothie-Juice Business Heats Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PLANO, Texas (AP) -- The smell of citrus and the bright colors  
inside the Zuka Juice shop are hard to overlook, but at this moment 
all eyes are focused on the blenders. 
</P>
<P>
	For the shop's customers, there's nothing like a cool smoothie  
to temper the unforgiving summer heat. 
</P>
<P>
	Keith, a United Parcel Service worker who declined to give his  
last name, navigated through the blistering heat all day until his 
uniform was soaked with sweat. He came to the smoothie shop in 
search of his favorite drink, something called the Orchard Oasis 
with wheat grass and carrot juice. 
</P>
<P>
	The smoothie was finally placed in Keith's work-worn hands. Then  
-- satisfaction. Keith has become a regular at Zuka, coming in every 
other day since it opened this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like them because they're cool and they take away your  
hunger,'' he said between sips. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe because they're chilled, maybe because they're seen as a  
healthy alternative to milkshakes, smoothies have caught on. Last 
year, retail juice and smoothie bars in America earned $540 
million, according to Dan Titus, president of the Juice Gallery, a 
consulting and publishing firm. That's a 50 percent increase from 
the year before, and sales could triple this year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The smoothie is basically a trend that is now being  
developed,'' Titus said. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas, home to pavement-melting summer temperatures, has played  
a large role in the spread of the smoothie, which started with 
health-conscious Californians in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the nation's largest smoothie retailers, Jamba Juice,  
opened in 1990 in California but had no Texas stores until it 
merged with Zuka Juice in February and instantly gained 15 shops in 
the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Smoothie King started in 1989 in Louisiana. Three years later,  
it ventured into Texas for the first time, and now Smoothie King 
has 56 locations in the Lone Star State. 
</P>
<P>
	This summer, Dallas-based 7-Eleven, the nation's largest  
convenience store chain, introduced its adult version of the 
Slurpee -- a frozen carbonated beverage -- the Frut Cooler 
(pronounced fruit) nationwide. 7-Eleven had enjoyed success with 
the Cafe Cooler, a frozen cappuccino drink introduced last year, 
and company officials expect similar results from the 
pseudo-smoothie. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're a beverage destination,'' said Sharon Powell, vice  
president of fresh foods at 7-Eleven. ``We consider (the Frut 
Cooler) a huge success. After the Cafe Cooler, this was a natural 
extension.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials with Frullati Cafe and Bakery, a nationwide chain  
based in Dallas, said depending on the location, 40 percent to 60 
percent of their sales are smoothies. 
</P>
<P>
	Smoothie shops attribute much of their sales figures to the  
public's perception that the concoction is a healthy alternative to 
sodas, iced teas and other cold beverages. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consumers are becoming more snack-oriented. People are looking  
for healthy alternatives,'' said Ms. Powell, who conceded it's 
questionable whether smoothies really are that healthy. 
</P>
<P>
	Smoothies typically are made of frozen or fresh fruit, fruit  
juice and ice. Most are low in fat, but they often contain plenty 
of calories from the natural sugar in the fruit. Some also contain 
frozen yogurt or sherbet, which raise the calorie count. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the Zuka Juice's smoothies have about two grams of fat  
and 500 to 600 calories, depending on the type of drink and its 
size. 
</P>
<P>
	The 12-ounce 7-Eleven Frut Coolers have one gram of fat per  
serving. They come in two flavors, orange and strawberry creme, 
which contain 270 and 280 calories, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think our Frut Cooler has been well-received all over the  
country,'' Ms. Powell said. ``Smoothies originally started out on 
the West Coast, but since then it still has been very successful. 
One of our best selling areas has been in the Northeast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some experts wonder about the smoothie's staying power.  
</P>
<P>
	Beverage Digest editor and publisher John Sicher noted that the  
smoothie's $540 million market is dwarfed by the $56 billion soft 
drink industry, and therefore its future is uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
	``Smoothies are a relatively new product, and American people  
like innovation,'' Sicher said. ``Also, people like fruit-flavored 
beverages, but their market is very small. It's a tiny segment of 
the beverage industry. It's way too early to tell what will 
happen.''

<HEADLINE> Mo. Apartment Building Burns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Ten people were taken to hospitals after  
a natural gas explosion touched off a fire at an apartment building 
that sent flames shooting high into the air before the structure 
collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
	The explosion shortly after 8 p.m. Monday happened just as three  
crew members from Missouri Gas Energy were warning residents about 
a natural gas leak, said Brad Humston, a spokesman for the Fire 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the workers were among the most seriously hurt, and were  
taken to the University of Kansas Medical Center's burn unit in 
Kansas City, Kan., said Kevin Crockett, a spokesman for the gas 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	The injured were suffering from burns, lacerations and heat  
exhaustion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw people with what looked like second- and third-degree  
burns, lacerations and bruises,'' said Kevin Cartwright, who was 
riding his bicycle in the area and stopped to help because he has 
paramedic training. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was chaos. I didn't go in and I don't see how anyone could  
have gone in. There was just too much fire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Everyone was accounted for in the building, which collapsed  
about 8:30 p.m. The fire was finally put out at 10:15 p.m., after 
the gas was shut off. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearby buildings were evacuated. A neighborhood school was  
opened so that the evacuees would have a place to escape the heat. 
The high in downtown Kansas City on Monday was 101.

<HEADLINE> Plan Would Pay School Fight Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Students who fall victim to violence on city  
school campuses should have their medical bills covered by the 
district, a city councilor says. 
</P>
<P>
	``They should pay if it happens in the school,'' said Albert  
O'Neil, who plans to file a bill on the issue next week. 
``(They're) going to have to pay through the nose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His proposed city ordinance would target all assaults, down to  
scuffles between friends, that end in injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Under current policy, students injured on public school premises  
during a school activity are reimbursed for medical bills, said 
Chris Horan, executive secretary of the Boston School Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Many familiar with O'Neil's more expansive proposal dismissed it  
as unfeasible. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's basically health insurance,'' said Randy Chapman, former  
head of the Massachusetts Bar Association's criminal justice 
division. ``It's saying, `When you're on school property, we will 
pay for any injustice, regardless of fault.''' 
</P>
<P>
	But O'Neil's idea has some support.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know whether we will be able to do this, but I support  
his intent,'' said City Councilor Peggy Davis-Mullen. ``We have to 
make sure we've done everything in our power to ensure a safe 
atmosphere at school.''

<HEADLINE> Jewell-Libel Case To Be Heard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- A judge will decide whether Richard Jewell was a  
public figure when The Atlanta Journal-Constitution identified him 
as a suspect in the Centennial Olympic Park bombing three years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Jewell has sued the newspaper for libel.  
</P>
<P>
	If Jewell could be considered a public figure, he faces a higher  
standard in proving the newspaper libeled him. 
</P>
<P>
	Jewell, who eventually was cleared by the Justice Department,  
says stories portrayed him as a strange person probably guilty of 
causing the explosion, which killed one person. 
</P>
<P>
	Fulton County State Court Judge John Mather heard arguments  
Monday. He did not indicate when he would rule. 
</P>
<P>
	Newspaper attorney Sean Smith said Jewell was very public in the  
days after the blast. Jewell, a security guard in the park, was 
praised for spotting the satchel that contained the explosive and 
moving people from the area, and granted up to a dozen interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	A private person claiming libel must prove a news organization  
was negligent in reporting false, damaging information. A public 
figure must prove malice, that a news organization knew or 
suspected it was reporting harmful falsehoods and acted with 
reckless disregard.

<HEADLINE> Paup Tears Muscle at Training Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Jacksonville Jaguars linebacker Bryce  
Paup was the first casualty of training camp and he didn't even 
step foot on the field. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10-year veteran suffered a torn pectoral muscle while  
lifting weights and will likely miss Jacksonville's first preseason 
game, Aug. 13 against Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Paup will not participate in drills when training camp begins  
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Paup was second on the team with 6 1/2 sacks last season after  
being signed as a free agent from the Buffalo Bills. This season he 
was expected to be used in more pass-rush situations under new 
defensive coordinator Dom Capers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jaguars also released linebacker James Hamilton on Tuesday.  
Hamilton failed his physical after suffering torn knee ligaments 
last year.

	BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) -- Protectionist measures recently adopted  
by Argentina to curb imports from Brazil has thrown the Mercosur 
trade bloc into a crisis, Argentinian officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Argentina's ambassador to Brazil, Jorge Hugo Herrera Vegas, said  
at a news conference that Mercosur was ``going through a difficult 
phase, perhaps its most difficult.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mercosur is comprised of Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, and  
Uruguay. Bolivia and Chile are associate members. 
</P>
<P>
	Cheaper imports from Brazil following the January devaluation of  
Brazil's currency prompted Argentina to adopt protectionist 
measures for its textiles, steel and home appliances. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Brazil reacted by temporarily suspending trade talks  
with Argentina.

	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- A strike involving tens of  
thousands of truckers snarled traffic across Brazil for a second 
day Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The strike, which union leaders said involved half of the  
country's 1.5 million trucks, was called to protest poor roads, 
high tolls and the price of gas. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal highway police said thousands of trucks were partially  
or totally blocking major routes in 14 of Brazil's 27 states. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 200 trucks were lined up by the side of a major road into  
Rio. In Sao Paulo, police said trucks lined up for 13 miles along 
the Dom Pedro highway, 35 miles outside the city. 
</P>
<P>
	Transportation Minister Eliseu Padilha was quoted as saying he  
would help the truckers bring their complaints to the government. 
Padilha blamed the poor quality of roads on the country's recent 
financial woes, which diverted funds for repairs to other areas.

	MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) -- More than 200 police officers  
patrolled neighborhoods Tuesday at the start of a three-month 
campaign to crack down on juvenile violence in Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
	Special riot forces were deployed Monday night in the  
government's effort to break up more than 100 gangs with 1,600 
members in Managua, Police Chief Franco Montealegre said Tuesday. 
Another 60 gangs of 735 members are believed to operate elsewhere 
in Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
	The gangs are blamed for killings, robberies and vandalism.  
</P>
<P>
	President Arnoldo Aleman said gang members guilty of crimes will  
be prosecuted and others will be subject to anti-gang education 
programs.

	PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) -- The government Tuesday indefinitely  
postponed modifications to Panama's so-called ``gag law'' that 
would tighten controls over reporting on personal lives. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal had led to protests by Panamanian newspapers and  
human rights groups. 
</P>
<P>
	It was scheduled to be presented to Panama's congress Tuesday,  
but the Interior and Justice Ministry said it would be re-examined 
and presented to lawmakers after further discussion. 
</P>
<P>
	The changes would have allowed a low-level official to order  
reporters imprisoned for accurate but embarrassing reports about 
``private'' activities.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Mexico's Congress will ask the Supreme Court  
to decide whether auditors will be granted access to books of a 
bankrupt financial institution that was taken over by the 
government, a legislator announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Fauzi Hamdam of the opposition National Action Party said  
opposition groups, who together hold a majority, agreed the audit 
of Banco Union could clarify allegations the bank illegally funded 
political campaigns of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary 
Party, or PRI. 
</P>
<P>
	President Ernesto Zedillo's administration has argued that  
Mexico's trust secrecy laws prevent it from giving auditors access 
to the records. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamdam said Banco Union is believed to have funneled $25 million  
to PRI campaigns, including Zedillo's presidential bid in 1994. 
Carlos Cabal Peniche, Banco Union's former owner, is facing 
extradition in Australia. He is wanted in Mexico on accusation of 
frauds totaling $700 million.

<HEADLINE> Clintons To Vacation in Mass., N.Y. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will split a 16-day August  
vacation between Martha's Vineyard and New York, where his wife, 
Hillary, is expected to seek a Senate seat. 
</P>
<P>
	Visiting the Massachusetts island of Martha's Vineyard for the  
fifth straight summer, the Clintons once again will stay at the 
20-acre compound owned by Boston businessman Richard Friedman on 
Oyster Pond. They will be there Aug. 19-28, press spokesman Joe 
Lockhart said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	On Aug. 28, they will switch to the Hamptons on Long Island for  
a weekend series of fund-raising events staged by the Democratic 
National Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	After that, the Clintons will spend Aug. 30 to Sept. 3 in  
Skaneateles, a quiet resort town of 7,500 people on Skaneateles 
Lake just southwest of Syracuse. It once was a stop on the Civil 
War-era Underground Railroad that ferried slaves north to freedom. 
The Clintons will stay at the lakeside home of Thomas McDonald, a 
real estate developer. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart said he was not aware of plans for any political  
appearances by the president or first lady in New York other than 
the weekend events on Long Island. 
</P>
<P>
	After New York, the president probably will spend a couple days  
at Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland's Catoctin 
Mountains, Lockhart said.

<HEADLINE> Craig Takes Phillips Under His Wing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STOCKTON, Calif. (AP) -- Retired running back Roger Craig is  
taking a special interest in Lawrence Phillips. It's part of his 
job. 
</P>
<P>
	The 49ers recruited Craig, one of the top running backs in the  
team's history, as a mentor to the newly signed Phillips, who on 
Tuesday took part in his first NFL practice in a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Between the 49ers' two training camp workouts at the University  
of the Pacific, Phillips and Craig lunched together and walked 
around the campus, talking quietly. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just here giving him a little advice,'' said Craig, who  
like Phillips played at Nebraska before starring for San Francisco 
in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want to clutter his brain with a lot of little  
things,'' Craig said. ``We don't want to treat him like a little 
kid. He knows what he has to do. He knows right from wrong. 
Basically, the main thing I want to see him do is just display some 
of his talents. The main thing is just taking care of football 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips said he welcomed the attention from Craig.  
</P>
<P>
	``He said he's checking me out. He's representing Nebraska,''  
said Phillips, who was assigned Craig's old number, 33. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Bill Walsh said Phillips, returning to the NFL  
after problems with the law, alcohol, and weight cost him jobs with 
the St. Louis Rams and Miami Dolphins, would not receive special 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 49ers are doing what they can to help Phillips make the  
most of his latest chance. They've brought Craig to camp, veterans 
on the team are encouraging Phillips along with position coach Tom 
Rathman, also a former Nebraska star, and team personnel consultant 
sociologist Harry Edwards is available for further support. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a network of people who will work with him,'' Walsh  
said. ``But we know that lurking out there could be a problem, 
unforeseen by us or anybody else. We're alert to that and we're 
doing everything we can to accept him and have him assimilated into 
the organization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips resurrected his faltering career by starring this  
spring for Barcelona of NFL Europe. He was signed Monday by San 
Francisco and became the front-runner to replace injured Garrison 
Hearst, who is expected to miss most of the season because of 
complications in his recovery from a broken ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got the helmet and jersey so I feel like a 49er now,''  
Phillips said. ``It's a lot of offense to get in. This is about the 
fifth offense I've learned in about three years, so it's going to 
take some time but I look forward to getting it down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said coach Steve Mariucci: ``His head has got to be swimming.  
It's a brand new system. There's a lot of things he's got to grab 
on to. He showed some good speed. He caught the ball well. He did 
fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh said Phillips' initial practice with the team was  
impressive. The former No. 1 pick has dropped about 20 pounds from 
his playing weight while with the Rams and Dolphins in 1996-97. 
</P>
<P>
	``He looked super quick today, super explosive and fast,'' Walsh  
said. ``They say with the Rams, he looked lethargic and out of 
shape and he stayed that way, so I'm hopeful that he'll continue to 
dedicate himself to football and stay focused and be able to 
perform for us. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think he's for real. Now, how good he'll be, we just don't  
know. He might be a great player. He might be a good player. He 
might be a solid player. He won't be a poor player. He'll be one of 
those three and we'll take it from there.''

<HEADLINE> Dolphins' Rookies Sign Contracts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVIE, Fla. (AP) -- Miami Dolphins rookie running back J.J.  
Johnson stared at his first NFL paycheck in disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never seen that much money,'' Johnson said. ``I said,  
`You're going to hand that to me?''' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins' top draft pick received a $980,000 signing bonus  
Tuesday as part of a four-year, $2.65 million deal. 
</P>
<P>
	He was among six rookies signing contracts before reporting to  
training camp. The first practice for the newcomers is Wednesday, 
with the entire team taking the field for the first time Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Fullback Rod Konrad also signed a four-year contract. Signing  
three-year deals were running back Cecil Collins, center Grey 
Ruegamer, punter Brent Bartholomew and guard Joe Wong. 
</P>
<P>
	All seven Miami draft choices are now under contract. They were  
aware that coach Jimmy Johnson has little patience for rookies who 
report late because of a negotiating stalemate. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point in his career, he probably thinks it's kind of  
tedious to have to deal with,'' Konrad said. ``He's worried about 
winning the Super Bowl, not about a couple of thousand dollars here 
or there. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't want to make the boss angry, just like any other  
job. I think it was important to get here on time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, for one, had no complaints about the deal he signed.  
His family spent time on welfare when he grew up in Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most money you ever talked about was $487 in a summer job,  
and that was when you let it double up for two weeks,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, the 39th player taken in the draft, is expected to  
challenge incumbent Karim Abdul-Jabbar for a starting job. 
</P>
<P>
	Another candidate at running back, Collins, agreed to forgo the  
traditional lump-sum signing bonus. Instead he'll receive his 
$110,00 bonus in installments over the length of his three-year, 
$860,000 contract -- if he stays out of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins, a fifth-round draft pick, battled drug and legal  
problems that limited him to six games in college.

<HEADLINE> Eagles' Coach Says Race Not an Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Assertions by Donovan McNabb's agent that  
race may be playing a role in contract negotiations with the 
Philadelphia Eagles are ``absurd,'' coach Andy Reid said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Race will never been an issue,'' Reid said, addressing a  
broadcast interview with agent Fletcher Smith aired Tuesday in 
Philadelphia. ``Not now, nor never.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview on Philadelphia's Comcast SportsNet, Smith  
raised the possibility that the Eagles were reluctant to give 
McNabb a contract without voidable years because he is black. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's not much history with black quarterbacks, but you  
definitely don't want to see Tim Couch, Peyton Manning, Ryan Leaf, 
Kerry Collins get the kind of deals they got and it was no issue. 
We'll pay these guys,'' Smith said in the cable TV interview. 
</P>
<P>
	``If (McNabb) hasn't said it to me or anyone else, I know he's  
like, well, why now? Why pull the plug now when for the past couple 
of years you've been consistently doing it for the white 
quarterbacks? And now it's my turn, and I have to stick to the 
structure that, if I play so well then I'll get paid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith told The Associated Press Tuesday night that the issue of  
race has never come up in his negotiations with Joe Banner, the 
Eagles' executive vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have not brought up race with them,'' Smith said. ``I have  
always negotiated based on Donovan McNabb's talents, not the color 
of his skin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McNabb, also on Comcast, said the issue ``has been blown way out  
of proportion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really on the verge of trying to make me look bad, and I  
haven't set foot on the field,'' McNabb said. ``This is not a 
racial issue and we don't want anyone to think that. ... We want to 
continue to work with this contract deal, get it over so I can 
report to camp.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Eagles and McNabb are believed to be discussing details of a  
$50 million, seven-year contract including a signing bonus of up to 
$12 million. The deal is hung up on the issues of voidable years 
and a buyback clause. The Eagles don't want to include them, while 
McNabb wants to be able to renegotiate after three or four seasons 
-- and possibly get another huge signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	McNabb, the No. 2 overall pick in the draft, was due in camp  
Sunday night and missed a second day of practice for rookies and 
selected veterans Tuesday. McNabb is the projected backup to 
starting quarterback Doug Pederson. 
</P>
<P>
	Banner has not commented specifically on the talks. But he  
issued his strongest challenge yet to McNabb at the team's training 
facility at Lehigh University on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Banner cited Steve McNair, the No. 3 pick in the 1995 draft, as  
a quarterback who benefited from not having voidable years and a 
buyback clause. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a structure that we think has some problems with it,''  
Banner said. ``And thus, we're asking somebody to have both the 
courage and the foresight to do something different.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith told the AP he had no reason to believe race was the  
reason the Eagles opposed such a deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really don't think race is an issue in this contract  
negotiation,'' Smith said. ``Prior to drafting Donovan, voidable 
years was an issue they did not care to deal with. And knowing Andy 
Reid's history, Brett Favre didn't have a voidable deal. I just 
think that they truly feel it's not in the best interests of the 
player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Eagles still have three other draft picks unsigned:  
third-round pick Doug Brzezinski and fourth-round picks Na Brown 
and Damon Moore. Veterans are due in camp Wednesday, and the first 
full-squad workout is scheduled for Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want them all in here now,'' Reid said. ``I am not in favor  
of holdouts.''

<HEADLINE> Cruise Ship Runs Aground in Alaska </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) -- A small cruise ship with more than 100  
people aboard ran aground and was reported taking on water ``out of 
control'' Tuesday in Alaska coastal waters. Passengers were 
evacuated safely. 
</P>
<P>
	Coast Guard spokesman Roger Wetherell said no injuries had been  
reported. The ship radioed a mayday at 9:06 a.m. ADT (1:06 p.m. 
EDT). 
</P>
<P>
	All passengers were taken off the vessel and were safely aboard  
another tourist boat, he said late this morning. A few crew members 
stayed behind to try to save the ship. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's aground, and they are flooding,'' Wetherell said, adding  
that the remaining crew members were in no danger. ``There are 
plenty of vessels in the area to take them off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The vessel was identified as the ``Spirit of '98,'' one of seven  
small cruise ships operated by Seattle-based Alaska 
Sightseeing-Cruise West. 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Novak-Beatty, vice president of sales and marketing, said  
there were 94 passengers and a crew of 22, for a total of 116 on 
board, when it hit a rock. Wetherell gave a slightly higher number 
of crew, 26. 
</P>
<P>
	The 192-foot ship, built to resemble the lines of the old-time  
coastal cruising vessels and with an 1890s decor, had left 
Anchorage and was headed for Juneau, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two helicopters dropped pumps to help with the flooding and a  
Coast Guard cutter was en route to the scene, Wetherell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other cruise ships were on the scene, and the boat ``was  
reporting `out-of-control flooding' via a radio report,'' Wetherell 
said. ``It's an emergency situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ship is in Alaska's Inside Passage, the long, narrow stretch  
of islands that extends southeastward from the main part of the 
state. It offers tourists spectacular views of scenery and marine 
wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
	The site is 16 miles into Tracy Arm, a long, narrow fjord about  
40 miles southeast of Juneau, Alaska's capital. Two large glaciers 
in Tracy Arm extend to the water's edge, allowing tourists to see 
huge chunks of ice plunge into the water. 
</P>
<P>
	Water temperatures in the area generally run in the low 50s at  
this time of year.

<HEADLINE> Gas Additive Alert Raises Cost Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal panel's recommendation that a widely  
used gasoline additive be substantially reduced because it is 
contaminating water raises the question of what would take its 
place and whether Americans would have to pay more at the pump to 
get it. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel recognized the additive MTBE has improved air quality  
in several metropolitan areas but said concerns are growing about 
its appearance in groundwater, where it causes a foul smell and 
taste while not yet posing a health risk. 
</P>
<P>
	The methanol-based additive in ``reformulated gasoline'' is used  
in 16 states, or altogether in about a third of the nation's motor 
fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	The Environmental Protection Agency essentially agreed with the  
recommendations of the advisory panel it convened on the fuel's 
future. EPA Administrator Carol Browner said the agency would ask 
Congress to develop legislation maintaining the reformulated-gas 
program but aiming to phase out MTBE. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Perciasepe, EPA's assistant administrator for air and  
radiation, said Tuesday any changes to the program must safeguard 
water supplies without sacrificing recent gains in air quality. A 
reduction in MTBE use must also protect American consumers from 
fluctuations in gas prices and preserve the use of renewable fuels, 
such as corn-based ethanol, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear how that would be accomplished.  
</P>
<P>
	Daniel Greenbaum, president of the Boston-based Health Effects  
Institute and chairman of the advisory panel, said the group 
suggested that MTBE be phased out over four years to allow refiners 
enough time to find other ways to reduce toxic chemical releases 
from cars. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given enough time for a transition ... the impact on  
(gasoline) prices should be very small or not noticeable,'' 
Greenbaum said. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy analysts tend to agree. But confusion about what  
alternative might be available or what Congress may do makes it too 
early to know. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people who this is really traumatic for are the refiners  
who've invested production money into MTBE,'' said analyst Tim 
Evans at Pegasus Econometric Group. 
</P>
<P>
	If many refiners go bankrupt from their investments in MTBE, a  
reduction in overall production capacity could lead to spot 
gasoline shortages and higher prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Vancouver, Canada-based Methanex Corp. has a $1.4 billion  
lawsuit against the U.S. government for what it contends is a 
violation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, relating to 
California's decision to ban MTBE by 2002. Methanex is the world's 
leading producer of methanol, which it supplies to MTBE producers. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Evans said: ``I wouldn't expect to see any immediate  
impact of prices at the pump.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The most obvious replacement for MTBE would be ethanol, but it  
costs more to manufacture. It also evaporates more readily, 
particularly in hot summer months, releasing organic pollutants. 
For that reason, it is used in cleaner-burning fuel mainly during 
the winter. 
</P>
<P>
	And ethanol is primarily manufactured in the Midwest, making it  
difficult now to get it to key West Coast and Northeast markets. 
</P>
<P>
	But Bruce Knight, chief lobbyist for the National Corn Growers  
Association, said ethanol plants produce enough of the fuel now to 
meet the needs of the California market. They could quickly grow 
their capacity -- outside the Midwest, if needed -- further, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another possible alternative is a blend of alkalytes and  
aromatics, which are derived from crude oil. But for that to happen 
Congress would need to change the law mandating that reformulated 
gasoline contain a higher amount of oxygen. 
</P>
<P>
	Aromatics are slightly less expensive than ethanol, but pose  
risks of increased toxic emissions. Alkalytes, though clean 
burning, are low-octane and would require pricey capital 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Refiners are looking for the cheapest, cost-effective solution  
and, of course, one that will be accepted by consumers and 
regulators,'' Evans said.

resolve a Medicare billing dispute with the federal government. The 
money would cover the settlement and related legal bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Beverly said today that it had reached a tentative understanding  
with the U.S. Justice Department on potential settlements of the 
investigations. It refused to elaborate, noting that the settlement 
is not final. 
</P>
<P>
	The company acknowledged last November that two former employees  
were among the targets of a criminal investigation being carried 
out by a federal grand jury in San Francisco. Beverly was already 
under civil investigation for its billing practices and faces a 
shareholder lawsuit, which claims Beverly misled investors about 
its billing practices. 
</P>
<P>
	Beverly plans to take the pre-tax charges in the second quarter  
for the potential settlements and related matters totaling between 
$175 million and $225 million, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's earnings report for the second quarter will be  
postponed until no later than Aug. 20, Beverly said. But Beverly 
said preliminary results show it earned 13 cents per share from 
operations, before any special charges. That would be in line with 
analysts' forecasts.

<HEADLINE> Blood Tests Confirm Jagger's Baby </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Blood tests confirm that Mick Jagger is the father  
of Brazilian model Luciana Morad's son, the spokesman for the 
Rolling Stone lead singer said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy to confirm that -- the blood test was positive,''  
Jagger's spokesman Bernard Doherty told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	``But the tape stops here. Sorry I can't embellish, but it's a  
`legal matter, baby,' as The Who once said,'' Doherty added. 
</P>
<P>
	The test paves the way for Ms. Morad, 29, to seek a settlement  
from the 56-year-old rocker for their son, now three months old. 
</P>
<P>
	She named the baby Lucas Morad Jagger. But Jagger had refused to  
acknowledge paternity publicly. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas-born model Jerry Hall, Jagger's partner for 22 years,  
split with him over Ms. Morad's pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hall, 43, and Jagger announced this month that they were  
seeking to have their 1991 marriage on the Indonesia island of Bali 
annulled and had reached a financial settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	News reports said Jagger's lawyers told him the results of the  
blood test while he was in France, where he has a chateau. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hall and their four children, Elizabeth, 15, James, 13,  
Georgia May, 7, and Gabriel, 1, were also in France, the reports 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucas is Jagger's seventh child. He also has Karis, 28, by  
singer Marsha Hunt, and Jade, 26, with his ex-wife Bianca. 
</P>
<P>
	News reports said Ms. Morad had the blood tests done in New York  
two weeks ago, and samples were sent to a London clinic. 
</P>
<P>
	Details of Jagger's settlement with Ms. Hall have not been  
announced. 
</P>
<P>
	British newspapers carried estimates ranging from $15 million to  
$50 million, after Ms. Hall yielded to Jagger's insistence that 
they were never legally married. His lawyers said the civil part of 
the ceremony in Bali was not completed.

<HEADLINE> Georgia Sect Alarms Neighbors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EATONTON, Ga. (AP) -- A sect founded by an ex-convict has built  
two 40-foot pyramids and a giant sphinx amid the pines and red clay 
of middle Georgia, alarming some with its armed guards and 
prophecies of deliverance by spaceships from another galaxy. 
</P>
<P>
	The sheriff and the sect had an armed confrontation in April  
when he tried to escort a building inspector onto the property, and 
tensions are running so high that mediators from the U.S. Justice 
Department were called in earlier this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	The members call themselves the Yamassee Native American  
Nuwaubians and claim to have created a utopian society on their 
476-acre compound of Egyptian-style architecture. 
</P>
<P>
	Many people in and around Eatonton -- a rural community that was  
the birthplace of Alice Walker, author of ``The Color Purple,'' and 
Joel Chandler Harris, creator of the Uncle Remus tales -- fear the 
Nuwaubians are similar to Heaven's Gate, the cult whose 39 members 
committed mass suicide in 1997 in Rancho Santa Fe, Calif., and the 
People's Temple followers of Jim Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	``This group here has a combination of all those schools of  
thought,'' Sheriff Howard Sills said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 100 Nuwaubians live in trailers on the compound. An  
additional 300 to 400 reside elsewhere in Putnam County. The 
Nuwaubians, most of whom are black, claim to be descended from the 
Egyptians and the Yamassees, a tribe of Indians indigenous to this 
part of Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	Past the armed guards at the compound's entryway, Nile River  
Road stretches between two rows of statues of Egyptian royalty. A 
gold pyramid serves as a mini-mall, with a bookstore and clothing 
store. A labyrinth leads to the black pyramid, which serves as a 
church. Inside, an Egyptian-like chant hums over speakers 24 hours 
a day. 
</P>
<P>
	The group's lodge houses busts of King Tut and Queen Nefertiti  
and a glass tomb holding an alien-like creature with a huge head 
and bulging eyes. 
</P>
<P>
	Members say they pay no dues and are free to come and go. And  
they insist that suicide is not in their plans. 
</P>
<P>
	The group's founder, Dwight York, who calls himself Malachi Z.  
York, served time in New York in the 1960s for assault, resisting 
arrest and possession of a dangerous weapon. 
</P>
<P>
	York has claimed to be from a galaxy called Illyuwn and has said  
that in 2003 spaceships are going to descend from the sky and pick 
up a chosen 144,000 people for a rebirth. Most recently, York has 
referred to himself as Chief Black Eagle, a reincarnated leader of 
the Yamassee Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a constantly opportunistic evolving ideology,'' the  
sheriff said. ``We've gone from an extraterrestrial to a Christian 
pastor to an Indian leader with willful and wanton resistance to 
legal authority time and time again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The group's spokeswoman, Renee McDade, and Marshall Chance, who  
is referred to as the Nuwaubians' leader, distance themselves from 
the space prophecies of York, who lives on the compound and refuses 
to give interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're all awaiting the coming of the real Messiah,'' Chance  
said. ``We are a biblical people. If it's not in the Bible, then 
we're not concerned about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The group moved to Georgia in 1993 from New York, where it had  
operated under other names, including the Ansaru Allah Community. A 
1993 FBI report linked that group to a myriad of crimes, including 
arson and extortion. 
</P>
<P>
	Until recently, the Nuwaubians pretty much kept to themselves.  
Then last year, the county rejected a request to have the property 
rezoned from agricultural to commercial. Since then, the Nuwaubians 
have been at odds with county officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after the building inspector was denied access, the  
sheriff and his deputies tried to enter. 
</P>
<P>
	``The armed guards literally stood in front of my car,'' Sills  
said. ``It was obvious to me that this was provocative and they 
wanted to provoke some sort of armed confrontation, so I decided to 
leave.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the sheriff returned two months later, ``we were served  
with this cockamamie lawsuit that said we'd be fined $5 million if 
we went onto the property,'' Sills said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nuwaubians said they have met all the permit requirements.  
``We feel they're trying to impede us from our progress here. It 
feels like they're trying to put us out of our land,'' Chance said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mediators from the Justice Department's Community Dispute  
Resolution unit were asked to get involved after the Nuwaubians 
leveled charges of racism against officials in Putnam County, which 
has about 17,000 people, more than one-third of them black. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Nuwaubians felt they were being harassed, the county  
officials said they were being harassed,'' mediator Ernie 
Stallworth said. ``Everyone was pointing a finger and that has 
lessened, but I still believe we have work to do.''

<HEADLINE> Internet Sites Sell Personal Info </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Private information unwittingly released by  
Internet users is not protected under federal guidelines because 
few Web sites adhere to them, according to a study released 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on previous reports on Internet users and Web sites, the  
Center for Democracy and Technology said Congress should pass 
legislation to force compliance with guidelines issued by the 
Federal Trade Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	The lack of privacy protection on the Internet contributes to a  
pervasive ``unease that someone's watching you,'' the center's 
counsel, Deirdre Mulligan, told the Senate Commerce Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``Internet privacy on the Internet should be the rule rather  
than the exception,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	To that end, Sen. Conrad Burns, R-Mont., chairman of Commerce's  
communications subcommittee, has introduced legislation to require 
Web site operators to post privacy policies on their pages and 
allow consumers to direct those operators not to share their 
private information. 
</P>
<P>
	But Commerce Committee Chairman John McCain, R-Ariz., has sided  
with the FTC, refusing to move forward with legislation until it 
becomes clearer whether private industries on the Web can police 
themselves. That stance virtually kills Burns' bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Internet changes daily, if not hourly. Any regulation  
imposed today may be ineffective in protecting consumers 
tomorrow,'' McCain said in a statement. But, he warned, ``the 
industry should not be misled into thinking that these results 
represent some type of pass on future legislation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain noted that a study by Georgetown University found that 94  
percent of the most frequently used 100 Web site have privacy 
disclosure, as do two-thirds of randomly visited sites. 
</P>
<P>
	But Mulligan and Marc Rotenberg, director of the Electronic  
Privacy Information Center, told lawmakers that many of those 
disclosures do nothing else -- such as explain how a consumer might 
refuse to allow his or her information to be sold or shared. 
</P>
<P>
	``Privacy policy is not the same as privacy protection,''  
Rotenberg told the panel. If Congress does not provide better 
enforcement and clearer guidelines, consumers will be faced with a 
choice to ``either use the Internet and give up their privacy, or 
stay off the Net,'' he added.

<HEADLINE> Woodstock Violence Blamed on Few </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME, N.Y. (AP) -- Tom Fall tossed another bundle of merchandise  
into his truck, then paused to ponder what had gone wrong at 
Woodstock '99. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was supposed to be peace, love and harmony,'' the  
52-year-old vendor from Vermont said Monday. ``I was at the first 
one. That was a disaster also, but there was no violence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fall was one of the lucky vendors whose goods were spared in the  
vandalism, looting and more than a dozen fires that erupted at the 
end of the three-day concert Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The destruction was caused by only a few hundred people among  
the 150,000 concertgoers, officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This festival did not collapse into chaos,'' Oneida County  
Executive Ralph Eannace said. ``This festival had a very serious 
problem for a few hours last night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seven men aged 17 to 35 were arrested on charges of rioting,  
disorderly conduct and criminal mischief at the 3,000-acre venue on 
the grounds of a former Air Force base. 
</P>
<P>
	Two state troopers were among seven people injured before the  
scene was brought under control a few hours before daybreak Monday. 
One concertgoer suffered a broken leg and back injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials refused to call the episode a riot.  
</P>
<P>
	``These weren't all bad kids,'' State Police Superintendent  
James McMahon said. ``A lot of them came up and said they were 
upset. The majority were tremendous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those caught on the festival grounds had a much different  
perspective as they watched an unruly mob loot and burn 12 
tractor-trailers, set fire to a small bus and several portable 
toilets, overturn a car and destroy several vendor booths, ATM 
machines, light stands and a speaker tower. 
</P>
<P>
	The mob rampaged for nearly 90 minutes before 500 state troopers  
in riot gear moved in. 
</P>
<P>
	``It all started with a bunch of drunks,'' 22-year-old Lou  
Velazquez of Bellingham, Mass., said Monday as he loaded his 
backpack for the trip home. ``They just wanted to go wild.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Security inside the festival was provided by a 1,250-person  
force that organizers said was not properly trained to handle a 
riot. When the violence started, troopers were outside the grounds 
helping guide about 75,000 people who were leaving early. 
</P>
<P>
	Woodstock organizers will have to pay for most of the damage.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was a shame. It put a sour ending on this, that it had to  
end this way,'' said organizer Michael Lang. ``I'm disappointed. 
Right to the end it was going so well.''

<HEADLINE> Gang Leader on Marshals' Wanted List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Johnny Jackson, who allegedly directs  
narcotics trade for Chicago's largest street gang, was added to the 
U.S. Marshals list of 15 most wanted fugitives Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Acting Marshals Director George R. Havens said Jackson, 27, is  
the highest ranking member of the Gangster Disciples street gang 
not already in prison. He has been charged in a 50-count federal 
drug conspiracy indictment return in 1995 in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gangster Disciples number more than 5,000, and Jackson is  
said to direct daily street operations for the gang's cocaine and 
other narcotics trade and money collection operation, the marshals 
service said. 
</P>
<P>
	A convicted felon with an extensive and violent record, Jackson  
also is sought for questioning about the December 1998 apartment 
fire that killed his common-law wife, Carla Hill, the service said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of his co-defendants in the drug indictment have been  
convicted of multiple homicides, including the murder of a federal 
witness. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson himself faces charges that carry a minimum mandatory  
sentence of life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``Due to the violent nature of Jackson's criminal background, he  
should be considered armed and quite dangerous,'' Havens said. 
``Jackson has made statements that he will not be taken the by 
United States Marshals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson is 5-feet-9, weighs 185 pounds and has brown eyes and  
closely cropped, or possibly shaven, black hair and a medium black 
complexion. He also has a gap between his front teeth and his right 
earlobe has been pierced several times. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson has used the aliases Johnny Clasberry or Clasbarry.  
</P>
<P>
	The marshals service is prepared to pay for information leading  
to Jackson's arrest and conviction. Those with information are 
asked to call the nearest marshals office or their headquarters at 
1-800-WANTED2.

<HEADLINE> Toddler Locked in Day Care Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT PIERCE, Fla. (AP) -- A 14-month-old boy lay alone in a  
day-care center crib for almost two hours after closing time before 
a police officer broke a couple of windows and reunited him with 
his distraught mother. 
</P>
<P>
	Keisa King said Monday that she is no longer sending her son,  
Elijha Weathers, to the Wee Wuns Wunderland. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no way you can leave a baby alone for that period of  
time,'' King said, bouncing Elijha, who is asthmatic, on her knee. 
``One of the women there told police that she knew he was there -- 
it was just time to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Employees at Wee Wuns Wunderland would not comment about the  
Friday incident. Lt. Sean Baldwin said police and the state child 
welfare authorities are investigating. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, when King couldn't get to the day-care center by  
closing time, Wee Wuns workers have taken Elijha to another center 
that operates 24 hours. So after knocking at the center's doors 
Friday, King prepared to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	Elijha's cry stopped her, and she summoned police. Elijha had no  
obvious injuries, but his eyes were swollen from crying and asthma, 
King said.

<HEADLINE> Canada Beats U.S. in Baseball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- The pros came to play for the United  
States, their first foray into international baseball. What the 
minor leaguers got in their opening game of the Pan American Games 
was an eyeful. And a loss of major league proportions. 
</P>
<P>
	Gut-wrenching, stunning, incredulous.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're pretty disappointed, but we'll get over it,'' U.S.  
manager Buddy Bell insisted after Canada scored four two-out runs 
in the bottom of the 11th for a 7-6 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	The rally came after Canadian manager Ernie Whitt held up the  
game 30 minutes protesting a rules interpretation by umpires and 
international officials over how many times he could visit the 
mound. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitt got ejected, his protest was rejected, but the Canadians  
got a stirring victory. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. led 6-3 in the top of the 11th after a two-run homer by  
Jason Hardtke. But then after the long delay, the Americans 
couldn't put the host team away. 
</P>
<P>
	Andy Stewart tied the game with a three-run homer off Scott  
Stewart. Then the Canadians loaded the bases on two walks and a hit 
batter. They won when Stubby Clapp's short fly ball to left fell in 
front of left fielder Shawn Gilbert, who called off shortstop 
Travis Dawkins. 
</P>
<P>
	The Canadian players rushed onto the field in celebration, while  
the stunned Americans slowly, dejectedly walked off. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitt said he was just trying to make his point with his tirade.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still upset, but it's nice to come back and get the win.  
If we have rules, let's abide by them. This gives them something to 
clarify,'' Whitt said, clutching a rulebook as he entered a media 
area. 
</P>
<P>
	After the U.S. team took its three-run lead, Whitt walked to the  
mound to talk with pitcher Chad Ricketts. He'd also visited 
Ricketts in the 10th. 
</P>
<P>
	``According to the rules, you are allowed three free trips to  
the mound, plus an additional trip for every three innings you play 
in extra innings. And when you take a pitcher out, it doesn't count 
as a trip,'' Whitt said. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I went out in the 10th, it should have been my first trip  
to the mound. According to the rules, I still have three more trips 
I could burn, but the umpire (Cuba's Nelson Diaz) told me I had to 
remove the pitcher at that time and that's when I blew up. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a little language difference. ... He was persistent.  
He went to the IBA and the IBA withheld it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After receiving Whitt's written protest, International Baseball  
Association officials and the umpires huddled underneath the 
stadium. The protest was disallowed. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitt had to leave the field, although he could be seen peeking  
up the tunnel when Canada staged its rally. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitt said officials told him that after nine innings the three  
initial trips are gone, even if they have not been used up. That 
means there is only one free trip remaining, and he said that is 
not specified in the rulebook. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell, whose team is under pressure to get to the gold medal game  
or miss the Sydney Olympics next year, was admittedly confused by 
the controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It really doesn't make sense to me,'' Bell said. ``But nobody  
asked me about it. So I don't think they care what I think. That 
didn't cost us the game. But it's something that needs to be looked 
at,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a little excessive, I would think.''

<HEADLINE> Woman Gets $4.4M in Hospital Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A jury awarded $4.4 million to a woman who  
said her newborn baby suffered brain damage because hospital staff 
didn't respond quickly enough when monitors showed that the fetus 
had problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Ina Hutchinson sued Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, saying  
personnel should have called an obstetrician sooner. 
</P>
<P>
	She said her 6-year-old son, Christopher Patterson, is  
profoundly retarded, incontinent, has to use a wheelchair and has 
limited ability to speak. He was delivered at Cedars-Sinai Medical 
Center in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	``A phone call would have prevented this tragic outcome,''  
Jerome L. Ringler, the lead plaintiff's attorney, said in a story 
published in today's Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
	Hospital attorney Michael A. O'Flaherty said he will appeal the  
verdict, reached Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	He said evidence showed Christopher's brain was damaged before  
his mother got to the hospital, and the judge did not allow the 
hospital to present key evidence that its employees followed proper 
procedure.

<HEADLINE> Report: Gas Additive Can Be Harmful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Environmental Protection Agency, awaiting  
a report today critical of smog-fighting MTBE in gasoline, is 
reversing course and urging a prompt and significant rollback in 
the additive's use because it is getting into drinking water. 
</P>
<P>
	The methanol-based additive in so-called reformulated gasoline,  
used in about a third of the nation's motor fuel in 16 states, once 
was touted as key to cutting air pollution from automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal research shows that the compound causes tumors in rats  
and may do so in humans. A University of California study showed 
that the additive has affected at least 10,000 groundwater sites 
throughout the state. Recently California announced it would ban 
MTBE use, and Maine state officials pulled out of the reformulated 
gasoline program because of concern about MTBE. 
</P>
<P>
	EPA Administrator Carol Browner said Monday that the EPA ``must  
begin to significantly reduce the use of MTBE in gasoline as 
quickly as possible without sacrificing the gains we've made in 
achieving cleaner air.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said the EPA would ask Congress to develop new legislation  
designed to maintain the reformulated gas program that has been 
credited with cutting air pollution from cars, but with an aim 
toward phasing out MTBE use to protect water supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the nation's air quality and its water supply must be  
protected but ``never one at the expense of the other,'' Browner 
said in a statement anticipating the release of findings of an EPA 
advisory panel today on the future of the gas additive. 
</P>
<P>
	The advisory panel, comprising diverse interests from  
environmentalists to oil industry executives and state regulators, 
found that while reformulated gasoline has contributed to 
significant air quality improvements, MTBE poses a growing threat 
to drinking water, according to draft summary obtained by The 
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel found that MTBE molecules travel unusually fast  
through soil and into ground water once gasoline gets into the 
environment. That can happen through leaks in underground tanks as 
well as spills while refueling motor vehicles, boats and other 
equipment such as lawn mowers. 
</P>
<P>
	Coinciding with the advisory panel report's release, a coalition  
of government, environmental and industry groups was to announce 
today a nationwide education campaign on the need to protect 
against gasoline leaks and spills. 
</P>
<P>
	Each year 9 million gallons of gasoline -- the equivalent of a  
full supertanker -- are spilled in the United States from leaks, 
inefficient engines and carelessness, said the Alliance for Proper 
Gasoline Handling, the coalition spearheading the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear what a change in MTBE use would have on gasoline  
prices, but some experts expect it may cause increases at the pump 
as refiners find other ways to reduce toxic chemical releases. It 
also may boost ethanol prospects because that is one of the major 
alternative additives for pollution control. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress in 1990 required that gasoline sold in areas with  
severe air pollution contain a higher amount of oxygen so gasoline 
would burn more completely. Oil companies responded by using MTBE, 
methyl tertiary butyl ether, a methanol-based additive. While other 
additives such as ethanol also could be used, MTBE has been by far 
the widest choice. 
</P>
<P>
	Reformulated gasoline is required to be sold in all or part of  
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, 
Massachusetts, Maryland, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, 
Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas, Virginia and Wisconsin. Arizona 
also uses the fuel because the state's gasoline supplies primarily 
come from California refineries. 
</P>
<P>
	The EPA advisory panel, formally called the Blue Ribbon Panel on  
Oxygenates and Gasoline, concluded that MTBE use in reformulated 
gasoline ``should be reduced substantially.'' Two of the panel's 
members recommended it be banned entirely, and the group said 
Congress should give states clear authority to do just that. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a report summary, the panel found trace levels of  
MTBE in 5 percent to 10 percent of the drinking water in areas 
where reformulated gasoline is sold. While those levels themselves 
pose no health concerns, the panel felt they were a strong enough 
signal that widespread use of MTBE could pose a future threat to 
the drinking water supply. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not saying there's a public health threat now,'' Daniel  
Greenbaum, president of the Boston-based Health Effects Institute 
and chairman of the advisory panel, said in an interview. ``We're 
trying to prevent what has become a low-level, widespread problem 
from becoming a larger and worse problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greenbaum emphasized that the panel does not call for the  
outright banning of MTBE, but that alternatives to MTBE be more 
widely brought into use as additives to gasoline to ensure the air 
quality gains made under the program are not eroded. 
</P>
<P>
	Northeast states have been pushing for greater flexibility to  
ban MTBE in reformulated gasoline. Jason Grumet, executive director 
of the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management, said 
the MTBE experience makes one thing clear: ``We better be pretty 
careful where we're leaping before we make profound changes in the 
nation's fuel supply again.''

<HEADLINE> Handyman Admits to 4 Killings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK, Calif. (AP) -- A motel handyman described  
in detail for a television interview how he killed a naturalist and 
three Yosemite sightseers, saying he had dreamed of such crimes 
since childhood. 
</P>
<P>
	Cary Stayner told San Francisco's KBWB-TV in an off-camera  
jailhouse interview Monday how he killed Joie Ruth Armstrong last 
week and Carole Sund, her daughter Juli and family friend Silvina 
Pelosso last winter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am guilty,'' Stayner said. ``I did murder Carole Sund, Juli  
Sund, Silvina Pelosso and Joie Armstrong. ... None of the women 
were sexually abused in any way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The stunning admission was the latest twist in a strange case  
dating to mid-February, when the sightseers vanished. 
</P>
<P>
	Only days ago, authorities said they believed those responsible  
for the high-profile slayings near one of the nation's premier 
national parks were already behind bars. Stayner, who had worked 
and lived at the lodge where the three were last seen alive, was 
questioned months ago and ruled out as a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner, 37, told KBWB that he had fantasized about killing  
women for 30 years before acting on his dreams. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he strangled Ms. Pelosso, 16, and Carole Sund, 42, in  
their rented cabin at the Cedar Lodge in El Portal, just outside 
Yosemite's western boundary. He said he then took Juli Sund to a 
lake, where he killed the 15-year-old girl early the next morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The women were reported missing on Feb. 17. It was more than a  
month before their bodies were found. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner told KBWB he abandoned the group's rental car with the  
bodies of Ms. Pelosso and Carole Sund inside, returning two days 
later to burn evidence and to retrieve Mrs. Sund's wallet, which he 
dumped in Modesto to confuse authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner said he was the person who tipped the FBI to the  
whereabouts of Ms. Sund's body by sending an anonymous letter. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspect also said he thought he had gotten away with the  
crimes and did not leave the area for fear of drawing attention to 
himself. Everything changed when he struck up a chance conversation 
with Ms. Armstrong last week and was unable to resist killing her 
when he realized she was alone, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Her decapitated body was found last Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	To the victims' families, Stayner said, ``I am sorry their loved  
ones were where they were when they were. I wish I could have 
controlled myself and not done what I did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	FBI agent Nick Rossi said he could not say whether Stayner's  
statements were consistent with what he has told investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	Sources speaking on condition of anonymity told The Associated  
Press earlier Monday that Stayner confessed to beheading Ms. 
Armstrong and killing the other women. One source said 
investigators are trying to corroborate his story and determine 
whether others were involved. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner said nothing at a court appearance Monday in Sacramento,  
where a federal magistrate ordered him held pending arraignment 
Aug. 6 in Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
	A grand jury is reportedly looking into whether a loose-knit  
group of methamphetamine users were involved in the sightseer 
killings. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're not off the hook yet,'' an unidentified source told  
the San Francisco Chronicle. ``It's very difficult to believe he 
(Stayner) did this on his own.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner, an avid outdoorsman with youthful, clean-cut good  
looks, worked and lived at the Cedar Lodge where the sightseers 
stayed and Ms. Armstrong was an occasional visitor. His sport 
utility vehicle was spotted near her remote cabin Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Twice Thursday, park rangers and sheriff's deputies questioned  
Stayner and searched his car. Once, they grabbed his backpack to 
look for Ms. Armstrong's head, but found nothing and let Stayner 
go, according to an FBI affidavit. Ms. Armstrong's head was later 
found near her body. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner failed to show up for work Friday -- his first absence in  
a year and a half -- and FBI agents sought him again. He was found 
at a nudist colony near Sacramento after someone there recognized 
him from news reports and called authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner then confessed to the agents, the FBI said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Stayner name already is part of the annals of California  
crime. Stayner's younger brother, Steven, was kidnapped in Merced 
in 1972 and held for seven years by a man who sexually abused him. 
He escaped and was reunited with his family, but died in 1989, aged 
24, in a hit-and-run accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner's uncle Jesse Stayner died a year later after being shot  
by his own gun. The Merced County sheriff's office has reopened the 
case, considering Cary Stayner as a suspect.

<HEADLINE> Sumitomo Sues Credit Lyonnais Rouse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese trading company Sumitomo Corp. sued Credit  
Lyonnais Rouse today, accusing it of assisting a former Sumitomo 
employee who caused massive losses through illegal copper trades. 
</P>
<P>
	In a lawsuit filed in the High Court of England and Wales in  
London, Sumitomo is seeking about $308 million from Credit Lyonnais 
Rouse. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit accuses Credit Lyonnais Rouse of dishonestly  
assisting Yasuo Hamanaka, the former Sumitomo employee, to make 
unauthorized trades that resulted in losses of $2.6 billion, 
Sumitomo said. It did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	Credit Lyonnais Rouse, the London-based subsidiary of France's  
Credit Lyonnais, denied any wrongdoing and said it will contest 
Sumitomo's lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``It considers the business relationship between the two  
organizations to have been conducted properly and openly in all 
aspects,'' it said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Sumitomo sued UBS AG of Switzerland and Chase  
Manhattan Corp. of the United States demanding compensation for 
loans they allegedly provided to Hamanaka. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1996 disclosure of Hamanaka's illegal trades shook world  
copper markets, and raised questions about oversight at Japanese 
corporations. 
</P>
<P>
	The former star copper trader, who pleaded guilty to forgery and  
fraud charges, was sentenced to eight years in prison in March 
1998.

<HEADLINE> House GOP Would Cut NASA 10 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Members of both parties say they will try to  
ease a 10 percent cut in NASA's budget that has been approved by a 
House subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Alan Mollohan, D-W.Va., criticized the ``enormous,  
devastating'' reduction in the space agency's budget as a House 
Appropriations Committee subcommittee, on a voice vote Monday, 
approved a $93.8 billion measure financing housing, veterans, 
science and environmental programs for next year. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA Administrator Daniel Goldin said such cuts, if ever  
enacted, would result in the agency having to lay off workers, 
close two or three of its 10 centers and sustain delays in 
deploying the space station. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're talking about gutting space exploration,'' he told  
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Subcommittee Chairman James Walsh, R-N.Y., the bill's chief  
author, said the cuts in space spending were ``perhaps the most 
difficult and painful choices'' he made in writing the measure. 
</P>
<P>
	Referring to that and other reductions, he said he would ``make  
every effort to address these difficulties'' later this year, when 
the legislation is likely to be part of budget negotiations with 
the Clinton administration expected to result in higher spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the legislation, the National Aeronautics and Space  
Administration would get $12.3 billion for fiscal 2000, which 
begins Oct. 1. The space agency received $13.7 billion this year, 
and President Clinton requested $13.6 billion for next. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure would provide $2.4 billion for the international  
space station, one of NASA's highest priorities. That's $100 
million more than this year, only half the boost Clinton requested. 
</P>
<P>
	It is elsewhere that NASA would feel the pinch. The legislation  
would deny the president's $150 million request for future missions 
of the Earth observing system, which studies climate, and trim $75 
million from future Mars exploration missions as well. The space 
shuttle would get $150 million less than Clinton wants. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill's cuts reflect the GOP's efforts to try living within  
spending limits enacted in 1997 in the budget-balancing agreement 
with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	To help stay within those limits, the subcommittee would  
designate $3 billion in veterans health-care spending and $2.5 
billion in disaster assistance as ``emergencies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under budget law, that means those items would be exempt from  
spending limits. Clinton had proposed making the disaster spending 
an emergency, but not the veterans' money. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel also claimed savings by reducing the Tennessee Valley  
Authority's ability to borrow by $3 billion -- loans the agency is 
not expected to seek anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would provide $7.3 billion for the Environmental  
Protection Agency, $100 million above Clinton's request but nearly 
$300 million below this year. Within that total, it would provide 
$115 million for climate change technology -- a favorite of Vice 
President Al Gore -- just half the administration's request. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans would provide $18.3 billion for veteran's health  
care, $1 billion more than this year and Clinton's original 
request. Gore said Monday the administration now wants $1 billion 
more as well, as veterans' groups apply pressure for more spending. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure also provides $26.1 billion for the Department of  
Housing and Urban Development, $2 billion less than Clinton 
requested but $2 billion more than this year. Money for inner-city 
development and aid for public housing renters would be cut below 
Clinton's requests. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo said the cut  
``strikes a terrible blow against families and communities in need, 
ensuring that those left behind on America's road to prosperity 
will fall even further back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the GOP-dominated Senate voted to restore a rule it  
abandoned four years ago that will make it harder to use spending 
bills to change laws. The near party-line vote to renew that rule 
was 53-45. 
</P>
<P>
	The lack of the rule in recent years made it easier for  
Democrats to slow work on spending bills and force debate -- and 
often votes -- on patients' rights and other issues.

<HEADLINE>  Cubans Complain at Pan Am Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- While Cuban athletes are winning  
medals, Cuban officials are winning no friends at the Pan American 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	As expected, the Cubans are running second to the United States  
in the medal count and have been dominant in such strongholds as 
wrestling and baseball. Their top sport, boxing, hasn't even begun 
yet. 
</P>
<P>
	A bit more surprising has been the actions of the country's  
federation members. They contend the local media have provoked 
Cubans to defect, and comments by Cuban President Fidel Castro have 
heightened tensions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have never seen so many tricks, so much filth in the Pan  
American Games,'' Castro told Communist Party faithful during a 
speech Monday. ``We are competing in enemy territory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I have absolutely no idea where he is coming from,'' Dick  
Schultz, executive director of the U.S. Olympic Committee, said 
Tuesday. ``His athletes are doing quite well. They're getting good 
recognition, win lose or draw, and the fans have been very friendly 
to the Cubans. ... This one came out of left field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Castro claimed there were significant changes in the rules for  
baseball, ``the most important, the most attractive sport.'' But 
his team, which has been the international champion for decades, 
needs to beat clubs made up merely of minor leaguers to qualify for 
the Sydney Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Games organizers apparently aren't too disturbed by Castro's  
remarks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see any criticism of our organization from what he  
said,'' Brian Koshul, Pan Ams press secretary, said. ``Politics 
between Cuba and the United States has been going since 1957. 
Sports goes beyond politics. 
</P>
<P>
	``Politics might have an intrusion on some games, but we're  
trying not to let that happen. Politics is for politicians. I'm not 
in a position to criticize anything the head of a government says. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was critical of the U.S. and Canadian governments. He was  
critical of the media of writing why people defect. He was critical 
of the media for writing how people defect. ... I don't know why he 
said it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, members of the Cuban delegation to the games  
complained about stories in the Winnipeg Sun, contending the 
newspaper was encouraging Cubans to defect. 
</P>
<P>
	``This situation is contrary to the Olympic spirit and to the  
sports spirit in general,'' said Jose Ramon Fernandez, president of 
the Cuban Olympic Committee. ``The Cuban delegation does not accept 
these methods, which are contrary to the spirit of friendship and 
hospitality with which the Canadian people have received us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cuban pistol shooter Abel Juncosa Reyes asked for asylum before  
the games. Reporter Lisette Cepero of Radio Rebelde also has sought 
asylum. The Sun ran a story including a statement by Enrico Blanco, 
a former boxer who defected in 1967 and now lives in Texas, that 
Fernandez said incited Cubans ``to desert.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, a news conference with high jump world record holder  
Javier Sotomayor was canceled without explanation from the Cuban 
delegation. But, earlier in the games, Cuban spokesman Pedro 
Cabrera said, ``We are fed up with questions about defection. We 
are here to compete and we are not afraid of deserters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even as Sotomayor's news conference was being called off, Cuban  
wrestler Yoel Romero was losing to American Les Gutches in a 
renewal of their bitter rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
	After Gutches beat Romero in overtime in the 187-pound class  
match, the American lightly pounded the back of the Cuban with his 
hands. Both stood up and began yelling at each other, with Gutches, 
of Corvallis, Ore., taunting Romero and screaming in his face. 
Romero pointed his finger at Gutches and yelled right back, and the 
referee separated them. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've wrestled four times. There have been some exchanges.  
We're both in the same boat,'' said Gutches, the 1997 world 
champion, who lost to Romero in their two most recent meetings. 
``He did the same thing to me the last time. In Spokane (at the 
World Cup), the love taps went the other way. I'm not proud of it, 
but it goes both ways.''

of the media for writing how people defect. ... I don't know why he 
said it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, members of the Cuban delegation to the games  
complained about stories in the Winnipeg Sun, contending the 
newspaper was encouraging Cubans to defect. 
</P>
<P>
	``This situation is contrary to the Olympic spirit and to the  
sports spirit in general,'' said Jose Ramon Fernandez, president of 
the Cuban Olympic Committee. ``The Cuban delegation does not accept 
these methods, which are contrary to the spirit of friendship and 
hospitality with which the Canadian people have received us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cuban pistol shooter Abel Juncosa Reyes asked for asylum before  
the games. Reporter Lisette Cepero of Radio Rebelde also has sought 
asylum. The Sun ran a story including a statement by Enrico Blanco, 
a former boxer who defected in 1967 and now lives in Texas, that 
Fernandez said incited Cubans ``to desert.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, a news conference with high jump world record holder  
Javier Sotomayor was canceled without explanation from the Cuban 
delegation. But, earlier in the games, Cuban spokesman Pedro 
Cabrera said, ``We are fed up with questions about defection. We 
are here to compete and we are not afraid of deserters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even as Sotomayor's news conference was being called off, Cuban  
wrestler Yoel Romero was losing to American Les Gutches in a 
renewal of their bitter rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
	After Gutches beat Romero in overtime in the 187-pound class  
match, the American lightly pounded the back of the Cuban with his 
hands. Both stood up and began yelling at each other, with Gutches, 
of Corvallis, Ore., taunting Romero and screaming in his face. 
Romero pointed his finger at Gutches and yelled right back, and the 
referee separated them. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've wrestled four times. There have been some exchanges.  
We're both in the same boat,'' said Gutches, the 1997 world 
champion, who lost to Romero in their two most recent meetings. 
``He did the same thing to me the last time. In Spokane (at the 
World Cup), the love taps went the other way. I'm not proud of it, 
but it goes both ways.''

<HEADLINE> Palladium, Platinum, Grains Fall  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Grain and soybean futures extended their sharp slide Tuesday on  
the Chicago Board of Trade as prospects for bumper fall harvests 
improved with more favorable weather conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, palladium and platinum futures fell sharply,  
while energy futures continued a retreat. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean futures tumbled nearly 6 percent, nearly reaching the  
exchange imposed loss limit, as rain fell overnight in central 
Illinois and moved on to Indiana and Ohio -- areas where dry soil 
had raised concerns about crop conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn and spring wheat futures also tumbled, with investors  
giving back much of the gains made last week, as forecasters called 
for moderating temperatures across the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Brutally hot weather last week baked vulnerable crops, but the  
damage was not as severe as originally thought. The U.S. 
Agriculture Department's weekly crop update found that corn and 
soybean crops in the good-to-excellent category posted only a 2 
percentage-point decline; investors were expecting a 3 
percentage-point decline, or more. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans in particular appear poised to shatter production  
records. The young plants do not enter their crucial flowering 
stage full-force for at least a week, and they are more hardy than 
corn and wheat and can tolerate weather extremes. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery fell 7 1/4 cents to $2.67 3/4 a bushel;  
December corn fell 8 cents, or 3.7 percent, to $2.08 1/2 a bushel; 
December oats fell 4 1/4 cents to $1.12 1/2 a bushel; November soybeans 
fell 26 3/4 cents to $4.25 1/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Palladium and platinum futures fell sharply on the New York  
Mercantile Exchange after Russian officials indicated their are 
enough supplies available for export to avoid serious shortages 
later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian exports to Western manufacturers were disrupted in April  
-- after just a few weeks of shipments -- following the imposition of 
new export taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Large contracts still have not been set for manufacturers, who  
use the metal for jewelry and more increasingly in producing 
catalytic converters for cleaner-burning automobiles. But investors 
worried the statements could signal that commitments were being 
made to get exports back on track. 
</P>
<P>
	September palladium fell $5.65 to $338.35 an ounce; October  
platinum fell in sympathy, dipping $5.60 to $348.40 an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude and its products fell a second day on the New York  
Mercantile Exchange as investors bet weekly inventory data will 
show another build in supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Petroleum Institute's closely followed report was  
expected to show a supply build over the past week as some refinery 
problems were overcome, leading to increase production of gasoline 
and other products at a time when seasonal demand is at its peak 
and beginning to wane. 
</P>
<P>
	September crude fell 14 cents to $20.38 a barrel; August heating  
oil fell 0.40 cent to 50.71 cents a gallon, while the more active 
September contract fell 0.37 cent to 51.55 cents a gallon. August 
unleaded gasoline fell 0.40 cent to 61.35 cents a gallon, while 
more-active September fell 0.54 cent to 60.41 cents a gallon. 
September natural gas fell 1.3 cents to $2.625 for each 1,000 cubic 
feet.

<HEADLINE> Feds Won't Regulate Cable Net Access </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators have chosen a wait-and-see  
attitude as the legal brawl rages on over whether cable companies 
offering high-speed Internet services must share lines with their 
competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Federal Communications Commission has made one point  
clear: Even in the absence of federal intervention, it does not 
want thousands of local municipalities coming up with their own 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is in the national interest that we have a national  
broadband policy,'' FCC Chairman Bill Kennard said in a speech in 
San Francisco last week. ``The FCC has the authority to set one, 
and we have. We have taken a deregulatory approach, an approach 
that will let this nascent industry flourish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So-called broadband access over cable lines provides connection  
speeds dozens of times faster than today's telephone modems. But 
consumer groups say the flip side of this is that cable companies -- 
which are not regulated as ``common carriers'' -- control not only 
the wires, but the programs that people see. 
</P>
<P>
	Cable companies could also deprive consumers of content choice  
over the Internet, says Gene Kimmelman, co-director of the 
Consumers Union's Washington office. 
</P>
<P>
	Cable, phone, satellite and wireless companies are all racing to  
build these high-speed connections and win customers. So far, only 
about a million American homes have cable Internet hookups, 
compared with the more than 30 million on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	For this reason, the FCC says it is too early to pinpoint  
anti-competitive concerns and has declined to force cable companies 
to open up their lines to competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	But the FCC's hands-off policy hasn't deterred some local  
leaders from taking matters into their own hands. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge backed the decision by Portland, Ore., area  
cable officials ordering AT&AMP;T, after its acquisition of cable 
company Tele-Communications Inc., to open its high-speed cable 
lines to rival Internet companies. The company is appealing. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioners in Broward County, Fla., voted for a similar  
requirement, prompting AT&AMP;T to file suit Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Municipal officials assembled in St. Louis for the National  
Association of Counties meeting last week insisted in a resolution 
that ``it is essential that local government franchise authorities 
have the authority to require that all cable companies provide open 
access to Internet service providers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Federal regulators don't think that is an effective way to  
implement policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The prospect of inconsistent rules and regulations promulgated  
by 30,000 local regulatory agencies does not produce a predictable 
regulatory environment,'' said Deborah Lathen, chief of the FCC's 
Cable Services Bureau, last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission plans to file a friend-of-the-court brief for  
AT&AMP;T's appeal of the Portland decision to explain the need for a 
national policy. On Monday, Kennard applauded the decision by San 
Francisco's city supervisors to approve the transfer of the cable 
franchise from TCI to AT&AMP;T, and hold off on forcing open access, 
pending the outcome of the Portland case. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC's stance has drawn the ire of organizations like the  
openNET Coalition, a lobbying group AOL formed with other Internet 
providers and regional phone companies, that want access to the 
pipelines. 
</P>
<P>
	``Doing nothing while AT&AMP;T turns a cable monopoly into an  
Internet monopoly is not a policy; it's surrender,'' said Greg 
Simon, the coalition's co-director. 
</P>
<P>
	Others say that while the FCC's hands-off policy might get  
high-speed Internet service out to consumers more quickly, 
regulators will later on face a serious problem with a few 
companies dominating the market. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T says its presence in the broadband arena has actually  
fueled competition, such as that among local phone companies that 
are speeding up the Internet services they offer and cutting 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also says that its foes are taking the issue to the  
local level as a last-ditch resort. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've been rejected at every other decision-making level,''  
said Jim Cicconi, AT&AMP;T's general counsel.

<HEADLINE> Fla. Woman Falls Into Storm Drain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NAPLES, Fla. (AP) -- A woman leaving a movie theater stepped into  
a storm drain whose grate was askew and was swept nearly 100 feet 
through a pipe before firefighters rescued her. 
</P>
<P>
	Susannah Halston, 45, suffered a cut on the back of her head  
from hitting the pavement as she fell into the drain in a parking 
lot Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The water-filled pipe measured 30 inches in diameter, with only  
5 inches of air space, North Naples fire Capt. Marvin Steffen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters rescued Ms. Halston within five minutes after  
prying off a second grate above her and lowering a ladder. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff's deputies said they were looking for two boys who might  
have information about why the grate was pulled part-way off the 
opening.

	Japan Passes New Security Guidelines  
</P>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo has abided by a pacifist constitution that  
bars it from offensive military action since the end of World War 
II, but the annual defense report it issued today makes clear that 
Japan has the right to defend itself -- including the use of 
military strikes to prevent likely attacks. The 500-page defense 
report came amid the country's efforts to redefine its security 
role in an increasingly tense Asia. Under pressure from the United 
States to take more responsibility for its defense, Japan's 
parliament passed a new set of security guidelines in May that 
allow Japanese forces to provide greater assistance to American 
troops in Asia and give the United States greater access to air- 
and seaports here.

	Nerve Agent in Iraq To Be Destroyed

<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- A team of chemical experts was ordered  
today to destroy VX nerve agent left in a U.N. laboratory in 
Baghdad after Iraq's allies failed to convince the Security Council 
to hold the samples for further analysis. The majority of the 
15-member council, which includes the U.S., backed U.N. weapons 
inspectors who said the small quantities of VX could only be used 
to calibrate equipment, posed no danger, and should be destroyed. 
But Russia, China and France demanded an analysis of the VX, 
intimating that the material might have been used improperly to 
contaminate fragments of Iraqi missile warheads. The Iraqi 
government has accused the U.N. Special Commission of spying, and 
Russia and China have demanded its abolition.

	Senate Spars Over Tax Cut, Veto Threatened  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans and Democrats sparred today on the  
eve of Senate debate over tax cuts, with Vice President Al Gore 
accusing the GOP of ignoring Medicare. Majority Leader Trent Lott 
said Congress should return budget surplus money to taxpayers and 
predicted passage of the $792 billion, 10-year tax cut measure 
before the week is out. President Clinton has vowed a veto, though, 
and a final compromise, if there is one, is weeks or months away. 
The centerpiece of the GOP proposal would reduce the 15 percent 
income tax rate to 14 percent, effective in 2001. The measure also 
contains tax breaks for education, IRAs, long-term care insurance, 
small businesses and estates.

	Arafat To Consider Wye Delay

	EREZ CROSSING, Gaza Strip (AP) -- Palestinian leader Yasser  
Arafat reluctantly agreed today to consider Israeli Prime Minister 
Ehud Barak's request to delay Israeli territorial pullbacks from 
the West Bank. Arafat made clear he was not inclined to agree to 
any slowdown in Israeli withdrawals mandated under the 
U.S.-brokered Wye accord. Barak said he had presented arguments in 
favor of combining some territorial withdrawals with comprehensive 
talks on an overall peace settlement between Israel and the 
Palestinians. Palestinians fear such a merging of Wye and so-called 
final status talks will cause delays in the ceding of land and 
perhaps other provisions of the pact as well.

today that investigators will examine the fuel tank construction on 
minivans from model years 1996-1999 and some pickups from model 
years 1994-99. The agency estimates there are about 2 million of 
the minivans and nearly 1.3 million of the pickups on the road.

<HEADLINE> Brooks, Bidwell Glad To Be in Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- Luckily for Aaron Brooks and Josh  
Bidwell, their first impressions on Green Bay Packers coaches were 
made well before the first week of training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Green Bay's two fourth-round draft picks signed contracts and  
reported to camp on Tuesday, a day after their fellow rookies and 
free agents did. Brooks and Bidwell were the last of the Packers' 
12 picks to sign. 
</P>
<P>
	But both already had participated in minicamps with the Packers  
during the summer, and neither felt out of the loop despite their 
small extended vacations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was glad to get back in the groove of things,'' said Brooks,  
who led Virginia to a 9-3 record and a Peach Bowl berth in his 
senior season. ``I felt like I fit right in because I'd already had 
a lot of reps in minicamp.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks looks like a leading contender in the race to be one of  
Brett Favre's backups. While veteran Rick Mirer is the likely No. 
2, Brooks has a combination of athleticism, arm strength, 
intelligence and experience that could prove too tempting for the 
Packers to pass up for the No. 3 slot. 
</P>
<P>
	In two years as a starter at Virginia, Brooks directed a  
multiple-set offense that threw the ball long and often. He did it 
again on Tuesday at the Packers' training camp, wowing fans with 
several long bombs during scrimmage drills. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks thinks he'll fit well within offensive coordinator  
Sherman Lewis' aggressive, wide-open West Coast scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love it,'' he said. ``The challenge for me right now is to  
absorb as much of the offense as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Bidwell, signing a contract ended what could have been an  
ugly standoff. The Packers gambled a fourth-round pick on the 
Oregon graduate, and he wanted to quickly assure them it hadn't 
been wasted. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just wanted it to be all over,'' Bidwell said. ``It's more  
of an anxiety than anything ... but now it's nice to know I won't 
have to deal with it for three years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bidwell was known in college for his booming kicks, and the  
Packers expect him to be their starting punter -- so much so that 
the only other punter in camp is journeyman Will Brice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like I need to be confident and treat it like it's my  
job to lose,'' Bidwell said.

<HEADLINE> All Umpires Rescind Resignations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In what appears to be an overwhelming defeat for  
major league umpires, their threatened walkout collapsed Tuesday 
when all of the umps withdrew their resignations. 
</P>
<P>
	However, about one-third of the 68 major league umpires will  
lose their jobs anyway, because the American and National leagues 
already have hired 25 replacements from the minor leagues, two 
high-ranking baseball officials said, speaking on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	AL president Gene Budig sent letters to nine AL umpires on  
Monday accepting their resignations, according to the officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar letters to as many as 13 NL umps will be sent by NL  
president Len Coleman later this week, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The umpires had escalated their labor battle with baseball on  
July 14 by voting to resign en masse on Sept. 2, but the strategy 
began to falter when some of the umps began to take back their 
resignations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, it didn't turn out to be the right move because we  
had defectors,'' umpire Rich Garcia told ESPN Tuesday before the 
Tigers-Indians game in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia still expressed confidence in union leader Richie  
Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason we have what we have today is because of Richie  
Phillips,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, umpires sued the AL and NL in federal court in  
Philadelphia, seeking a court order that would allow them to 
withdraw the resignations prior to the Sept. 2 effective. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for owners and umpires held a conference call Tuesday  
with U.S. District Judge Edmund V. Ludwig, who refused to issue a 
temporary restraining order to prevent owners from accepting the 
resignations, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Without such an order, the umpires baseball isn't taking back  
will be forced to spend years in court in an effort to regain their 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball commissioner Bud Selig declined comment, spokesman Rich  
Levin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips issued a statement saying ``a group of very fine  
umpires stand very tall and will hold their heads high forever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They are to be admired for their resolve and courage,''  
Phillips said. ``They are confident that they will eventually 
prevail in this very unseemly affair that was deliberately provoked 
by major league baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Phillips said ``unfair labor practice charges are being  
pursued before the National Labor Relations Board,'' the NLRB's 
Philadelphia office, where umpires usually file, said nothing had 
been received by Tuesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
	Several baseball lawyers said they expect a battle among the  
divided umpires on whether Phillips, their lawyer since 1978, will 
be in charge of negotiations this offseason for a new labor 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires announced their mass resignations after a meeting in  
Philadelphia on July 14, and 56 of the 68 umpires submitted 
resignation letters in the following week. 
</P>
<P>
	By last Friday, 14 of those 56 umpires had withdrawn their  
resignations. The rest of the withdrawals were sent to the leagues 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires decided on the resignation strategy because they feared  
owners would lock them out when their labor contract expires Dec. 
31, and the agreement contains a no-strike clause. 
</P>
<P>
	The nine AL umps who were sent letters Monday accepting their  
resignations are Drew Coble, Jim Evans, Dale Ford, Rich Garcia, Ed 
Hickox, Mark Johnson, Ken Kaiser, Greg Kosc and Larry McCoy. 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia was rated the third-best AL umpire by players in a survey  
last winter, while Coble was rated sixth. 
</P>
<P>
	The only NL umpires assured of keeping their jobs are Wally  
Bell, Mark Hirschbeck and Jeff Nelson.

<HEADLINE>  Kamerling Sets 50m Butterfly Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- Sweden's Anna-Karin Kammerling lived up  
to her reputation as the women's fastest swimmer in the butterfly 
Tuesday by breaking her world record in 50-meters. 
</P>
<P>
	The 19-year Kammerling was timed in 26.29 seconds, bettering the  
26.39 she swam July 1 at the Swedish national championships. 
</P>
<P>
	She led all the way, beating Swedish teammate Johanna Sjoberg of  
Sweden, who was timed in 26.93. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't expect to break the world record again because in two  
races yesterday I didn't go very fast or feel very good,'' 
Kammerling said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first world record broken in Istanbul's Atakoy  
Olympic pool on the European side of this city spanning two 
continents. 
</P>
<P>
	In the men's 50-meter butterfly, Pieter Van den Hoogenband of  
the Netherlands nearly set a world record of his own, clocking the 
world's third all-best time of 23.89. 
</P>
<P>
	He later took away Alexander Popov's championship record by  
swimming a blazingly 48.70 in the semifinals of the 100-meter 
freestyle, just one day after he swam the world's all-time fastest 
leg in the 4x100 in 47.31. Popov holds both the world and European 
record of 48.21 set in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Holland's 4x100 team win also broke a streak held by Popov, who  
chased Hoogenband on the last leg. It was Popov's first silver 
medal in the Euros.

<HEADLINE>  Kamerling Sets 50m Butterfly Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- Sweden's Anna-Karin Kammerling lived up  
to her reputation as the women's fastest swimmer in the butterfly 
Tuesday by breaking her world record in 50-meters. 
</P>
<P>
	The 19-year Kammerling was timed in 26.29 seconds, bettering the  
26.39 she swam July 1 at the Swedish national championships. 
</P>
<P>
	She led all the way, beating Swedish teammate Johanna Sjoberg of  
Sweden, who was timed in 26.93. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't expect to break the world record again because in two  
races yesterday I didn't go very fast or feel very good,'' 
Kammerling said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first world record broken in Istanbul's Atakoy  
Olympic pool on the European side of this city spanning two 
continents. 
</P>
<P>
	In the men's 50-meter butterfly, Pieter Van den Hoogenband of  
the Netherlands nearly set a world record of his own, clocking the 
world's third all-best time of 23.89. 
</P>
<P>
	He later took away Alexander Popov's championship record by  
swimming a blazingly 48.70 in the semifinals of the 100-meter 
freestyle, just one day after he swam the world's all-time fastest 
leg in the 4x100 in 47.31. Popov holds both the world and European 
record of 48.21 set in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Holland's 4x100 team win also broke a streak held by Popov, who  
chased Hoogenband on the last leg. It was Popov's first silver 
medal in the Euros. 
</P>
<P>
	Coupled with Hoogenband's performance in the semis, the Dutchman  
has become Popov's biggest threat as he tries for a fifth 
consecutive gold in Wednesday's 100-meter freestyle final. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 100-meter backstroke, European champion Stev Theloke of

<HEADLINE> Newman Contributes To Save Factory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORWALK, Conn. (AP) -- Paul Newman has opened his wallet in an  
effort to save a historic lock factory near his hometown. 
</P>
<P>
	Newman donated $25,000 to save the Lock Building in Norwalk, a  
closed factory built in 1856 that has been threatened with 
destruction as part of an urban renewal project. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a vote of confidence,'' William Kraus, vice president of  
the Historic Lock Building Association, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Later this week, the association plans to unveil a proposal to  
save the building and convert it into a regional art center. 
Several artists are already renting space in the building. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, Newman donated $50,000 toward preserving a  
piece of open space in Westport and made a rare stage appearance 
with his wife, Joanne Woodward, to benefit a land trust trying to 
save forest from destruction.

<HEADLINE> NFLPA Recommends License Be Revoked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- The NFL Players Association proposed  
to strip sports agent William ``Tank'' Black's license for three 
years Tuesday after determining his company made improper cash 
payments to college players. 
</P>
<P>
	The penalty will take effect if an arbitrator agrees with the  
NFLPA disciplinary committee's decision. Black has 20 days to seek 
arbitration. From there, arbitrator Roger Kaplan would have about 
45 days to hold a hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFLPA filed a disciplinary complaint against Black in May,  
accusing his company, Professional Management Inc., of making 
improper payments to former players at Florida, LSU and South 
Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation centered on alleged payments to former Florida  
players Jevon Kearse, Johnny Rutledge and Reggie McGrew. Rutledge 
has gone public with a statement admitting he took money. All three 
players have submitted sworn affidavits stating the same. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFLPA disciplinary committee, which consists of players  
Richard Harvey, Trace Armstrong and Robert Smith, read through the 
200-page response to the complaint that Black submitted earlier 
this month. The committee also held a four-hour telephone 
conference to hear his side of the story Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee decided to propose revoking Black's license for  
three years and forcing him to pay a $25,000 fine when he 
reapplies. 
</P>
<P>
	The penalty is designed to inflict a severe blow to Black's  
11-year-old business, in which he represents about 40 professional 
athletes, the vast majority of them in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clubs can't deal with someone who isn't certified by the  
NFLPA,'' NFLPA attorney Richard Berthelsen said. ``If the penalty 
is upheld, he can't talk to club personnel about a player's 
contract. If he is being hired for that service, most players are 
going to find somebody else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Black, however, insists his company will remain viable if the  
penalty is upheld, with a company attorney doing the direct 
contract negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the allegations surfaced, all of Black's clients -- besides  
Kearse, McGrew, Rutledge and former Gator Mike Peterson -- have 
remained with him. NBA star Vince Carter signed a multi-year 
contract extension with Black this month. 
</P>
<P>
	``PMI is a larger organization than just Tank Black,'' said  
spokesman Michael Butler. ``It's a thriving business and it will 
continue to thrive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A statement released from PMI said the decision was ``highly  
predictable'' considering the way the process has progressed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is what one would expect from a blatantly unfair process  
that has been characterized by vague charges, innuendo, speculation 
and a reckless disregard for the facts,'' the statement read. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement said Harvey was only present for 20 minutes of the  
nearly four-hour phone conversation. 
</P>
<P>
	``His abbreviated appearance is further evidence of a total lack  
of objectivity and closed-minded approach exhibited by the NFLPA in 
this matter from the beginning of the process,'' the statement 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Berthelsen said Harvey was present for more than 20 minutes, but  
not for the entire phone conversation. He said Black and his 
attorney, Leonard Mungo, asked for a postponement of the telephone 
conference to Monday and knew some training camps would be 
underway. 
</P>
<P>
	``Richard was fully aware of the entire answer submitted in the  
case and all the information transmitted yesterday,'' Berthelsen 
said. ``Since the call was so lengthy, he had to leave to attend 
required activity at training camp.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Black also filed a lawsuit against the NFLPA, accusing the union  
of an unfair disciplinary process. A judge dismissed it Monday, but 
Black re-filed it Tuesday with additional counts.

<HEADLINE> Sturm Group Wins Nuggets, Avalanche </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The bidding battle for the Colorado Avalanche and  
the Denver Nuggets is over, and a group headed by Colorado 
billionaire Donald Sturm has won. 
</P>
<P>
	The Strum group was assured of victory today when Bill Laurie  
and his wife, Nancy, decided not to participate in a live auction 
scheduled for Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``After careful consideration, Nancy and I regret to announce  
our decision not to increase our ($400 million) offer,'' Laurie 
said in a statement. ``While we remain committed to the Denver 
sports teams as fans, we have made the difficult decision not to 
pursue ownership further.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sturm group on Monday offered Ascent Entertainment Group  
$461 million for the Nuggets, the Avalanche and the Pepsi Center 
arena, outbidding a group that included John Elway and a separate 
bid by a Saudi Arabian princess. 
</P>
<P>
	``We look forward to working with Donald L. Sturm and The Sturm  
Group to insure there is a smooth transition of ownership,'' said 
Chuck Neinas, interim chairman and CEO for Ascent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lauries bought the sports assets for $400 million in March,  
but Ascent re-opened the bidding process after shareholders filed 
two lawsuits claiming the assets should have fetched a higher 
price. 
</P>
<P>
	A third suit was filed by a businessman who claimed the Lauries  
backed out of an agreement to sell the Avalanche to them for $80 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lauries will receive $8.2 million from Ascent as part of an  
agreement reached when the bidding process was re-opened last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Ascent officials said its board of directors selected  
the Sturm group because it offered the highest price -- reportedly 
beating its nearest competitor by $11 million -- and ``provided 
documented ability to fund the purchase price and ongoing 
operations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The group also demonstrated the ``ability to meet the financial  
and operating requirements of the city and country of Denver,'' 
while meeting the ownership standards of the NHL and NBA, Neinas 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Princess Thara Al Saud, the widow of Prince Mohammed Abdul Aziz,  
a nephew of King Fahd who died in a plane crash 23 years ago, said 
she offered $450 million for the sports assets. She said would 
pursue other pro basketball and hockey franchises. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway's business manager, Jeff Sperbeck, declined to confirm the  
reported $438 million bid submitted by the retired Broncos 
quarterback, Denver financier Bjorn Erik Borgen and Colorado ski 
mogul George Gillett. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sturm group was set to proceed to Wednesday's live auction  
to determine the new owner before the Lauries withdrew from the 
bidding. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts predicted the price could have gone as high as $500  
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Pete Webb, spokesman for the Lauries, said among other things,  
the new owner of the NBA's Nuggets and the NHL's Avalanche must 
guarantee that if either team leaves Denver in the next 25 years, 
the owner will reimburse the city the cost of recruiting and 
bringing a new team to Denver.

<HEADLINE> Dell Unveils Cheaper Computer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN (AP) -- Dell Computer Corp. is jumping into the online  
business, saying Tuesday it will provide Internet service with a PC 
priced under $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at Dell, which is strongest in direct PC sales to  
businesses, said the new venture is part of Dell's strategy of 
increasing sales to consumers by building direct relationships with 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our consumer business continues to be the great untold story  
about Dell,'' said Paul Bell, senior vice-president and general 
manager of Dell's home and small business group. ``We're very, very 
bullish about the consumer business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new online initiative features one year of Internet access  
with the purchase of a Dell Dimension desktop or Inspiron notebook 
PC. The Dimension PCs with 150 hours of monthly Dellnet service 
begin at $959 or $29 a month over four years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Web site, www.dellnet.com, includes a personalized start  
page created by Snap.com, free e-mail and discounts on non-Dell 
products and services. The Web site also offers programs to help 
customers develop personal Web pages through Homestead.com and the 
ability to create audiofiles and download music to a desktop. 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph Panettieri, executive editor of trade magazine Smart  
Reseller, said Dell's new initiative mimics the trend of other PC 
makers offering free Internet service and Internet service 
providers, or ISPs, giving away computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Panettieri said the Dell approach is useful for consumers who  
don't want to get locked into a multiyear deal with an Internet 
provider that could be outdated or out of business before the 
contract expires. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dell is going to be in business in a year, it's going to be in  
business in five years, it's not going anywhere,'' he said. ``In 
the ISP market, all bets are off of who's going to be around in 
three or four years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Panettieri said the new initiative also illustrates Dell's  
attempt to take on Gateway, another direct PC seller, to claim more 
of the consumer base. 
</P>
<P>
	While Dellnet will be available only to buyers of certain PCs,  
Dell hopes eventually to make the Internet service available to the 
wider market.

<HEADLINE> Politician Gets Tax Evasion Sentence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) -- A former Florida House speaker and his  
wife have been sentenced to prison terms for tax evasion. 
</P>
<P>
	Bolley ``Bo'' Johnson received two years in prison and his wife  
Judi 15 months. They failed to report $452,675 in income paid to 
them by representatives of various interests seeking to take 
advantage of his influence with former Gov. Lawton Chiles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sorry for the pain and suffering that has been brought to  
the people I love and care about,'' Johnson said Tuesday in a brief 
statement to U.S. District Judge Lacey Collier. 
</P>
<P>
	Through tears, Mrs. Johnson told the judge, ``I still am in awe  
of everything that has happened. I want to apologize to everyone 
concerned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In May, a jury found Johnson, 47, guilty on four counts and Mrs.  
Johnson, 48, guilty of three counts of failing to report income 
from consulting fees received during four of six years ending in 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``You simply add to the public cynicism of the system and  
politicians in general,'' Collier told the Johnsons. 
</P>
<P>
	The income the Johnsons failed to report was paid by interests  
that included casino gambling, transportation, road building and 
health care businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	A onetime Pensacola real estate broker, Johnson served in the  
House 16 years as a Democrat and was speaker during his last two 
years through November 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors contended at trial that the Johnsons hid their  
income, but defense lawyers argued they were guilty of sloppy 
record keeping. 
</P>
<P>
	Collier allowed both to remain free on bond and turn themselves  
in to begin their sentences Aug. 30.

<HEADLINE> Ill. Gun Seller Pleads Innocent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEORIA, Ill. (AP) -- A man accused of selling Benjamin Smith the  
guns he used in his deadly Fourth of July weekend shooting spree 
pleaded innocent Tuesday to federal gun charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Donald Fiessinger, 64, of Pekin, was indicted last week on a  
charge that he sold guns without a federal license to Smith, who 
targeted blacks, Jews and Asians during his hate-fueled shooting 
rampage in Illinois and Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	Two people were killed and nine were injured. The spree ended  
July 4 when Smith killed himself as police closed in on him in 
Southern Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith had tried to buy guns from a licensed dealer in Peoria  
Heights shortly before the rampage but was turned away when a 
routine background check found that an ex-girlfriend had an order 
of protection against him. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say he then turned to Fiessinger, who had advertised  
guns in a local newspaper. Fiessinger admitted selling Smith the 
guns, but insisted he knew nothing about Smith's white supremacist 
beliefs.

	``Blues Blues Blues'' (Atlantic) -- Jimmy Rogers' All-Stars  

</P>
<P>
	In tribute to the late Jimmy Rogers, an electric guitar player  
in Muddy Waters' first electric band, an array of mega-stars joins 
Jimmy on this disc. These stars will likely make it the biggest 
seller of his career, albeit a posthumous one. 
</P>
<P>
	OK, so we can bemoan this unfair fact and denounce this album as  
a gimmick. It is a gimmick. So what? The appearance of star guests 
on a disc recorded by a working bluesman has become common, and no 
one has ever drawn the star power that Jimmy Rogers did here: Mick 
Jagger on three tracks plus Keith Richards, Eric Clapton, Robert 
Plant, Jimmy Page, Jeff Healey, Stephen Stills, blues virtuoso Taj 
Mahal and Fabulous Thunderbird Kim Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
	Hey, take Jimmy out of there and you have one of those 1980s  
supergroups. 
</P>
<P>
	But they didn't take Jimmy out of there, and more importantly,  
this is Jimmy's music, not theirs. The stars do not overpower, they 
do not even imprint their signatures, as is the case on John Lee 
Hooker's all-star recordings. 
</P>
<P>
	If anything, the music here is a little low-key for Jimmy, who  
was aging. And it is a pleasure to listen to the rock millionaires, 
like Mick on ``Trouble no More'' and the Led-Zep duo on ``Gonna 
Shoot You Right Down,'' limit themselves to performing as sidemen 
for Jimmy, not only in tribute but musically.

	``What It Is'' (Blue Note) -- Jacky Terrasson  

</P>
<P>
	Jazz pianist Jacky Terrasson is in search of the perfect groove  
on ``What It Is,'' a glorious mix of eclectic, rhythm-driven music 
heavy on percussion, syncopation and humor. 
</P>
<P>
	For his fourth album as a leader, Terrasson assembled his  
largest band yet, including saxophone, flute, harmonica and Cuban 
vocalist Xiomara Laugart on the Latin-flavored ``Better World.'' 
Other highlights include Ravel's ``Bolero'' in seven-eighths time, 
Pink Floyd's ``Money'' -- complete with jingling coins -- and the 
War-like funk of ``Toot-Toot's Tune.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's not all. The rollicking ``Le Roi Basil'' is worthy of  
Return to Forever's best work. And on the hard-driving ``What's 
Wrong With You!'', Terrasson and saxophonist Michael Brecker trade 
frenetic solos, settling on the same chord for 16 bars at a time. 
As they savor the liberating beat, we can, too.

	``You Can't Stop the Bum Rush'' (Work Group) -- LEN  

</P>
<P>
	The big-label debut of LEN represents a viable alternative for  
hip-hop music fans looking for something different. But beware, 
LEN's Bronx rap stylings can leave you wondering where 
``influence'' ends and crass borrowing begins. 
</P>
<P>
	LEN is an Ontario, Canada-based foursome with a penchant for the  
past. Listening to the 12-track trip down rap's memory lane 
illuminates LEN's heartfelt affinity for 1980s break-dance anthems. 
But the group does little to carve out a musical identity of its 
own. 
</P>
<P>
	There's no subtlety or new beat patterns to the drum  
machine-laden ``Hot Rod Monster Jam'' or ``Cryptic Souls Crew,'' 
taken straight from the pages of Afrika Bambaata and the Crash 
Crew, respectively. It has become all too fashionable lately not 
only to sample your predecessors, but to blatantly mimic them in 
shallow attempts to revive past rap glory days. 
</P>
<P>
	When they're not rhyming nostalgic, LEN (D-Rock, DJ Moves,  
Burger Pimp and Shar) make it their mission to revisit every 
long-dead style from 1970s easy listening to early 1980s glam rock, 
even employing Poison guitarist C.C. DeVille on the rote, 
four-chord ``Feelin' Alright.'' 
</P>
<P>
	LEN's worth a listen if you've tired of new rap's bad-dog  
braggarts, but these talented kids could have smirked less and 
produced better.

	``Dysfunction'' (Flip/Elektra) -- Staind  

</P>
<P>
	As if Korn and Limp Bizkit weren't enough for the mosh pit  
faithful, now comes the brooding, thrash debut album 
``Dysfunction'' from Staind. 
</P>
<P>
	That's too bad for Korn and Co., because Staind is better.  
</P>
<P>
	You don't just listen to Staind, you endure the band's pain.  
This distortion-guitar-driven group grabs the listener by the wrist 
and drags him down a street of torment and despair. 
</P>
<P>
	But Staind's pain is the listener's prize.  
</P>
<P>
	Lead singer Aaron Lewis' vocals fuel the fire well. If Pearl  
Jam's Eddie Vedder hadn't perfected the outcast rock warble first, 
Lewis would have done it anyway. There's no stopping Staind's 
determination behind the furious drumming of Jon Wysocki and 
adventurous guitar work from Mike Mushok. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just Go'' begins as a slow and tangled guitar crawl and cranks  
into a powerful piece about insecurities overcome through 
willpower. ``Home'' describes the fear of loneliness with Lewis' 
soulful cries. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dysfunction'' is wonderful but dark listening. In the  
crunch-rock genre littered with halfhearted copycats, Staind stands 
out with its well-crafted lyrics and unique sense of disparate 
vision. 
</P>
<P>
	These guys deliver, and rock should thank them.

<HEADLINE> New Jersey Removes Prosecutor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- The head of the biggest county prosecutor's  
office in New Jersey was removed Tuesday amid allegations of 
misconduct and reckless spending on such things as a $120 leather 
wastebasket and a $250,000 recreational vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	Essex County Prosecutor Patricia A. Hurt, the second black woman  
to head a prosecutor's office in New Jersey, had served only 18 
months of a five-year term. The state attorney general said he was 
ordered to remove Ms. Hurt by Gov. Christie Whitman, who appointed 
Ms. Hurt to the post. 
</P>
<P>
	The office, whose jurisdiction includes Newark, has 115 lawyers  
and handles one-third of all criminal cases in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	The attorney general's office has subpoenaed at least eight of  
Ms. Hurt's employees for an investigation of her spending. The 
probe reportedly focuses on allegations she used employees for 
personal errands. 
</P>
<P>
	It is also investigating her use of money seized from criminals  
to buy office supplies that include a $250,000 customized 
recreational vehicle and a $120 leather wastebasket. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, a grand jury charged four investigators assigned to  
Ms. Hurt's narcotics unit with misconduct, saying they illegally 
searched a home for drugs, then lied about it. Two of those charged 
were appointed to top positions by Ms. Hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal and state agencies are also examining how her office  
handled the April 8 slaying of a police officer in Orange. Three 
people were detained, and one died in police custody, before 
someone else was arrested and confessed. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hurt had no comment Tuesday. She can continue drawing her  
$115,000 salary. 
</P>
<P>
	The last New Jersey prosecutor removed from office was Nicholas  
L. Bissell Jr. of Somerset County. He was ousted in 1995 after he 
was indicted on federal charges of tax evasion and abusing his 
office. Bissell was convicted but fled before sentencing, killing 
himself in a Nevada motel room in 1996 as U.S. marshals entered.

<HEADLINE> Cruise Lines Must Tell FBI of Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Most cruise ships sailing out of U.S. ports  
now have to report all crimes at sea to the FBI under a new policy 
approved by the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The policy, announced Tuesday, follows recent disclosures of  
sexual assaults aboard cruise ships. It covers about 90 percent of 
the North American cruise industry and takes effect immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, the cruise lines left it up to the victims to report  
a crime once back in port. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new policy, cruise lines will report onboard crimes if  
the ship calls on U.S. ports or the offense involves Americans. It 
was unanimously approved last week by the 16 members of the 
International Council of Cruise Lines. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our companies, and industry as a whole, have zero tolerance  
for crimes committed on our vessels,'' the top executives of four 
of the largest cruise lines -- Carnival, Royal Caribbean, Princess 
and Crystal -- said in an open letter to the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement follows the disclosure earlier this month that  
Carnival crew members were accused of sexual assault 62 times in a 
five-year period. They were the first crime statistics released by 
a cruise line. 
</P>
<P>
	The disclosure was ordered by a Florida judge hearing a lawsuit  
brought by a former employee who said that she was raped by a 
fellow worker and that the company tried to cover it up.

<HEADLINE> Baseball Umpires Sue Leagues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Now baseball umpires want the right to withdraw  
their resignations, so they sued the American and National Leagues 
in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
	In a reversal of strategy apparently caused by their internal  
split, the Major League Umpires Association filed a 14-page 
complaint Monday in U.S. District Court in Philadelphia 
</P>
<P>
	They said several baseball officials are spreading ``false and  
misleading statements to umpires about deadlines to accept 
resignations, deadlines to offer rescissions of resignations and 
deadlines to reject rescissions of resignations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires also accused the American League and the commissioner's  
office of saying they intend to withhold termination pay of up to 
$400,000 per ump. 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires, whose resignations are set to take effect Sept. 2, also  
claimed baseball has offered them up to $2 million in future gains 
if they join a dissident group in the union that is trying to fire 
its negotiator, Richie Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
	They chose the resignation tactic because their current labor  
deal has a no-strike clause, and they fear owners would lock them 
out after it expires. 
</P>
<P>
	However, their position has been weakened by the decisions of 23  
of 32 AL umpires who say they will stay on. Only three of their 36 
NL counterparts say they will remain. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners have hired more than 20 new umpires from the minor  
leagues as of Sept. 1. The Triple-A umpires had been working as 
vacation fill-ins in the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	While no additional withdrawals of resignations were received  
Monday, one baseball official, speaking on the condition he not be 
identified, said several NL umpires had called baseball to say they 
were considering reversing course and staying on. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're partially divided right now and hopefully we can all  
come together at some point,'' said NL umpire Bruce Froemming, a 
union board member. ``But as far as what happened in Philly today, 
I have not talked to anybody and am as confused as anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thus far, 14 of the 56 umpires who resigned have withdrawn their  
resignations. The baseball official said the sport would continue 
to accept withdrawals, but only until all vacancies are filled. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody likes to portray Richie as the bad guy,'' AL umpire  
Jim Evans said. ``Richie Phillips has been very instrumental in 
helping raise the standards of this profession.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Evans is one of the AL umpires who submitted his resignation and  
backs Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
	``That doesn't mean everything Richie Phillips has ever done in  
his life, that everybody who is in his camp agrees with 
everything,'' Evans said. ``It's the commitment to the future of 
this profession -- the big picture. 
</P>
<P>
	The case was assigned to U.S. District Judge Edmund V. Ludwig,  
who three years ago issued a court order that prevented umpires 
from striking in the postseason. Umpires threatened a strike after 
Roberto Alomar spit at umpire John Hirschbeck and was given just a 
five-game suspension. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, umpires want a court order that gives them until  
Sept. 2 to withdraw their resignations. They also want Ludwig to 
declare that owners have engaged ``in numerous and serious unfair 
labor practices'' and to declare that mass resignations are a legal 
strike. 
</P>
<P>
	At least four more minor league umpires were hired Monday,  
another baseball official said. 
</P>
<P>
	In an unusual twist, umpires accused owners of wrongfully  
agreeing to give Larry Barnett more termination pay than the labor 
contract requires. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnett, who with 31 years of service is baseball's senior  
umpire, agreed to retire after this season for $550,000 -- $150,000 
more than the AL was required to give him. 
</P>
<P>
	The AL also has been negotiating for the retirements of Dale  
Ford, Ted Hendry, Ken Kaiser and Durwood Merrill, the suit said. 
</P>
<P>
	The current labor agreement is set to expire Dec. 31. Umpires  
asked the court to declare that the current labor agreement was 
abandoned by the AL and NL because commissioner Bud Selig is trying 
to shift supervision of umpires from the leagues to Sandy Alderson 
in the commissioner's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires contend the partial shift of responsibility to Alderson  
this season violated their agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips declined comment, as did Selig. Ludwig did not  
immediately set a date for a hearing.

<HEADLINE> Internet Gambling Co. Loses Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- New Yorkers who gamble via the Internet are  
playing in a virtual casino inside their computers and are subject 
to state gaming laws even if the gambling company is based 
overseas, a judge ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer hailed the decision by  
State Supreme Court Justice Charles Edward Ramos against World 
Interactive Gaming Corp., of Suffolk County, as precedent-setting. 
He called it a victory for his office's recently established 
Internet Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were a couple of other cases concerning offshore  
gambling in the pipeline, but we believe this is the first ruling 
by a judge anywhere,'' Spitzer spokesman Scott Brown said. The 
ruling by the judge was made last week and made public Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The case began in February 1998 as a probe into allegations that  
WIGC had improperly sold shares in a casino gambling business for 
$10,000 each, taking in some $1.8 million from 114 investors, 10 of 
them in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	In June 1998, state investigators tapped into WIGC Web sites and  
placed bets, according to court papers. The company's computer 
didn't accept a bet from a state investigator when she typed in New 
York state as her home on a sign-in form, so she typed in Nevada 
instead, said WICG's attorney, Anthony Colleluori. 
</P>
<P>
	The company had contended that because its computer servers were  
located and licensed on the Caribbean island of Antigua, the state 
had no jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 20-page ruling, the judge dismissed that claim as  
irrelevant and set a Sept. 9 hearing on restitution for investors. 
</P>
<P>
	``The act of entering the bet and transmitting the information  
from New York via the Internet is adequate to constitute gambling 
activity within New York state,'' the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge said WIGC had violated state and federal laws,  
including the federal Interstate Wire Act, with a gambling Web site 
that ``creates a virtual casino within the user's computer 
terminal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an important decision for law enforcement throughout  
New York and perhaps throughout the nation,'' Spitzer said in a 
statement. ``The judge has clearly stated that it doesn't matter 
whether someone promoting gambling to state residents is based in 
Albany, Albuquerque or Antigua. New York state laws still apply.'' 
</P>
<P>
	World Interactive's Antigua subsidiary went online a year ago,  
but a state lawsuit forced it to halt operations, Colleluori said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that WIGC had never taken bets from New Yorkers, and he  
argued that there are no state or federal laws against Internet 
gambling. He said the company would appeal the ruling. Despite its 
name, in New York state the Supreme Court is just a trial-level 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	New York bars non-Indian gambling unless it's approved by the  
state Legislature, like horse racing and the state Lottery.

<HEADLINE> FDA Approves Flu Inhalant Drug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ignoring the recommendation of its own  
advisory panel, the Food and Drug Administration approved an 
inhalant drug for the treatment of simple influenza. 
</P>
<P>
	Studies show the drug, to be marketed under the name Relenza,  
can reduce the duration of flu symptoms by up to 36 hours, but 
critics said the benefit does not justify approval. 
</P>
<P>
	An FDA advisory panel voted 13-4 in February against  
recommending approval of Relenza, saying the drug helped flu 
sufferers only slightly. The panel requested more studies, 
particularly among people in nursing homes and the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Heidi M. Jolson, director of the FDA's antiviral drug  
product division, said approving a drug against the recommendation 
of an advisory committee ``doesn't happen commonly'' but Relenza 
adds a new weapon to the very limited flu-fighting arsenal. She 
said the need for some therapy against flu was a strong element in 
the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``Influenza is an important public health problem, and this will  
provide another option for treatment,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jolson said that since the advisory committee vote last  
February, the drug manufacturer, GlaxoWellcome Inc., has provided 
information to answer many of the questions raised during the 
panel's hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We felt we had sufficiently addressed the concerns that the  
advisory committee had brought up,'' Jolson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some experts said Relenza could cause serious side effects for  
some patients. 
</P>
<P>
	``This drug should never have been approved,'' said Dr. Sidney  
Wolfe of the Public Citizen Health Research Group. ``The benefits 
are close to zero.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wolfe, a frequent critic of the FDA, said the action is an  
example of new and lower standards the agency now uses for drug 
approvals. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the drug could pose a breathing risk for asthma  
patients. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA announcement warned that asthma sufferers might face  
breathing problems and recommended they be ready to use 
bronchodilator therapy when taking Relenza. 
</P>
<P>
	Glaxo officials said the drug is the first of a new class,  
called neuraminidase inhibitors, that attacks both type A and type 
B flu strains. The drug is approved for prescription use by adults 
and by adolescents 12 years and older who have had flu symptoms for 
no more than two days. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Michael J. Elliott of Glaxo, based in Research Triangle  
Park, N.C., said the drug has been tested on about 6,000 people in 
clinical trials. In Australian and European trials, he said, flu 
sufferers reported the inhaled drug shortened the duration of flu 
symptoms by about 1 1/2 days. 
</P>
<P>
	In U.S. studies, patients using the drug said their symptoms  
went away about a day earlier than those of people taking placebos. 
Elliott said these findings were based on the self-reporting of 
people involved in the clinical trials and were not proven by 
laboratory tests. 
</P>
<P>
	The American studies mean the course of a flu illness that would  
endure untreated for six to 10 days would last five to nine days, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Influenza affects 25 million to 50 million Americans annually  
and is blamed for more than 20,000 deaths and about 300,000 
hospitalizations. Flu incidence tends to peak in the fall and 
winter. Symptoms include headache, muscle aches, fever, cough and 
sore throats. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA said the Relenza was effective only among patients who  
started treatment within two days after symptoms appeared, and was 
less effective among patients who did not have fever or severe 
symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug was not proven effective in preventing the flu, the FDA  
found. Jolson said the drug was not indicated for use in stopping 
the spread of influenza in such places as nursing homes. This was 
an issue the advisory panel recommended be studied. 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott said Glaxo had not determined the price of the drug, but  
it is expected to be available this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very pleased that Relenza will now be available for the  
1999-2000 flu season,'' Dr. James Palmer, a Glaxo vice president, 
said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug works by inhibiting the action of neuraminidase, an  
enzyme the flu virus uses to break away from an infected cell and 
move to another cell. Blocking the enzyme's action limits the 
spread of the virus. 
</P>
<P>
	Relenza is to be sold in 10-dose packages. It is to be taken  
twice daily for five days. Relenza is dispensed through a device 
that lets the patient inhale the drug into the lungs through a 
mouthpiece.

<HEADLINE> Bauer Wants Home-Schooler Vouchers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Republican presidential contender Gary  
Bauer said Tuesday that school voucher proposals should be expanded 
to cover the cost to parents of educating their children at home. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer noted that most school voucher proposals provide funds for  
moving children to private schools or public schools outside the 
home district but don't include home schooling. ``The politicians 
didn't think very much about this particular alternative,'' he 
said. ``This is a legitimate choice and I want to make sure the 
playing field is level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal came as Bauer met with a group of parents who  
home-school their children. 
</P>
<P>
	Voucher programs allow parents the freedom to take the education  
funding earmarked for their child and use it to pay the costs of 
attending a school other than their neighborhood public school. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the debate is over whether tax money for public school  
students should be used for tuition at private schools. Public 
school advocates say that undermines public education, but most 
conservatives favor that step. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer favors voucher programs for private schools, but expanded  
that Tuesday to include home schooling. He said parents could use 
the money for curriculum material, or to hire help in areas where 
they don't feel competent to teach. 
</P>
<P>
	Home-school advocates won a years-long legislative battle that  
allows them to teach their children at home. Many are religious 
conservatives unhappy with the public school curriculum and the 
lack of religious instruction. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer is appealing to these conservatives in his bid for the  
Republican presidential nomination. He made it clear he would favor 
home schooling if he's elected. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will never allow the federal government to get into the  
business of regulating home schooling,'' said Bauer. 
</P>
<P>
	He argued that there's some history of youngsters who are taught  
at home, and they measure up well against students taught in both 
private and public schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the parents are engaged, the children are in pretty good  
shape,'' said Bauer. ``Those of you who are engaged in home 
schooling are doing something incredibly important for your 
children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under Iowa law, parents do not have to be licensed teachers to  
home-school youngsters. They register youngsters with the local 
school district, which has staffers who will offer assistance and 
advice. The youngsters are tested periodically and can take part in 
some extracurricular activities. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer said advocates won that law by pressuring politicians, and  
demonstrated effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the end of the day, politicians fear unemployment more than  
anything,'' he said.

<P>
	GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. (AP) -- Dan Dutko, a major Democratic  
fund-raiser and member of the Democratic National Committee, died 
Tuesday of head injuries suffered in a mountain biking accident 
over the weekend in Aspen. He was 54. 
</P>
<P>
	Dutko was in Aspen for a Democratic fund-raiser attended by  
President Clinton on Saturday. He was co-chairman of Leadership 
2000, the DNC's top finance committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Dutko first met Clinton while coordinating the McGovern campaign  
in West Texas in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	He held many other high-level political positions, including  
vice chairman of finance for Clinton-Gore in 1995; finance chairman 
of the 53rd inaugural ball; and vice chairman of finance for the 
DNC in 1996 and national finance chairman for Maryland Lt. Gov. 
Kathleen Kennedy Townsend. 
</P>
<P>
	Dutko had also been chief of staff for Sen. Donald Stewart,  
D-Ala., and Rep. Bob Krueger, D-Texas.

	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Harry ``Sweets'' Edison, a jazz trumpeter  
who accompanied singers such as Frank Sinatra, Ella Fitzgerald and 
Billie Holiday, died Tuesday. He was 83. 
</P>
<P>
	Edison joined the Count Basie Orchestra in the mid-1930s when he  
was 18 and became a featured soloist. Basie saxophonist Lester 
Young dubbed him ``Sweets'' because of the pleasing tone of his 
horn. 
</P>
<P>
	Edison stayed with Basie's big band until about 1950 before  
heading off to perform with his own quintet. He recorded his own 
albums, notably ``Sweets For The Sweet Taste Of Love,'' accompanied 
Sinatra as a studio musician and worked with Benny Carter on movie 
sound tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the years he played with most of the famous big bands,  
including those of Buddy Rich, Quincy Jones, Louis Bellson, Henry 
Mancini and Nelson Riddle. 
</P>
<P>
	Edison taught music seminars at Yale University in the Duke  
Ellington Fellowship Program and he was honored as a ``master 
musician'' with a 1991 National Endowment for the Arts Award at the 
Kennedy Center.

<HEADLINE> Broadcast.com Founder Weighs Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- It took the Gulf War to make CNN famous. For  
broadcast.com, its first million-hit audience was President 
Clinton's grand jury testimony about Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	The hits have just kept coming for the Internet broadcaster --  
sporting events, a lingerie fashion show, an American hero's return 
to space. 
</P>
<P>
	But even more significant, in the view of broadcast.com  
co-founder and chief executive Todd Wagner, was an event that 
wasn't hyped on the Internet: a parade for last year's World Series 
champion New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the last-minute production -- the company wasn't sure it  
would be able to transmit the pictures until an hour before the 
parade -- the event still drew 100,000 hits. 
</P>
<P>
	``It told me, behavior modification,'' Wagner said. ``People are  
coming, they're looking for something and finding it. ... People 
started realizing, 'Wow, there's cool stuff there every day.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Wagner's ``behavior modification'' could be just another term  
for brand loyalty. Wagner said he considers it is a force that 
already is taking hold on the Internet and will frustrate 
latecomers -- even those with deep pockets. 
</P>
<P>
	``This industry is a dead-out sprint to get there first,''  
Wagner said. ``Look at all the companies that sat back and were 
patient. Look at how expensive it has become to get market share on 
the Internet. Look at most of the leaders now; they were the ones 
that got there first.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, Wagner, 38, and his partner, Mark Cuban, 40, have  
reason to gloat a little. What started in 1995 -- with $4,000 in 
equipment in Cuban's spare bedroom -- as a way for the two Indiana 
University graduates to hear Hoosiers basketball games from Dallas, 
the company now operates out of a 28,000-square-foot converted 
warehouse equipped with satellite dishes that pull in TV and radio 
signals from around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Wagner and Cuban sold $30,000 shares in the company themselves  
until finding a private underwriter and trading equity to Motorola, 
Intel, Yahoo! and other partners. When the company went public last 
July, Wall Street went wild. From an opening price of $18 a share, 
the stock shot to $72 before closing its first day at $62.75. 
</P>
<P>
	``They had the perfect Internet IPO,'' said Gail Bronson, senior  
analyst with IPO Monitor, an online tracking service for new 
stocks. ``They had a good name, they were first to the market, and 
they had a very engaging, novel technology that was going to offer 
a solution to a perceived need in the marketplace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Bronson said the company also had strong underwriters and  
management with good marketing skills. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mark Cuban is a very engaging speaker and very good  
salesman,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, the stock price began climbing again, and  
went over the $100 mark after reports circulated that the company 
would be bought by Yahoo! Inc., based in Santa Clara, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, Cuban and Wagner agreed to sell to Yahoo in a deal  
then valued at $5.7 billion. But that was nearly four months ago, 
and a slump in Yahoo's stock has driven the value of the deal down 
to about $4.2 billion. (Shares in broadcast.com are currently 
trading at about $110) 
</P>
<P>
	Wagner insists he's not losing sleep over the deal's declining  
worth or the possibility of it unraveling. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market is out of our control and out of our hands,'' he  
said in an interview at a Dallas country club. ``We don't pay much 
attention to that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Yahoo's share price sinks, broadcast.com has yet to earn a  
nickel. After losing $14.9 million last year, the company posted a 
$3.8 million loss (11 cents per share) on revenue of $10.3 million 
in the first quarter of 1999. Revenue is growing but not as quickly 
as costs, mostly for marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	Wagner declined to predict when the company will turn a profit.  
But he noted that analysts suggest it will happen in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Dressed in a navy suit, red tie and starched white shirt, Wagner  
looks more like a young law firm associate -- which he used to be -- 
than an Internet pioneer. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuban, who founded and led technology companies before  
broadcast.com, is usually portrayed as the technical and marketing 
genius, Wagner as the money guy. Wagner hesitated when asked if 
that characterization flattered or offended him. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're two different people,'' he said. ``My background was  
obviously going to be more appropriate to be doing deals, and 
Mark's background was going to be a lot more appropriate to worry 
about the technology.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Today, broadcast.com carries about 400 radio stations, 55  
television and cable systems, and exclusive deals with the National 
Hockey League, Major League Baseball and the largest 100 companies 
on the Nasdaq stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal with Nasdaq says something else about broadcast.com:  
Although the grunts and glitz of sports and lingerie shows draw 
attention, the company makes most of its money on business 
teleconferencing. 
</P>
<P>
	Wagner and Cuban pitch CEOs this way: Why spend big bucks flying  
people to meetings or paying for expensive satellite time and 
equipment when you can broadcast a speech or meeting to workers at 
their desktops? 
</P>
<P>
	Wagner insists that broadcast.com won't change even after it  
becomes Yahoo Broadcast Services, likely in August. He promises 
that the company will stick to ``the things that got us here and 
that we do well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In its last big acquisition before broadcast.com, Yahoo laid off  
two-thirds of the work force at GeoCities and moved its 
headquarters to Yahoo's home in Santa Clara, Calif. Wagner 
predicted that won't happen to his company, which has more than 300 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Layoffs ``are not contemplated in this transaction,'' he said.  
``We'll run as a separate division within Yahoo. We will continue 
to grow here in Dallas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts such as Daniel King of LaSalle Street Capital Markets  
in Chicago say the deal is a good fit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Broadcast.com has a great deal of content but they really need  
a lot more traffic to grow their client base,'' King said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wagner sees growth in the Internet dependent on making the  
medium more interactive, personal and useful. He predicted that 
people will pay to get Web sites without advertising and even pay 
per-view, although broadcast.com has mostly steered clear of that 
format because it would have to refund customers who caught a poor 
signal or none at all. 
</P>
<P>
	The Internet will change radically in the next few years as  
wireless and faster broadband connections spread and as people surf 
the Web with televisions and other appliances -- breaking the tether 
that ties the Internet to desktop PCs. Wagner said better 
technology will replace today's jerky, grainy Internet video with 
high-definition pictures. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, 1998 and 1999 have been as good as it gets in the  
careers of Cuban and Wagner. July 17 marked the first anniversary 
of the IPO that made them very rich. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was a very great day, no question,'' he said with a  
laugh.

<HEADLINE> Qwest Turns a Small Profit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Qwest Communications International, which last  
week won a bidding war to acquire U S West, turned a small profit 
in the second quarter, edging Wall Street forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
	The Denver-based company earned $18.5 million, or 2 cent per  
share, during the April-June period. 
</P>
<P>
	In last year's second quarter, Qwest lost $808.9 million, or  
$1.67 a share, but that includes one-time expenses of $812.5 
million related to the purchase of long-distance provider LCI 
International and other communications companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest results topped analyst profit projections of 1 cent  
per share and bolstered Qwest's stock price, which had sagged 18 
percent since the U S West deal was announced early last week. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tuesday's Nasdaq trading, Qwest rose $1.56 1/4, or 5.5 percent,  
to close at $30.12 1/2 per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest, which recently finished building an 18,500-mile network  
of fiber-optic cables, waged an aggressive campaign to acquire U S 
West, the Baby Bell phone company serving the Rocky Mountains and 
Pacific Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
	U S West had already agreed to merge with Global Crossing when  
Qwest made an unsolicited offer of nearly $35 billion in stock. The 
bid is part of Qwest's bid to position itself as a supercarrier for 
torrents of data traffic from the Internet, phone calls and TV. 
</P>
<P>
	Some investors worry that Qwest's growth strategy may be too  
ambitious, suggested Tom Friedberg, an industry analyst at 
Denver-based Janco Partners Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	But overall, ``I think people are happy that Qwest continues to  
demonstrate positive earnings results,'' Friedberg said. ``The 
company continues to beat analysts' expectations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest's second-quarter revenues totaled $873.7 million, a 25.6  
percent increase over the $695.3 million in combined revenues that 
Qwest, LCI and the other companies would have posted as a single 
entity during the same period last year. By itself, Qwest had 
revenues of $393.7 million in the second quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Core communications services accounted for $790.4 million of  
Qwest's revenues from the latest quarter, a 46 percent jump 
compared with the same operations a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The second-quarter results ``clearly illustrate the management's  
ability to effectively direct Qwest's day-to-day operations while 
expanding our market leadership position,'' Joseph P. Nacchio, 
Qwest's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement.

<HEADLINE> Shane Spencer Rejoins Yankees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Outfielder Shane Spencer, sidelined because of an  
irregular heartbeat, rejoined the New York Yankees on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been taking it easy for three weeks. I'm bored,'' said  
Spencer, who was placed on the disabled list July 3 and treated for 
atrial fibrillation. 
</P>
<P>
	Spencer, 27, was re-evaluated July 12 and declared in stable  
condition with a normal heart rate. He went 7-for-16 in five games 
with Triple-A Columbus during a rehab assignment before being 
activated. 
</P>
<P>
	``They said it just happens. It's a pretty common thing,'' said  
Spencer, who is not taking medication. He said he has no history of 
heart trouble in his family. 
</P>
<P>
	Spencer was hitting .243 with six homers and 12 RBIs this  
season. 
</P>
<P>
	His return means left field once again is congested with  
Spencer, Ricky Ledee and Chad Curtis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what the answer is, but I think we'll be all  
right,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not up to me,'' Spencer said. ``I'll look at the lineup  
card like before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Left-hander Ed Yarnall, who appeared in two games, was sent to  
Columbus to make room on the roster for Spencer.

<HEADLINE> Khmer Rouge Case May Be Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) -- Lawmakers from Prime Minister Hun  
Sen's ruling party said Tuesday they want to amend Cambodian law to 
give prosecutors more time to gather evidence against Khmer Rouge 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	They disagreed on whether the proposed amendment would allow a  
delay in the trial of Khmer Rouge guerrilla chief Ta Mok, which 
must otherwise begin by Sept. 9. 
</P>
<P>
	The law now allows authorities to hold suspects for up to six  
months before trial. Forty-two lawmakers from the Cambodian 
People's Party submitted a petition to the assembly's legislative 
committee on July 16 calling for the six-month limit to be waived 
if suspects are charged with genocide, crimes against humanity or 
war crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmaker Cheam Yeap said prosecutors have complained that six  
months is not enough time to investigate such serious crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that if the measure is swiftly passed, it could be  
applied to the military court's case against Ta Mok, who was 
arrested March 6 and arraigned three days later on charges of 
belonging to an illegal organization. 
</P>
<P>
	But another lawmaker who signed the petition, Ek Samol, said he  
thought the proposed amendment was intended solely for a planned 
genocide tribunal for Khmer Rouge leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cambodian government and the United Nations are working to  
create a tribunal to try top Khmer Rouge figures for the deaths of 
an estimated 1.7 million Cambodians during 1975-79. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides Ta Mok, only one other senior Khmer Rouge figure now is  
awaiting trial -- chief executioner Kaing Khek Iev, better known by 
his revolutionary name Duch. 
</P>
<P>
	Every other surviving Khmer Rouge leader lives freely in  
Cambodia after striking deals with Hun Sen that led to the 
dissolution of the guerrilla movement.

<HEADLINE> Golfer Scores Two Holes-in-One  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLTON, Mass. (AP) -- A hole-in-one is remarkable enough. Two  
in one round is extraordinary. 
</P>
<P>
	Neil Bartholomew, a 3-handicapper who plays out of Holden Hills  
Country Club, did just that Sunday, acing two holes in the same 
round of the Harold Krause Memorial Tournament at Heritage Country 
Club. 
</P>
<P>
	Using an 8-iron, he scored his first career ace on the 165-yard  
13th hole. Three holes and less than an hour later, he grabbed his 
second with a 7-iron on the 175-yard 16th hole. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if I'll ever come down from this,'' Bartholomew,  
42, told the Telegram &AMP; Gazette of Worcester. ``I've had shots 
inside of 2 inches, shots hanging on the hole. I've been very close 
a lot of times, so many times that I thought it would never 
happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the 13th hole, his shot landed 2 feet in front of the hole,  
took two hops and rolled in. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of pocketing the ball for posterity's sake, he continued  
to play it. 
</P>
<P>
	On the 16th, the shot landed and rolled toward the hole.  
</P>
<P>
	``It looked like it was just hanging on the edge,'' Bartholomew  
said. ``After a second or two delay, it fell in. We just went 
crazy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the second hole-in-one, he took the ball out of play.  
</P>
<P>
	He won a set of clubs for the first ace, and $250 in merchandise  
from a local pro shop for the second. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the two aces, however, Bartholomew didn't win the  
tournament. His play didn't make up for that of his three 
teammates, said Shane Bacigalupo, a member of that team and one of 
the tournament organizers. 
</P>
<P>
	Richie Powers, a co-owner of the course who has worked there  
since 1964, estimated that five or six holes-in-one are made at the 
course each year. 
</P>
<P>
	As far as two aces in one round were concerned, Powers said: ``I  
know we never had it happen here before.''

<HEADLINE> S&AMP;P 500 Funds: Not All Alike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It seems pretty straightforward -- a mutual fund  
that invests in stocks that are part of the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 
Index. Buy shares of that fund and you'll get a return pretty close 
to that of the S&AMP;P. 
</P>
<P>
	But if you look at the more than 100 funds that focus on the S&AMP;P  
500, you'll find it's more complex than that. Not all S&AMP;P 500 funds 
are alike, mostly because of a variation in returns. 
</P>
<P>
	So far this year, the GE Institutional S&AMP;P 500 Index fund has  
returned nearly 12 percent, while the Pillar Equity Index Fund has 
returned just over 10 percent, according to Lipper Inc. Over the 
same period, the S&AMP;P 500 itself has returned 11.49 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The divergence largely results from fees, the bite taken out of  
an investor's return to pay the costs of running a fund. That 
includes salaries for fund managers and staff, commission for 
buying and selling stocks and printing and mailing costs for 
reports. The disparity can also come from differences in the way 
funds buy and sell S&AMP;P 500 stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Fees are a big issue for funds, investors and the Securities and  
Exchange Commission, which wants fund companies to be more upfront 
about fees. 
</P>
<P>
	The key number for investors trying to size up a fund's fee is  
its expense ratio, which for the average stock fund is about 1.45 
percent. The GE Institutional S&AMP;P fund has an expense ratio of 0.15 
percent; at the Pillar fund, it's 1.8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Does a percentage point or two matter all that much? Over time  
it absolutely does, according to The Independent Adviser, a 
newsletter for Vanguard investors that says it has no ties to the 
mutual fund company. 
</P>
<P>
	The newsletter calculated that $100,000 invested under an  
expense ratio of 0.18 percent -- the ratio for Vanguard's Index 
Trust 500 fund -- would grow to $794,810 over 15 years. That's 
$122,132 more than the amount returned under a 1.45 percent expense 
ratio. 
</P>
<P>
	``It might cost you quite a bit in the long run,'' said Jeremy  
Siegel, a professor of finance at the Wharton School at the 
University of Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	``Either they don't care that much or they're not aware of the  
differences,'' he said of investors who are getting a lower return. 
</P>
<P>
	Many investors do care, and that has helped Vanguard's Index  
Trust 500 fund grow to $92.64 billion in assets, placing it just 
behind the biggest mutual fund, Fidelity Magellan, which has $97.59 
billion (The Magellan, a growth fund, has a 0.62 percent expense 
ratio). 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past five years, Vanguard's Index Trust 500 fund and  
its Institutional Index fund, which also tracks the S&AMP;P 500, have 
been the top two funds in the S&AMP;P 500 category, according to 
Lipper. The Vanguard 500 Index fund has had an annualized return of 
27.08 percent, while the Institutional fund has returned 27.24 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The difference in their returns is due in part to the lower  
costs of an institutional fund -- because it has a different 
investor base, it doesn't need to send reports and newsletters to 
individual investors that can drive up costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Vanguard's edge comes in part from the fact that unlike most  
mutual fund companies, it is owned by the investors in its funds. 
Most other companies are owned by stockholders, and so part of the 
returns generated by a fund must be diverted to them. 
</P>
<P>
	For some investors, there may be good reasons for investors to  
accept a lower return. The choice may be based on convenience -- 
they're already invested in a fund family such as Fidelity and like 
the ease with which they can switch money from one fund to another. 
</P>
<P>
	If they have brokerage accounts with firms like Morgan Stanley  
Dean Witter or Merrill Lynch, they might be more inclined to follow 
the advice of a broker they trust -- and who's likely to steer them 
toward his or her company's own funds. In such cases, brokers are 
also getting a piece of the return. 
</P>
<P>
	While all S&AMP;P 500 index funds focus on the same stocks, there  
are some differences in how they buy those stocks that also affect 
returns, said Jim Folwell, a consultant with the firm Cerulli 
Associates in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	``An index fund does not buy all 500 stocks,'' Folwell said.  
``They buy securities that will represent and track to some 
extent'' the S&AMP;P 500. 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that if when a fund receives money from investors, it  
buys according to an investment model it has set up. 
</P>
<P>
	The best way to find out the differences among funds is to read  
their prospectuses or look them up on their Web sites. Also, the 
Securities and Exchange Commission has a mutual fund cost 
calculator on its Web site (www.sec.gov/mfcc/mfcc-int.htm) to help 
investors estimate how much it costs to own a mutual fund, and to 
compare those costs with other funds.

<HEADLINE> '60 Minutes' Leads CBS in Nielsens / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ``60 Minutes'' led a crowded field of  
newsmagazines to the top of the ratings during a week when viewers 
bored with reruns turned increasingly to cable. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS won the network competition with a 6.4 rating and 12 share.  
NBC was second with a 5.9 rating and 11 share and ABC was at 5.6 
and 11, Nielsen Media Research said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``60 Minutes'' was among six newsmagazines that were the 12 most  
popular prime-time shows last week. Unlike many of its rivals, ``60 
Minutes'' didn't do any stories about John F. Kennedy Jr.'s fatal 
plane crash. 
</P>
<P>
	During prime-time last week, 42 percent of TV viewers were  
watching either CBS, NBC, ABC or Fox. However, 46 percent of 
viewers were watching a basic cable network, the highest weekly 
share for cable during the current television season, according to 
the Cabletelevision Advertising Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox had a 4.1 rating and 8 share for the week, the WB had a 2.4

<HEADLINE> Analysis of First Alexander Ad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	An analysis of Lamar Alexander's first television commercial of  
the 2000 presidential campaign: 
</P>
<P>
	TITLE: ``Auction''  
</P>
<P>
	LENGTH: 30 seconds.  
</P>
<P>
	PRODUCER: Internally by the campaign.  
</P>
<P>
	AIRING: Statewide in Iowa  
</P>
<P>
	SCRIPT: Mock television reporter: ``This just in ... the Iowa  
caucuses have been canceled. An auction is underway on the White 
House lawn.'' Auctioneer: ``25, now 30, 30 now 40, 40 now 50'' 
Reporter: The nomination is going to the bidder with the most 
cash.'' Auctioneer: ``50 million, going once, twice, I've sold it 
for 50 million.'' Alexander: ``The presidency ought to be about 
raising children, farm prices and standards ... not just raising 
money. I've been all over Iowa because the presidency's too 
important to be bought or inherited. It ought to be earned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	IMAGES: The spot opens with the image of a television reporter  
in front of the White House seeking to convey a sense of urgency. 
It then switches to an auction on the White House lawn with a group 
of cigar-smoking men wearing black cowboy hats while a potbellied 
auctioneer conducts the sale, purportedly of the GOP presidential 
nomination. The commercial then switches to a somber-looking 
Alexander wearing a business suit and speaking directly into the 
camera. 
</P>
<P>
	ANALYSIS: With Texas Gov. George W. Bush raising far more money  
than any of his GOP rivals, Alexander uses humor to raise the issue 
that ``big money'' is threatening the nomination process. The 
commercial also seeks to play on the independent streak of Iowa 
activists in both parties, who cherish their role in presidential 
campaigns. It warns that there are candidates who are putting more 
emphasis on money than courting activists in Iowa. Alexander argues 
that he's trying to save the Iowa caucuses by doing traditional 
grass-roots campaigning, while others ignore the state. The timing 
of the commercial was picked because campaign activity has been 
very heavy in the state recently in advance of the Ames straw poll 
next month.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Down on Weather / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures fell sharply early  
today on the Chicago Board of Trade amid forecasts for rain across 
Midwest growing regions, which will relieve dry pockets. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn and soybeans took the brunt of the losses, dropping sharply  
a second day, as forecasters predicted moderating temperatures 
early next week in major growing regions, which will be accompanied 
by widespread rainfall. 
</P>
<P>
	The forecasts come after government on Monday reported crop  
conditions had not deteriorated significantly last week in Illinois 
and Iowa, the nation's largest growing states, despite temperatures 
that rose to their highest so far this year. That likely means 
farmers remain on track to produce bumper fall harvests. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat fell in sympathy with corn and soybeans.  
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery fell 3 1/2 cents to $2.71 1/2 a bushel;  
December corn fell 5 1/4 cents to $2.11 1/4 a bushel; December oats fell 
1 1/2 cents to $1.15 1/4 a bushel; November soybeans fell 14 cents to 
$4.48 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef futures retreated on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while  
pork futures were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	August live cattle fell .18 cent to 65.27 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle fell .12 cent to 77.40 cents a pound; August lean 
hogs fell .97 cent to 48.10 cents a pound; August pork bellies fell 
.32 cent to 44.15 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Agent Denies Race Had Role in Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Assertions by Donovan McNabb's agent that  
race may be playing a role in contract negotiations with the 
Philadelphia Eagles are ``absurd,'' coach Andy Reid said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Race will never been an issue,'' Reid said, addressing a  
broadcast interview with agent Fletcher Smith aired Tuesday in 
Philadelphia. ``Not now, nor never.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview on Philadelphia's Comcast SportsNet, Smith  
raised the possibility that the Eagles were reluctant to give 
McNabb a contract without voidable years because he is black. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's not much history with black quarterbacks, but you  
definitely don't want to see Tim Couch, Peyton Manning, Ryan Leaf, 
Kerry Collins get the kind of deals they got and it was no issue. 
We'll pay these guys,'' Smith said in the cable TV interview. 
</P>
<P>
	``If (McNabb) hasn't said it to me or anyone else, I know he's  
like, well, why now? Why pull the plug now when for the past couple 
of years you've been consistently doing it for the white 
quarterbacks? And now it's my turn, and I have to stick to the 
structure that, if I play so well then I'll get paid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith told The Associated Press Tuesday night that the issue of  
race has never come up in his negotiations with Joe Banner, the 
Eagles' executive vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have not brought up race with them,'' Smith said. ``I have  
always negotiated based on Donovan McNabb's talents, not the color 
of his skin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Eagles and McNabb are believed to be discussing details of a  
$50 million, seven-year contract including a signing bonus of up to 
$12 million. The deal is hung up on the issues of voidable years 
and a buyback clause. The Eagles don't want to include them, while 
McNabb wants to be able to renegotiate after three or four seasons 
-- and possibly get another huge signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	McNabb, the No. 2 overall pick in the draft, was due in camp  
Sunday night and missed a second day of practice for rookies and 
selected veterans Tuesday. McNabb is the projected backup to 
starting quarterback Doug Pederson. 
</P>
<P>
	Banner has not commented specifically on the talks. But he  
issued his strongest challenge yet to McNabb at the team's training 
facility at Lehigh University on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Banner cited Steve McNair, the No. 3 pick in the 1995 draft, as  
a quarterback who benefited from not having voidable years and a 
buyback clause. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a structure that we think has some problems with it,''  
Banner said. ``And thus, we're asking somebody to have both the 
courage and the foresight to do something different.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith told the AP he had no reason to believe race was the  
reason the Eagles opposed such a deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really don't think race is an issue in this contract  
negotiation,'' Smith said. ``Prior to drafting Donovan, voidable 
years was an issue they did not care to deal with. And knowing Andy 
Reid's history, Brett Favre didn't have a voidable deal. I just 
think that they truly feel it's not in the best interests of the 
player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Eagles still have three other draft picks unsigned:  
third-round pick Doug Brzezinski and fourth-round picks Na Brown 
and Damon Moore. Veterans are due in camp Wednesday, and the first 
full-squad workout is scheduled for Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want them all in here now,'' Reid said. ``I am not in favor  
of holdouts.''

<P>
	KITZBUEHEL, Austria (AP) -- Yevgeny Kafelnikov of Russia, the  
Australian Open champion, needed nearly two hours to do it, but he 
survived a second-round scare in the General Open on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kafelnikov outlasted Slava Dosedel 7-6 (7-3), 1-6, 6-3 in the  
second round of the Generali Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was not easy, I felt that I had only 60 or 70 percent of my  
potential,'' Kafelnikov said after his first match in the hot 
conditions in the Austrian Alps. ``I need another day to get used 
to the conditions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defending champion Albert Costa of Spain won his 11th straight  
match in the clay-court event, beating Germany's Michael Kholmann 
6-4, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
	In other second-round matches, Slovakia's Karol Kucera beat  
Australia's Wayne Arthurs 6-3, 6-4, and Australia's Richard 
Fromberg defeated Russia's Marat Safin 6-3, 6-2.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks led the market to its  
strongest performance in more than a week today as investors hunted 
for bargains among shares that have been beaten down in recent 
sessions. At the close of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones 
industrial average was up 115.88 at 10,979.04. The blue-chip index 
rose as much as 168 points during the session, rebounding strongly 
from Monday's shiftless 47.80-point loss. Broader stock indicators 
were also higher. The Nasdaq composite index rose 60.50 to 
2,679.69. After last week, when the Nasdaq dropped 172.08 points, a 
loss of 6.1 percent, analysts said investors were ready to scoop up 
technology stocks at their discounted prices.

	Consumer Confidence Falls in July  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After rising eight straight months to a 30-year  
high, consumer confidence fell in July, a sign that the Federal 
Reserve has succeeded in cooling off economic growth by raising 
interest rates. The Conference Board reported today that its index 
of consumer confidence, which measures consumers' propensity to 
spend, declined 3.4 points to 135.6 in July, from 139.0 in June. 
Economists, who had not been expecting so big a drop, said it was 
partly the result of Fed's June 30 move to nudge up short-term 
interest rates one-quarter of a percentage point in a pre-emptive 
strike against inflation.

	Feds Won't Regulate Cable Net Access  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators have chosen a wait-and-see  
attitude as the legal brawl rages on over whether cable companies 
offering high-speed Internet services must share lines with their 
competitors. But the Federal Communications Commission has made one 
point clear: Even in the absence of federal intervention, it does 
not want thousands of local municipalities coming up with their own 
regulations. So-called broadband access over cable lines provides 
connection speeds dozens of times faster than today's telephone 
modems. But consumer groups say the flip side of this is that cable 
companies -- which are not regulated as ``common carriers'' -- 
control not only the wires, but the programs that people see.

	Unready Brokerages Face Y2K Closing

the Year 2000, under new rules adopted today. In a 5-0 vote, the 
Securities and Exchange Commission set a target date of Aug. 31 for 
brokerage firms to complete their Year 2000 compliance efforts but 
also allows additional time for unprepared firms to show that they 
will be ready no later than Nov. 15. ``Any firm that cannot achieve 
Y2K compliance in a timely fashion will be required to cease doing 
business by Dec. 1,'' SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt said before the

cover the cost of layoffs and other restructuring activities. The 
loss, forecast by the company last month, amounted to $1.65 per 
share. That compared to a loss of $55 million, or 84 cents per 
share, during the year-ago period. The company reported revenues of 
$212.2 million in the three months ended June 30, down from $281.2

admissions at its hospitals. The nation's largest hospital company, 
which for more than two years has been the target of a federal 
billing fraud investigation, reported income of $181 million, or 31 
cents per share in the second quarter, down from $191 million or 30 
cents per share in the same period a year ago. The profit excluded 
gains on the sale of hospitals, restructuring and 
investigation-related costs. Results beat Wall Street forecasts by 
1 cent, according to First Call Corp. The figures on per share 
earnings reflect stock buybacks. Columbia/HCLA stock was down 7/16

during the April-June period. In last year's second quarter, Qwest 
lost $808.9 million, or $1.67 a share, but that includes one-time 
expenses of $812.5 million related to the purchase of long-distance 
provider LCI International and other communications companies. The 
latest results topped analyst profit projections of 1 cent per 
share and bolstered Qwest's stock price, which had sagged 18

Qwest stock was up 1 9/16 at 30 1/8 today.

<HEADLINE> Bryant Gumbel Praised by CBS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- CBS is sparing no effort -- or praise --  
when it comes to Bryant Gumbel's return to morning television. 
</P>
<P>
	Gumbel, who moved to CBS after hosting NBC's dominant ``Today''  
for 15 years, will debut Nov. 1 with ``The Early Show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A high-tech studio with a ``Today''-like window on New York's  
Fifth Avenue is under construction. An intensive search for 
Bryant's co-host is under way. And Lisa Birnbach (``The Official 
Preppy Handbook'') and Martha Quinn, one of MTV's original VJs, 
have been signed as contributors. 
</P>
<P>
	Is Bryant, whose primetime CBS newsmagazine ``Public Eye with  
Bryant Gumbel'' was a ratings flop, worth the attention? Yes, CBS 
news executives told the Television Critics Association on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no one better at morning television in the world,''  
said CBS News President Andrew Heyward. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is nobody better than this man in live television ...  
this is the man that the '90s and the next millennium were made 
for,'' echoed Steve Friedman, senior executive producer for ``The 
Early Show'' and a ``Today'' alumnus. 
</P>
<P>
	When it came to the new show's performance, Heyward was more  
measured in his expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's plenty to gain without having to suddenly make  
grandiose claims about what's going to happen with the `Today' 
show. The `Today' show is excellent. ... we're not predicting any 
kind of immediate, dramatic result here.''

<HEADLINE> Sinclair To Sell Radio Stations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc. plans to sell 43  
radio stations in nine markets to Entercom Communications Corp. for 
$821.5 million in cash. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal announced Monday would be the latest in a wave of sales  
in the radio industry since federal limits on how many stations a 
single company may own were relaxed. Entercom, based in Bala 
Cynwyd, Pa., near Philadelphia, already owns 42 radio stations in 
six markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale would also allow Sinclair to concentrate on its TV  
operations. The Baltimore-based broadcaster owns or provides 
programs for 59 TV stations in 38 markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of a letter of intent, Entercom would also buy $5  
million worth of advertising on Sinclair's television stations 
during the next five years and pay for up to $2 million in capital 
improvements that Sinclair had committed to undertake. 
</P>
<P>
	Sinclair expects to realize $650 million from the deal after  
taxes and will initially use the money to pay down debt. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sinclair is now positioned to take advantage of the next wave  
of station consolidation, the advent of digital television and the 
convergence of television and the Internet,'' Sinclair chief 
executive David Smith said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the company would also consider buying its own stock.  
</P>
<P>
	The deal excludes Sinclair's five FM stations and one AM radio  
station in St. Louis. Indianapolis-based Emmis Communications Corp. 
has an option to buy those stations, according to David Amy, 
Sinclair's chief financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies expect to need three weeks to complete  
negotiations on the deal, which is also subject to approval by the 
Federal Communications Commission and Department of Justice as well 
as the boards of both companies. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading Tuesday, Entercom was up $2.62 1/2 a share at $39.75 on  
the New York Stock Exchange while Sinclair was up 12 1/2 cents a share 
at $17.50 on the Nasdaq Stock Market.

<HEADLINE> Sean Elliott Awaits Kidney Donor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Sean Elliott is waiting for definitive word  
that a kidney donor has been found. 
</P>
<P>
	``The good news is that there is a possibility that a member of  
my family could be a match,'' the San Antonio Spurs forward said 
Monday. ``But it is too early to tell. There are further tests that 
have to be conducted and until all of the tests are complete, it is 
premature to make any predictions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spurs spokesman Tom James said testing will last two or three  
more days, and the team will announce when there is a match. 
</P>
<P>
	Potential donors must be examined to see if they are in good  
enough health to donate a kidney. 
</P>
<P>
	The tests on family members probably will take place in Tuscon,  
Ariz., and final preoperative tests will take place once the donor 
arrives in San Antonio, the San Antonio Express-News reported. The 
newspaper said blood samples were taken from Elliott's two brothers 
and his mother, Odiemae. 
</P>
<P>
	KSAT-TV reported earlier Monday that one of Elliott's brothers  
had a compatible kidney. The station quoted a source close to 
Elliott but did not report which brother, Noel or Robert, was the 
match. 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott's father, Robert Elliott, is not a candidate because he  
is diabetic. 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott, a 31-year-old starter on the Spurs' NBA championship  
team, needs a kidney transplant to avoid dialysis. 
</P>
<P>
	His disease, focal segmental glomerular sclerosis, is one of a  
variety of kidney ailments that result in severe, prolonged loss of 
protein into the urine. The cause is not clear.

<HEADLINE> '60 Minutes' Leads CBS in Nielsens / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ``60 Minutes'' was the most popular prime-time  
show during a week when viewer defection to cable television hit a 
season peak. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS won the network competition with a 6.4 rating and 12 share.  
NBC was second with a 5.9 rating and 11 share and ABC was at 5.6 
and 11, Nielsen Media Research said on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``60 Minutes'' was among six newsmagazines that were the 12 most  
popular prime-time shows last week. Unlike many of its rivals, ``60 
Minutes'' didn't do any stories about John F. Kennedy Jr.'s fatal 
plane crash. 
</P>
<P>
	During prime-time last week, 42 percent of TV viewers were  
watching either CBS, NBC, ABC or Fox. However, 46 percent of 
viewers were watching a basic cable network, the highest weekly 
share for cable during the current television season, according to 
the Cabletelevision Advertising Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox had a 4.1 rating and 8 share for the week, the WB had a 2.4  
rating and 5 share, UPN was at 1.5 and 3 and Pax TV had a 0.7 and 
1. 
</P>
<P>
	Evening news ratings jumped during the week following the  
Kennedy plane crash. NBC's ``Nightly News'' had a 7.8 rating and 17 
share, narrowly beating ABC's ``World News Tonight,'' which was at 
7.7 and 17. The ``CBS Evening News'' had a 6.5 rating and 14 share. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 994,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 99.4 million TV homes. The share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of July 19-25, the top 10 shows, their networks and  
ratings were: ``60 Minutes,'' CBS, 10.1; ``20/20-Wednesday,'' ABC, 
9.3; ``Frasier'' special, NBC, 8.7; ``Everybody Loves Raymond,'' 
CBS, 8.5; ``48 Hours-Monday,'' CBS, 8.2; ``Touched By an Angel,'' 
CBS, 8.2; ``Becker,'' CBS, 8.1; ``Frasier,'' NBC, 8.1; ``Dateline 
NBC-Tuesday,'' NBC, 7.9; ``20/20-Friday,'' ABC, 7.8; ``Dateline 
NBC-Wednesday,'' NBC, 7.8; ``Friends,'' NBC, 7.8.

<HEADLINE> Democratic Fund-Raiser Dutko Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. (AP) -- Dan Dutko, a major Democratic  
fund-raiser and member of the Democratic National Committee, died 
Tuesday of head injuries suffered in a mountain biking accident 
over the weekend in Aspen. 
</P>
<P>
	Dutko, 54, of Chevy Chase, Md., was in Aspen for a Democratic  
fund-raiser attended by President Clinton on Saturday. He was 
co-chairman of Leadership 2000, the DNC's top finance committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``He enriched our lives with his enthusiasm and served his  
country with distinction,'' Clinton said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Dutko first met Clinton while coordinating the McGovern campaign  
in West Texas in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	He held many other high-level political positions, including  
vice chairman of finance for Clinton-Gore in 1995; finance chairman 
of the 53rd inaugural ball; and vice chairman of finance for the 
DNC in 1996 and national finance chairman for Maryland Lt. Gov. 
Kathleen Kennedy Townsend. 
</P>
<P>
	Dutko had also been chief of staff for Sen. Donald Stewart,  
D-Ala., and Rep. Bob Krueger, D-Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Streator, Ill., Dutko joined the Air Force as a  
teen-ager and served for four years. He later received his 
bachelor's degree from San Angelo State University in Texas and 
worked as a missile systems test engineer and research director. 
</P>
<P>
	Dutko was a founding partner and chairman of The Dutko Group  
Inc., a public policy management and lobbying firm based in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	State Trooper Shane Dillard said Dutko and two friends were  
riding mountain bikes Sunday when Dutko lost control of his bicycle 
and hit his head on the pavement. Dutko was not wearing a helmet, 
Dillard said.

<HEADLINE> Pan Am Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Wayne Weathers is pursuing an Olympic  
dream in one sport while getting paid to play another. 
</P>
<P>
	Weathers, a linebacker for the Winnipeg Blue Bombers of the  
Canadian Football League, is competing for Canada in freestyle 
wrestling at the Pan American Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Ranked No. 1 in Canada at 130 kilograms, Weathers learned just  
before last week's game at Montreal he would be wrestling in the 
games. Wrestling ends Wednesday, so he'll return to the Blue 
Bombers in time for Thursday night's game at Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
	The timing made the decision to compete in these games an easy  
one. But Weathers' goal is to wrestle in the Olympics, and if he 
makes the Canadian team next year, he would face a tougher 
decision. He'd have to give up football for a while to train for 
the Sydney Games in September, right in the middle of the CFL 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would concentrate on the Olympics,'' Weathers said. ``But if  
we could do something around it ... the football people have been 
so accomodating with it. They haven't had a problem about me doing 
the wrestling part. They told me, `Do whatever you need to do.' 
They've been great about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But what if he had a chance to play in the NFL next season?  
Would he still choose going to the Olympics? 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a question,'' Weathers said, pausing for a moment.  
``I'd probably still try to make the Olympics first. Then maybe the 
NFL would be there for me when I come back. If they wanted me, it 
would still be there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weathers, 26, reasons that in wrestling, there's nothing better  
than the Olympics, so he'd better go for it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ever since I started wrestling, I've been thinking about  
that,'' he said. ``Since there's nothing after it in wrestling, 
that's the main focus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weathers split his first two matches in the Pan Ams competition.  
He was pinned in the first round, then needed just 32 seconds to 
pin his second-round opponent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I figure right now I'm in the top 10 in the world,'' Weathers  
said. ``We'll just see how far I can get up there and still do 
other things.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *GOLDEN COMEBACK:* Emma Robinson had to battle more than just  
choppy water and the other competitors to win the gold medal in 
pairs rowing. 
</P>
<P>
	With partner Theresa Luke, Robinson won the race only four  
months after surgery for thyroid cancer. Though still on 
medication, she said her health is no longer a day-to-day concern. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really happy to be here and I'm happy that things seem to  
be fully recovered,'' Robinson said. ``I'm not feeling tired or 
fatigued at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because she was radioactive from her treatments for a few days,  
she had to avoid her teammates for those periods. Other than that, 
she trains just like always and inspires her teammates with every 
stroke. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm able to say, `Wow, if she can do that, I can do that and  
more,' '' Luke said. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *WRONG TURN:* An Ecuadorian athlete was denied a chance to  
compete in the women's 20-kilometer race walk because a voluntary 
driver took her to the wrong place. 
</P>
<P>
	Miriam Ramon, who competed in the 1992 Olympics, was distraught  
after arriving at the course 10 minutes into the race at 
Assiniboine Park. Her driver mistakenly took her first to Bird's 
Hill Park on the other side of Winnipeg. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is an incredible misfortune,'' said Dalilo Carrera, head of  
the Ecuador Olympic Committee. ``I don't know what happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The chief operating officer for the Pan Am Games, Bob McMahon,  
said Ramon was driven to the event because she missed the bus that 
takes athletes to their competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``The shuttle left on time,'' McMahon said. ``Every other  
competitor made it. I don't know how much she missed the bus by.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *CANADIAN COUPLE:* The rewards of playing their national teams  
in the same sport only go so far for Rick Roberts and Lisa Faust. 
</P>
<P>
	Roberts plays for Canada's field hockey team and Faust, whom he  
married last year, is a member of the women's team. But just 
because they're married doesn't mean they're roommates. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's so great to have family close by at a time like this,''  
Faust said. ``We are so supportive of each other. But it is a bit 
of a tease living down the hall from each other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They also might not see each other play much, because when one  
has a game, the other also might have a game or be practicing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tournament is all business,'' Roberts said. ``We might  
share a lunch or dinner together or a little television in the 
common room, but we're not spending any substantial time in each 
other's rooms.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With both teams expected to medal, that time together can wait.

	GOP, Democrats Spar Over Tax Cut  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans and Democrats sparred today on the  
eve of Senate debate over tax cuts, with Vice President Al Gore 
accusing the GOP of ignoring Medicare. Majority Leader Trent Lott 
said Congress should return budget surplus money to taxpayers and 
predicted passage of the $792 billion, 10-year tax cut measure 
before the week is out. President Clinton has vowed a veto, though, 
and a final compromise, if there is one, is weeks or months away. 
The centerpiece of the GOP proposal would reduce the 15 percent 
income tax rate to 14 percent, effective in 2001. The measure also 
contains tax breaks for education, IRAs, long-term care insurance, 
small businesses and estates.

	U.S., Russia To Hold Nuclear Talks  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States and Russia agreed today to  
begin a new round of talks in Moscow next month to reduce their 
long-range nuclear weapons. The decision was announced at the 
windup of talks Russian Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin held with 
Vice President Al Gore. Stepashin's visit was geared toward putting 
U.S.-Russian relations on an even course after an angry rift over 
NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia. In 1993, the United States and Russia 
agreed to shrink their arsenals of long-range nuclear warheads, but 
the Russian legislature has refused to ratify the accord.

	FDA OKs Flu Drug Despite Concerns  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An inhalant used to treat simple influenza has  
been approved by the Food and Drug Administration, despite an 
advisory panel recommendation that the drug be rejected. The drug, 
to be marketed under the name Relenza, was approved by the FDA 
based on clinical studies that showed it reduced the duration of 
flu symptoms by 24 to 36 hours. An FDA advisory panel in February 
voted against recommending approval of Relenza, saying the drug 
showed only a small benefit for flu sufferers.

	Phone Tower in National Park Debated  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Schoolchildren visiting Rock Creek national  
park may soon come across something not natural to the terrain: 
cell phone towers. Many Washington residents, including the mayor, 
say they don't want cell towers on the swath of greenery that 
bisects the city. But the Senate added a provision to the District 
of Columbia budget appropriations bill earlier this month that 
would require the National Park Service to allow two towers to be 
built there for cell phone use. The House of Representatives' 
version of the bill, scheduled for a vote this week, does not have 
the cell phone tower provision.

	Upper Midwest Gets Break From Heat  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Parts of the Midwest got a break today from the  
heat wave blamed for more than two dozen deaths, giving utilities a 
breather from the strain of keeping air conditioners running full 
tilt. Afternoon temperatures were only in the 80s across the 
northern Plains and much of the Ohio Valley. However, temperatures 
to the south and east were again in the steamy 90s, and the Midwest 
was expected to return to that level later in the week. There have 
been at least 33 heat-related deaths in the past week.

	Lawmakers Want To Repeal Low-Flow Toilets  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some members of Congress want to flush away a  
federal law that requires new toilets to use less water. The new 
low-flow commodes are intended to save water, but some lawmakers 
complained today that you have to flush again -- and maybe again -- 
to rinse all waste out of the bowl. A 1992 conservation law 
requires less water for any new toilets installed in homes, along 
with lighter sprays in shower heads. Republican Rep. Joe 
Knollenberg of Michigan, said he has received thousands of 
complaints ``from disgruntled consumers who are angry that their 
new toilets repeatedly clog, require multiple flushing, and in the 
end do not save water.'' He said dozens of those complaints were 
written on toilet paper.

On Wall Street, the Dow ended up 115.88 at 10,979.04. Advancing

	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Mark McGwire hit his 37th homer during the  
St. Louis Cardinals' 2-1 loss against the San Francisco Giants 
today, taking the major league lead for the first time since 
opening day. The solo homer moved him one past Sammy Sosa, whose 
Chicago Cubs play tonight at Montreal. McGwire's 10th homer in his 
last 13 games, a 407-foot shot over the left-field bleachers, moved 
him past Lou Gehrig into sole possession of 16th place on the 
career list with 494 home runs.

<HEADLINE> Rams Raise Offer to Faulk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MACOMB, Ill. (AP) -- The St. Louis Rams have hiked their contract  
offer to holdout running back Marshall Faulk to more than $40 
million over seven years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rams have practiced for five days without Faulk, the NFL's  
best all-purpose back last year, and coach Dick Vermeil said 
Tuesday it's time to come to terms and get down to business. 
</P>
<P>
	``Enough is enough,'' Vermeil said. ``The time is now, let's go  
to work. That's the way I feel about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Faulk's agent, Rocky Arceneaux, and Rams vice president Jay  
Zygmunt met for about three hours Monday in St. Louis. Vermeil said 
the sides are close, but that ``it's still rocky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I have spent almost no time thinking about it and almost no  
time talking about it with Jay,'' Vermeil said. ``I just don't get 
involved in it, I really don't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vermeil diffused talk that Faulk would delay signing to duck  
this weekend's three-day practice and scrimmage with the 
Indianapolis Colts, his old team, in Champaign, Ill. The Rams 
acquired him two days before the draft for second- and fifth-round 
draft picks and Faulk left on less than perfect terms. 
</P>
<P>
	``We weren't planning to use him there anyway,'' Vermeil said.  
``We didn't want him to be a target. It's just common sense.''

<HEADLINE> Consumer Confidence Falls in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After rising eight straight months to a 30-year  
high, consumer confidence fell in July, a sign that the Federal 
Reserve has succeeded in cooling off economic growth by raising 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The Conference Board reported Tuesday that its index of consumer  
confidence, which measures consumers' propensity to spend, declined 
3.4 points to 135.6 in July, from 139.0 in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer sentiment is an important economic indicator, since  
consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of the nation's overall 
economic activity. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists, who had not been expecting so big a drop, said it  
was partly the result of Fed's June 30 move to nudge up short-term 
interest rates one-quarter of a percentage point in a pre-emptive 
strike against inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan signaled last week that the Fed is  
ready to pump up rates even higher if the economy shows signs of 
overheating. His remarks had sent stock averages retreating from 
all-time highs, although they recovered handsomely on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average rose 115.88 points, or by 1.1  
percent, to close at 10,979.04, helped by the report from the 
private business group and also by bargain-hunting buying following 
last week's selloff. The Dow reached an all-time high of 11,209.84 
on July 16. 
</P>
<P>
	Although economists are not ruling out a move by the Fed to  
further tighten credit next month, the Conference Board report 
indicated the central bank already may have already applied 
sufficient brakes. 
</P>
<P>
	It ``probably does indicate that the consumer is going to be a  
little bit more cautious. Even the good economy and low 
unemployment rate has become old hat,'' said Donald Ratajczak, 
director of economic forecasting at Georgia State University. 
</P>
<P>
	The dip in confidence may reflect concerns about the tighter  
credit and less rosy job prospects that often accompany higher 
interest rates, said Lynn Franco, associate director of the board's 
consumer research center. 
</P>
<P>
	Anxiety about rising rates also has spurred a surge in home  
buying and mortgage refinancings. 
</P>
<P>
	``You watch the news, you know mortgage rates are at their  
lowest in decades, and you just get the sense you'd better move 
now,'' said John Farrell, who refinanced both a seven-bedroom house 
in Essex Fells, N.J., and a beach house on Long Beach Island, N.J., 
two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	With rates on the rise, Farrell said he had become edgy and  
wanted to lock in a mortgage before there was a further increase. 
His mortgage broker was so busy with similar deals that Farrell had 
to negotiate an extension of the timetable for closing the 
refinancings. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the National Association of Realtors reported that  
Americans' existing- home sales soared 10.6 percent last month to a 
record high, as consumers scrambled to lock in the best deals to 
beat slowly advancing mortgage rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The national average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage got  
as low as 6.49 percent last October, the lowest level since 1967, 
but has since climbed to 7.52 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Although consumer confidence slipped, it is far from a sign that  
the nation's longest peacetime economic expansion is on the ropes.

	Franco said the decline in the confidence index in July ``does  
not suggest a long-term erosion in consumer optimism,'' adding 
that, ``like the stock market, even today's gung-ho consumers need 
resting periods.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With index readings well over 100, Franco said there is ``plenty  
of strength left in the economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Conference Board's expectations index, which measures  
confidence in the economy's future, declined to 107.0 in July from 
114.9 in June. However, the group's ``present situation index,'' 
which measures current confidence, rose to 178.7 from 175.0. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers' assessment of current conditions improved with an  
increase in the proportion of respondents rating business 
conditions as ``good'' and a slight drop in the percentage saying 
jobs are hard to find. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, consumers' outlook six months from now was much less  
optimistic than in the previous survey. The percentage of 
respondents anticipating a pickup in business conditions dropped, 
as did the percentage of consumers expecting more jobs to be 
available in the coming months and the proportion anticipating 
gains in income. 
</P>
<P>
	The consumer confidence survey is based on a poll of 5,000  
households conducted by NFO Research Inc. of Greenwich, Conn. It 
uses a baseline of 100, set in 1985.

<HEADLINE> Former NFL Player Killed by Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Although several NFL players knew Demetrius  
DuBose had fallen on hard times, the last thing they expected to 
hear was that he'd been fatally shot by police who chased him down 
after he fled a burglary scene. 
</P>
<P>
	Dubose, 28, a former linebacker for Notre Dame and the Tampa Bay  
Buccaneers, died Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how you go from being a (second-round) pick from  
Notre Dame to getting shot to death for burglary,'' said San Diego 
Chargers guard Aaron Taylor, who played with DuBose at Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't think it would end like this,'' added Chargers kicker  
John Carney, who played at Notre Dame a few years before DuBose, 
but knew him through mutual friends. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tragic. He had a lot going for him,'' Carney said. ``I  
knew people reached out to him, but he was a hard guy to reach. He 
didn't want the help.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DuBose fled when officers tried to question him outside a  
Mission Beach home that had been burglarized, Lt. Glenn 
Breitenstein said. Officers said they tried to stop him by spraying 
him with mace, but he ran. They caught him, scuffled and he got 
away again. 
</P>
<P>
	When they caught him a second time, they struggled with him and  
both officers pulled out nunchakus, a weapon that consists of two 
wooden sticks joined at the ends by a short chain or rope. 
Breitenstein said DuBose managed to disarm both officers of the 
martial arts weapons and charged them. The officers then shot 
DuBose. 
</P>
<P>
	``The officers believed that they were about to be assaulted in  
a dangerous manner with weapons that could kill them, and they 
fired,'' Breitenstein said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said DuBose seemed drunk or drugged. An autopsy was  
conducted Monday. Results of toxicology tests were not expected for 
a few weeks, Breitenstein said. 
</P>
<P>
	The two officers who shot DuBose were removed from field work  
pending an investigation, Lt. Tom Orden said. Their names were not 
released. 
</P>
<P>
	DuBose, whose last address was Mammoth Lakes, Calif., played for  
Notre Dame from 1989 to 1992. He was a second-round draft pick of 
Tampa Bay in 1993 and played four seasons with the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is so uncharacteristic,'' said Jerry Angelo, Tampa Bay's  
director of player personnel. ``If anything went bad in his life, 
it had to have come after football for it to get to the depths it 
did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Angelo said DuBose was let go because he wasn't a good player,  
not because of anything that happened off the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Ex-Tampa Bay coach Sam Wyche said he couldn't believe the news.  
</P>
<P>
	``He talked about (how) if it didn't work out, he'd do the next  
thing and take it on just as hard. He was just a positive guy,'' 
Wyche said. 
</P>
<P>
	DuBose signed with the New York Jets as a free agent in 1997,  
but was cut during training camp four months later. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor heard that DuBose was practically destitute and had lost  
his San Diego-area condominium. 
</P>
<P>
	``There would be like a `Demetrius sighting' -- he'd just  
disappear, then show up one day, for a night, then boom, he'd 
disappear. A buddy said, `God, the guy looked like he was sleeping 
in his car or something,''' Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, DuBose was arrested in South Bend, Ind., after he  
became belligerent at a nightclub. When an off-duty police officer 
working at the club ordered him to leave, DuBose allegedly grabbed 
a pipe from an overhead sprinkler system -- flooding the club with 
some 1,600 gallons of water. 
</P>
<P>
	He was charged with resisting address, disorderly conduct and  
possession of marijuana.

<HEADLINE> Japan Auto Output Falls Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's production of cars, trucks and buses fell  
in June for the third straight month, dropping 2.5 percent from a 
year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first six months of the year, output has fallen 3.3  
percent to 4.93 million units, the Japan Automobile Manufacturers' 
Association said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	For the month of June, production of passenger cars declined 1.2  
percent to 265,172 units, truck output slumped 7.9 percent to 
157,261 and bus production fell 2.5 percent to 4,331. 
</P>
<P>
	However, mini-car production soared 59.1 percent to 112,881,  
reflecting a continuing boom in that sector of the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's automobile output has been falling all year amid poor  
sales and declining exports. 
</P>
<P>
	Production fell in June at all of Japan's top five carmakers.  
</P>
<P>
	Ailing Nissan Motor Co., which this year received a massive  
capital injection from France's Renault, recorded a particularly 
steep fall of 18.3 percent to 112,734 units. 
</P>
<P>
	Production at Japan's largest automaker, Toyota Motor Corp. fell  
3.8 percent to 265,940. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitsubishi Motor Co. production fell 8.5 percent to 86,919,  
while that at Honda Motor Co. dropped 4.3 percent to 106,163. Mazda 
Motor Corp. output fell 5.0 percent to 68,651. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first six months of the year, vehicle demand fell 0.2  
percent to 3.04 million, and exports are estimated to have fallen 5 
percent, the association said.

<HEADLINE> MGM Reports $249.8 Million Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) -- Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. lost $249.8  
million during the second quarter as the company took charges to 
cover the cost of layoffs and other restructuring activities. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss, forecast by the company last month, amounted to $1.65  
per share. That compared to a loss of $55 million, or 84 cents per 
share, during the year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
	Restructuring charges included $85 million in severance and  
other personnel costs and $140 million in film-related writedowns. 
</P>
<P>
	The company reported revenues of $212.2 million in the three  
months ended June 30, down from $281.2 million in the year-ago 
period. 
</P>
<P>
	Film and television revenues also declined during the period, in  
part because MGM released only one theatrical film during the 1999 
quarter, compared to three a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The studio laid off 80 employees last year in a cost-cutting  
program. MGM also has said it would halt development of new 
television shows to focus its limited resources on 10 programs 
already scheduled to air this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	For the six months ending June 30, MGM lost $556 million, or  
$3.69 per share, on revenue of $470.9 million. In the first six 
months of 1998 the studio lost $73.7 million, or $1.12 per share, 
on revenue of 597.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The studio has struggled financially for more than a decade as a  
result of ownership changes and the sale of key assets. 
</P>
<P>
	MGM went public in 1997, a year after billionaire Kirk Kerkorian  
purchased the studio for a third time. In documents filed at the 
time of the public offering, MGM officials said they did not expect 
to turn a profit for several years. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week MGM said it was seeking approval from the Securities  
and Exchange Commission to sell $750 million in stock to pay debts, 
cover restructuring costs and raise working cash. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the money will go toward a $112.5 million payment MGM  
owes Warner Home Video to cover costs from the early termination of 
a video-distribution deal. Tracinda Corp. has agreed to buy any 
shares not purchased by existing stockholders and the public, MGM 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	MGM shares were down 93 3/4 cents to $19.43 3/4 in trading on the New  
York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> 780 Thomas Jefferson Books Sought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Though it owns more books than anyone else --  
over 27 million, with an additional 250 coming in every day -- the 
Library of Congress is searching hard for 780 more volumes. 
</P>
<P>
	Not just any 780 books, of course. It wants to reconstruct a  
complete set of the volumes it obtained from Thomas Jefferson after 
British troops burned Washington in 1814. 
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately, many of the books were lost in another fire on  
Christmas Eve 1851. Now the library wants to assemble a complete 
set of Jefferson's original books for display on the library's 
200th birthday next April. 
</P>
<P>
	It was one of the country's best collections and the price would  
have been higher if the books had been valued by content rather 
than just size. When Jefferson was buying he told his agents he 
wanted small books, so he could carry them on horseback. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, Jefferson got $23,940 for his 6,487 books. The library  
figures that equals $213,000 in today's money. If it can find the 
missing 780 books, the set will be complete. 
</P>
<P>
	Some in Congress complained. One said Jefferson included 10  
cookbooks, nine of them in foreign languages most congressmen 
couldn't read. Another called some of the books ``atheistic, 
irreligious and immoral.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The congressman may have been thinking of one of the books the  
library is now looking for, an English version of Voltaire's 
``History of Charles XII,'' published in London in 1740. The French 
writer Voltaire was much reviled for his attacks on organized 
religion. 
</P>
<P>
	The library is also looking for ``Chippendale's Cabinet Maker's  
Designs,'' published by Thomas Chippendale in 1754. Jefferson 
himself invented a swivel chair. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Jones, owner of the National Football League's Dallas  
Cowboys, has given a million dollars for the search. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the heart of (Washington) Redskins' territory, it is  
particularly appreciated,'' said James H. Billington, the Librarian 
of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Dimunation, head of rare books at the library, thinks the  
million will be enough. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the duplicates may never be found. Dimunation is  
particular about getting a copy from precisely the same printing 
that Jefferson did -- ``even if it's the fourth Dublin edition of 
something originally published in London,'' he said. Few of the 
third president's books came from this side of the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	Dimunation said that because of Jefferson's importance as author  
of the Declaration of Independence and a founder of the U.S. system 
of government, the reproduced collection should represent as 
closely as possible the sources that went into his thinking. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was his laboratory,'' Dimunation explained.  
</P>
<P>
	The collection represents Jefferson's wide-ranging tastes. He  
classified gardening as one of the fine arts. In the fashion of the 
times he leaned heavily on Greek and Roman classics, though he 
could be critical of them. He disliked Plato's ``Republic,'' 
revered by many as a blueprint for an ideal government. 
</P>
<P>
	Jefferson could turn classics to his own purposes. Like many of  
today's politicians, he wanted to learn Spanish. Rosemary Plakas, a 
historian at the library, said Jefferson used the Roman historian 
Tacitus to perfect himself. He got copies in the original Latin, 
Spanish and English translations, separated them into pieces and 
had corresponding pieces from each volume bound together so he 
could jump from one language to the other.

<HEADLINE> China, U.S. Resume Trade Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- China agreed today to new commercial talks with  
the United States but it is still not offering to resume 
negotiations with Washington on joining the World Trade 
Organization, a U.S. envoy said. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement reflected a further easing of China's acrimony  
over the NATO bombing of its embassy in Yugoslavia on May 7. In 
anger over the attack, which killed three Chinese, Beijing 
suspended talks with Washington on human rights, security issues 
and its WTO bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Secretary of Commerce David Aaron met today with Chinese  
Foreign Trade Minister Shi Guangsheng and other Chinese officials 
to work on bringing the two countries back to the table on their 
trade issues. 
</P>
<P>
	In the talks, Shi agreed to co-chair with U.S. Commerce  
Secretary William Daley a meeting of a joint commercial forum later 
this year in Beijing, Aaron said. An exact date was not set. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement ``puts our commercial discussions firmly back on  
track,'' Aaron told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The forum, called the Joint Committee on Commerce and Trade,  
will include working groups to meet on information technology, 
aviation, environmental technology and other areas, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron said he did not discuss China's bid to join the WTO in  
depth. He repeated the U.S. offer to restart the talks any time, 
but the Chinese officials did not disclose any timetable, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Aaron said his meetings were cordial and constructive,  
and that his Chinese hosts stressed the importance of China-U.S. 
economic ties. 
</P>
<P>
	China has set a year-end deadline for joining the WTO, which  
sets rules for world trade. Earlier today, Aaron said the goal was 
``by no means impossible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before the bombing in Belgrade -- NATO said it targeted the  
embassy by mistake -- the two sides had made progress on U.S. 
demands that China open up its markets. 
</P>
<P>
	But there have been delays in implementing earlier agreements,  
Aaron said. He pointed to deals on long sought-after licenses for 
two U.S. insurance firms and on investment in digital phone 
technology called CDMA, or Code Division Multiple Access networks. 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron's visit follows talks over the weekend between Secretary  
of State Madeleine Albright and Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan in 
Singapore. Last week, Assistant Secretary of State Stanley Roth was 
in China to discuss Taiwan and prepare for the Singapore meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	The new agreement on commercial talks came amid signs that  
China's trade surplus with the United States is worsening due to an 
economic slowdown that has cut demand for U.S. imports. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, China posted a $57 billion trade surplus with the  
United States, second only to Japan's $64 billion surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, meanwhile, the House was to take up the annual  
question of extending for another year China's trade status. 
</P>
<P>
	As it has in every year since 1980, Congress is expected to go  
along with the president's decision to grant China the same low 
tariffs enjoyed by virtually all other trading partners. 
</P>
<P>
	But with anti-China feelings running high because of China's  
alleged theft of nuclear secrets and human rights abuses, today's 
House vote was likely to be closer than last year's, when lawmakers 
voted 264-166 for normal trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron was to fly to Korea later today for talks on market access  
in such industries as steel, pharmaceuticals and autos and to 
assess South Korea's economic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	The final leg of Aaron's trip takes him to Tokyo, where he plans  
to push for greater access to Japan's construction market, as well 
as seek progress on flat glass, autos, medical equipment, 
pharmaceuticals and electronic commerce.

<HEADLINE> Fla. Firm Settles Case With Customs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Florida electronics company has agreed to  
pay the government $14 million to settle charges that it had 
violated import laws, the U.S. Customs Service said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Customs said Recoton Corp. of Lake Mary, Fla., has agreed to  
make the payment -- one of the largest negotiated by Customs. The 
company sells consumer electronics accessories, loudspeakers and 
car audio systems under such brand names as RoadGear, Advent, 
Jensen and Discwasher. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the agreement, the company also is settling claims  
that it violated U.S. law by mismarking the country of origin on 
its merchandise and by understating the value of imported 
merchandise, a move that deprived the government of about $4.1 
million in duties, a Customs official said. The official spoke on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The company ``has agreed to enter guilty pleas to a number of  
counts,'' Customs said in a statement. The agreement was reached 
last week and was filed to a federal court in Florida on Tuesday, 
the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also under the agreement, criminal fines that may be assessed by  
a federal court will be deducted from the $14 million payment, 
Customs said. The official said those fines could range anywhere 
from $3 million to $6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were some mistakes made and it was in the best interest  
of the company and shareholders to enter this plea,'' said Recoton 
spokesman Peter Ildau. 
</P>
<P>
	``Importers are required to take `reasonable care' to ensure  
that they comply with U.S. import laws. This case shows that the 
penalties can be steep if they fail to do so,'' said Customs 
Commissioner Raymond Kelly.

<HEADLINE> Emergency Declared for E. Montana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MUSSELSHELL, Mont. (AP) -- Gov. Marc Racicot declared a state of  
emergency Tuesday for 32 counties in eastern Montana because of 
dry, windy conditions feeding a 33,000-acre fire in the central 
part of the state. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor's action authorizes quick use of National Guard  
personnel and equipment if authorities need help against the fire -- 
which began Saturday as 11 separate blazes ignited by lightning -- 
or any others that spring up. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire raged near the prairie town of Musselshell, population  
50, but firefighters took advantage of a break in the windy 
conditions Tuesday and said the town was no longer threatened. They 
expect the fire to be controlled by Thursday or Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hot, but we haven't gotten the wind we predicted,'' fire  
information officer Mary Lunsford said. ``We've been able to button 
up the line and get some other lines closed up. We've made a lot of 
progress. 
</P>
<P>
	About 400 firefighters are on the lines and are being helped by  
three helicopters and three planes.

<HEADLINE> Feds Want Info on Honeywell-Allied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- The U.S. Department of Justice has asked for  
additional information about the proposed merger of Honeywell Inc. 
and Allied signal Inc., but the merger is still expected to be 
completed this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Honeywell said Tuesday the request was expected and said the  
companies will cooperate fully. The companies did not release 
details about what type of information the government requested. 
</P>
<P>
	As previously announced, shareholders of the two companies will  
vote Sept. 1 on the proposed merger. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the proposed deal, AlliedSignal would buy Honeywell for  
about $15 billion in stock, creating a company that makes 
everything from aircraft landing systems to home thermostats. 
</P>
<P>
	The new company would keep Honeywell's name, but use  
AlliedSignal's base in Morris Township, N.J., as its headquarters. 
The companies have said they will cut 4,500 jobs while combining 
their work forces of 120,000 people in more than 95 countries.

<HEADLINE> Justice Defends Agribusiness Mergers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a rebuff to farm-state Democrats, the  
Justice Department's antitrust chief said Tuesday that agribusiness 
mergers did not cause the slump in commodity prices and sometimes 
even help producers. 
</P>
<P>
	``That price decline is not a product of increased  
concentration'' in agribusiness, Assistant Attorney General Joel I. 
Klein told the Senate Agriculture Committee. ``There are other 
factors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is no significant difference in competition in the  
industry now than in 1996, when commodity prices peaked, Klein 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists attribute the recent decline in crop prices to a  
worldwide glut of grain and economic problems in Asia and Europe 
that cut into their food imports. 
</P>
<P>
	But with the agricultural economy stuck in its worst downturn  
since the mid-1980s, many lawmakers have been pointing to declining 
competition among food processors, pesticide makers, seed companies 
and other agribusinesses as the culprit. For example, four 
meatpackers control 80 percent of the nation's beef, up from 36 
percent two decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
	After the hearing, Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., said Klein was  
ignoring a long-term decline in commodity prices relative to what 
consumers pay for food. ``Power in the marketing chain gives you a 
greater share of the retail dollar,'' Conrad said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, the Justice Department came under criticism  
from congressional Democrats for allowing Cargill Inc., North 
America's second-largest grain trader, to acquire the grain 
operations of Continental Grain Co. even though the companies were 
required to sell some of their assets. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure that is going to mean a darn thing back on the  
farm,'' Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, told Klein. 
</P>
<P>
	The Agriculture Department estimates the two companies control  
42 percent of U.S. corn exports, a third of soybeans sold overseas 
and at least 20 percent of wheat exports. 
</P>
<P>
	The forced divestiture would ensure buyers are still available  
to compete for farmers' grain, Klein said. It's in farmers' 
interest for U.S. companies to cut their costs, because they have 
to compete overseas, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we don't compete efficiently in Asia, if we don't compete  
efficiently in Europe to sell products, that's going to hurt the 
family farm,'' Klein said. 
</P>
<P>
	Klein also told the panel antitrust laws generally are adequate  
to protect farm interests, although he thinks Congress should give 
Justice responsibility for approving railroad mergers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Surface Transportation Board, which has authority over  
acquisitions in the railroad industry, approved a $5.4 billion 
merger three years ago between the Union Pacific and Southern 
Pacific over the opposition of the Justice, Transportation and 
Agriculture departments.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Higher; Dow Up 115.88 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks led the market to its  
strongest performance of the month as investors hunted for bargains 
Tuesday among shares that have been beaten down in recent sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average gained 115.88 points, or by 1.1  
percent, to close at 10,979.04. The blue-chip index rose as much as 
168 points during the session, rebounding strongly from Monday's 
shiftless 47.80-point loss. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's  
500 rose 15.08 to 1,362.84, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 
60.14 to 2,679.33. 
</P>
<P>
	A wide range of computer-related stocks soared Tuesday, helping  
the Dow and the technology-dominated Nasdaq alike. Computer makers 
rose, including IBM, up 3 1/4 to 126 1/4, and Hewlett Packard, up 3 9/16 
at 109 1/4. Chip maker Intel gained 4 11/16 to 67 9/16 after a Wall 
Street analyst raised his 1999 earnings forecast. 
</P>
<P>
	After last week, when the Nasdaq dropped 172.08 points, a loss  
of 6.1 percent, analysts said investors were ready to scoop up 
technology stocks at their discounted prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``We saw a pretty big downdraft over the past few days, so  
there's definitely some bottom-fishing going on,'' said Hank 
Herrmann, chief investment officer at Waddell &AMP; Reed of Overland 
Park, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors had several diverse reasons for swinging away from  
technology stocks last week. The shares had been bid to record 
highs at the start of July on the promise of strong corporate 
earnings. As a majority of high-tech companies met or beat 
expectations, many investors sold off their shares, hoping to lock 
in profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks were also threatened after Federal Reserve  
Chairman Alan Greenspan indicated that the Fed remains willing to 
raise interest rates if it determines that doing so would hold off 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's gains spread beyond the high-tech sector, with banks  
and brokerages also rallying. American Express rose 5 7/8 to 142 3/8 
following its strong earnings report, released Monday. Analysts 
said growth prospects for the credit-card provider are robust, 
especially as the company develops an online bank and a Web-based 
service for corporate and travel-related products. 
</P>
<P>
	A modest rise in bond prices helped stocks Tuesday. By late  
afternoon, the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond was at 6.01 
percent, compared with 6.03 percent late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks and bonds received some support from a Conference Board  
report Tuesday that showed consumer confidence declined in July, 
after eight months of consecutive gains and a rise to a 30-year 
high. Analysts said the report suggested that the nation's 
continued economic growth may not be reaching inflationary levels. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, market watchers are more interested in upcoming reports  
on the employment costs index and the gross domestic product, both 
scheduled for release Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Greenspan will address a Senate panel on Wednesday. While  
most do not expect him to break new ground, analysts will listen 
carefully for any clues about the central bank's sentiment on the 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Until then, many remain unconvinced of the market's strength.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is still a market laboring under the lack of real  
momentum in either direction,'' said Gregory Nie, technical analyst 
at Everen Securities in Chicago. He said modest volume indicated 
that many traders are staying out of the market for now. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 6-to-5 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange. Composite volume totaled 867.36 million 
shares, compared with a paltry 751.75 million in the previous 
session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index rose 4.79 to 640.69, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index gained 1.83 to 792.62. The Russell 
2000 index of smaller companies rose 3.61 to 446.48. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell for the fifth  
straight session, slipping 0.16 percent. European indexes were 
mostly higher, as Germany's DAX index rose 0.3 percent, Britain's 
FT-SE 100 rose 1.5 percent, and France's CAC-40 closed 0.7 percent 
higher.

<HEADLINE>  Israeli Navy Gets German-Built Subs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ABOARD THE HANIT MISSILE BOAT (AP) -- Bursting nose first from  
the water like its namesake, Israel's new Dolphin submarine 
surfaced for the first time in its home waters today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphin is the first of three German-built diesel-powered  
submarines to be delivered to Israel. The squat, cigar-shaped 
vessel is aimed at helping transform Israel's aging underwater 
fleet into a modern attack-and-deter force. 
</P>
<P>
	With a crew of 35, the Dolphin has enough range to sneak  
undetected into ports as far away as the Persian Gulf, send frogmen 
to plant mines and destroy ships. 
</P>
<P>
	The three submarines carry sub-Harpoon sea-to-sea missiles.  
Foreign experts say they can be replaced by small cruise missiles 
carrying nuclear warheads. 
</P>
<P>
	Analyst Yiftah Shapir of the Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies  
at Tel Aviv University said he believes Israel will be able to 
fashion a nuclear warhead small enough to fit the Dolphin. 
</P>
<P>
	If Israel were attacked with nuclear weapons, missiles aboard  
the Dolphin would be unharmed and ready for retaliation, according 
to foreign weapons experts. With Iran and Iraq trying to acquire 
nuclear weapons, Israel saw the need for a second-strike 
capability, the experts said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Israeli military and the government don't talk about the  
subject. 
</P>
<P>
	The mood was festive today as the Israeli navy and Israeli Prime  
Minister and Defense Minister Ehud Barak greeted the Dolphin about 
12 miles off the northern port of Haifa. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dolphin is only the first of three submarines ... that will  
change the entire face of the navy and the long-arm capabilities of 
Israel,'' Barak said at the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	Under clear skies and on calm seas, six gray Israeli missile  
boats circled the new submarine, sending greetings by loudspeaker 
to its crew as four F-16 warplanes flew overhead in formation. 
</P>
<P>
	Reflecting friendly interservice rivalry, an officer on the  
Hanit missile boat remarked that it was one of the few times the 
air force has saluted the navy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great feeling, and emotional, too,'' said Capt. Yuval,  
the commander of the submarine flotilla that sailed with the 
Dolphin from Germany to Haifa Bay. He was plucked from the two-tone 
green vessel to talk to reporters aboard the Hanit. 
</P>
<P>
	Yuval, whose last name cannot be used under Israeli military  
regulations, said the Dolphin gives Israel ``a lot of confidence 
and ability under the water'' that it did not have before. 
</P>
<P>
	Israel contracted with Germany to have two Dolphin-class  
submarines built to Israeli specifications in 1989. In 1990, it 
canceled the project because of its high cost -- $300 million per 
submarine. 
</P>
<P>
	Israel decided to renew the project after the 1991 Persian Gulf  
War, when Iraq fired 39 Scud missiles at the Jewish state. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany offered to pay for two submarines. The Israeli military  
said today that one factor in the German decision was the role of 
German companies in developing Iraq's chemical warheads. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a result, the German government offered humanitarian and  
military support,'' the military said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, a third submarine was added, with Israel and Germany  
splitting the cost. The second submarine is to be delivered in 
October and the third in 2000.

<HEADLINE> Senate OKs Bill To Clean Up Boxing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate approved legislation Tuesday aimed  
at protecting professional boxers from unscrupulous managers and 
promoters and cleaning up the tarnished image of the sport. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, long sought by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., was approved  
without opposition. A companion bill is working its way through the 
House. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure would require promoters and organizers of major  
boxing events to disclose more financial information and inform 
state boxing commissions of charges, costs and fees they take out 
of boxers' purses. 
</P>
<P>
	It states that no boxing contract can extend longer than a year,  
making it more difficult to tie fighters to long-term contracts. 
Fighters also would not be required to hire a manager associated 
with a promoter. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation, named after former heavyweight champion  
Muhammad Ali, would standardize physical exams that boxers must 
undergo before each match and make a brain CAT scan every two years 
a requirement for obtaining a license. 
</P>
<P>
	Fight broadcasters would not be not allowed to have a direct or  
indirect financial interest in the boxer's manager or management 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	``When honest and open competition is inhibited, it is the  
boxers who suffer most,'' McCain said at a hearing of his Senate 
Commerce Committee last April attended by Ali. ``But millions of 
ticket-buying fans in America are also hurt by monopolistic 
practices in boxing.''

<HEADLINE> Bears, McNown Still Far Apart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PLATTEVILLE, Wis. (AP) -- Cade's in California, his agent isn't  
budging and the Chicago Bears are still sweating through two-a-days 
without a No. 1 quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	So what do the Bears do now? That's the unavoidable $10 million  
question. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just trying to decide what our next move should be since  
they made no move off their original offer,'' Jim Miller, the 
Bears' director of business operations, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Bears made a revised contract offer to Cade McNown and  
agent Tom Condon over the weekend, they figured there'd still be 
some sort of haggling. When Condon faxed his response Monday, 
however, he simply put into writing the same deal he'd been asking 
for all along: a seven-year contract that voids after three years, 
with the Bears able to buy back the fourth through sixth years with 
another signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	No way, the Bears said.  
</P>
<P>
	``Our contention is, we're paying a signing bonus based on a  
five- or six- or seven-year contract, and we're not getting full 
service on it,'' Miller said. ``You've made that initial financial 
commitment. Is it fair to the club to have to make a decision to 
pay an even bigger signing bonus just to keep a player after three 
years?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Condon has not returned repeated phone calls from The Associated  
Press. 
</P>
<P>
	McNown, the 12th pick overall, has been quiet during  
negotiations, but receiver Curtis Conway said he's talked to McNown 
and he's anxious to get this settled. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't say (he's) angry, but he wants to get the deal  
done,'' Conway said. ``Cade wants to be here more than anybody else 
wants him to be here. ... He's very pumped about playing football. 
He's very confident. He wants to be here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations with McNown have been stuck on voidable years from  
the start. The Bears have never done a deal like that, and didn't 
want to start. But Condon is one of the architects of voidable year 
deals, and it's standard for most of his big-name players now, 
particularly quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	So after a few days of both sides holding firm, the Bears backed  
down. Miller made Condon an offer Saturday for a six-year deal that 
could void to five years. With a $5 million signing bonus, the 
total package was worth just under $10.2 million -- more than the 
No. 6 pick, Torry Holt, got from St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	The performance incentives seemed reasonable, too. McNown had to  
be the quarterback for 55 percent of the total plays over his first 
three years for the voidable year to kick in. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's still not enough,'' Miller said. ``Ted and I are a bit  
perplexed and we're not real sure where to go. You wind up bidding 
against yourself. It's a situation of, `You don't like this, well 
how about this.' We're just very disappointed they have not moved 
one bit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One possible problem with the Bears' offer is the salary. McNown  
would make about $2 million, but that is well below the average 
salary for a starting quarterback. And with Erik Kramer no longer 
around, McNown will probably be starting much earlier than most 
rookie quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Comparing McNown's salary to the average salary is  
``ludicrous,'' Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why is a rookie quarterback, the 12th pick in the draft, the  
fifth quarterback picked, why is he lumped with an average 
quarterback?'' Miller asked. ``He's not an average quarterback. He 
hasn't even taken a snap yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After he got Condon's response, Miller went back to the Bears'  
headquarters in Lake Forest so he could meet with Phillips and 
decide what to do next. One option is to wait until the three 
quarterbacks picked ahead of McNown sign and use their contracts as 
a measurement. 
</P>
<P>
	But more waiting doesn't help the players. The Bears are  
installing a new, complex offense, and they're doing it without the 
quarterback who's going to be running it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It does affect the team, but you have to go on,'' defensive  
tackle Mike Wells said. ``It's nothing we can control. The coaches 
don't have control and I'm not so sure Cade has control. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be nice to have him here, but he's not.''

<HEADLINE> Phillies' Schilling To Miss Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Philadelphia Phillies ace Curt Schilling  
will miss his scheduled start Wednesday with mild biceps 
tendinitis. 
</P>
<P>
	Schilling, who started for the National League in the All-Star  
game, has felt stiffness in his right biceps while warming up 
before his last two starts. He is scheduled to skip just one start 
and pitch again next Tuesday in Florida against the Marlins. 
</P>
<P>
	``He can pitch, but he still has some mild discomfort,''  
Phillies doctor Michael Ciccotti said Tuesday. ``We all agree that 
in the long term, it would be best if he misses a start to 
hopefully get over this completely and pitch pain-free.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schilling (14-4) is tied with Arizona's Randy Johnson for the NL  
lead with eight complete games and is among the league leaders in 
wins, innings and ERA. The right-hander, who has 141 strikeouts 
this season, is seeking his third consecutive season with at least 
300. 
</P>
<P>
	But Schilling allowed five earned runs and nine hits in five  
innings in his last start against Atlanta on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very mild tenderness,'' Ciccotti said. ``Everything else  
is normal. If it takes him missing a start to be pain-free the rest 
of the season, it's worth it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rookie right-hander Steve Schrenk will start Wednesday against  
the Marlins instead of Schilling.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Returns to the Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Bill Bradley knows it can be tough to prompt  
people to dip into their wallets by reminding them of his days as a 
Rhodes scholar or his 18 years in the U.S. Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	So it wasn't egghead buddies or political colleagues he brought  
together Tuesday night to raise money for his Democratic 
presidential campaign. It was his friends from his first career as 
a New York Knick. 
</P>
<P>
	``Your friends help you,'' he said, motioning to a lineup that  
included former NBA players Phil Jackson, Willis Reed and Dave 
DeBusschere. ``It happens that my friends are tall.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The former players, several Hall of Famers among them, assembled  
for a fund-raiser called Hoopla at the Chicago Historical Society. 
Some 500 people that campaign organizers said would raise at least 
$350,000 came to meet the former players, get autographs, and shoot 
baskets at hoops set up in the Historical Society's courtyard. 
</P>
<P>
	The former players said they were pleased to show their support  
for Bradley, who spent 10 seasons with the Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know he's a decent man, a very intelligent person,'' said  
Walt Frazier, a former teammate. ``He doesn't see color. I know 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Frazier and others said they have long known about Bradley's  
political aspirations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We used to kid him about being Mr. President,'' Frazier said.  
</P>
<P>
	John Havlicek, an opponent for several years with the Boston  
Celtics, said of Bradley, ``We all believe in Bill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley said if the event is a success, he'll take it on the  
road. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, the former Chicago Bulls coach, said he hoped the event  
will ``bring some spirit to the campaign.'' Jackson, now the coach 
of the Los Angeles Lakers, had previously campaigned with Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, noting the unusual nature of the fundraiser, said he  
isn't taking money from political action committees. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to be more creative,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Bradley said one message of his campaign is that he's had a life  
outside politics. He said there were times in his life that he 
didn't give the federal government any thought at all, possibly a 
dig at Vice President Al Gore, his opponent for the Democratic 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been in the federal government all his life,'' Bradley  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He did briefly discuss other campaign issues, saying for example  
that he is pushing for stricter gun control than the vice 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	But mostly it was basketball, as the players proved they could  
still shoot. At one point Havlicek made seven consecutive shots 
from the top of the key. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the talk was about basketball. Speaking of his chances  
against Gore, Bradley looked at Jackson, who coached the Bulls to 
six championships in eight years: ``I'd like to think I'm his new 
Michael Jordan.''

<HEADLINE> Cox To Buy Gannett Cable TV Assets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Cox Communications Inc. will purchase Gannett Co.  
Inc.'s cable television operations in Kansas, Oklahoma and North 
Carolina for $2.7 billion, the fourth cable acquisition the company 
has announced this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the completion of all pending deals, Atlanta-based Cox  
will rank as the nation's fifth-biggest cable company, with 6 
million subscribers in 18 states. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, Cox announced plans to buy TCA Cable in a $4  
billion deal and Media General cable systems in a $1.4 billion 
deal. Earlier this month, it announced plans to swap its AT&AMP;T Corp. 
stock valued at $2.8 billion for AT&AMP;T-owned cable television 
systems in seven Southern and Western states. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our recent acquisitions provide us the size and scale that  
will enable us to remain a significant player in the broadband 
communications industry,'' said Jim Robbins, Cox president and 
chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Cox, AT&AMP;T and others have been actively buying or partnering  
with other cable properties to use their wires for telephone and 
Internet services. About 75 percent of the Gannett systems have 
been upgraded to handle interactive television, high-speed access 
and telephone service. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gannett's cable properties are a natural fit with our growth  
strategy of adding large, technologically advanced properties in 
stand-alone markets and in markets contiguous to our existing 
operations,'' Robbins said. 
</P>
<P>
	The $2.7 billion price tag for the 522,000 Gannett subscribers  
is equivalent to $5,100 per subscriber, a new high in the cable 
industry. The Gannett deal has been structured as a purchase of 
assets that will generate about $350 million in tax benefits to 
Cox, however. 
</P>
<P>
	A few years ago, cable customers fetched about $1,500 each. In  
June 1998, AT&AMP;T spent $3,500 per subscriber for the customers of 
Tele-Communications Inc., a record at the time until earlier this 
year, when AT&AMP;T agreed to spend $4,700 for each subscriber of the 
MediaOne Group. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cox deal removes the Arlington, Va.-based Gannett, a  
publishing giant that has not been aggressively seeking cable 
growth, from the industry, said Thomas Eagan, a cable industry 
analyst for PaineWebber Group. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're taking out someone who isn't a player. We expect there  
to be one more,'' he said, speculating that Cox and St. Louis-based 
Charter Communications may soon battle for the cable holdings of 
The Washington Post Co. 
</P>
<P>
	David Goldsmith, an analyst for Buckingham Research Group, said  
the deal is a good fit with Cox's plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're buying it intelligently,'' he said. ``There'll be more  
acquisitions for sure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of the agreement, Cox will get about 303,000  
customers in Kansas, including Wichita, Topeka and Manhattan; 
122,000 customers in Oklahoma City; and 97,000 customers in North 
Carolina, including Greenville and Rocky Mount. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cox-Gannett agreement was approved Tuesday by the board of  
directors of Gannett and is expected to be completed by early next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading, shares of Cox were down 81 1/4 cents to $30.12 1/2 while  
shares of Gannett were up $1.87 1/2 to $76.37 1/2, both on the New York 
Stock Exchange.

	JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) -- A cruise ship carrying as many as 120

	Pollution 'Hot Spots' ID'd in Serbia

<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- U.N. experts examining the  
environmental consequences of NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia urged 
today that action be taken immediately to clean up pollution ``hot 
spots'' in Serbia. The ``hot spots'' were found mostly in the 
heavily targeted Serb towns of Pancevo and Kragujevac, where 
mercury, asbestos and other hazardous substances were found spilled 
into the environment. But many of the environmental problems 
predated the NATO bombing, although airstrikes may have worsened 
some of them, U.N. officials said. The United States and its allies 
have refused to give any reconstruction aid to Yugoslavia while 
President Slobodan Milosevic is in power.

confined since 1982. A Justice Department gave no reason for not 
opposing the move. Hinckley has been confined to St. Elizabeths 
Hospital since 1982, when he was acquitted by reason of insanity in 
the 1981 shooting attack on President Reagan outside a Washington

<HEADLINE> Hormone May Be Key to Preeclampsia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- An imbalance in hormones that regulate the size  
of blood vessels may be the key to understanding a potentially 
dangerous problem that afflicts about one in every 12 expectant 
U.S. mothers, researchers reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem is preeclampsia, a condition of late pregnancy in  
which the woman's blood pressure rises and her tissues retain 
abnormal amounts of fluid. Left untreated, it can lead to 
eclampsia, which can kill mother or child. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers compared 134 women who developed preeclampsia with  
139 similar pregnant women who did not. 
</P>
<P>
	Levels of a hormone that makes blood vessels expand tended to  
drop in the preeclampsia women weeks before the effects were 
detected, according to the findings published in today's Journal of 
the American Medical Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The drop caused an imbalance in the ratio of PGI-M to another  
hormone, called TX-M, which makes blood vessels constrict and 
causes blood pressure to rise, said researchers led by Dr. James 
Mills of the National Institute of Child Health and Human 
Development. 
</P>
<P>
	Past research indicated aspirin might help prevent preeclampsia,  
but when tried on a large group of women it failed to show much 
benefit. 
</P>
<P>
	Future efforts to try to prevent preeclampsia should instead  
target regulating PGI-M to put the hormones back in balance, the 
researchers said.

<HEADLINE> Arizona's Dellucci Has Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Arizona Diamondbacks outfielder David Dellucci  
underwent surgery Tuesday to repair a damaged bone in his left 
wrist, a condition that threatens his career. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything went extremely well,'' said Dr. Don Sheridan, who  
performed the 2 1/2-hour operation. ``The technical aspects of the 
operation couldn't have gone better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sheridan removed 3 to 4 millimeters of the radius bone in  
Dellucci's left forearm. He also leveled the wrist joint to even 
out the pressure all along his wrist. 
</P>
<P>
	Dellucci had a condition known as Kienbock's disease. Because  
the radius bone was longer than the ulna bone in his forearm, there 
was undue pressure on one of the small dice-sized bones in his 
wrist called the lunate. 
</P>
<P>
	With each blow to the wrist, Dellucci was losing more  
circulation in his hand. Without the surgery, the bone in his hand 
would have disintegrated and his career certainly would be over, 
Sheridan said. With the surgery, Sheridan has predicted about a 70 
percent chance that Dellucci will be able to play professional 
baseball again. 
</P>
<P>
	In about two weeks, the wrist will be put in a cast that will  
remain in place for about two months. Dellucci hopes to be ready to 
participate in spring training. 
</P>
<P>
	Dellucci's parents, grandmother and some close friends were at  
the hospital when the surgery was performed.

<HEADLINE> Champion Mares To Try Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Jays Stable and Extreme Velocity will try for a  
second win in the Breeders Crown Mare Pace Saturday night at the 
Meadowlands. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining them in the nine-horse field at the track in East  
Rutherford, N.J., will be Galleria, winner of the 1998 Breeders 
Crown 3-year-old Filly Pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Jays Stable won the Mare Pace last year, and Extreme Velocity,  
who was not in the 1998 race, won it in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mare Pace was one of three BC races for older pacers and  
mares for which post positions were drawn Tuesday. The others are 
the Colt &AMP; Gelding Pace and the Trot for both males and mares. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on Saturday's program will be two nine-horse elimination  
heats for the Hambletonian for 3-year-old trotters. The first five 
finishers in each heat will return for the final Aug. 7 at the 
Meadowlands. 
</P>
<P>
	Extreme Velocity, driven by John Campbell, the winningest driver  
in the 15-year history of the Breeders Crown, won a BC prep July 24 
on the Meadowlands' one-mile oval for her fourth win in eight 
starts this year. Jays Table has three wins in 15 starts, while 
Galleria will be looking for her first victory in her eighth 1999 
start. 
</P>
<P>
	One of 10 starters in the Colt &AMP; Gelding Pace will be Red Bow  
Tie, winner of the race last year. The colt has won half of his 12 
starts this year, including the William Haughton June 25 at the 
Meadowlands. 
</P>
<P>
	Since there were 14 horses entered in the Trot, three of them  
mares, there will be an elimination heat, with the first 10 
finishers returning for the final. In the elimination heat, the 
trotters who drew from Nos. 11 through 14 will start in the second 
row. 
</P>
<P>
	Three Trot contenders are Glorys Comet (post position 5), Super  
High Test (9), and Goodtimes (10). 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell, who has won 33 BC finals, also will drive Open  
Nobility in the Mare Pace and Mister Goal in the Trot. 
</P>
<P>
	CR Commando, winner of two of five starts this year, and  
Starchip Enterprise, winner of two of four, are two contenders in 
the first Hambletonian heat that will go off at 5:15 p.m. CR 
Commando's stablemate, CR Renegade, and Self Possessed are two 
contenders in the 6:05 p.m. second heat. 
</P>
<P>
	The $380,000 Colt &AMP; Gelding Pace and $580,000 Trot final will be  
shown live on an ESPN2 from 8 p.m. to 9 p.m. EDT. The $282,000 Mare 
Pace will be tape. 
</P>
<P>
	The eight Breeders Crown races for 2 and 3-year-old pacers and  
trotters of both sexes will be held later.

<HEADLINE> Forbes Wants Abortions Made Illegal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- The landmark Supreme Court decision that  
affirmed a woman's right to abortion ``is going to go'' as public 
opinion shifts, Republican presidential candidate Steve Forbes said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has not withstood the test of time well,'' said Forbes.  
</P>
<P>
	He said the appointment of judges should be tied to their  
opposition to abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes was criticized during the 1996 election campaign by  
conservatives leery about his position on issues like abortion. He 
has gone out of his way to avoid that attack this time around. 
</P>
<P>
	He has charted a sharply conservative course, including pushing  
for the reversal of the 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision which legalized 
abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Roe vs. Wade was a terribly argued decision,'' Forbes  
said. ``That is going to go one way or the other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes said he would pick judges according to their views on  
``adhering to the Constitution, including the belief in the 
sanctity of life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abortion has become an important issue in the fight for the  
Republican presidential nomination. All of the GOP candidates say 
they oppose abortion, but there are differences in emphasis. 
</P>
<P>
	Conservative GOP contenders said abortion should be a litmus  
test for the appointment of judges and said they would favor a 
constitutional amendment banning the procedure. More moderate 
Republican candidates put less emphasis on the issue, arguing that 
public opinion won't back strict restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes said public opinion is shifting, and candidates ought to  
help that shift along. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is growing support for restrictions,'' said Forbes, who  
conceded ``many Americans don't agree with the ultimate goal yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though abortion rights have been a part of the law for 25 years,  
Forbes said those rights haven't become accepted. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you have made a wrong constitutional decision you shouldn't  
let it stand,'' Forbes said. ``Just because bad law has been around 
for a while, you shouldn't leave it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes' abortion stance has made him a favorite of many  
conservatives this presidential campaign. Some say it's time to 
begin uniting behind Forbes because he has the resources to compete 
effectively against well-financed candidates like Texas Gov. George 
W. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, Forbes said he opposed abortion, but conservatives were  
suspicious of his commitment. They pointed to his support of 
Christie Todd Whitman, the pro-choice governor of New Jersey.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Pays Tribute to JFK Jr. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- An Indian guru played the flute. A choral  
group sang a song he wrote that began ``John, John, John Kennedy.'' 
And tributes were read from around the world -- from Nelson Mandela, 
Elie Weisel and Carl Lewis, to name a few. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no famous faces in the audience, just ordinary people  
who came to the United Nations Tuesday to honor an American 
president's son who made his own mark during his 38 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The celebration was organized by guru Sri Chinmoy, who runs The  
Peace Meditation group at the United Nations, and the U.N. staff's 
Society of Writers. It included tributes from around the globe for 
John F. Kennedy Jr., who died with his wife and her sister when 
their plane crashed into the Atlantic Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
	After Chinmoy spoke of every person being ``a traveler on  
eternity's road'' and played a mournful flute solo, members of the 
meditation group read more than 20 tributes -- including one from 
Mandela, who was described as a hero of Kennedy's. 
</P>
<P>
	``John F. Kennedy Jr. should be celebrated in death even as he  
was celebrated in life,'' the recently retired South African leader 
said in a message from Johannesburg. 
</P>
<P>
	When Kennedy was a sophomore at Brown University, Andrew Young,  
former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, recalled that the 
young Kennedy visited South Africa and led an effort at the college 
to end apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was invited to be the keynote speaker and saw that, for his  
own speech, he wore his father's sport coat. Here was this tall, 
skinny 19-year-old preparing himself to fill his father's shoes,'' 
said Young, a former Atlanta mayor. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said he shared ``the  
widespread admiration for John's compassion, humanity and the 
fortitude which he showed from an early age.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others spoke of Kennedy's international impact.  
</P>
<P>
	``I hope that his life of concern for his fellow human beings  
will be an enduring inspiration not only to Americans but to people 
the world over,'' said Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien. 
</P>
<P>
	Many tributes focused on Kennedy's charitable works.  
</P>
<P>
	``We all wish we could be like John -- to be in the spotlight and  
yet to lead a life that everyone is extremely proud of,'' wrote 
Olympic runner Carl Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	Weisel, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, asked: ``Were the gods  
jealous of him? Jealous of his youthful grace and exuberance? 
Jealous of his love of life? Or jealous perhaps of a nation's 
admiration of his desire to give hope rather than evoke remorse?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cardinal Jaime Sin, archbishop of Manila, had an answer: ``Maybe  
God wanted him to come to him earlier. Maybe God needed him in 
heaven.''

<HEADLINE> Hubbell's Guilty Plea Is Conditional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Presidential friend Webster Hubbell is getting  
a shot at erasing his guilty plea to a misdemeanor tax charge, 
thanks to an unusual wrinkle in his plea agreement with prosecutor 
Kenneth Starr. 
</P>
<P>
	In the agreement, Hubbell's guilty plea to that charge will  
remain in place only if Starr can convince the Supreme Court to 
overturn an appeals court ruling that would make the case difficult 
to prove. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, Starr asked the high court to hear his appeal and  
give him a chance to preserve Hubbell's guilty plea. If the court 
denies review or rules against Starr, he has agreed to seek 
dismissal of Hubbell's June 30 plea to the tax charge. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Hubbell's guilty plea to a felony charge of concealing  
legal work on a fraudulent Arkansas land project would not be 
affected. Hubbell, the former No. 3 Justice Department official, 
was sentenced in June to a year of probation after entering the 
guilty pleas that wrapped up the Whitewater phase of Starr's work. 
</P>
<P>
	The tax charge alleged that Hubbell evaded paying taxes on some  
of the hundreds of thousands of dollars he received from friends of 
President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton in 1994 when he was 
under criminal investigation by Starr's office. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal appeals court ruled in January that Starr could  
prosecute Hubbell on the tax charge but set a high legal standard 
for use by prosecutors of Hubbell's own financial papers, which he 
was required to produce under a limited grant of immunity from 
prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbell had argued that using the papers to prosecute him would  
violate his privilege against self-incrimination, granted by the 
Constitution's Fifth Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court decision ``essentially requires advance  
knowledge of the contents of a document as a prerequisite of a 
right to use the document's contents,'' Starr's appeal to the 
Supreme Court said. ``That is a daunting standard that no 
prosecutor is ever likely to meet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The June 30 plea agreement specified that Starr would take that  
issue to the nation's highest court. If the court denies review or 
fails to ruled in the independent counsel's favor, Starr agreed to 
seek dismissal of Hubbell's guilty plea on the tax charge. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia  
said that if Starr could not show that he had ``reasonably 
particular knowledge'' of Hubbell's financial records before they 
were subpoenaed, the prosecutor could not use information from 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's appeal contends that because Hubbell created the  
documents before they were subpoenaed, the contents of the 
documents could be used, so long as prosecutors did not seek to 
show that he was required to turn them over. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department had supported Starr's appeal to the D.C.  
Circuit court, saying the ruling was ``likely to impose significant 
burdens'' on the prosecution of certain tax cases involving large 
amounts of documents. 
</P>
<P>
	An attorney for Hubbell declined immediate comment on Starr's  
appeal.

<HEADLINE> Rangers 8, Orioles 6  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Emergency starter Luis Alicea homered and drove  
in three runs Tuesday night as the Texas Rangers stretched their 
winning streak to nine by beating Mike Mussina and the Baltimore 
Orioles 8-6. 
</P>
<P>
	Todd Zeile had four hits for the Rangers, who improved to 11-1  
since the All-Star break. Texas' nine-game streak matches its 
longest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Brady Anderson homered twice, driving in four runs, and Albert  
Belle hit his fourth homer in two games for the Orioles, whose 
six-game winning streak ended. 
</P>
<P>
	Mussina (13-5), who had won his previous four starts, was tagged  
for 11 hits and seven runs in 4 2-3 innings. It was his 
second-shortest stint of the season and only his second loss since 
June 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Cal Ripken, vying for his 400th career home run, went 0-for-3  
with a walk. 
</P>
<P>
	Alicea was inserted into the starting lineup at second base  
shortly before game time after right fielder Juan Gonzalez was 
scratched because of a strained right wrist he suffered Friday. 
Mark McLemore moved to right and Alicea got a rare start. 
</P>
<P>
	Alicea responded with his first homer in 104 at-bats this  
season, a two-run drive in the second inning that put Texas ahead 
for good. He added a sacrifice fly in the third. 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron Sele (10-6) allowed five runs and eight hits in six-plus  
innings. The right-hander has won seven of nine decisions since 
giving up nine runs in a loss to Baltimore on May 16. 
</P>
<P>
	John Wetteland worked the ninth for his major league-leading  
30th save. 
</P>
<P>
	Belle's 25th homer staked Baltimore to a 2-0 lead in the first  
inning, but the Rangers answered with a four-run second. After 
Alicea's homer, Mussina yielded two singles before Rusty Greer hit 
a two-out, two-run double on a liner to right that eluded the glove 
of the leaping Belle. 
</P>
<P>
	Alicea's sacrifice fly drove in an unearned run in the third. A  
two-run triple by Royce Clayton made it 7-2 in the fifth and ended 
Mussina's night. 
</P>
<P>
	Baltimore got a run in its half on an RBI double by Anderson,  
but Sele avoided further damage by striking out Harold Baines with 
the bases loaded. Anderson chased Sele with a two-run homer in the 
seventh. 
</P>
<P>
	Ziele singled in a run in the ninth, his seventh straight game  
with at least one RBI. Anderson led off the Orioles' half with his 
second homer. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Texas has at least one double in all 12 games since the  
break and has 10 in its last four games. ... Attorney general Janet 
Reno sat among fans in the back of the lower deck. ... Rafael 
Palmeiro went 1-for-3 against Mussina and is 4-for-27 (.148) 
lifetime against his former teammate. ... Anderson's first homer 
was his 13th and the first since June 20.

<HEADLINE> Upper Midwest Gets Break From Heat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Parts of the Midwest got a break Tuesday from the heat wave  
blamed for at least 33 deaths, giving utilities a breather from the 
strain of keeping air conditioners running full tilt. 
</P>
<P>
	Afternoon temperatures were only in the 80s across the northern  
Plains and much of the Ohio Valley. But there was little relief on 
the East Coast, where temperatures rose into the 90s again. It was 
92 in New York City on Tuesday -- the fifth straight day over 90. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been at least 33 heat-related deaths in the past  
week: 12 in Missouri, 11 in Illinois, eight in Ohio and two in 
North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the deaths have been in urban areas.  
</P>
<P>
	``When you're in a country home, you can just open a window,''  
said Diane Rackers, spokeswoman for the Missouri Department of 
Health. ``But when you're in downtown St. Louis, there's not much 
cool air to stir.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas City, Mo., registered an afternoon temperature of 98.  
Scattered rain and a cool front made the situation somewhat better 
in St. Louis, which reached 90, a far cry from the high of 102 on 
Monday. But it was still the 13th consecutive day in the 90s. 
</P>
<P>
	Highs in the Chicago area were only in the 80s on Tuesday, a  
break from a run of steamy weather that started July 18. The 
temperature was expected to reach the low 90s again later in the 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	American Electric Power, which has 3 million customers in seven  
Midwestern states, had been asking customers to conserve 
electricity, but dropped its heat alert Monday after cooler air 
arrived. That could change if rising temperatures later in the week 
pump up demand again, said spokesman Pat Hemlepp. 
</P>
<P>
	Farther east, New York state registered its 12th day in the 90s  
this year. That's typically the number of 90-plus readings for the 
entire summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of a so-called ``Bermuda high'' sitting over the East,  
with its clockwise rotation pumping hot, humid air northward, this 
could be one of the hottest Julys on record for New York City, said 
Bob Stalker at the National Weather Service. The average for the 
month is 77 degrees, but the city's average this July is close to 
81. 
</P>
<P>
	While the heat has combined with drought conditions in some  
areas to wither crops, it's had the opposite effect for some 
Eastern Seaboard farmers whose vegetables are ripening earlier than 
usual. 
</P>
<P>
	Mountains of produce are being sent to market from Georgia,  
North Carolina and as far away as Canada, said Rod Parker, manager 
of the Northern Neck Farmers Market at Oak Grove, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, Parker said, ``there's simply too much produce on the  
market right now'' for farmers to make a profit.

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 115.24; Nasdaq Up 44.83 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks posted solid gains today as the  
technology shares that have been beaten down in recent sessions 
rallied anew. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up  
115.24 at 10,978.40. On Monday, the blue-chip index fell 47.80 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's  
500 index was up 14.77 at 1,362.53, and the Nasdaq composite index 
was up 44.83 at 2,664.02. 
</P>
<P>
	A market slump that began last week has hit the Nasdaq, which is  
dominated by technology shares, most sharply. The index dropped 
172.08 points last week, a loss of 6.1 percent, and shed an 
additional 73.21 points Monday. By today, technology shares were 
beginning to look like bargains to some traders. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors moved away from technology stocks for diverse reasons.  
The shares were bid to record highs at the start of July on the 
promise of strong corporate earnings. As a majority of high-tech 
companies met or beat expectations, investors tended to sell off 
their shares, hoping to lock in profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks have also been threatened after Federal  
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan indicated that the Fed remains 
willing to raise interest rates if it determines that doing so 
would hold off inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, a wide range of technology companies rose. Chip maker  
Intel was up 4 at 66 7/8 and computer maker IBM was up 2 1/4 at 125 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Online auctioneer eBay Inc. extended the pattern of  
post-earnings losses, however. EBay fell 2 5/8 to 101 3/4 a day after 
announcing that its profits in the recent quarter beat analysts' 
expectations by a penny. 
</P>
<P>
	A modest rise in bond prices helped stocks today. At noon, the  
yield on the 30-year Treasury bond was at 6.01 percent, compared 
with 6.03 percent late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks and bonds received some support from a Conference Board  
report that showed consumer confidence declined in July, after 
eight months of consecutive gains and a rise to a 30-year high. 
Analysts said the report suggested that the nation's continued 
economic growth may not be reaching inflationary levels. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, analysts are more interested in upcoming reports on the  
employment costs index and the gross domestic product, both 
scheduled for release Thursday. Also, Greenspan will address a 
Senate panel on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Until then, analysts remain unconvinced of the market's  
strength. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is still a market laboring under the lack of real  
momentum in either direction,'' said Gregory Nie, technical analyst 
at Everen Securities in Chicago. He said modest volume indicated 
that many traders are staying out of the market for now. 
</P>
<P>
	On the New York Stock Exchange, volume came to 315.48 million  
shares at midday, ahead of Monday's quiet pace but still fairly 
light. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-4 margin on 
the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was up 3.15 to 639.05, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index was up 0.55 to 791.34. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies was up 2.35 at  
445.22.

<HEADLINE> Fla. Eyes Marijuana-Killing Fungus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Florida may start testing a fungus that  
could kill marijuana plants in a move environmentalists say could 
backfire if the fungus mutates and attacks crops like tomatoes and 
corn. 
</P>
<P>
	Two state agencies have given approval for the tests to be  
conducted in a quarantine lab on the fungus Fusarium oxysporum, a 
bioherbicide designed to destroy plants like marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we would be years away from using this,'' James  
McDonough, director of the state Office of Drug Control, said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	McDonough said he hasn't made any recommendations to Gov. Jeb  
Bush about the idea of dusting suspected areas with the pot-eating 
fungus. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmentalists said they're concerned about fooling with  
Mother Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida Department of Environmental Protection Secretary David  
Struhs has warned that introducing the fungus into the wild could 
cause disease in crops, including tomatoes and corn. 
</P>
<P>
	Others are worried that the fungus could get out of control like  
the weed kudzu, a vine planted for soil stabilization that has 
grown like wild in South. 
</P>
<P>
	``We tend to manipulate the environment sometimes with these  
biological introductions,'' said David Gluckman, lobbyist for the 
Florida Wildlife Federation. ``We're paying the price for that 
now.''

<HEADLINE> Kennedy Bumps Basinger From Magazine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A photograph of the late Carolyn Bessette  
Kennedy has bumped Kim Basinger off the cover of Vanity Fair. 
</P>
<P>
	The magazine's September issue features the wife of John F.  
Kennedy Jr. on the cover and in a 10-page black-and-white spread of 
pictures by Bruce Weber, who works regularly for Vanity Fair. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Bessette Kennedy posed for the pictures a little over a year  
ago in Glen Cove, on Long Island, and Weber offered them to the 
magazine in the wake of the plane crash that killed her, her 
husband and her sister. 
</P>
<P>
	The magazine's September issue had not yet gone to press, so the  
photo of Basinger and an accompanying article were pulled and will 
appear at a later date, according to Beth Kseniak, a Vanity Fair 
spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were able to change the cover at the last minute,'' she  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The magazine will be out next week and will also include an  
article on JFK Jr.

<HEADLINE> Schrempf Insulted by $1M Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- The Seattle SuperSonics' Detlef Schrempf says he  
will either retire or play for the Portland Trail Blazers next 
season, rather than accept a $1 million offer from the Sonics, the 
Tacoma News Tribune reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing unnamed sources, the newspaper said Schrempf found the  
Sonics' offer ``insulting,'' especially considering his $3.3 
million salary last season and his statistics. 
</P>
<P>
	He had the second-best scoring, rebounding and assisting numbers  
on the team, with an average 15 points, 7.4 rebounds and 3.7 
assists. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Payton averaged 21.7 points, but Schrempf shot 47 percent  
from the floor to Payton's 43 percent, and 39 percent from 3-point 
range to Payton's 29 percent. He also shot better from the 
free-throw line than Payton, 82.8 percent to 72.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	By renouncing Schrempf, the Sonics can use his salary slot to  
sign a quality free agent such as Mitch Richmond, the paper 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	That means Schrempf loses his Larry Bird rights -- which would  
have let him sign for any amount with the Sonics -- for the 
veteran's minimum of $1 million.

<HEADLINE> European Stocks Close Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- European stocks closed higher Tuesday for the  
first time in eight days as Glaxo Wellcome led pharmaceutical 
stocks up after the company said it had received U.S. approval to 
market a flu drug. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Glaxo, the ninth-most heavily weighted stock in the  
Dow Jones Stoxx Index, rose 4.6 percent, or 73 pence, to 1,679 
pence in London. 
</P>
<P>
	Glaxo announced Tuesday that it had received U.S. Food and Drug  
Administration approval to market Relenza, a treatment for the Type 
A and B strains of influenza, in the United States. The drug is 
already sold in Australia and New Zealand and has been approved for 
sale in all 15 countries in the European Union. 
</P>
<P>
	Other drug stocks also rose Tuesday, including AstraZeneca up 89  
pence at 2332 pence and Switzerland's Novartis up 25 euros at 2,155 
euros. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Stoxx Index of 590 European companies closed up  
2.43 points, or 0.8 percent, at 301.70. Pharmaceutical and 
telecommunications shares were the top performers, gaining 2.1 
percent and 1.3 percent in their respective indexes. 
</P>
<P>
	British Telecom gained 66 pence to 1117 pence, after the company  
said it will buy the 40 percent of mobile telephone operator 
Cellnet it doesn't already own. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx Index, which tracks 296 companies in  
countries joining the single currency, rose 1.04 points at 315.43. 
The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx 50 Index finished up 10.67 points at 
3687.58, while the DJ Stoxx 50 Index ended up 32.85 points at 
3649.66. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankfurt's Xetra DAX index closed up 0.3 percent to 5,224.16,  
retreating from an earlier high after HypVereinsbank's stock fell 
amid concerns about the banks' provisioning for possible bad real 
estate loans. 
</P>
<P>
	Optimism that other blue-chip banks will do better helped lift  
their share prices, traders said. Deutsche Bank shares closed up 
1.08 euros at 60.88 euros, and Commerzbank ended at 32.49 euros, up 
59 cents. 
</P>
<P>
	The Paris CAC 40 index ended up 0.7 percent to 4,426.12 and

<HEADLINE> Opposition to Hinckley Leave Dropped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government has dropped its opposition to  
allowing presidential assailant John W. Hinckley Jr. to take 
supervised day trips from the mental hospital where he has been 
confined since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department spokesman Myron Marlin today confirmed the  
government let Monday's deadline pass without appealing to the 
Supreme Court for review of a lower court decision. He declined to 
give a reason. 
</P>
<P>
	Over prosecutors' opposition, a three-judge federal appeals  
panel granted permission in January for supervised trips away from 
St. Elizabeths Hospital. The full U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for 
the District of Columbia refused to reconsider the decision in 
April. 
</P>
<P>
	Hinckley has been confined to St. Elizabeths since 1982, when he  
was acquitted by reason of insanity in the 1981 shooting attack on 
President Reagan outside a Washington hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	Reagan, press secretary James Brady and two law enforcement  
officers were wounded in a shooting that Hinckley later said was an 
attempt to impress actress Jodie Foster. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors, who argued against the off-campus visits, said  
Hinckley remains disturbed and unpredictable. 
</P>
<P>
	Hospital officials have said that as part of his treatment, he  
should be allowed visits off hospital grounds, supervised by 
hospital staff. 
</P>
<P>
	Hinckley's lawyer, Barry Levine, was not immediately available  
for comment today. In April, he said supervised day trips would not 
pose a risk to the public. ``Mental health professionals who know 
him are of the view that John Hinckley is not a danger to anyone,'' 
Levine said at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court's ruling gives hospital officials discretion  
to decide when and where Hinckley can take supervised day trips. 
The Secret Service and U.S. attorney's office are to be notified 
whenever a trip is planned. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1986, Hinckley left the hospital for a visit with his family  
during the Christmas holiday. Levine said. After that, prosecutors 
sought a court order that they be notified before such excursions. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge had turned down Hinckley's request for a  
Christmastime visit with his parents and girlfriend in 1997. 
Hinckley appealed to the three-judge appeals panel that cleared the 
way for his off-campus visits.

<HEADLINE> Fleet To Pay $1.3M for Deception </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Fleet Finance Inc. has agreed to settle  
charges by federal regulators that it failed to provide accurate 
disclosures of the costs and terms of home equity loans to 
consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a settlement announced Monday by the Federal Trade  
Commission, Fleet Finance and its successor company, Home Equity 
U.S.A., will pay $1.3 million in restitution and administrative 
costs to certain consumers whose loans originated with or were 
purchased by Fleet Finance between January 1990 and December 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the FTC, Atlanta-based Fleet Finance on numerous  
occasions failed to accurately provide consumers with information 
about the costs and terms of their loans, including their right to 
cancel their credit transactions. The commission charged that these 
actions violated the Truth in Lending Act as well as federal law 
prohibiting deceptive business practices. 
</P>
<P>
	Jodie Bernstein, director of the commission's bureau of consumer  
protection, said the company's actions made it difficult for 
consumers to comparison shop or decide whether to cancel their 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
	In some instances, Fleet Finance failed to provide disclosures  
of certain information, such as annual percentage rates, the number 
and timing of payments and the total payments owed, the commission 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers affected by this order may have had mortgage loans  
with the following entities: Fleet Finance, Fleet Financenter, 
Fleet Consumer Discount Company, Fleet Industrial Loan Company or 
Fleet City Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Agents will send out claim forms to consumers who may be  
eligible for redress. Consumers who believe they are affected by 
this order can also call this FTC toll-free number: 800-987-9330. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies could not be reached for comment. A settlement  
does not constitute an admission of wrongdoing.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a rebuff to farm-state Democrats, the  
Justice Department's antitrust chief said Tuesday that agribusiness 
mergers did not cause the slump in commodity prices and sometimes 
even help producers. 
</P>
<P>
	``That price decline is not a product of increased  
concentration'' in agribusiness, Assistant Attorney General Joel I. 
Klein told the Senate Agriculture Committee. ``There are other 
factors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is no significant difference in competition in the  
industry now than in 1996, when commodity prices peaked, Klein 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists attribute the recent decline in crop prices to a  
worldwide glut of grain and economic problems in Asia and Europe 
that cut into their food imports. 
</P>
<P>
	But with the agricultural economy stuck in its worst downturn  
since the mid-1980s, many lawmakers have been pointing to declining 
competition among food processors, pesticide makers, seed companies 
and other agribusinesses as the culprit. For example, four 
meatpackers control 80 percent of the nation's beef, up from 36 
percent two decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
	After the hearing, Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., said Klein was  
ignoring a long-term decline in commodity prices relative to what 
consumers pay for food. ``Power in the marketing chain gives you a 
greater share of the retail dollar,'' Conrad said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, the Justice Department came under criticism  
from congressional Democrats for allowing Cargill Inc., North 
America's second-largest grain trader, to acquire the grain 
operations of Continental Grain Co. even though the companies were 
required to sell some of their assets. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure that is going to mean a darn thing back on the  
farm,'' Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, told Klein. 
</P>
<P>
	The Agriculture Department estimates the two companies control  
42 percent of U.S. corn exports, a third of soybeans sold overseas 
and at least 20 percent of wheat exports. 
</P>
<P>
	The forced divestiture would ensure buyers are still available  
to compete for farmers' grain, Klein said. It's in farmers' 
interest for U.S. companies to cut their costs, because they have 
to compete overseas, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we don't compete efficiently in Asia, if we don't compete  
efficiently in Europe to sell products, that's going to hurt the 
family farm,'' Klein said. 
</P>
<P>
	Klein also told the panel antitrust laws generally are adequate  
to protect farm interests, although he thinks Congress should give 
Justice responsibility for approving railroad mergers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Surface Transportation Board, which has authority over  
acquisitions in the railroad industry, approved a $5.4 billion 
merger three years ago between the Union Pacific and Southern 
Pacific over the opposition of the Justice, Transportation and 
Agriculture departments.

<HEADLINE> Feds Probe Ala. Mower Explosion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JASPER, Ala. (AP) -- A man was riding his lawn mower when it  
exploded, killing him and his dog and hurling pieces of the mower 
over the roof of his house. 
</P>
<P>
	James Larry McAnnally was killed instantly when the  
11-horsepower mower exploded Monday. His age was not available. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators for the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and  
Firearms joined a probe of the death Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	McAnnally had not started cutting his grass but had driven a  
short distance across his back yard when the lawn mower exploded. 
His dog was in the back yard. 
</P>
<P>
	Jaime Reyes, chief agent in the ATF office at Birmingham, said  
the agency was called ``because it is an undetermined type of 
explosion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The coroner said pieces of the mower were found on the roof of  
McAnnally's home in north Jasper and the steering wheel was in the 
front yard. Other pieces were strewn up to 100 feet away in 
neighboring yards. He said the explosion was heard up to a mile 
away. 
</P>
<P>
	Fire Chief John Dutton said gasoline fumes could have caused the  
explosion, which he described as being unlike anything he had 
previously seen.

<HEADLINE> 1,000 Asteroids May Threaten Earth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Up to 1,000 asteroids are large enough and  
close enough to pose a potential risk to Earth, but the chances of 
a collision are extremely remote, astronomers say. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers attending a conference on asteroids and comets at  
Cornell University said Tuesday that new data suggests there are 
500 to 1,000 nearby asteroids big enough to cause planet-wide 
damage if they collided with the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	David Rabinowitz of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory said that  
there are probably 2,000 to 4,000 asteroids of about one-third of a 
mile in diameter that cross the orbital path of the Earth. These 
would be big enough to cause extensive regional damage if they hit 
the Earth, but probably would not have the planet-wide effects of 
the larger space rocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Asteroid impacts have scarred the Earth and moon for billions of  
years, but the impact of very large asteroids -- the so-called 
planet killers -- are extremely rare. The last major extinction, 
which killed off the dinosaurs, occurred 65 million years ago when 
an asteroid five to eight miles in diameter smashed the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts estimate that a mile-wide asteroid could possibly hit  
the Earth only about once every 100,000 to 1 million years. 
</P>
<P>
	But for right now, there are no known big asteroids heading for  
the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Chodas of JPL said that through a worldwide effort,  
astronomers have now identified about 15 percent to 20 percent of 
the predicted number of asteroids dangerous to the Earth. He said 
the goal is to find at least 90 percent of the expected number. 
</P>
<P>
	Once an asteroid is found, astronomers can monitor its orbit, or  
path around the sun, and determine if it poses any risk to Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	Chodas said there currently are no looming threats from outer  
space.

	Handyman Admits to Yosemite Murders  
</P>
<P>
	YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK, Calif. (AP) -- A motel handyman  
reportedly admitted Monday that he killed a naturalist and three 
Yosemite sightseers, saying he was acting on long-held fantasies. 
Cary Stayner told San Francisco's KBWB-TV in a jailhouse interview 
that he had dreamed about killing women for 30 years. Stayner, 37, 
did not appear on camera. ``I am guilty,'' Stayner told a KBWB 
reporter. ``I did murder Carole Sund, Juli Sund, Silvina Pelosso 
and Joie Armstrong. ... None of the women were sexually abused in 
any way.''

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Russian Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin,  
trolling for American capital and good will, is offering 
wall-to-wall assurances that his country's rocky economy is on the 
upswing and that American investors ``can come without fear of 
racketeers.'' Opening a brief visit that includes meetings with 
President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore, the former 
counterintelligence chief told hundreds of American business 
executives that accounts of ``criminalization'' in Russia's 
transition from state controls were exaggerated.

Kosovo because of fear of revenge-inspired violence, ethnic 
Albanians continue to return unabated. Some 300 refugees sheltered 
in the United States left for Macedonia on Monday, where busses 
Tuesday are taking them back to Kosovo's capital Pristina. About 
9,700 refugees were brought to the United States by the U.S. 
government beginning in May, when attacks by Serb forces prompted 
an exodus of an estimated 860,000 ethnic Albanian refugees from 
Kosovo.

	Landslide Reportedly Kills 7 in China

	SHANGHAI, China (AP) -- A landslide swept a bus off a mountain  
road and into a river in western China, killing seven people and 
leaving six missing, a newspaper reported Tuesday. The accident 
occurred Monday in Sichuan province, where heavy rain has caused 
flooding and mudslides that have killed dozens of people, according 
to the West China City Daily. A rain-soaked hillside collapsed near 
the town of Yingjing, southwest of the provincial capital of 
Chengdu, sweeping the bus into a river. Nine people escaped with 
serious injuries, seven bodies were recovered and the six missing 
were believed buried under the rubble, the newspaper said.

	DALLAS (AP) -- People with implanted defibrillators can walk

without fear of getting an extra shock to the heart, researchers 
reported Tuesday. ``There is absolutely no danger from a slow 
stroll through the gates, even if it takes 10 or 15 seconds,'' said 
a professor of medicine at the Indiana University School of 
Medicine in Indianapolis. However, if a person with a defibrillator 
takes longer, he or she could experience an unnecessary electric 
shock to the heart.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Scorching heat gripped the eastern third of the  
country on Monday, continuing a hot spell that has been blamed for 
at least 24 deaths -- including an elderly Illinois woman found 
inside her 102-degree home. Forecasts say there's no immediate 
relief in sight. Heat advisories were posted Monday from Kansas 
eastward through the Ohio Valley, and over parts of the Southeast. 
Temperatures throughout the region hit the 90s and reached triple 
digits with the heat index. The weather was blamed on eight deaths 
in Cincinnati over the weekend, 11 deaths in Illinois in the past 
week and five in Missouri.

from Arizona on June 12.

<HEADLINE> Treasurer Sentenced in Campaign Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The city's former treasurer was sentenced Tuesday  
to 40 months in prison for illegally pressuring a brokerage firm 
for a political contribution and forcing aides to campaign on 
taxpayers time. 
</P>
<P>
	Miriam Santos, 43, the Democratic candidate for state attorney  
general in 1998, was also ordered to pay $53,000 in restitution. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have dedicated myself to the public good and I never dreamed  
that my career would end in this manner,'' Santos told the court. 
</P>
<P>
	Her lawyer said the case would be appealed.  
</P>
<P>
	Santos threatened to bar the firm of Fuji Securities from doing  
business with the city unless it contributed $10,000 to the 
Democratic Party of Illinois. She also had her office staff do 
campaign work on city time. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Charles Norgle said Santos deserved a tough  
sentence for lying to the jury during a two-week trial that ended 
with her conviction May 3. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is well established that a criminal defendant's right to  
testify does not include the right to commit perjury,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the case vexed him because Santos came from a good  
family. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll leave it to others to figure that out,'' Norgle told her.  
``And you may spend the rest of your life trying to figure it out 
as well.''

<HEADLINE> Parkinson's Drug Side Effects Slight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- New research presented Tuesday shows that a  
relatively new drug for treating Parkinson's disease produces less 
of a debilitating side effect than the most widely prescribed drug 
used for the disorder. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Oliver Rascol of the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire,  
Toulouse, France, presented the study at a medical conference in 
Vancouver, British Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	The study compared the widely used levadopa with the newer drug  
Requip, made by SmithKline Beecham, which has its U.S. headquarters 
in Philadelphia. Requip was approved by the federal government just 
two years ago while levadopa, also known as Sinemet, has been 
available for 35 years and is given to 75 percent of patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Levadopa is the most effective treatment for the symptoms of  
Parkinson's, which include tremors, slow movement, rigidity and 
poor balance. But it has a side effect -- involuntary body 
movements. 
</P>
<P>
	For most patients, this is mostly a social embarrassment. But in  
some patients, ``it can be even more troublesome, preventing you 
from being able to eat or to sit up in a chair,'' Rascol said. 
</P>
<P>
	An expert not involved in the study agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the longer-term complications are much more difficult  
to manage ... and can be as disabling as the disease itself,'' said 
Dr. Matthew B. Stern, director of the Parkinson's Disease and 
Movement Disorders Center at the University of Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	Requip is one of a promising new class of drugs called dopamine  
agonists. They still have side effects, including confusion, upset 
stomach, lightheadedness, hallucinations and sleepiness, but they 
are not as disabling as the involuntary body movements, Stern said. 
</P>
<P>
	The five-year study shows that treating patients with Requip at  
the outset, and using levadopa only when Parkinson's symptoms 
become bad enough to require the stronger drug, resulted in fewer 
involuntary body movements than the common treatment of using 
levadopa from the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can delay the levadopa and you can use lower doses of  
levadopa,'' Rascol said. In a minority of cases, no levadopa is 
needed at all, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Previous studies supported a similar conclusion, but Rascol's  
study had more reliable conclusions than earlier ones, Stern said. 
</P>
<P>
	For one thing, this study selected the patients early on and  
tracked them throughout their treatments. Also, this was a 
``double-blind'' study in which neither the patients nor the people 
tracking the symptoms knew which drugs were in use. 
</P>
<P>
	According to SmithKline Beecham, 130 people completed the study,  
85 on Requip and 45 on levadopa. Among those given Requip, 27 
percent suffered side effects, compared with 29 percent of those on 
levadopa. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the incidence of uncontrollable body movements was 5  
percent for Requip and 36 percent for levadopa. 
</P>
<P>
	The study was paid for by SmithKline Beecham but run  
independently.

<HEADLINE> Prayer Books Stolen by Nazis Sought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Eight rare prayer books stolen by the Nazis from  
the French home of a Jewish art collector should be returned to his 
estate by a Manhattan gallery, a lawsuit filed Tuesday claimed. 
</P>
<P>
	The books, valued at $15 million, belonged to Alphonse Kann, who  
collected more than 1,200 pieces of art, including paintings by 
Picasso, Manet and Matisse. He left his home in 1939, ahead of the 
Nazi occupation of France. 
</P>
<P>
	In a lawsuit filed in State Supreme Court, descendants and heirs  
of Kann said the 15th, 16th and 17th century manuscripts, known as 
``Books of Hours,'' are currently at the Wildenstein Gallery. They 
estate was made aware of their location in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The hand lettered manuscripts contain colorful religious  
illustrations by renowned artists of the period. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit alleges that Kann's collection was stolen from his  
St. Germane-en-Laye home outside Paris in October 1940 after Kann 
moved to London for what he thought would be a temporary stay. He 
never returned and died in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit was filed in the name of Francis Warin, the  
surviving son of Kann's nephew, Charles Weil, and En Memoire 
D'Alphonse Kann, an association in France comprised of Kann's 
heirs, beneficiaries and descendants. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit said the association tried unsuccessfully to  
negotiate the return of the manuscripts from the gallery. A message 
left with the company Tuesday was not returned.

<HEADLINE> Report: Ford Unit Talks With Mazda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Ford Motor Co.'s finance subsidiary is in final  
negotiations to acquire the credit arm of Mazda Motor Corp., a 
newspaper reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford Motor Credit Co. the world's largest auto finance firm, has  
reached a ``basic agreement'' to buy Mazda Credit Corp. and turn 
the firm into a subsidiary by September, the Nihon Keizai business 
daily said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yuji Kato, a Mazda spokesman, said his company could not comment  
on the report. 
</P>
<P>
	Hiroshima-based Mazda is 33.4 percent owned by Ford of the  
United States. Ford is the world's second-largest automaker. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said Ford Motor Credit plans to set up a  
full-fledged finance business centered on autos in Japan by 
acquiring Mazda's finance subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
	Mazda Credit, based in the western city of Osaka, provides  
financing for purchases of Mazda vehicles. It had $1.44 billion in 
sales-financing assets as of March 1999, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford Motor Credit, which now operates in 35 countries, already  
has a Japanese unit, Ford Credit Japan Inc., that finances 
purchases of Ford vehicles.

<HEADLINE> Politician Gets Tax Evasion Sentence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) -- A former Florida House speaker was  
sentenced to two years in prison Tuesday for tax evasion, and his 
wife got 15 months for the same. 
</P>
<P>
	Bolley ``Bo'' Johnson and his wife Judi failed to report  
$452,675 in income paid to them by representatives of various 
interests seeking to take advantage of his influence with former 
Gov. Lawton Chiles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sorry for the pain and suffering that has been brought to  
the people I love and care about,'' Johnson said in a brief 
statement to U.S. District Judge Lacey Collier. 
</P>
<P>
	Through tears, Mrs. Johnson told the judge, ``I still am in awe  
of everything that has happened. I want to apologize to everyone 
concerned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In May, a jury found Johnson, 47, guilty on four counts and Mrs.  
Johnson, 48, guilty of three counts of failing to report income 
from consulting fees received during four of six years ending in 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Collier rejected pleas from the defense for a reduction in the  
sentence on the grounds they had taken responsibility for their 
crimes. The judge said the Johnsons refused to admit their crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	``You simply add to the public cynicism of the system and  
politicians in general,'' Collier told the Johnsons. 
</P>
<P>
	The income the Johnsons failed to report was paid by interests  
that included casino gambling, transportation, road building and 
health care businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	A onetime Pensacola real estate broker, Johnson served in the  
House 16 years as a Democrat and was speaker during his last two 
years through November 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors contended at trial that the Johnsons hid their  
income, but defense lawyers argued they were guilty of sloppy 
record keeping. 
</P>
<P>
	Collier allowed both to remain free on bond and turn themselves  
in to begin their sentences Aug. 30.

<HEADLINE> Elliott, O'Dwyer Sued Over Bar Melee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINEOLA, N.Y. (AP) -- New York Jets offensive lineman Jumbo  
Elliott and ex-Jet Matt O'Dwyer, now with the Cincinnati Bengals, 
are being sued for $6.3 million because of a barroom brawl earlier 
this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Three police officers and two people who were in the bar are  
suing, saying they were injured. 
</P>
<P>
	``These people are accustomed to using their brute strength for  
football,'' attorney Lawrence Elovich said of players. ``When they 
misbehave on the field they get a penalty. This time, it's going to 
cost them a lot more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He filed the suit Monday in state Supreme Court in Nassau  
County. 
</P>
<P>
	It seeks $1.3 million in compensatory damages and $5 million in  
punitive damages against O'Dwyer and Elliott, according to Elovich. 
</P>
<P>
	Jason Fabini of the Jets, the third football player arrested in  
the melee at Bogart's bar in Long Beach, was not named in the 
lawsuit because ``he in no way contributed to the injuries 
sustained by my five clients,'' Elovich said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said the three football players were arrested after  
Elliott urinated in the sink of a women's bathroom and punched two 
bar patrons and O'Dwyer kicked out a police car window as he was 
being arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit was filed on behalf of Long Beach police officers  
John O'Sullivan and Dean Burke, Nassau County police officer 
Anthony Rivelli and the other two people, Michael Conradis and 
Christine Bonsignore. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawyer said O'Sullivan, Burke and Rivelli suffered what may  
be permanent eye damage from flying glass. Rivelli also suffered 
back and hip injuries after being kicked and knocked down by 
O'Dwyer, Elovich said. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit also charged that the 308-pound Elliott punched  
18-year-old Bonsignore in the chest, leaving her with nerve damage 
to her chest and back. Elovich said Conradis suffered jaw damage 
and was unable to open his mouth for 10 days after being punched in 
the face by Elliott. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe that along with the fame, adulation, and huge  
financial rewards of being a professional football player comes the 
concomitant responsibility not to use their enormous strength to 
injure the public,'' Elovich said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was expected,'' Elliott's attorney Brian Davis said of the  
lawsuit. ``The day after the incident they were in the attorney's 
office looking for a pay day.'' Lawyers for the players have 20 
days to respond to the civil charges. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Dwyer, who signed a two-year, $2.7 million contract with

<HEADLINE> Khmer Rouge Case May Be Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) -- Lawmakers from Prime Minister Hun  
Sen's ruling party said Tuesday they want to amend Cambodian law to 
give prosecutors more time to gather evidence against Khmer Rouge 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	They disagreed on whether the proposed amendment would allow a  
delay in the trial of Khmer Rouge guerrilla chief Ta Mok, which 
must otherwise begin by Sept. 9. 
</P>
<P>
	The law now allows authorities to hold suspects for up to six  
months before trial. Forty-two lawmakers from the Cambodian 
People's Party submitted a petition to the assembly's legislative 
committee on July 16 calling for the six-month limit to be waived 
if suspects are charged with genocide, crimes against humanity or 
war crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmaker Cheam Yeap said prosecutors have complained that six  
months is not enough time to investigate such serious crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that if the measure is swiftly passed, it could be  
applied to the military court's case against Ta Mok, who was 
arrested March 6 and arraigned three days later on charges of 
belonging to an illegal organization. 
</P>
<P>
	But another lawmaker who signed the petition, Ek Samol, said he  
thought the proposed amendment was intended solely for a planned 
genocide tribunal for Khmer Rouge leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cambodian government and the United Nations are working to  
create a tribunal to try top Khmer Rouge figures for the deaths of 
an estimated 1.7 million Cambodians during 1975-79. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides Ta Mok, only one other senior Khmer Rouge figure now is  
awaiting trial -- chief executioner Kaing Khek Iev, better known by 
his revolutionary name Duch. 
</P>
<P>
	Every other surviving Khmer Rouge leader lives freely in  
Cambodia after striking deals with Hun Sen that led to the 
dissolution of the guerrilla movement.

<HEADLINE> At the Movies: 'The Dinner Game' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Better pay attention, because the jokes in ``The Dinner Game''  
come as quick as volleys at the French Open. 
</P>
<P>
	The biting comedy, one of the highest grossing films in French  
history, is fast-paced, lighthearted fun. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the ending is as message-laden as an after-school  
special, everything up until then is so amusing, such preachiness 
is forgivable. 
</P>
<P>
	Set in Paris, ``The Dinner Game'' (``Le Diner de Cons'') is  
about an arrogant, rich yuppie who engages in a cruel competition 
with his equally obnoxious friends. They hunt for the biggest 
idiots they can find and invite them to dinner parties simply to 
make fun of them. 
</P>
<P>
	Pierre Brochant (Thierry Lhermitte), a handsome, golf-playing  
publisher, thinks he's found ``a world champion'' in Francois 
Pignon (Jacques Villeret), a short, balding, overweight accountant 
who toils in the lower ranks of the Financial Ministry. Picture a 
French version of Danny DeVito. 
</P>
<P>
	But Pignon springs to life and his blue eyes twinkle when he  
talks about his beloved hobby: He builds models of famous monuments 
using matchsticks. He's more than happy to discuss how many 
matchsticks and tubes of glue it took to build his tiny Eiffel 
Tower -- if anyone can stay awake long enough to listen. 
</P>
<P>
	Pignon is kind and he means well, though. When he goes to  
Brochant's lavish apartment for drinks before the big dinner, he 
tries his hardest to help Brochant through a series of sticky 
situations -- with disastrous results. 
</P>
<P>
	Brochant's pretty, blond wife Christine (Alexandra Vandernoot),  
sick of her husband's thoughtless game and his philandering, dumps 
him on the answering machine for Pignon to hear. Pignon, who 
fancies himself a crafty thinker, tries to persuade Christine to 
come back but ends up insulting her and encouraging Brochant's 
clingy mistress, Marlene (Catherine Frot). 
</P>
<P>
	When Pignon offers to help find Christine, he ends up inviting  
over his co-worker, a ruthless tax investigator who is suspicious 
of Brochant's beautiful -- and undeclared -- art works. 
</P>
<P>
	The movie's moral is obvious from the start, and it's clear that  
the smug Brochant is the real idiot and will get what's coming to 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately, ``The Dinner Game'' relies on basic and somewhat  
hackneyed tenets of comedy for laughs -- mistaken identity, plays on 
words and over-the-top physical humor. But because the film is 
funny and well-intentioned, it's easy to overlook these 
shortcomings. 
</P>
<P>
	Lhermitte and Villeret have great chemistry. The scenes in which  
the two spar with words are a joy to watch. 
</P>
<P>
	The supporting cast is strong with terrific comedic timing,  
notably Daniel Prevost as the tax inspector and Francis Huster as 
Brochant's buddy who gets caught in the elaborate plot to find 
Christine. 
</P>
<P>
	But the script from writer-director Francis Veber is the real  
star. Veber, who wrote ``La Cage aux Folles'' in 1978, got the idea 
for this film from a real game played in Paris. He thought it would 
be fun to make life miserable for one of these egotistical jerks, 
and the revenge he creates in ``The Dinner Game'' is hilarious. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Dinner Game,'' a Lions Gate Films release, is in French  
with English subtitles. The film was nominated for six Cesar awards 
(the French equivalent of the Oscar) including best picture, and 
won Cesars for best screenplay, best actor for Villeret and best 
supporting actor for Prevost. It runs 80 minutes and is rated 
PG-13.

<HEADLINE> Trumpeter 'Sweets' Edison Dead at 83 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Harry ``Sweets'' Edison, a jazz trumpeter  
who accompanied singers such as Frank Sinatra, Ella Fitzgerald and 
Billie Holiday, died Tuesday. He was 83. 
</P>
<P>
	Edison, who had fought cancer for 14 years, joined the Count  
Basie Orchestra in the mid-1930s when he was 18 and became a 
featured soloist. Basie saxophonist Lester Young dubbed him 
``Sweets'' because of the pleasing tone of his horn. 
</P>
<P>
	Edison stayed with Basie's big band until about 1950 before  
heading off to perform with his own quintet. He recorded his own 
albums, notably ``Sweets For The Sweet Taste Of Love,'' accompanied 
Sinatra as a studio musician and worked with Benny Carter on movie 
sound tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the years he played with most of the famous big bands,  
including those of Buddy Rich, Quincy Jones, Louis Bellson, Henry 
Mancini and Nelson Riddle. 
</P>
<P>
	Edison taught music seminars at Yale University in the Duke  
Ellington Fellowship Program and he was honored as a ``master 
musician'' with a 1991 National Endowment for the Arts Award at the 
Kennedy Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Edison lived in Los Angeles from 1950 until December, when he  
returned to Columbus because of his health, his daughter Helena 
said. But he continued to perform until a month ago and traveled to 
Europe this spring, she said.

<HEADLINE> Hispanics Call Network Boycott </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- A national coalition of Latino groups decided  
Tuesday to mobilize Hispanics for a weeklong boycott of the four 
major TV networks in September to protest the ``brownout'' of 
Hispanics in American television. 
</P>
<P>
	``Latinos are mad as hell and not going to take any more,'' said  
Felix Sanchez, president of the National Hispanic Foundation for 
the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanchez's organization and nine other Latino groups announced  
the move at the annual convention of the National Council of La 
Raza, a coordinating organization whose 240 affiliate groups claim 
a membership of 3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, the NAACP at its national conference said it was  
going to monitor how network shows incorporate minority roles in 
their programs. That organization, the nation's oldest and largest 
civil rights group, threatened boycotts and legal action to make 
its point for greater diversity. 
</P>
<P>
	Alex Nogales, spokesman for the National Hispanic Media  
Coalition, said the Hispanic boycott will be the opening salvo in 
the fight for greater diversity on television. 
</P>
<P>
	The coalition said Latino leaders will meet in Washington on  
Sept. 12, National Hispanic Heritage Week. 
</P>
<P>
	``There the group will launch the brownout,'' asking Hispanics  
to turn off their televisions to counter the networks' ``brownout'' 
that is evidenced by ``a virtual absence of Latino images on 
television,'' a coalition statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers said they plan no action against sponsors, only  
against the networks. 
</P>
<P>
	The coalition plans to meet with advertisers, will look for  
legal and regulatory remedies and plans to start buying stock in 
publicly owned media companies to influence stockholder meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are starting with small incremental steps,'' Nogales said.  
``But if these networks don't want to hire us, we don't have to 
watch their product.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nogales suggested that the nation's 31 million Latinos rent  
Latino-themed films or read Latino literature during the boycott. 
</P>
<P>
	While Hispanics constitute 11 percent of the U.S. population,  
they comprise less than 2 percent of the characters on prime-time 
television shows, said Lisa Navarrete, a spokeswoman for La Raza, a 
national Hispanic advocacy organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Navarrete said that only one Latino actor, Martin Sheen on NBC's  
West Wing, has been cast on a new network show set to premiere in 
the 1999-2000 season. 
</P>
<P>
	La Raza President Raul Yzaguirre said a lack of Hispanic faces  
on television contributes to marginalizing and stereotyping. 
</P>
<P>
	``People build perceptions of the world around them based in  
part by what they see on television,'' Yzaguirre said. ``We want a 
balanced picture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ABC in May announced plans to add minority characters to five of  
its shows. Sanchez said he was happy about the move, but it falls 
short of what is needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are glad they are looking at these issues, but we are still  
going to be underrepresented,'' Sanchez said. ``It isn't even a 
first step.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NBC said in a statement that minority representation ``continues  
to remain a top priority'' and expressed pride in minority actors 
on shows including ``ER'' and ``Law &AMP; Order.'' The statement added: 
``We realize there is still work to be done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ABC Television Network's president, Patricia Fili-Krushel, said  
in a network meeting in Pasadena, Calif., Tuesday that she wanted 
to ``reaffirm ABC Network's commitment to finding lasting solutions 
to make our network more diverse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said progress was made during the five years she was  
president of ABC Daytime in adding minority characters to programs, 
as well as hiring minorities for jobs behind the camera, including 
writers, technicians and stagehands. She said the problem existed 
in ``different parts'' of the network and was a ``personal 
commitment'' for her. ``I think you will see change,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC also noted that it had sponsored an entertainment special in  
June, ``The 1999 ALMA Awards,'' honoring the achievements of Latino 
performers. 
</P>
<P>
	Other major networks had no immediate response to requests for  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago at its national conference in New York, the NAACP  
announced it would begin to monitor the ``virtual whitewash'' in 
fall TV programming. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to requesting congressional and Federal  
Communications Commission hearings on licensing and ownership of 
the networks, campaign organizers are considering lawsuits and 
boycotts of advertisers. 
</P>
<P>
	The NAACP also plans to study whether the 1934 Communications  
Act mandating public ownership of the airwaves can be used as a 
basis for suing.

<HEADLINE> Abbott Says Career Is Likely Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Jim Abbott has concluded in the past few weeks he  
can no longer pitch effectively, and says his career likely is 
over. 
</P>
<P>
	Abbott, who was born without a right hand, was released Friday  
by the Milwaukee Brewers. 
</P>
<P>
	The 31-year-old Abbott said it's time to ``look in other areas  
and aspects of life. It's time to admit reality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After he allowed five runs in 3 2-3 innings in front of friends  
and family July 8 at Tiger Stadium, he said would contemplate his 
future after the All-Star break. Against the Philadelphia Phillies 
on July 14, he gave up four hits and three runs in the ninth inning 
in a 7-0 loss, surrendering two walks and two wild pitches. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I've come to the end, baseball-wise,'' Abbott told the  
Detroit Free Press from his home in California on Monday. ``I feel 
fulfilled. I feel satisfied.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abbott had a 2-8 record and a 6.91 earned-run average when he  
was released by the Brewers. 
</P>
<P>
	``My career wasn't always great, but it was wonderful. I learned  
so many lessons and had so many great friends and experiences. I 
don't feel the emptiness that I felt after I was released by the 
Angels a few years ago,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Abbott was a collegiate star at Michigan.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'll always be looked at as having played with one hand,''  
Abbott said. ``There's an accomplishment to that that I can be 
proud of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He played for the United States team that won the baseball  
tournament at the 1988 Olympics in Seoul. He then skipped the 
minors and went straight to the California Angels. 
</P>
<P>
	He spent four seasons with the Angels, compiling a 47-52 record,  
before being traded to the New York Yankees. He pitched a no-hitter 
against Cleveland on Sept. 4, 1993, at Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Abbott opened the 1995 season with the White Sox and later was  
traded back to the Angels, who released him after a series of shaky 
starts in spring training in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, he signed a minor league deal with the White Sox and  
worked his way through the farm system. He was 5-0 in the final 
month of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	On Jan. 27, Abbott signed a one-year, $600,000 contract with the  
Brewers, who promised him a spot in the starting rotation. But he 
struggled. 
</P>
<P>
	Abbott said he no longer had the fastball to be a power pitcher  
and the adjustment to becoming a finesse pitcher was too much. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't able to make the transition to throw a formidable  
off-speed pitch,'' he said. ``You have to be able to do that. For 
me, it was a tough transition to make. Unfortunately, I wasn't able 
to do it.''

<HEADLINE> New England States Best for Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Looking for the best place to raise little  
Michael or Janet? Then head to Maine, according to a child advocacy 
group's ranking of that state as the best for bringing up children. 
In fact, almost any New England state would do; the top five 
child-rearing states are in that region. 
</P>
<P>
	No need to rush there yet, though.  
</P>
<P>
	``We don't ask people to leave the state they live in and flock  
to No. 1,'' David Levy, an attorney and president of the Children's 
Rights Council, said Tuesday in announcing results of its fifth 
annual survey at a Capitol Hill news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``We seek to instill a sense of friendly competition among the  
states -- friendly competition to do better for our children,'' Levy 
added. The council was created in 1985 to work on behalf of the 
children of unwed, separated or divorced parents. 
</P>
<P>
	The report measured each state and Washington in the following  
areas: rates of child abuse and neglect; immunizations under age 2; 
high school dropouts; child poverty; child deaths; infant 
mortality; mothers not receiving prenatal care in the first three 
months of pregnancy; juvenile arrests; teen births and divorce. 
</P>
<P>
	Rankings were based on the average of all 10 factors for each  
state. 
</P>
<P>
	Maine climbed up from eighth place last year, when Iowa was No.  
1. 
</P>
<P>
	Behind Maine were Massachusetts, Connecticut, Vermont and New  
Hampshire. North Dakota, Maryland, Kansas, Wisconsin and Iowa 
rounded out the top 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Bringing up the rear, in descending order, were Idaho,  
Mississippi, Arkansas, Nevada, Oklahoma, California, Arizona, 
Texas, New Mexico and Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
	The District of Columbia was last, in 51st place.  
</P>
<P>
	The report incorporates information from public and private  
sources, including the FBI, the Department of Health and Human 
Services, The Annie E. Casey Foundation (which compiles similar 
child welfare information), the federal Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention and state law enforcement agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	Maine's leap to No. 1 was attributed to an increase in  
graduation rates and dips in child poverty and teen births. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a wonderful honor for Maine and it simply tells the  
country something we've known in Maine for a long time -- it is a 
wonderful place to raise children,'' said Gov. Angus King Jr., who 
was joined by members of the state's congressional delegation. But 
he acknowledged that still more needed to be done. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody from Maine would tell you that everything is fixed,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A few tourists at the Capitol, told about the list, appeared in  
no hurry to move to Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	Amrit Singh, peering into a display case with an 8-year-old  
daughter, scoffed at the notion that location influences how a 
child will fare later in life. 
</P>
<P>
	``Upbringing is the most important thing, and the values you  
teach your child at home,'' said Singh, an 11-year resident of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``We sort of like where we are now,'' said Renee Hodder, who has  
lived most of her life near Cleveland with her husband and three 
school-aged children. 
</P>
<P>
	New England claimed the top five slots this year in part because  
the council changed its calculations to focus more closely on those 
factors that directly affect children, said Ellen Sanders, a 
legislative assistant for the group. 
</P>
<P>
	Data on alcohol- and drug-related deaths were dropped since they  
may be irrelevant if the individual had no children or was not a 
child, Sanders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Data on single-parent households and unwed births also were  
dropped because they overlap with teen birth figures, which 
remained in the study, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Peggy Armstrong, a spokeswoman for District of Columbia Mayor  
Anthony Williams, said city officials had no quarrel with the 
last-place rank in the report. 
</P>
<P>
	Next year's budget, which Congress must approve, earmarks $50  
million for programs to ``help turn these terrible statistics 
around,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't argue with the fact that these numbers show ... that  
our kids aren't getting what they need,'' Armstrong said, ``and the 
mayor's about changing that.''

<HEADLINE> Sting Beat Liberty 75-69 in OT </HEADLINE>

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Dawn Staley scored six points in overtime and  
Rhonda Mapp had 18 points and 18 rebounds to lead the Charlotte 
Sting to a 75-69 victory over the New York Liberty on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlotte outscored New York 11-5 in overtime as the Liberty  
missed their first eight shots. Teresa Weatherspoon's 3-pointer and 
Vickie Johnson's steal and layup brought New York within 72-69 with 
9.8 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
	But Staley sank two free throws and Mapp added one for the final  
margin. 
</P>
<P>
	Crystal Robinson, who led New York with 23 points, hit a  
3-pointer to tie the game at 64 with 5.2 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson faked Charlotte Smith off her feet and hit the  
game-tying shot from the top of the key. She finished 6-for-12 from 
behind the arc.

<P>
	Guarded by Weatherspoon, Staley missed a leaning 10-foot jumper  
at the buzzer, sending New York to its third overtime in its last 
six games. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlotte, which has won five of its last seven games, trails  
New York by one-half game in the Eastern Conference. The Liberty 
(10-9) dropped into a tie with idle Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	Staley and Andrea Stinson finished with 15 points apiece.  
</P>
<P>
	Johnson had 15 points and Sue Wicks added 10 points and nine  
rebounds for the Liberty, losers three straight games and five of 
their last seven. 
</P>
<P>
	Vicky Bullett added 13 points and 10 rebounds for the Sting  
(10-10), who led 40-27 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
	After two free throws by the Sting, New York went on an 8-0 run  
to open the second half, capped by Robinson's 3-pointer, to trail 
42-35 with 15:53 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	The Liberty closed the gap to 51-47 points on another 3-pointer  
by Robinson with 9:30 remaining. Robinson's 12-foot jumper brought 
New York within 57-56 five minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
	Mapp added a turnaround jumper for a 59-56 lead with 2:57  
remaining. Staley's 3-pointer extended the lead to 62-58 with 1:52 
left. 
</P>
<P>
	Mapp's layup with 16 seconds left gave the Sting a 64-61 lead  
before Robinson's shot from behind the arc sent the game into 
overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	Staley hit a jumper and Stinson added two free throws for a  
68-64 lead at 3:17 of overtime. Staley sank two more free throws

	In the first half, the Sting opened an early lead and stopped  
the Liberty's fast break. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlotte held the Liberty to two field goals over six minutes  
and went on a 17-4 run capped by Stephanie McCarty's jumper for a

<HEADLINE>  Pan Am Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Ernie Whitt fumed, the U.S. baseball  
team blew it and Morgan White beamed, braces and all. 
</P>
<P>
	On a day that White and teammate Jennie Thompson restored some  
pride in U.S. women's gymnastics at the Pan American Games, the 
nation's baseball team squandered a four-run lead and lost to 
Canada in its controversy-spiced opener Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	And there was more from Cuba, this time from the man at the top.  
President Fidel Castro accused Canada and the United States of 
dirty tricks aimed at harming Cuba during the games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are competing in enemy territory,'' Castro declared during  
his annual Revolution Day speech in Havana. 
</P>
<P>
	The baseball fireworks were ignited by Whitt, the Canadian  
manager, ejected in a rulings dispute with the umpires, then filed 
a protest that was rejected. The resulting 30-minute delay only 
served to inspire the Canadians, who trailed 6-3 at that point, but 
rallied for a 7-6 victory in 11 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	``The second he got ejected, he believed we were going to come  
back and win this game,'' said Canada's Andy Stewart, who had to 
admit, ``that was an unusual way to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White, 16, who has yet to outgrow her braces, is one of the  
youngest members of the entire U.S. delegation. She also came from 
behind. She was third heading into the final rotation of the 
all-around competition, but put together a strong routine on the 
uneven bars that was enough to give her a .031 margin over Canada's 
Michelle Conway. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson, second going into her last routine, held on for the  
bronze despite falling off the balance beam. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew I could be a consistent competitor, and I thought I  
could do well if I just believed in myself,'' White said. ``But I'm 
still in shock that I won. This builds my confidence enormously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The loss to Canada didn't do much for the confidence of the U.S.  
baseball team, It seemed to have its game well in hand before 
Stewart, who plays Double-A ball in the Phillies organization, hit 
a three-run homer off Scott Stewart to tie the score in the 11th. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada then loaded the bases on two walks and a hit batter  
before Stubby Clapp hit a routine popup into short left field. 
Shortstop Travis Dawkins appeared to be under the ball, but left 
fielder Shawn Gilbert called him off. 
</P>
<P>
	Bad move. Gilbert couldn't get to the ball, it plopped to the  
grass and the winning run scored. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to lose when you feel like you played hard all game  
long, you go up by three and got two outs,'' U.S. manager Buddy 
Bell said. ``You just pretty much figure things will work out the 
way you want them to. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I have been in this game long enough to know better than  
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whitt erupted after walking to the mound in the top of the 11th  
to talk to pitcher Chad Ricketts, who had just surrendered a 
two-run homer to Jason Hardtke that gave Team USA a 6-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Because Whitt talked to Ricketts the previous inning, the  
umpires said he exceeded the number of free trips allowed in a game 
and had to remove the pitcher. Whitt thought otherwise, a 20-minute 
discussion -- which eventually became an argument -- followed and 
Whitt got tossed. 
</P>
<P>
	He promptly filed a protest, which international baseball  
officials turned down. By the end of the game, Whitt had cooled 
down -- somewhat. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess they make the rules as they go,'' he said. ``Needless  
to say, I'm still upset about it, but it's nice to come back and 
win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the two gymnastics medals, coach Mary Lee Tracy felt much  
better leaving Winnipeg Arena than she did on Saturday, when the 
favored Americans finished second to Canada in the team race. 
</P>
<P>
	``It does help soothe a little bit of the pain from the team  
competition,'' Tracy said. ``Definitely to me that was painful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States leads the medals count with 63, including 24  
gold. Cuba has 37, with 15 gold, and Canada has 35, with nine gold. 
</P>
<P>
	Castro's comments followed the defection of a Cuban athlete and  
a journalist at the games. He echoed criticism by Cuban athletic 
officials that the Canadian media were encouraging Cuban athletes 
to defect. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have never seen so many tricks, so much filth in the Pan  
American Games,'' Castro said. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States lost a coach and a key athlete on Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	Assistant Harvey Glance took over as head coach of the men's  
track and field team after Ralph Lindeman was sent home to Colorado 
Springs on the advice of doctors. Lindeman, 48, the track coach at 
the Air Force Academy. 
</P>
<P>
	The freestyle wrestling team lost one of its top performers when  
two-time world champion Terry Brands became ill and went home to 
Iowa City, Iowa. He was replaced by Eric Guerrero in the 
competition that began today. 
</P>
<P>
	The American women survived a rugged water polo match with Cuba,  
winning 10-5 but emerging from the pool with bruises, scratches and 
torn bathing suits. Maureen O'Toole had a hat trick. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a very physical game,'' Heather Moody said. ``We didn't  
notice that in their play when we watched them two days ago, but 
they really took it out on us.''

<HEADLINE> Fawcett Promotes CBS-TV Movie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Farrah Fawcett has gone public with the  
reason behind her memorably odd appearance on the ``Late Show with 
David Letterman'' -- questionable advice from mom. 
</P>
<P>
	``My mom said `Just go and have a good time,''' Ms. Fawcett  
recounted Monday, adding jokingly: ``This is your fault, mom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The actress, who appeared at the Television Critics Association  
to promote the CBS-TV movie ``Silk Hope,'' made light of her 
bizarre behavior two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The actress became the butt of jokes when she squirmed in her  
seat and seemed to lose her train of thought during Letterman's 
show on June 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe she was guilty of ``being a bad talk show guest,'' the  
52-year-old actress said this week, but she was simply trying to be 
playful. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Fawcett, who gained stardom with the 1970s TV show  
``Charlie's Angels,'' said she's ended a lengthy break from acting 
that was intended to help her deal with unspecified ``personal 
issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The work had lost a little of its glamour,'' she added. ``It  
became more work than fun.''

<HEADLINE> NYC Mayor Heads Into Clinton's Turf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- In a not-so-subtle tweak at Hillary  
Rodham Clinton -- his potential opponent in a U.S. Senate race -- New 
York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani traveled to her territory today for a 
little campaigning. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll maximize the listening and do a lot of exploring,''  
Giuliani said Monday, poking fun at the first lady's ``listening'' 
tours of New York communities this summer. ``But mainly, I am going 
there to raise money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After meeting today with Gov. Mike Huckabee and Lt. Gov.  
Winthrop Rockefeller, both fellow Republicans, Giuliani attened a 
fund-raiser at the Capital Hotel. He was to give a speech later in 
the afternoon before continuing on to Alabama and Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton has been the target of carpetbagging charges since  
she announced her interest in the seat being vacated by Sen. Daniel 
Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y.. The first lady was born in Illinois and 
has lived in Arkansas and Washington, D.C., for most of her adult 
life. She has never lived or worked in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Huckabee was quick to take a jab at Mrs. Clinton during a news  
conference with the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Giuliani) has never been here before. He's never worked here,  
he's never lived here. Today he will be announcing his candidacy 
for some significant major office in Arkansas,'' Huckabee quipped. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani had joked earlier this year about whether he should run  
for the Senate in Arkansas, and Republican leaders in Arkansas 
smelled an opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
	``The lieutenant governor and the governor called me, and so it  
developed into a fund-raiser,'' Giuliani said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton's representatives did not return a call for comment  
on Giuliani's trip, but at least one New York Democrat was not 
amused. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a cheap prank, unworthy of the mayor of the city of New  
York and a man who would be a U.S. senator,'' said Judith Hope, 
chairwoman of the New York State Democratic Committee. ``But it is 
typical of Rudy Giuliani.''

<HEADLINE> Judge: Cisneros Tapes Can Be Used </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal judge says recordings secretly made  
by former Housing Secretary Henry Cisneros' ex-mistress may be used 
at his upcoming conspiracy trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The tapes are at the heart of the independent counsel's case  
that Cisneros, while under consideration for a Cabinet post in the 
Clinton administration, conspired with one-time paramour Linda 
Jones to conceal details of his more than $250,000 in payments to 
her. 
</P>
<P>
	In his ruling Monday, U.S. District Judge Stanley Sporkin  
rejected the defense's extensive effort to throw out the tapes, 
which captured conversations in which Cisneros and Ms. Jones 
discussed the payments. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision, permitting Independent Counsel David Barrett to  
use 22 tapes in their entirety and portions of four others, settles 
the last major issue remaining before Cisneros' September trial on 
conspiracy and obstruction of justice charges. 
</P>
<P>
	He has pleaded innocent.  
</P>
<P>
	``The court finds that the vast majority of the tapes contain  
reliable and accurate representations of the conversations that 
occurred between (Ms. Jones) and Cisneros between April 1990 and 
December 1993,'' the judge wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisneros ``has presented no direct evidence that the voice on  
the tapes is not his, nor that the statements attributed to him are 
inaccurate,'' Sporkin added. 
</P>
<P>
	While allowing prosecutors the leeway to use 22 tapes in their  
entirety, Sporkin limited the use of four others, saying they bore 
signs of ``obvious alteration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During four days on the witness stand, Ms. Jones testified that  
she edited as many as 10 of the 88 tapes of her phone conversations 
with Cisneros that she later turned over to federal investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she performed the editing -- and destroyed all 88  
originals -- because she feared legal repercussions if she didn't 
delete passages in which she threatened to reveal their financial 
arrangement if Cisneros stopped paying her. She also said she 
removed some sexually suggestive passages and those dealing with 
uninvolved parties. 
</P>
<P>
	On the tapes, made as the relationship soured, Cisneros can be  
heard explaining to Ms. Jones how he had described the payments 
when he spoke to the Clinton transition team and the FBI agents 
conducting his Cabinet background check. 
</P>
<P>
	During that background check, Cisneros acknowledged giving Ms.  
Jones financial support after their extramarital affair burst into 
public view in 1988, costing her marriage and career as a political 
fund-raiser. But prosecutors contend he falsely told the FBI he 
never paid her more than $10,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
	The 18-count indictment against Cisneros alleges he paid her  
more than $264,000 between 1990 and 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jones is serving a 3 1/2-year prison sentence after she ran  
afoul of the independent counsel, in part because she 
misrepresented the tapes as unaltered originals. Now she is 
cooperating with the prosecutors who put her behind bars, hoping to 
gain a sentence reduction.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Lauds Legal Service for Poor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Even a remarkably prosperous America needs the  
dedication of lawyers who help the needy when they could make more 
money doing something else, President Clinton said Tuesday on the 
25th anniversary of a federal agency that gives free legal aide to 
the poor. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also used the celebration of the Legal Services Corp.'s  
birthday to chastise the group's congressional critics as 
shortsighted, and to laud the service of his wife, Hillary Rodham 
Clinton, as a legal aid attorney and board member of the group. 
</P>
<P>
	``You and I know there are still a lot of poor folks out  
there,'' Clinton said during an East Room salute to the 
congressionally-chartered group, which has been under annual attack 
in the Republican-led House for four years. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a need, a crying need, for the Legal Services  
Corporation,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	A House Appropriations subcommittee voted last week to roughly  
halve the Legal Service budget to $141 million. The same House 
panel also voted to halve funding last year, but that vote was 
later reversed by the full House. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency has had a rough year. In April, it admitted that a  
few regional offices had overstated their workloads. And in June, 
an independent investigation showed that the organization's five 
largest offices also reported 75,000 cases they couldn't document. 
</P>
<P>
	The Baltimore and New York City offices reported twice as many  
legal cases as they should have, according to a General Accounting 
Office report, while offices in Chicago, Los Angeles and Puerto 
Rico overstated their caseloads by small margins. 
</P>
<P>
	Cases were double-counted, cases that should have been closed  
were counted as open, and cases paid for from nonfederal sources 
were included with the federal count, the audit said. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican lawmakers asked the GAO to look into Legal Service's  
case reporting after The Associated Press reported in April that 
the agency overstated tens of thousands of cases handled in 1997. 
An AP review of five other offices among the agency's 269 regional 
programs found officials had overstated their caseload by at least 
90,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress uses the reported workload to gauge the agency's  
budget, and Republican critics said the GAO report revealed serious 
management problems or worse. 
</P>
<P>
	``LSC's waste and mismanagement are hardly cause for  
celebration,'' House Majority Leader Rep. Dick Armey said Tuesday. 
``The agency has been coy with Congress and wasted taxpayer 
money,'' Army said. 
</P>
<P>
	Agency officials say that the number of overstated cases is  
small by comparison to the millions of poor people served since the 
agency's founding. They denied the agency hid anything, and 
promised an internal review of case-reporting problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Legal Services gave $283 million in federal money to  
about 260 local affiliates to finance legal help for about 1 
million poor Americans with civil cases such as tenant problems or 
those needing protection from domestic violence.

<HEADLINE> San Diego May End Burglary Probes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Becky Wyatt awoke about dawn, checked on her  
children, then discovered that her television, camcorder, wedding 
ring, car keys and minivan were gone. 
</P>
<P>
	She did what most would, she called police. Though they  
investigated this time, they may not in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	The San Diego police are considering a stop to home burglary  
investigations unless there is a known suspect, a compelling lead 
or extensive evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	The move comes on the heels of a study showing that of the 7,000  
annual burglaries in the city, only 12 percent were solved. And few 
resulted in arrests and even fewer garnered convictions. 
</P>
<P>
	Heath Wyatt is still trying to shake that uncomfortable feeling  
that someone stole through the rooms of their house as they slept. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do think the policy change is pertinent to some  
investigations, but in our case, with the potential for violence, 
maybe it does warrant keeping it open. I want the guy caught,'' 
Wyatt told Tuesday's editions of The San Diego Union-Tribune. 
</P>
<P>
	But Police Chief Dave Bejarano said resources would be better  
spent by sending more officers to neighborhoods where drugs are 
widely sold and used, since many of the burglars are drug addicts 
trying to support their habits. 
</P>
<P>
	``By having proactive narcotics teams, we will prevent many of  
these cases from ever becoming burglaries,'' said Bejarano, who as 
a new chief is evaluating how the department uses its officers. 
</P>
<P>
	For six months, San Diego will divert about 18 burglary  
detectives to three narcotics investigation teams. If home burglary 
crimes do not substantially increase and the teams are successful 
in making more drug arrests, Bejarano could make the change 
permanent. 
</P>
<P>
	If so, San Diego would be only one of a few police departments  
in the country that no longer investigates all home burglaries. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York City Police Department is considering a similar  
step after completing a six-month study of 89,082 burglaries, which 
resulted in the arrests of only 142 people after detectives spent 
94,784 hours investigating. Only 12 went to prison. 
</P>
<P>
	San Diego Capt. John Magian said officers will still take home  
burglary reports by person or phone, but a detective won't get 
assigned to every case. 
</P>
<P>
	``If somebody violates your home, you deserve to have a police  
officer there,'' he said. ``But if somebody breaks into your garage 
and steals your barbecue or bicycle, maybe a police officer's time 
could be better spent someplace else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though the change is generally supported by officers and  
detectives, Garry Collins, president of the San Diego Police 
Officers Association, said people should be able to count on the 
police to do everything possible to get back their property. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like we're getting away from police work,'' he said. ``To  
expect the cases to come all signed, sealed and delivered, it's 
like cherry picking, you only take the ones that are handed to you. 
What if they did that with rapes?''

<HEADLINE> McGwire Hits 37th, Passes Gehrig </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Mark McGwire hit his 37th homer in the  
first inning of the St. Louis Cardinals' game Tuesday against the 
San Francisco Giants, taking the major league lead for the first 
time since opening day. 
</P>
<P>
	The solo homer moved him one past Sammy Sosa, whose Chicago Cubs  
played Tuesday night at Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire's 10th homer in his last 13 games, a 407-foot shot over  
the left-field bleachers, moved him past Lou Gehrig into sole 
possession of 16th place on the career list with 494 home runs. 
McGwire had tied Gehrig with a three-run homer Monday night against 
the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
	With 256 homers since the start of the 1995 season, McGwire  
matched Babe Ruth's record for most homers in five consecutive 
seasons. Ruth hit 256 in 1926-30.

<P>
	McGwire homered on opening day, but had not led the majors in  
homers since the second day of the season.

<HEADLINE> Ryan Leaf Likely Gone for Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- There's no way Ryan Leaf will match the 15  
interceptions and 39.0 rating from his disastrous rookie season. 
</P>
<P>
	That's because he's not expected to throw a pass in 1999 after  
undergoing surgery Monday to repair a tear in his throwing 
shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	The second-year quarterback could be ready to play in 3-4 months  
if his rehabilitation goes well, but the Chargers aren't inclined 
to keep a roster spot open for him that long. Leaf, who dropped all 
the way to third string by the start of training camp, is expected 
to be put on the injured reserve list sometime before the season 
starts. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't made the decision, but it's likely we'll go to  
IR,'' general manager Bobby Beathard said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a long time, and to carry a guy that long on  
the roster is unlikely,'' said coach Mike Riley, who already is 
anticipating tough decisions on how many players to carry at 
running back, fullback and tight end. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaf hurt his right shoulder diving on a fumble during a  
voluntary workout in June. He aggravated it throwing a deep pass 
during the first few minutes of the opening practice of training 
camp on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	During Monday's 30-minute arthroscopic surgery, team doctors  
used three tacks to repair the torn labrum, trainer James Collins 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Riley said Leaf needs to be consistent in his rehabilitation.  
Veteran quarterback Erik Kramer, signed by the Chargers on 
Thursday, had a similar injury last year and said the rehab was 
grueling. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaf hasn't proven to be reliable during his brief, stormy NFL  
career. He supposedly fell asleep in team meetings last year, and 
caused grumbling among his teammates when, despite his atrocious 
rookie season, he skipped the first three days of the voluntary 
workouts in June to play in some charity golf tournaments. He also 
skipped some special passing drills Riley set up. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's young, so that's going to be another part of the learning  
process of being a pro athlete,'' Riley said. ``It takes a lot of 
self-discipline, and Ryan's young and is learning how to do that. 
So we obviously have to help him with that as far as staying on top 
of it ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if you're gone for three weeks, guys lose track of what  
they're doing, and then when they come back, it's like, `You should 
know that.' But it's not that easy when they're not physically a 
part of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Collins said Leaf will have to wear a sling for two weeks and  
then will be able to begin his rehab. He won't begin throwing until 
at least a couple months into rehab. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaf, given an $11.25 million signing bonus after being taken as  
the second pick overall in the 1998 draft, was benched after nine 
starts. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, defensive end Israel Ifeanyichukwu is scheduled for  
surgery Tuesday to repair torn cartilage and a partially torn 
anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee. He was hurt in 
Saturday's practice and will be gone for the season.

<HEADLINE> IOC Hires Ad Agency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Looking to strengthen its image for the 2000  
Sydney Games, the International Olympic Committee has hired an 
advertising agency to develop spots that will focus on athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	The ads by the Los Angeles firm TBWA/Chiat Day will begin  
running in January in TV, print and online outlets. The agency also 
works for clients like Nissan cars and the ABC television network. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC is coming off the worst scandal in the history of the  
games in which six of its members were expelled and four resigned. 
</P>
<P>
	However, IOC marketing director Michael Payne said Monday the  
advertising plans were in place before the scandal broke. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has nothing to do with earlier issues of this year,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Payne did not say how much the ad campaign cost but added that  
reports of $150 million are not far off. 
</P>
<P>
	``Indirectly, it will be of that value or even greater,'' he  
said. ``But we're not spending any money buying air time. It will 
be a very affordable investment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Olympic media outlets, in the United States and elsewhere, will  
not be charging the IOC additional fees to run the promotions. 
</P>
<P>
	``In addition to the rights fee they pay, a certain amount of  
promotional time was included,'' Payne said.

<HEADLINE> House OKs Rules, Regulations Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House of Representatives wants more  
information on how an estimated $700 billion is spent every year to 
comply with federal rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``Americans deserve to know where their hard-earned tax dollars  
are going, and this bill will provide that information,'' said 
House Commerce Committee Chairman Tom Bliley, R-Va., chief sponsor 
of a measure passed Monday, 254-157. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration and most Democrats oppose the  
measure, saying the benefits of federal health and safety rules are 
difficult to quantify and the bill would put unneeded new burdens 
on federal agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	It requires the director of the Office of Management and Budget  
to submit to Congress an annual analysis of the impact of federal 
rules and paperwork on both the public and private sector. 
</P>
<P>
	The costs and benefits of each agency and agency program rule  
must be specified and the OMB must include a report on duplications 
and inconsistencies. The bill would write into permanent law 
analysis requirements included in the last several budgets. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration issued a statement saying it already requires  
cost-benefit analyses for major rules and that the bill, by 
demanding analyses of each government program, ``would crowd out 
other priorities and would add little value in many cases.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill awaits Senate consideration.  
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Suit Begins Against Fugitive Ex-Guru </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A wrongful-death trial opened Tuesday for a  
former counterculture guru who killed his girlfriend and stuffed 
her in a trunk in 1977, then fled to France before he went on 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Ira Einhorn, 58, was not in court for opening arguments in the  
civil lawsuit, and there was no one to defend him. He is free in 
France while he appeals a French court's decision that he should be 
extradited to the United States for a criminal trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The family of Helen ``Holly'' Maddux is suing Einhorn to prevent  
him from profiting from any books or movies about the case. Miss 
Maddux was bludgeoned to death in 1977, and her remains were found 
18 months later in a closet in Einhorn's apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	Einhorn fled the United States in 1981 shortly before he was to  
go on trial. He was convicted in absentia of murder in 1993 and 
sentenced to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	James R. Beasley, an attorney for the Maddux family, said  
Einhorn's refusal to answer any legal papers, including a request 
that he either admit or deny that he killed Miss Maddux, was 
equivalent to an admission of liability, which the court accepted. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury will consider whether to award damages.  
</P>
<P>
	A prominent antiwar activist in the 1960s who once ran for mayor  
of Philadelphia, Einhorn spent 16 years in hiding before he was 
arrested in 1997 at his home in the French countryside. 
</P>
<P>
	A court refused to extradite him because French law does not  
allow for trial without the defendant being present. After 
Pennsylvania passed a law promising a retrial, Einhorn was 
re-arrested in September 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, a French court ordered him extradited provided that  
he be retried and not face the death penalty. He is appealing that 
order.

<HEADLINE> At the Movies: 'The Dinner Game' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Better pay attention, because the jokes in ``The Dinner Game''  
come as quick as volleys at the French Open. 
</P>
<P>
	The biting comedy, one of the highest grossing films in French  
history, is fast-paced, lighthearted fun. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the ending is as message-laden as an after-school  
special, everything up until then is so amusing, such preachiness 
is forgivable. 
</P>
<P>
	Set in Paris, ``The Dinner Game'' (``Le Diner de Cons'') is  
about an arrogant, rich yuppie who engages in a cruel competition 
with his equally obnoxious friends. They hunt for the biggest 
idiots they can find and invite them to dinner parties simply to 
make fun of them. 
</P>
<P>
	Pierre Brochant (Thierry Lhermitte), a handsome, golf-playing  
publisher, thinks he's found ``a world champion'' in Francois 
Pignon (Jacques Villeret), a short, balding, overweight accountant 
who toils in the lower ranks of the Financial Ministry. Picture a 
French version of Danny DeVito. 
</P>
<P>
	But Pignon springs to life and his blue eyes twinkle when he  
talks about his beloved hobby: He builds models of famous monuments 
using matchsticks. He's more than happy to discuss how many 
matchsticks and tubes of glue it took to build his tiny Eiffel 
Tower -- if anyone can stay awake long enough to listen. 
</P>
<P>
	Pignon is kind and he means well, though. When he goes to  
Brochant's lavish apartment for drinks before the big dinner, he 
tries his hardest to help Brochant through a series of sticky 
situations -- with disastrous results. 
</P>
<P>
	Brochant's pretty, blond wife Christine (Alexandra Vandernoot),  
sick of her husband's thoughtless game and his philandering, dumps 
him on the answering machine for Pignon to hear. Pignon, who 
fancies himself a crafty thinker, tries to persuade Christine to 
come back but ends up insulting her and encouraging Brochant's 
clingy mistress, Marlene (Catherine Frot). 
</P>
<P>
	When Pignon offers to help find Christine, he ends up inviting  
over his co-worker, a ruthless tax investigator who is suspicious 
of Brochant's beautiful -- and undeclared -- art works. 
</P>
<P>
	The movie's moral is obvious from the start, and it's clear that  
the smug Brochant is the real idiot and will get what's coming to 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately, ``The Dinner Game'' relies on basic and somewhat  
hackneyed tenets of comedy for laughs -- mistaken identity, plays on 
words and over-the-top physical humor. But because the film is 
funny and well-intentioned, it's easy to overlook these 
shortcomings. 
</P>
<P>
	Lhermitte and Villeret have great chemistry. The scenes in which  
the two spar with words are a joy to watch. 
</P>
<P>
	The supporting cast is strong with terrific comedic timing,  
notably Daniel Prevost as the tax inspector and Francis Huster as 
Brochant's buddy who gets caught in the elaborate plot to find 
Christine. 
</P>
<P>
	But the script from writer-director Francis Veber is the real  
star. Veber, who wrote ``La Cage aux Folles'' in 1978, got the idea 
for this film from a real game played in Paris. He thought it would 
be fun to make life miserable for one of these egotistical jerks, 
and the revenge he creates in ``The Dinner Game'' is hilarious. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Dinner Game,'' a Lions Gate Films release, is in French  
with English subtitles. The film was nominated for six Cesar awards 
(the French equivalent of the Oscar) including best picture, and 
won Cesars for best screenplay, best actor for Villeret and best 
supporting actor for Prevost. It runs 80 minutes and is rated 
PG-13.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Wins Bronze in Gymnastics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Gymnastics ended with another tough  
night for the U.S. women at the Pan American Games. 
</P>
<P>
	After winning the gold and bronze medals in the all-around  
competition, the United States managed only one medal in the 
individual events Tuesday night, a bronze by Morgan White in the 
uneven bars. 
</P>
<P>
	Another medal hopeful for the United States, Jennie Thompson,  
injured her ankle in the vault, the first event, and had to scratch 
from the bars and floor exercise. 
</P>
<P>
	White had won the gold medal in the all-around on Sunday night  
and Thompson the bronze. But on this night, the Canadians turned in 
the most spectacular performances and delighted a crowd of 6,116 by 
winning three of the four gold medals. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada, which had edged the favored United States for the team  
title on Saturday, got golds from Yvonne Tousek in the uneven bars 
and floor exercise and Lise Leveille on the balance beam. Cuba's 
Arazay Jova won the gold in the vault. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other Canadians won silver medals, Julie Beaulieu in the  
bars and Michelle Conway in floor exercise. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a really strong team right now, a lot of team spirit,  
and the crowd was just amazing,'' Tousek said. ``They not only 
cheered for the Canadians, but for all the performers. There was so 
much energy in the building. It really helped our performances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. men did not medal at all in competition dominated by  
Cubans, who claimed four of the six gold medals. 
</P>
<P>
	White, at 16 the youngest member of the U.S. women's team,  
scored 9.537 on the bars to trail Tousek (9.662) and Beaulieu 
(9.60). She was fourth in the floor exercise and fifth in the vault 
but still left the Winnipeg Arena with a smile -- and a bouquet for 
earning a medal. 
</P>
<P>
	Her floor exercise score of 9.687 had her in third place until  
Tousek, the next-to-last competitor, scored a 9.712. Fans clapped 
rhythmically while the scores on Tousek's routine were tallied and 
the crowd roared when her score was flashed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was hoping to medal in both events,'' White said. ``I  
thought I did a really good routine. I was very consistent the 
whole meet. I had no falls. I feel really proud.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The downer for White was seeing Thompson hurt her left ankle on  
her second vault landing. Thompson was to have X-rays on the ankle, 
U.S. coach Mary Lee Tracy said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was really hard,'' White said. ``She's my teammate. It's  
almost like me getting injured. I pray she'll be OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tracy said White, one of the up-and-comers in U.S. gymnastics,  
showed she has the potential to make the Olympic team. White had 
the second-best all-around score during the team competition before 
winning the all-around the following night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Morgan did a great job,'' Tracy said. ``She has to concentrate  
on getting some bigger skills and learning some new things, but the 
biggest thing is she made a statement in an international meet that 
she is a contender and a competitor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All-around champion Eric Lopez of Cuba took three golds in the  
men's individual, winning the pommel horse, rings and parallel 
bars. He was the silver medalist on the high bar. Teammate Abel 
Driggs won the vault and finished third in the parallel bars. 
</P>
<P>
	The other gold medals went to Canada's Alexander Jeltkov on the  
high bar and Argentina's Eric Pedercini in the floor exercise. 
</P>
<P>
	The top U.S. finishers were Michael Dutka, fifth in the floor  
exercise, and Stephen McCain, fifth in the rings.

<HEADLINE> Man Gets Rights to Rocket Belt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Fed up with years of stalling, a judge today  
granted an aviation enthusiast the rights to a one-man rocket belt, 
awarded him more than $10 million in damages and ordered the belt 
returned to him. 
</P>
<P>
	Trouble is, no one has seen the contraption since 1995. And one  
of the defendants was beaten to death shortly before a trial was to 
have begun. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Stanley won the default judgment today from State District  
Judge John T. Wooldridge at the end of a two-day trial. No one 
appeared to present a defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanley, of Houston, contended his former American Rocket Belt  
Corp. partner, Brad Barker, and Joe Wright, a Barker associate who 
provided office space for the fledgling outfit, bilked him out of 
the company and the belt in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm relieved this is over with,'' Stanley said after the  
ruling. ``Hopefully, this will exert public pressure on them to 
finally return the belt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barker, who has not responded to the lawsuit since giving a  
deposition in 1996, did not attend the trial. Wright was bludgeoned 
to death on July 16, 1998, 11 days before the trial was supposed to 
begin. 
</P>
<P>
	The RB-2000 rocket belt was one of only three such devices  
operational in the world. In its first and last public flight, in 
1995, a test pilot strapped it on, shot into the air and flew over 
the Houston Ship Channel for 28 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Then one of the developers put it in his trailer and drove off.  
</P>
<P>
	Stanley and Wright's attorney, Ronald Bass, have said Wright  
agreed to try to find out from Barker where the belt was in 
exchange for getting out of the lawsuit. He was killed shortly 
thereafter; no one was been charged. Barker was questioned but 
never charged and he vehemently denies the slaying had anything to 
do with the belt. 
</P>
<P>
	The size of a bulky backpack and weighing 120 pounds when  
fueled, the belt has two tanks filled with hydrogen peroxide and a 
third containing nitrogen. When the throttle is opened, a 
high-pressure stream blasts out two nozzles, providing the lifting 
thrust. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell Aircraft first developed the device in the early 1960s for  
the Defense Department, which wanted a rocket to improve soldiers' 
mobility. But its fuel capacity allowed for only a 20-second 
flight, making it impractical. 
</P>
<P>
	Others, like Barker, were intrigued and dreamed of building  
their own machine. He enlisted the help of Stanley, an old 
acquaintance, pilot and aeronautics buff. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright, a friend of Barker's who owned a car audio shop in  
Houston, offered them space at his business to build the belt with 
the understanding that rent would be paid after the rocket belt 
became successful. 
</P>
<P>
	In November 1994, the belt was ready for test flights, but  
suspicion already hung over the project. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanley believed Barker had been charging him at least twice  
what the parts and machinery cost and pocketing whatever money was 
left over. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanley confronted Barker. A fight broke out, and Barker beat  
his partner with a 4-pound hammer. Both men were charged with 
assault, though the charges against Stanley were dropped. Barker 
was convicted and placed on probation. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright quickly placed a lien on the rocket belt, claiming  
Stanley owed him back rent. Stanley never saw the belt again. 
</P>
<P>
	After that test flight, Barker put it in his trailer and drove  
away. 
</P>
<P>
	Barker hasn't said whether he still has the belt.  
</P>
<P>
	``I could tell you yes, I could tell you no,'' he told The  
Associated Press in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanley, who believes the device ``conservatively'' would  
command $500,000 a year in rentals, says he's still willing to cut 
Barker in if he relinquishes the belt. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanley doubts Barker has sold or destroyed the contraption.  
</P>
<P>
	``He worships that belt,'' he said. ``It's his golden calf.''  
</P>
<P>
	Stanley is seeking reimbursement for the rental value of the  
rocket belt since December 1994 -- an estimated $500,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
	But Stanley says all he really wants is the rocket belt back.

Championship) to survive. Women's golf does not have the luxury of 
a $136 million TV contract, nor does it have the backing of 
entities like Augusta National Golf Club, the Royal &AMP; Ancient or 
the PGA of America. 
</P>
<P>
	But the issue of sponsorship for the LPGA's final major, which  
starts Thursday outside Calgary, is a little more delicate. 
</P>
<P>
	The du Maurier, which is sponsored by a tobacco company, could  
be headed for extinction in two years because of antitobacco 
legislation in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be disastrous for the players to lose this,'' Laura  
Davies said. 
</P>
<P>
	Juli Inkster, a 39-year-old mother of two daughters, says the du  
Maurier is one of her favorite stops -- a tour of Canada's 
magnificent golf courses in a family atmosphere unlike any other on 
the LPGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would really hate to lose it,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	LPGA commissioner Ty Votaw walks a fine line in his discussions  
of the du Maurier. Parent company Imperial Tobacco has been a loyal 
sponsor of women's golf and is one reason for the recent boom north 
of the border. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Votaw must be prepared to find another major  
championship if du Maurier has to bail out. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't made any plans beyond 2000,'' Votaw said. ``To do  
so would be disrespectful to du Maurier and what they're done for 
us and golf throughout Canada.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Du Maurier's support goes beyond its 14-year sponsorship of an  
LPGA major. 
</P>
<P>
	Lorie Kane is her first victory away from joining the LPGA's  
elite. She is third on the money list with $567,737 and has a 
million-dollar smile that has made her one of the most popular 
players on tour. A.J. Eathorne was the top player out of LPGA 
qualifying school in October. She is third in the rookie of the 
year standings and 54th on the money list with $123,159. 
</P>
<P>
	Without the company's annual $500,000 commitment to the du  
Maurier Series developmental tour in Canada, chances are neither of 
them would be pursuing a career in golf. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, it's a health issue and an emotional issue,'' Kane said.  
``But as a golfer, I look at the positive things they do for the 
tour. The du Maurier people have been great to me -- they're a big 
reason I'm out here. It would be a real shame for them to lose 
this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, the implications of tobacco sponsorship cannot be  
ignored. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the five straight tournaments Nancy Lopez won as a  
21-year-old rookie in 1978 was the Kent-sponsored Golden Lights 
Championship. That prompted some fans to tell her they were 
surprised to learn she smoked. She didn't. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess that can happen,'' Lopez said. Still, she wants to see  
the du Maurier continue beyond 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The du Maurier got a slight reprieve last year when Canadian  
health officials ordered a five-year transition period for the 1997 
ban to take effect. After 2000, tobacco sponsors can advertise only 
on site, and their name can appear only on the bottom 10 percent of 
signs the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
	``If nothing changes ... bleak,'' du Maurier spokesman Michel  
Descoteaux said when asked about the future of the company's 
sponsorship. ``No final decisions have been made. Frankly, it is 
difficult to imagine how we could remain associated. This is the 
reason you sponsor an event, to be seen doing it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For all the good it has meant to women's golf, the  
legislation-driven demise of du Maurier could be a blessing in the 
long run. 
</P>
<P>
	If du Maurier thinks it can no longer get value from virtually  
invisible sponsorship after 2000, the LPGA thinks it can find 
another corporation to sponsor a tour event in Canada, in which 
case the tour could be tobacco free. 
</P>
<P>
	The most likely replacement as the fourth major would be the  
Women's British Open, which is quickly gaining prestige by going to 
courses like Royal Lytham &AMP; St. Annes and Royal Birkdale. 
</P>
<P>
	Sure, that would give women's golf another major with a title  
sponsor -- Weetabix, a cereal company -- but not one that creates so 
much controversy.

<HEADLINE> Rocket Belt Designer Wins $10M Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- An entrepreneur who says a partner stole his Buck  
Rogers-style rocket belt won $10 million Tuesday and a judge's 
order demanding the return of the contraption, whose whereabouts 
have been a mystery since 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling came after a four-year dispute among three former  
business partners, one of whom was bludgeoned to death. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, this will exert public pressure on them to finally  
return the belt,'' said Larry Stanley, designer of the contraption. 
</P>
<P>
	The strap-on rocket belt hasn't been seen publicly since  
Stanley's partner Brad Barker drove off with it after a 20-second 
demonstration flight in Houston four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Barker did not mount a defense during the 1 1/2-day trial. State  
District Judge John T. Wooldridge awarded Stanley four times more 
than he asked for. 
</P>
<P>
	After learning of the verdict, Barker denied having the rocket  
belt and said: ``Even if I had it, I would smash it into a million 
... pieces with a road grader.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The RB-2000 rocket belt, a hydrogen peroxide-powered backpack,  
is thought to be one of only two or three such devices operational 
in the world. Its developers said similar devices have been rented 
out for $25,000 for 20-second flights at exhibitions, concerts and 
other events. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanley also sued his partner Joe Wright to get the rocket belt  
back, but Wright was bludgeoned to death last year. Barker was 
questioned but never charged and has vehemently denied any 
involvement. 
</P>
<P>
	Barker said he wasn't even aware of the trial until he read the  
newspaper Tuesday morning.

<HEADLINE> Trooper Says he Warned Sharpe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREELEY, Colo. (AP) -- A state trooper says he let Shannon Sharpe  
off with a warning for speeding, and not because he plays for the 
Denver Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
	``I stopped 15 cars that day, and only gave five tickets, so I  
gave a lot of warnings,'' said Don Nadow, a trooper with the 
Colorado State Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharpe said he received a speeding ticket on U.S. 85 Friday  
while driving to training camp at the University of Northern 
Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	But Nadow said the tight end was going about 75 mph in a 65 mph  
zone and received only a warning. 
</P>
<P>
	Broncos defensive lineman Trevor Pryce wasn't so lucky. Nadow  
said he gave Pryce a ticket Friday for making several lane changes 
without signaling. 
</P>
<P>
	Nadow also stopped Terrell Davis that day because he did not  
have a front license plate. The MVP running back was given a 
warning. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharpe was not at training camp Tuesday because of the death of  
his nephew.

<HEADLINE> Democrats Victorious on Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Democrats knocked four provisions they  
considered anti-environmental out of a spending bill Tuesday, 
including one that would have blocked the Interior Department from 
raising royalties paid to the government by oil companies drilling 
on federal land. 
</P>
<P>
	But their victories seemed temporary as the mostly Western and  
pro-industry proponents of the blocked amendments planned to 
reintroduce at least some of them -- including the oil royalties 
measure -- in slightly different form. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not over till it's over,'' said Senate Appropriations  
Committee Chairman Ted Stevens, R-Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
	And in a victory for the mining industry, Sens. Harry Reid,  
D-Nev., and Larry Craig, R-Idaho, killed an effort by Sen. Patty 
Murray, D-Wash., and others to leave intact an Interior Department 
ruling that limits the size of the waste sites many hard-rock 
mining companies can establish on federal lands they use. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote against Murray's proposal was 55-41. That, in effect,  
left alive language by Craig that would block the Interior 
Department ruling, a victory for hundreds of gold and other 
hard-rock mines in the West. 
</P>
<P>
	The House-passed version of the bill would require adherence to  
the 1997 Interior Department ruling, which limits the size of the 
waste dumps to five acres per 20-acre claim. That leaves the final 
status of the ruling uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
	The action came on a $14.1 billion measure financing the  
Interior Department and several smaller agencies for the coming 
fiscal year. The Senate seemed unlikely to complete the measure 
until at least next week, because senators are expected to use the 
rest of this week debating a proposed Republican tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
	White House aides have threatened a veto of the overall bill  
because it would cut spending for park land purchases, cultural 
programs and other programs below the levels President Clinton 
wants. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, they object that eight other provisions they  
consider anti-environmental -- including the mining language -- 
remain in the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Ironically, Democrats were able to strip the four provisions  
from the bill -- all sponsored by Republicans -- by using a Senate 
rule that Republicans managed to reinstate only Monday. That rule 
makes it easier to kill language in spending bills that changes 
law. 
</P>
<P>
	Removed from the bill were provisions prohibiting the  
reintroduction of grizzly bears to federal lands in Idaho and 
Montana; blocking new energy efficiency rules for federal agencies; 
allowing lead mining to continue in the Mark Twain National Forest 
in Missouri; and the oil royalty language. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, a sponsor of the oil royalty  
provision, said she would reintroduce it later and expected to 
prevail. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of sentiment that if there's going to be a tax  
increase (on the oil industry), Congress should decide it and not a 
federal agency,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Her language would delay for the fourth time proposed changes in  
how much in royalties oil companies must pay the government. 
</P>
<P>
	The Interior Department proposal would base the royalties on the  
oil's market value, instead of today's system that uses a lesser 
value. Blocking the change would save oil companies $68 million in 
taxes next year, federal officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, House-Senate negotiators agreed on an $8.4 billion  
measure for next year's military construction projects. The mostly 
uncontroversial bill would be the first of the 13 annual spending 
bills ready for final House and Senate approval. 
</P>
<P>
	And the House approved, 420-8, a $20.2 billion measure financing  
energy and water projects. The administration has threatened to 
veto it because it contains language they say would threaten 
wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure would also withhold $1 billion from the Energy  
Department until Congress restructures the department's nuclear 
weapons program. The proposal is in response to recent revelations 
of Chinese spying at U.S. nuclear weapons labs.

<HEADLINE> Agent Says Nailon Is Innocent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FOREST HILL, Texas (AP) -- The agent for Charlotte Hornets draft  
pick Lee Nailon says his client is innocent of drug possession and 
evading arrest charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Fox said the 24-year-old former Texas Christian star  
simply was in the wrong place at the wrong time when he was 
arrested Saturday at a suburban Fort Worth hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the case is being blown out of proportion,'' Fox said.  
``Lee wasn't smoking anything. All they're basically saying is that 
Lee was there. There isn't much meat on the bones here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nailon, the Hornets' second-round choice last month, was with  
TCU running back LaDainian Tomlinson and another friend, Leroy 
Nesbitt III, at a Comfort Inn in Forest Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	Police arrested the three after finding between two and four  
ounces of marijuana and other paraphernalia in their second-floor 
room. They were released Sunday after posting $1,500 bond apiece.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Won't Block Rights Criticism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- Cuba decided Tuesday to back away from its plans  
to ask the U.N. Human Rights Commission to refrain from discussing 
the situation in Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	The human rights commission voted in April to condemn Cuba's  
rights record. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba had planned to submit a text to the U.N. Economic and  
Social Council, which oversees the commission, ``noting the intense 
debate and polarization'' caused by this year's debate and calling 
for an end to the criticism. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials were uncertain what effect Cuba's request might have  
had. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba said its decision was a sign of flexibility in the face of  
other countries' misgivings. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has led action to condemn Cuba in previous  
years. Last year, a U.S. motion was narrowly defeated for the first 
time since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba has faced renewed criticism for a new law aimed at  
independent journalists that seeks to punish those who undertake 
acts deemed to further aggressive U.S. policies toward Cuba, such 
as the long-standing embargo. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's resolution at the human rights commission also noted  
the March conviction of four Cuban dissidents on charges of 
furthering U.S. policies against the communist country. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba has long denied that it violates human rights, saying its  
free health and education provide better care and show more respect 
for human rights than those of other countries.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Will Respect, Not Fear, Brazil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GUADALAJARA, Mexico (AP) -- Insisting last year's game is a  
distant memory, U.S. coach Bruce Arena wants to take a realistic 
approach to the showdown with Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously it's a great challenge playing against the best team  
in the world,'' he said. ``We don't have fear. We have great 
respect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The teams meet Wednesday night in the FIFA Confederations Cup,  
their first encounter since the United States beat Brazil 1-0 last 
year in the CONCACAF Gold Cup, the championship of soccer's North 
and Central American and Caribbean region. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've never discussed that game,'' Arena said. ``That was a  
long time ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In that game, goalkeeper Kasey Keller was a barrier in what  
Brazilian forward Rivaldo called the best performance by a 
goalkeeper he had ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether Keller, who will probably start Wednesday, still  
knew how to stop Brazil, Arena said, ``No goalkeeper knows how to 
stop Brazil.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Brazilians said Tuesday they are concerned about the U.S.  
team's defense and expect the Americans to be fast and mark 
closely. Brazil coach Wanderley Luxemburgo said his strategy will 
be to ``mark them before they can mark us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good team that knows how to close down the opponent,''  
star forward Ronaldinho said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the players had seen some of the last U.S.-Brazil game,  
and the coach had told them about Brazil's mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll try to do on offense what we didn't do last time,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brazilians do not anticipate a repeat performance from  
Keller. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a good goalie,'' said Brazil's reserve goalkeeper,  
Marcos. ``But Brazil and the United States have played many times. 
The United States won once and they were lucky to get that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the Brazilian players have a lot of respect for the  
up-and-coming American team. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every year they're getting better in general terms,'' team  
captain Emerson said. ``United States, Nigeria, Japan -- you see a 
lot of the national teams are evolving. The United States is one of 
them. They're growing a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Brazilian team came to the Confederations Cup without many  
of its big stars. Much of the attention has been focused on 
Ronaldinho, a 19-year-old forward who many see as the future of 
Brazilian soccer and whom Luxemburgo said he sees as a son. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I was 10 my dad drowned,'' Ronaldinho said. ``I always  
think about him when I play. He's always in my prayers. I wish he 
could see me play.''

<HEADLINE>  Cadillac Facing Bumpy Road </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCHESTER, Mich. (AP) -- Cadillac's redesigned DeVille sedan is  
loaded with technological innovations for 2000, but analysts say 
the General Motors Corp. division needs to do much more to regain 
the luxury sales title it lost last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Cadillac's share of the U.S. luxury market fell to just under 16  
percent last year from its peak of 51 percent in 1976, according to 
Autofacts. It has been a victim of foreign competition and its 
failure to offer a luxury sport utility vehicle until recently. 
</P>
<P>
	``As their market share declines, the task of rebuilding it  
becomes more and more difficult,'' said independent analyst Susan 
Jacobs, who studies the luxury market. ``Cadillac's not accustomed 
to getting lost in the crowd, which is what it faces in today's 
luxury car market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cadillac's recent efforts to lure crowds of younger buyers to  
its showrooms have not been successful: Sales of the imported 
Catera entry-level sedan have been a disappointment, while demand 
for the larger Seville, redesigned for the '98 model year, was down 
23 percent in the first half of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Its late entry in the luxury sport utility vehicle segment, the  
Escalade, is little more than a gussied-up GMC Denali with a larger 
price tag. GM executives admit they underestimated the demand for 
big-ticket SUVs. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year ended with the ultimate humiliation for Cadillac: It  
lost the U.S. luxury sales crown it held for 48 years to rival Ford 
Motor Co.'s Lincoln division. 
</P>
<P>
	Through the first half of this year, Cadillac's U.S. car sales  
declined 15 percent while overall luxury car sales increased 7 
percent. Including SUV sales, Cadillac now trails Lexus, 
Mercedes-Benz and BMW -- all of which are benefitting from fresher, 
more innovative models. 
</P>
<P>
	Against this backdrop, Cadillac unveiled the 2000 DeVille on  
Tuesday. The DeVille, in its 50th year, is a key model for 
Cadillac: It has been the top-selling luxury car in the United 
States for 14 straight years. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2000 DeVille is full of new technology that Cadillac hopes  
will lure Lexus, BMW and Mercedes-Benz drivers. Top on the list is 
the optional ``night vision'' infrared system that alerts the 
driver to hazards well beyond the range of the car's headlights. 
The car also is available with ultrasonic sensors in the rear 
bumper that will warn the driver of obstacles while backing up. 
</P>
<P>
	The night vision option will be priced between $1,000 and  
$1,500; list prices for the new DeVille, which goes on sale in the 
fall, are expected to be close to the current model's range of 
$38,500 to $44,500. 
</P>
<P>
	Slightly shorter and slimmer than its predecessor, the new  
DeVille borrows styling cues from the smaller Seville but still 
retains the conservative, big-sedan look that distinguishes it as 
an American luxury car. 
</P>
<P>
	That's the problem, critics say. Cadillac tried hard not to  
offend its loyal customers, who are getting older and fewer, while 
betting the new technology would impress younger buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The DeVille looks too much toward yesterday and not enough  
toward Cadillac's future,'' Jacobs said. ``It's an evolution in the 
right direction, but it's still grounded on the demands of their 
traditional buyers. The concept, the size, the look is still the 
traditional look of Cadillac.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Hall, an analyst with AutoPacific Inc., said the new DeVille  
is intended to compete more with the Lincoln Town Car than the 
Mercedes S-class. With its bigger trunk and rear seating, it may 
steal some Lincoln customers and a piece of the stretch-limo 
business that the Town Car has owned for years. 
</P>
<P>
	The new DeVille will make more money for GM even if sales stay  
flat, because of cost savings designed into the car, said analyst 
Alan Baum of IRN Inc. As GM has replaced old models, it has made 
the new ones easier to build, with fewer parts, and has increased 
the number of models built off common ``platforms'' -- the chassis 
and major mechanical parts. 
</P>
<P>
	The DeVille is built from the same platform as the Seville,  
Pontiac Bonneville, Buick Park Avenue, Buick LeSabre and Oldsmobile 
Aurora. 
</P>
<P>
	Cadillac executives are looking to 2001 and beyond for the  
models they hope will finally restore the marque's prominence. The 
later models will be based on Caddy's new ``art and science'' 
styling theme evident in the edgy Evoq roadster concept car on 
display at this year's major auto shows. 
</P>
<P>
	The first evidence of that will show up in the redesigned  
Escalade, which will debut in 2001 for Cadillac's centennial model 
year of 2002. That will be followed by a redesigned Catera, an 
all-new, car-based SUV that's smaller than the Escalade, the next 
generation Seville that will return to a traditional rear-drive 
setup, and the limited-production Evoq. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem is Cadillac needs those models now.  
</P>
<P>
	``The delay in transforming their lineup is costing them  
business long-term'' Jacobs said. ``They are coming too late to 
make Cadillac stand out from the crowd and sustain a leading 
position in luxury.''

<HEADLINE> Consumer Confidence Falls in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Consumer confidence declined in July, the first  
dip this year after eight months of consecutive gains that had 
pushed it to a 30-year high, the Conference Board reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The private business group's index of consumer confidence, which  
measures consumers' propensity to spend, declined 3.4 points to 
135.6, from 139.0 in June. Analysts had not been expecting so big a 
drop. 
</P>
<P>
	The dip in confidence may reflect concerns about higher interest  
rates, tighter credit and less rosy job prospects, said Lynn 
Franco, associate director of the board's consumer research center. 
</P>
<P>
	In a pre-emptive strike against inflation, Federal Reserve  
policy-makers increased interest rates modestly in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan signaled last week that the Fed is  
ready to nudge rates even higher if the economy shows signs of 
overheating, something that has sent stock averages retreating from 
all-time highs. Although economists said today that a tightening of 
credit in August was still possible, the report was an indicator 
the Fed's move may have cooled sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
	The report ``probably does indicate that the consumer is going  
to be a little bit more cautious. Even the good economy and low 
unemployment rate has become old hat,'' said Donald Ratajczak, 
director of economic forecasting at Georgia State University. 
</P>
<P>
	Franco said the decline in the confidence index in July ``does  
not suggest a long-term erosion in consumer optimism,'' adding 
that, ``like the stock market, even today's gung-ho consumers need 
resting periods.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With index readings well over 100, Franco said there is ``plenty  
of strength left in the economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer sentiment is an important economic indicator since  
consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of the nation's overall 
economic activity. 
</P>
<P>
	The consumer confidence report could signal that the economy is  
slowing from its torrid growth in the past few months. It came as 
the stock and bond markets were in a swoon over prospects that the 
Fed would again raise rates at its next policy committee meeting on 
August 24 in a bid to prevent inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks were up today even before the figures came out as traders  
sought bargains after the recent selloff, and the market's gains 
widened into the afternoon. The Dow industrials were up 115 points 
and heading back toward 11,000 by early afternoon. The Dow reached 
an all-time high of 11,209.84 on July 16. 
</P>
<P>
	The Conference Board's expectations index, which measures  
confidence in the economy's future, declined to 107.0 in July from 
114.9 in June. However, the group's ``present situation index,'' 
which measures current confidence, rose to 178.7 from 175.0. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers' assessment of current conditions improved with an  
increase in the proportion of respondents rating business 
conditions as ``good'' and a slight drop in the percentage saying 
jobs are hard to find. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, consumers' outlook six months from now was much less  
optimistic than in the previous survey. The percentage of 
respondents anticipating a pickup in business conditions dropped, 
as did the percentage of consumers expecting more jobs to be 
available in the coming months and the proportion anticipating 
gains in come. 
</P>
<P>
	The consumer confidence survey is based on a poll of 5,000  
households conducted by NFO Research Inc. of Greenwich, Conn.

<HEADLINE> China Minister Criticizes Nations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SINGAPORE (AP) -- In an apparent reference to the NATO bombing of  
Yugoslavia, China's foreign minister today criticized countries 
that bypass the United Nations and ``bully'' others in the name of 
human rights. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said the United 
States is no bully. 
</P>
<P>
	Addressing diplomats from 20 countries at a meeting sponsored by  
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, Tang Jiaxuan spoke 
against what he said was large powers' violation of smaller 
nations' sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
	``The claims such as `the supremacy of human rights over  
sovereignty' and `there is no national boundary in safeguarding 
human rights' are in essence excuses for strong countries to bully 
weak ones,'' the Chinese foreign minister said. 
</P>
<P>
	``To bypass the U.N. and its Security Council so as to have  
one's own way will definitely weaken the pillar for the 
international security system and bring chaos into the 
international order,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Albright, who was among those who heard Tang, told  
reporters: ``If the reference is to the action of NATO and the 
United States in Kosovo, you need to ask the hundreds of thousands 
of Kosovars who have in fact been subjected to a bully that has 
massacred people and committed unspeakable crimes against 
humanity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She left the way open for similar actions in the future.  
</P>
<P>
	``When the U.N. cannot act because it is blocked by those who  
are not supporting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, (and 
when there is) a necessity to try to bring justice when crimes 
against humanity are committed,'' Albright said, ``then the United 
Nations ... leaves itself out of an essential action. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am very proud of the action the United States and NATO took  
to allow those people to return to their homes and build a decent 
life for themselves,'' Albright said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tang recently has said China remains unsatisfied with U.S.  
explanations that NATO's May 7 bombing of the Chinese Embassy in 
Yugoslavia was an accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright and Tang, who met Sunday over lunch, also differed on  
Taiwan's recent insistence on ``state-to-state'' relations with 
China. Tang refused to rule out force in unifying the mainland with 
Taiwan, which China considers a renegade province, and warned the 
United States not to interfere. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright also issued a joint statement today with the foreign  
ministers of South Korea and Japan, warning North Korea of 
``serious negative consequences'' if it goes forward with an 
expected test of a long-range missile. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our nations are united in urging (North Korea) to respond  
positively to the opportunity that now exists for it to improve its 
relations with the international community,'' Albright said. She 
said she hopes North Korea ``is listening to messages that are 
being delivered loud and clear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura said there would be  
``clear benefits'' to North Korea in demonstrating restraint. 
Otherwise, he said, ``in regards to the flow of people, goods and 
money, we might consider taking some actions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	China, which is North Korea's ally, went along with a statement  
issued Monday by the ASEAN forum saying the missile test would have 
a serious impact on stability in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	North Korea fired a three-stage missile over Japan last August  
and is widely believed to be planning to test a more advanced 
version soon, perhaps within the month. The newest North Korean 
missile could reach Japan, Hawaii and parts of Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
	In meetings today between ASEAN and its 10 key foreign partners,  
several foreign ministers urged Asian countries to resist the 
temptation to ease up on tough economic reforms now that the region 
is beginning to recover from its financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``The hard times are far from over,'' South Korean Foreign  
Minister Hong Soon-young said. ``Restructuring half finished is as 
dangerous as no restructuring at all. We must guard against the 
complacency that small successes tend to breed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 10-member ASEAN consists of Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia,  
Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Thailand, Singapore and 
Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
	They meet annually in the ASEAN Regional Forum with the United  
States, Russia, China, Japan, Australia, Canada, the European 
Union, South Korea, India, New Zealand and Mongolia.

<HEADLINE>  Cadillac's Future in Question </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCHESTER, Mich. (AP) -- Even as luxury car sales have boomed  
with a thriving economy, foreign automakers have steadily eroded 
Cadillac's U.S. market share like rust on a junked Coupe de Ville. 
</P>
<P>
	As the luxury division of General Motor Corp. showed off its  
newest model Tuesday, questions persisted about the No. 1 
automaker's ability to restore a nameplate that many affluent 
drivers today still associate with the finned luxo-barges of the 
'50s and '60s. 
</P>
<P>
	``As their market share declines, the task of rebuilding it  
becomes more and more difficult,'' said independent analyst Susan 
Jacobs. ``Cadillac's not accustomed to getting lost in the crowd, 
which is what it faces in today's luxury car market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cadillac's recent efforts to lure crowds of younger buyers to  
its showrooms have not been successful: Sales of the imported 
Catera entry-level sedan have been a disappointment, while demand 
for the larger Seville, redesigned for the '98 model year, was down 
23 percent in the first half of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Its late entry in the luxury sport utility vehicle segment, the  
Escalade, is little more than a gussied-up GMC Denali with a larger 
price tag. GM executives admit they underestimated the demand for 
big-ticket SUVs. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year ended with the ultimate humiliation for Cadillac: It  
lost the U.S. luxury sales crown it held for 48 years to rival Ford 
Motor Co.'s Lincoln division. 
</P>
<P>
	Through the first half of this year, Cadillac's U.S. car sales  
declined 15 percent while overall luxury car sales increased 7 
percent. Including SUV sales, Cadillac now trails Lexus, 
Mercedes-Benz and BMW -- all of which are benefitting from fresher, 
more innovative models. 
</P>
<P>
	Cadillac's overall share of the luxury market fell to just under  
16 percent last year from its peak of 51 percent in 1976, according 
to Autofacts. 
</P>
<P>
	Against this backdrop, Cadillac unveiled the 2000 DeVille. The  
DeVille, in its 50th year, is a key model for Cadillac: It has been 
the top-selling luxury car in the United States for 14 straight 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2000 DeVille is full of new technology that Cadillac hopes  
will lure Lexus, BMW and Mercedes-Benz drivers. Top on the list is 
the optional ``night vision'' infrared system that alerts the 
driver to hazards well beyond the range of the car's headlights. 
The car also is available with ultrasonic sensors in the rear 
bumper that will warn the driver of obstacles while backing up. 
</P>
<P>
	The night vision option will be priced between $1,000 and  
$1,500; list prices for the new DeVille, which goes on sale in the 
fall, are expected to be close to the current model's range of 
$38,500 to $44,500. 
</P>
<P>
	Slightly shorter and slimmer than its predecessor, the new  
DeVille borrows styling cues from the smaller Seville but still 
retains the conservative, big-sedan look that distinguishes it as 
an American luxury car. 
</P>
<P>
	That's the problem, critics say. Cadillac tried hard not to  
offend its loyal customers, who are getting older and fewer, while 
betting the new technology would impress younger buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The DeVille looks too much toward yesterday and not enough  
toward Cadillac's future,'' Jacobs said. ``It's an evolution in the 
right direction, but it's still grounded on the demands of their 
traditional buyers. The concept, the size, the look is still the 
traditional look of Cadillac.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Hall, an analyst with AutoPacific Inc., said the new DeVille  
is intended to compete more with the Lincoln Town Car than the 
Mercedes S-class. With its bigger trunk and rear seating, it may 
steal some Lincoln customers and a piece of the stretch-limo 
business that the Town Car has owned for years. 
</P>
<P>
	The new DeVille will make more money for GM even if sales stay  
flat, because of cost savings designed into the car, said analyst 
Alan Baum of IRN Inc. As GM has replaced old models, it has made 
the new ones easier to build, with fewer parts, and has increased 
the number of models built off common ``platforms'' -- the chassis 
and major mechanical parts. 
</P>
<P>
	The DeVille is built from the same platform as the Seville,  
Pontiac Bonneville, Buick Park Avenue, Buick LeSabre and Oldsmobile 
Aurora. 
</P>
<P>
	Cadillac executives are looking to 2001 and beyond for the  
models they hope will finally restore the marque's prominence. The 
later models will be based on Caddy's new ``art and science'' 
styling theme evident in the edgy Evoq roadster concept car on 
display at this year's major auto shows. 
</P>
<P>
	The first evidence of that will show up in the redesigned  
Escalade, which will debut in 2001 for Cadillac's centennial model 
year of 2002. That will be followed by a redesigned Catera, an 
all-new, car-based SUV that's smaller than the Escalade, the next 
generation Seville that will return to a traditional rear-drive 
setup, and the limited-production Evoq. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem is Cadillac needs those models now.  
</P>
<P>
	``The delay in transforming their lineup is costing them  
business long-term'' Jacobs said. ``They are coming too late to 
make Cadillac stand out from the crowd and sustain a leading 
position in luxury.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Barry Sanders Will Retire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- Barry Sanders, apparently fed up with the  
Detroit Lions' mediocre record and coach Bobby Ross, will retire 
from the NFL, his agent told ESPN and the Detroit Free Press on 
Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	David Ware, one of the two agents who handled the running back's  
affairs, said Sanders would issue a statement Wednesday announcing 
his retirement and wouldn't be available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	According to ESPN, Sanders told Ware and his other agent, Lamont  
Smith, of his retirement plans on Monday. The agents were unable to 
dissuade him, even with the argument that he's only 1,457 yards shy 
of the NFL career rushing record. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a line that says, `I've determined that my ... desire  
to leave is greater than my desire to continue playing.' Or words 
to that effect,'' Ware told the Detroit Free Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lions wouldn't confirm or deny the report.  
</P>
<P>
	``At this point we really have no comment on the various reports  
regarding Barry,'' Lions spokesman Bill Keenist said Tuesday night. 
``If anything should materialize, there will be an announcement. To 
comment any further would be speculation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ware and Smith didn't return calls seeking comment from The  
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Ware told the Free Press he was shocked by Sanders' decision.  
Ware declined to speculate on the exact reasons for Sanders' 
decision but said it was outlined thoroughly in the statement 
Sanders had written. 
</P>
<P>
	``I read the statement,'' Ware said. ``I didn't write it; he  
wrote it himself. It was very thoughtful, very well thought out, 
and he has come to a decision that he thinks is best for him. What 
can you do?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Detroit News also quoted a source as saying that Sanders  
will retire, saying it is not a negotiation ploy. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you retire, you retire from football,'' the source told  
the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Ross said the Lions would not trade Sanders. That  
came after a report that the Washington Redskins were interested in 
pursuing a trade for the running back. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders was the only veteran absent from the Lions' mandatory  
minicamp in May. 
</P>
<P>
	Ross and other members of the front office said they had not  
heard from Sanders in the offseason, and missed the mandatory and 
voluntary minicamps. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been reports that Sanders was unhappy with the Lions,  
but Sanders has not spoken publicly -- to the Lions or the media. 
</P>
<P>
	Veterans are scheduled to report to camp on Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Smith, Sanders' Denver-based agent, said the player  
issued a gag order forbidding his representatives from discussing 
the situation. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders was a training-camp holdout in 1989, 1991 and 1997. All  
were related to contract negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders, 31, has 15,269 career rushing yards, trailing the  
Chicago Bears' Walter Payton by 1,457 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lions have won only one playoff game in Sanders' 10 seasons  
in Detroit. They have had two 5-11 seasons sandwiched around a 9-7 
record in 1997 that earned a wild-card spot in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Sanders hasn't spoken publicly this offseason, others  
have expressed the depth of his frustration. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders' father, William Sanders, of Wichita, Kan., had  
previously raised the possibility of retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's sick of them (the Lions),'' William Sanders said in May.  
``He's sick of losing.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-Beatle Lennon Has Coat Auctioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRISTOL, England (AP) -- A cashmere coat worn by John Lennon  
didn't fetch nearly as much as hoped for at an auction Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The navy blue coat with velvet-trimmed collar and cuffs sold for  
$5,760. It was thought the coat that was worn by Lennon at the 
height of Beatlemania in 1964 could go for as much as $160,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I got a really good deal and plan to sell it in London  
and make a profit,'' said the buyer, Larry Castle, an antiques 
dealer from Hallatrow in southwestern England.

<HEADLINE>  Cadillac Facing Bumpy Road </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCHESTER, Mich. (AP) -- Cadillac's redesigned DeVille sedan is  
loaded with technological innovations for 2000, but analysts say 
the General Motors Corp. division needs to do much more to regain 
the luxury sales title it lost last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Cadillac's share of the U.S. luxury market fell to just under 16  
percent last year from its peak of 51 percent in 1976, according to 
Autofacts. It has been a victim of foreign competition and its 
failure to offer a luxury sport utility vehicle until recently. 
</P>
<P>
	``As their market share declines, the task of rebuilding it  
becomes more and more difficult,'' said independent analyst Susan 
Jacobs, who studies the luxury market. ``Cadillac's not accustomed 
to getting lost in the crowd, which is what it faces in today's

	The night vision option will be priced between $1,000 and  
$1,500; list prices for the new DeVille, which goes on sale in the 
fall, are expected to be close to the current model's range of 
$38,500 to $44,500. 
</P>
<P>
	Slightly shorter and slimmer than its predecessor, the new  
DeVille borrows styling cues from the smaller Seville but still 
retains the conservative, big-sedan look that distinguishes it as 
an American luxury car. 
</P>
<P>
	That's the problem, critics say. Cadillac tried hard not to  
offend its loyal customers, who are getting older and fewer, while 
betting the new technology would impress younger buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The DeVille looks too much toward yesterday and not enough  
toward Cadillac's future,'' Jacobs said. ``It's an evolution in the 
right direction, but it's still grounded on the demands of their 
traditional buyers. The concept, the size, the look is still the 
traditional look of Cadillac.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Hall, an analyst with AutoPacific Inc., said the new DeVille  
is intended to compete more with the Lincoln Town Car than the 
Mercedes S-class. With its bigger trunk and rear seating, it may 
steal some Lincoln customers and a piece of the stretch-limo 
business that the Town Car has owned for years. 
</P>
<P>
	The new DeVille will make more money for GM even if sales stay  
flat, because of cost savings designed into the car, said analyst 
Alan Baum of IRN Inc. As GM has replaced old models, it has made 
the new ones easier to build, with fewer parts, and has increased 
the number of models built off common ``platforms'' -- the chassis 
and major mechanical parts. 
</P>
<P>
	The DeVille is built from the same platform as the Seville,  
Pontiac Bonneville, Buick Park Avenue, Buick LeSabre and Oldsmobile 
Aurora. 
</P>
<P>
	Cadillac executives are looking to 2001 and beyond for the  
models they hope will finally restore the marque's prominence. The 
later models will be based on Caddy's new ``art and science'' 
styling theme evident in the edgy Evoq roadster concept car on 
display at this year's major auto shows. 
</P>
<P>
	The first evidence of that will show up in the redesigned  
Escalade, which will debut in 2001 for Cadillac's centennial model 
year of 2002. That will be followed by a redesigned Catera, an 
all-new, car-based SUV that's smaller than the Escalade, the next 
generation Seville that will return to a traditional rear-drive 
setup, and the limited-production Evoq. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem is Cadillac needs those models now.  
</P>
<P>
	``The delay in transforming their lineup is costing them  
business long-term'' Jacobs said. ``They are coming too late to 
make Cadillac stand out from the crowd and sustain a leading 
position in luxury.''

<HEADLINE> Armstrong Defeated in Time-Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- A tired-looking Lance Armstrong was  
soundly beaten by Alex Zuelle of Switzerland Tuesday in his second 
race since winning the Tour de France. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong, wearing the yellow jersey of the Tour winner, seemed  
to give up near the end as he slowed down dramatically and finished 
ninth in the two-leg Cross Laussane time trial. He was more than a 
minute behind Zuelle in the second leg. 
</P>
<P>
	Zuelle, who was second to Armstrong in the Tour de France,  
battled his countryman Laurent Dufaux for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
	They finished within a second of each other in the overall  
standings after the two stages. Italian Stefano Garzelli was third. 
</P>
<P>
	Both stages took place over the same 4.3-mile cobblestoned  
route, starting at the Olympic Museum and climbing 869 feet to the 
finish line. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong, whose victory in Paris marked a remarkable personal  
victory over life-threatening cancer, has set himself a punishing 
schedule since finishing the Tour on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	He won a race in Amsterdam Monday before traveling to  
Switzerland for the Cross-Lausanne Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the race did not finish until 8:45 p.m., he then  
planned to fly to Brussels for a celebrity dinner, before returning 
to Holland for another race Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texan then flies to the United States for a series of public  
appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cross-Lausanne has become a traditional event to showpiece  
the top riders from the Tour. Last year, it was won by Tour de 
France champion Marco Pantani.

<HEADLINE> Ekuban, Cowboys Sign Five-Year Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WICHITA FALLS, Texas (AP) -- Having taken up football just six  
years ago and spending only the last two as a defensive lineman, 
Dallas Cowboys top pick Ebenezer Ekuban recognized the importance 
of his first NFL training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	So when his agent told him late Monday that his contract was  
almost done, Ekuban got ready to go. At 1:45 a.m., he boarded team 
owner Jerry Jones' private jet in Maryland and seven hours later 
was sweating through practice with his new teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	``When they told me a plane was on the way, I had to hurry up  
and pack,'' Ekuban said. ``I forgot a couple of things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ekuban arrived in Texas around 4 a.m., slept for a couple hours,  
then signed his contract: a five-year, $5.65 million deal that 
includes a $3,525,000 signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cowboys held off on giving Ekuban performance milestones  
that would automatically increase his salary for fear of upsetting 
future salary caps. Vice president Stephen Jones noted that the 
team has a track record of rewarding its high achievers with 
bigger, longer contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he becomes a great player and fits in with this team, he  
probably won't ever see the end of this contract,'' said Jones, who 
negotiated Ekuban's deal with agent Marvin Demoff. ``We've 
historically extended guys like that and kept them. That's our 
strategy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A day after Jerry Jones outlined his new hardball stance with  
draft picks, only one remained unsigned. Second-round choice 
Solomon Page, an offensive lineman from West Virginia, reportedly 
is seeking $70,000 more in signing bonus than the team is willing 
to pay. 
</P>
<P>
	Ekuban repeatedly told his agent and the Cowboys that he wanted  
to be in camp from the beginning because he has so much to learn, 
more even than his fellow rookies. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want to hold out at all due to my lack of  
experience,'' he said. ``I made it a point to my agent that I 
didn't want to haggle over a little bit of money. I wanted to get 
in here the first day of camp and get as many repititions as I 
could.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ekuban, a Ghana native, began playing football his junior year  
in high school and was good enough to earn a scholarship to North 
Carolina -- as a tight end. He switched to defense as a junior and 
became a starter as a senior. 
</P>
<P>
	At 6-foot-3 and 281 pounds, Ekuban is big enough to handle most  
offensive linemen, but he's also fast enough to get around them. 
His 23 stops behind the line last year broke the Tar Heels record 
held by NFL alums Lawrence Taylor and William Fuller. 
</P>
<P>
	The speed factor set Ekuban apart during the scouting combine.  
His time of 4.7 seconds in the 40-yard dash was the fastest among 
defensive linemen. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not just flat-out, running-straight-down-the-field speed,  
it's functional speed at his position,'' Cowboys coach Chan Gailey 
said. ``He has the ability to turn the corner on a tackle, lower 
his shoulder and keep his balance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas moved up two spots to 20th to take Ekuban, making him the  
fourth defensive lineman the team has picked first in the last six 
years in a continuing quest for someone who can shake things up the 
way Charles Haley did in his prime. 
</P>
<P>
	Help on the line is especially necessary for the Cowboys this  
year because tackle Leon Lett was suspended indefinitely for 
violating the league's substance abuse policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm optimistic that I'll have a very good impact on the team  
my first year,'' Ekuban said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharing that optimism is linemate Greg Ellis, who spent three  
years with Ekuban at North Carolina until becoming Dallas' No. 1 
pick last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think a lot is expected of anybody in the first round, and  
it's probably not going to be any different with him,'' Ellis said. 
``But I think he can handle it. I won't say he will, but he has the 
ability to do so.''

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Rebound by Midday / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar slipped against the yen Wednesday  
morning as investors shrugged off a Japanese official's comment 
that a rapid rise in the yen was unwelcome. Japanese stocks 
rebounded moderately. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 116.44 yen, down 0.14 yen from late Tuesday in  
Tokyo but above its level of 116.36 yen in late New York trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 136.88 points,  
or 0.78 percent, to 17,599.60 points at the end of the morning 
session. On Tuesday, the average closed down 28.62 points, or 0.16 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the dollar fell despite remarks by Zembei  
Mizoguchi, head of the international bureau at Japan's Ministry of 
Finance, who said a rapid rise in the yen was unwelcome and that 
there was no change in the ministry's foreign exchange policy. 
</P>
<P>
	But many investors apparently believe policy has changed. The  
central bank aggressively defended a dollar exchange rate of 120 
yen a few weeks ago, but has now become relatively inactive in 
currency markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of Japan's dollar-buying intervention in recent weeks  
to stem the yen's rapid rise against the greenback is part of 
attempts by financial authorities here to help the nation's 
fledging economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Gains in the yen make Japanese exports more costly abroad, and  
thus less competitive, while cutting the value of foreign revenue 
in yen terms. 
</P>
<P>
	Trades said many players are awaiting Federal Reserve Chairman  
Alan Greenspan's testimony before the Senate banking committee 
later Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro traded at 123.61 yen, down from  
124.12 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, prices moved higher at midday, bolstered by  
a rally in New York and after five straight losing sessions in 
Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yen's relative steadiness against the dollar has also  
brightened sentiment, although investors remain wary about a 
further strengthening in the Japanese currency, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 115.88 points  
to close Tuesday at 10,979.04. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section rose 12.35 points, or 0.86 percent, to 1,446.46 at 
midday Wednesday. The TOPIX closed down 2.21 points, or 0.15 
percent, to 1,434.11 the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose  
to 1.6800 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.6550 percent, driving 
its price down to 101.03 yen from 101.25 yen.

<HEADLINE> Kamerling Sets 50m Butterfly Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- Sweden's Anna-Karin Kammerling lived up  
to her reputation as the women's fastest swimmer in the butterfly 
Tuesday by breaking her world record in 50-meters. 
</P>
<P>
	The 19-year Kammerling was timed in 26.39 seconds, bettering the  
26.39 she swam July 1 at the Swedish national championships. 
</P>
<P>
	She led all the way, beating Swedish teammate Johanna Sjoberg of  
Sweden, who was timed in 26.93. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't expect to break the world record again because in two  
races yesterday I didn't go very fast or feel very good,'' 
Kammerling said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first world record broken in Istanbul's Atakoy  
Olympic pool on the European side of this city spanning two 
continents. 
</P>
<P>
	In the men's 50-meter butterfly, Pieter Van den Hoogenband of  
the Netherlands nearly set a world record of his own, clocking the 
world's third all-best time of 23.89. 
</P>
<P>
	He later took away Alexander Popov's championship record by  
swimming a blazingly 48.70 in the semifinals of the 100-meter 
freestyle, just one day after he swam the world's all-time fastest 
leg in the 4x100 in 47.31. Popov holds both the world and European 
record of 48.21 set in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Holland's 4x100 team win also broke a streak held by Popov, who  
chased Hoogenband on the last leg. It was Popov's first silver 
medal in the Euros. 
</P>
<P>
	Coupled with Hoogenband's performance in the semis, the Dutchman  
has become Popov's biggest threat as he tries for a fifth 
consecutive gold in Wednesday's 100-meter freestyle final. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 100-meter backstroke, European champion Stev Theloke of  
Germany handily took his race in a time of 55.16, followed by 
Gordan Kozulj of Croatia in 55.84. Israel's Eithan Urbach, third in 
55.87, gave his country its second ever European Championship 
medal. 
</P>
<P>
	Italy's Domenico Fioravanti won the men's 100-meter breaststroke  
in a time of 1:01.34.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Extend Slide / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures extended their sharp  
slide Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid forecasts for 
weather conditions to turn more favorable for Midwest crops. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors have taken back much of the gains made last week, when  
brutally hot temperatures baked young plants in Illinois, Iowa, 
Indiana and Ohio, as forecasters predicted moderating weather over 
the next 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Rain fell overnight in drier growing areas, relieving crops that  
had been seeing soil moisture evaporate rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Agriculture Department late Monday also reported that  
crop conditions had not deteriorated as much as analysts had 
expected, boosting chances that they could recover in coming days 
as more rainfall and moderate temperatures approach. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery fell 7 1/4 cents to $2.67 3/4 a bushel;  
December corn fell 8 cents to $2.08 1/2 a bushel; December oats fell 
4 1/4 cents to $1.12 1/2 a bushel; November soybeans fell 26 3/4 cents to 
$4.25 1/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef and pork bellies advanced on the Chicago Mercantile  
Exchange, while lean hogs were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	August live cattle fell .25 cent to 65.20 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle rose .03 cent to 77.55 cents a pound; August lean 
hogs fell .22 cnet to 48.85 cents a pound; August pork bellies rose 
the limit 3 cents to 47.47 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Baseball Umpires Sue Leagues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Now baseball umpires want the right to withdraw  
their resignations, so they sued the American and National Leagues 
in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
	In a reversal of strategy apparently caused by their internal  
split, the Major League Umpires Association filed a 14-page 
complaint Monday in U.S. District Court in Philadelphia 
</P>
<P>
	They said several baseball officials are spreading ``false and  
misleading statements to umpires about deadlines to accept 
resignations, deadlines to offer rescissions of resignations and 
deadlines to reject rescissions of resignations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires also accused the American League and the commissioner's  
office of saying they intend to withhold termination pay of up to 
$400,000 per ump. 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires, whose resignations are set to take effect Sept. 2, also  
claimed baseball has offered them up to $2 million in future gains 
if they join a dissident group in the union that is trying to fire 
its negotiator, Richie Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
	They chose the resignation tactic because their current labor  
deal has a no-strike clause, and they fear owners would lock them 
out after it expires. 
</P>
<P>
	However, their position has been weakened by the decisions of 23  
of 32 AL umpires who say they will stay on. Only three of their 36 
NL counterparts say they will remain. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners have hired more than 20 new umpires from the minor  
leagues as of Sept. 1. The Triple-A umpires had been working as 
vacation fill-ins in the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	While no additional withdrawals of resignations were received  
Monday, one baseball official, speaking on the condition he not be 
identified, said several NL umpires had called baseball to say they 
were considering reversing course and staying on. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're partially divided right now and hopefully we can all  
come together at some point,'' said NL umpire Bruce Froemming, a 
union board member. ``But as far as what happened in Philly today, 
I have not talked to anybody and am as confused as anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thus far, 14 of the 56 umpires who resigned have withdrawn their  
resignations. The baseball official said the sport would continue 
to accept withdrawals, but only until all vacancies are filled. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody likes to portray Richie as the bad guy,'' AL umpire  
Jim Evans said. ``Richie Phillips has been very instrumental in 
helping raise the standards of this profession.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Evans is one of the AL umpires who submitted his resignation and  
backs Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
	``That doesn't mean everything Richie Phillips has ever done in  
his life, that everybody who is in his camp agrees with 
everything,'' Evans said. ``It's the commitment to the future of 
this profession -- the big picture. 
</P>
<P>
	The case was assigned to U.S. District Judge Edmund V. Ludwig,  
who three years ago issued a court order that prevented umpires 
from striking in the postseason. Umpires threatened a strike after 
Roberto Alomar spit at umpire John Hirschbeck and was given just a 
five-game suspension. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, umpires want a court order that gives them until  
Sept. 2 to withdraw their resignations. They also want Ludwig to 
declare that owners have engaged ``in numerous and serious unfair 
labor practices'' and to declare that mass resignations are a legal 
strike. 
</P>
<P>
	At least four more minor league umpires were hired Monday,  
another baseball official said. 
</P>
<P>
	In an unusual twist, umpires accused owners of wrongfully  
agreeing to give Larry Barnett more termination pay than the labor 
contract requires. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnett, who with 31 years of service is baseball's senior  
umpire, agreed to retire after this season for $550,000 -- $150,000 
more than the AL was required to give him. 
</P>
<P>
	The AL also has been negotiating for the retirements of Dale  
Ford, Ted Hendry, Ken Kaiser and Durwood Merrill, the suit said. 
</P>
<P>
	The current labor agreement is set to expire Dec. 31. Umpires  
asked the court to declare that the current labor agreement was 
abandoned by the AL and NL because commissioner Bud Selig is trying 
to shift supervision of umpires from the leagues to Sandy Alderson 
in the commissioner's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires contend the partial shift of responsibility to Alderson  
this season violated their agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips declined comment, as did Selig. Ludwig did not  
immediately set a date for a hearing.

<HEADLINE> Trumpeter 'Sweets' Edison Dead at 83 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Harry ``Sweets'' Edison, a jazz trumpeter  
who accompanied singers such as Frank Sinatra, Ella Fitzgerald and 
Billie Holiday, died Tuesday. He was 83. 
</P>
<P>
	Edison, who had fought cancer for 14 years, joined the Count  
Basie Orchestra in the mid-1930s when he was 18 and became a 
featured soloist. Basie saxophonist Lester Young dubbed him 
``Sweets'' because of the pleasing tone of his horn. 
</P>
<P>
	Edison stayed with Basie's big band until about 1950 before  
heading off to perform with his own quintet. He recorded his own 
albums, notably ``Sweets For The Sweet Taste Of Love,'' accompanied 
Sinatra as a studio musician and worked with Benny Carter on movie 
sound tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the years he played with most of the famous big bands,  
including those of Buddy Rich, Quincy Jones, Louis Bellson, Henry 
Mancini and Nelson Riddle. 
</P>
<P>
	Edison taught music seminars at Yale University in the Duke  
Ellington Fellowship Program and he was honored as a ``master 
musician'' with a 1991 National Endowment for the Arts Award at the 
Kennedy Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Edison lived in Los Angeles from 1950 until December, when he  
returned to Columbus because of his health, his daughter Helena 
said. But he continued to perform until a month ago and traveled to 
Europe this spring, she said.

<HEADLINE> Bush Skips Hispanic Convention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush is defending his record  
of reaching out to Hispanic voters even as he is being criticized 
for bypassing the annual convention of the nation's largest 
Hispanic civil rights advocacy group. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said the Republican presidential  
front-runner was unable to attend the National Council of La Raza 
convention because he was vacationing in Maine with his family. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are disappointed,'' La Raza President Raul Yzaguirre said  
Monday. ``Some of our people are a little angry he didn't show up. 
If he's taking us for granted, he is misreading our community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain of Arizona was the only Republican presidential  
candidate to accept an invitation to address the conference, held 
in Bush's home state of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	He told the convention that he won more than 55 percent of the  
Hispanic vote in his last election. ``I'm proud, but I'm not 
satisfied with that number. I want all their votes. Their support 
is my honor,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pressing for campaign finance reform as he actively courted the  
Hispanic vote, McCain said special interests and the ``pre-eminence 
of money over ideas'' run counter to the values of the Hispanic 
community. 
</P>
<P>
	``You are the backbone of our country,'' he told the group.  
</P>
<P>
	Asked about Bush's absence, the Arizona senator said, ``I really  
have no thoughts about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush enjoyed strong Hispanic support in his last gubernatorial  
election, and Tucker said that the Texas governor had visited 
Hispanic communities during campaign stops in Detroit, San Diego 
and Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	``His record of educating every child rebuilding America's  
defenses and restoring dignity and honor to the White House is 
resonating with Hispanic voters,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP presidential rival Elizabeth Dole also cited a scheduling  
conflict that prevented her from attending the conference. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Democratic side, former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley also  
cited a scheduling conflict, while Vice President Al Gore is 
scheduled to speak here Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	This isn't the first time Bush has run into complaints from  
minorities that he's ignoring them. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush made a last-minute appearance at the recent Unity  
conference of black, Latino, Asian and American Indian journalists 
in Seattle after initially declining an invitation to speak even 
though he was scheduled to be in Seattle at the time on other 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	Yzaguirre said he was bothered that Bush did not attend other  
Latino events. Bush skipped the recent gathering of the League of 
the United Latin American Citizens, which was also in his home 
state, and the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed 
Officials in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact he has missed a lot of Latino events is  
troublesome,'' Yzaguirre said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, La Raza officials released a report Monday saying  
hate crimes against Hispanics are on the rise and underscore a 
troubling pattern of harassment against the nation's 
fastest-growing minority group by law enforcement officials and 
extremists. 
</P>
<P>
	``Private citizens and law enforcement officials feel they can  
harass or attack Hispanic-Americans with almost complete 
impunity,'' Yzaguirre said. 
</P>
<P>
	To reduce hate crimes, La Raza is advocating the passage of the  
Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 1999 and extensive training of local 
law enforcement officials in how to identify and respond to hate 
violence.

<HEADLINE>  Blood Tests Confirm Jagger's Baby </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Blood tests confirm that Mick Jagger is the father  
of Brazilian model Luciana Morad's son, the spokesman for the 
Rolling Stone lead singer said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy to confirm that -- the blood test was positive,''  
Jagger's spokesman Bernard Doherty told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	``But the tape stops here. Sorry I can't embellish, but it's a  
`legal matter, baby,' as The Who once said,'' Doherty added. 
</P>
<P>
	The test paves the way for Ms. Morad, 29, to seek a settlement  
from the 56-year-old rocker for their son, now three months old. 
</P>
<P>
	She named the baby Lucas Morad Jagger. But Jagger had refused to  
acknowledge paternity publicly. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas-born model Jerry Hall, Jagger's partner for 22 years,  
split with him over Ms. Morad's pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hall, 43, and Jagger announced this month that they were  
seeking to have their 1991 marriage on the Indonesia island of Bali 
annulled and had reached a financial settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	News reports said Jagger's lawyers told him the results of the  
blood test while he was in France, where he has a chateau. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hall and their four children, Elizabeth, 15, James, 13,  
Georgia May, 7, and Gabriel, 1, were also in France, the reports 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucas is Jagger's seventh child. He also has Karis, 28, by  
singer Marsha Hunt, and Jade, 26, with his ex-wife Bianca. 
</P>
<P>
	News reports said Ms. Morad had the blood tests done in New York  
two weeks ago, and samples were sent to a London clinic. 
</P>
<P>
	Details of Jagger's settlement with Ms. Hall have not been  
announced. 
</P>
<P>
	British newspapers carried estimates ranging from $15 million to  
$50 million, after Ms. Hall yielded to Jagger's insistence that 
they were never legally married. His lawyers said the civil part of 
the ceremony in Bali was not completed.

<HEADLINE> NYC Mayor Heads Into Clinton's Turf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani had  
lunch Tuesday with some of the state's most prominent Republicans, 
poaching donations and talking politics in the home state of his 
likely rival for a U.S. Senate seat -- Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very, very good opportunity for me to learn more  
about the rest of the country, to learn more about Arkansas, to 
learn more about the things that unite Republicans,'' said 
Giuliani. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a lot of fun. ... It's a combination of fun and  
serious politicking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Mrs. Clinton nor Giuliani has formally entered the race  
for the New York Senate seat being vacated by Democratic Sen. 
Daniel Patrick Moynihan. 
</P>
<P>
	But Mrs. Clinton is widely believed to be planning a run, and  
Giuliani's trip down South is in part a response to the first 
lady's so-called ``listening tour'' she has been taking throughout 
New York in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani also plans to visit New Orleans and Alabama and hopes  
to raise as much as $200,000 for his expected campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	In Little Rock, about 60 people attended a $500-per-person  
fund-raising lunch at the Capital Hotel, where the menu consisted 
of beef tenderloin, twice baked potatoes, chocolate cake, and 
polite digs at Mrs. Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Mike Huckabee led the charge at a news conference earlier  
in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	He said about Giuliani, ``He has never been here before. He's  
never worked here, he's never lived here. Today he will be 
announcing his candidacy for some significant major office in 
Arkansas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then Huckabee told Giuliani, ``You've been here more than your  
opponent has lately.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton was born in Chicago and has spent most of her adult  
life in Washington, D.C., and in Arkansas, where her husband was 
governor before becoming president. Giuliani recently sent out a 
mailing in New York regarding Mrs. Clinton's travels. 
</P>
<P>
	``To me, New York is not a political `stepping stone.' New York  
is my life,'' the mayor states. ``So the question is not what New 
York can do for Mrs. Clinton, but what in the world can Mrs. 
Clinton do for the people of New York?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Giuliani appeared to get along well with his southern  
counterparts, the talk was not all lovey-dovey. Huckabee said he 
backed Giuliani despite the mayor's support of abortion rights and 
gay rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do disagree on certain issues, but we agree on a lot more,  
particularly on the role of limiting government, cutting taxes, 
giving the individual the opportunity to do his or her best,'' said 
Huckabee. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard Wolfson, Mrs. Clinton's campaign spokesman, declined to  
comment on the mayor's trip. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to engage in politics in Arkansas. She's going  
to continue her listening tour in New York,'' said Wolfson. 
</P>
<P>
	Arkansas Democratic Party Chairman Vaughn McQuary showed up at  
the Governor's Mansion for Giuliani's appearance but stood outside 
the gates. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a publicity stunt, as much on his part as it is on the  
governor's and lieutenant governor's part,'' McQuary said. ``I 
think it's a poke in the eye of the first lady by the governor and 
the lieutenant governor.''

<HEADLINE> ABC Presents Paris Fashions Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Other people dress fit to kill. When I get  
dressed, I look fit to be killed. 
</P>
<P>
	I'm the kind of fashion fugitive who would buy clothes  
shrink-wrapped at the 7-Eleven if I could. My glad rags are 
depressed. As a clothes horse, I'm a nag. 
</P>
<P>
	For me and others likewise sartorially challenged, ``Paris  
Fashion Collections'' is sure to be an eye-opener. For everyone 
else, it will simply be eye-popping. 
</P>
<P>
	The one-hour special, which ABC airs Thursday at 9 p.m. EDT,  
showcases 25 of the world's top fashion designers (names like John 
Galliano for Christian Dior, Alexander McQueen for Givenchy, 
Jean-Paul Gaultier, Christian Lacroix) along with their 1999 lines, 
which were unveiled in Paris last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Still being edited, the program was unavailable for review. But  
a six-minute clip reel caught my eye tout de suite. 
</P>
<P>
	Here's a young woman wrapped in a white sheath with a huge Davy  
Crockett cap on her head. Here's a jumpsuit-clad model whose 
billowing train is a pink-and-orange parachute. And here's a rare 
bird: a gal in a dress all of feathers. 
</P>
<P>
	We're talking haute couture (say, ``oat koo tour''). Which means  
high fashion, bubba. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides spotlighting the very fabulous fashion shows (staged at  
very fabulous places like Versailles), ``Paris Fashion 
Collections'' hears from fabulous attendees like Madonna, Sean 
``Puffy'' Combs, Boy George and George Lucas. 
</P>
<P>
	And the program goes behind the scenes. For example, there's a  
peek inside the House of Chanel with Karl Lagerfeld, who 
demonstrates how a couture design starts as a concept and 
culminates in a fabulous gown. 
</P>
<P>
	Host for a second year is Isabella Rossellini, who as an  
internationally famous supermodel and acclaimed actress -- as well 
as author, daughter of Ingrid Bergman and director Roberto 
Rossellini, and former spokeswoman for Lancome cosmetics -- knows a 
little something about glamour and style. 
</P>
<P>
	``But why does fashion matter?'' I ask her.  
</P>
<P>
	``It matters for the same reason that film matters or music  
matters,'' she says brightly. ``It isn't necessary, you don't need 
it. But it's fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And, on second thought: ``Fun, we need!''  
</P>
<P>
	On the special, Rossellini will have fun wearing Chanel and  
Valentino, but for this recent interview she looks lovely in 
everyday finery: slacks and blouse. Her hair is shorn impishly 
short and she wears no makeup. Meanwhile, I am wearing scuffed 
Rockports and a $3 street-fair tie. It occurs to me I should go on 
``Sally'' for a makeover. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes fashion seems a little frivolous,'' I venture.  
</P>
<P>
	Rossellini smiles an incandescent smile.  
</P>
<P>
	``Fashion IS frivolity -- as music is melody or dance is rhythm!  
It really is the industry of playfulness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``But what exactly IS haute couture?'' I ask, pleased at having  
said it right. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very confusing,'' she replied. ``There's always been a  
misconception that these are clothes you have to wear.'' She shook 
her head. 
</P>
<P>
	``The haute couture is very experimental fashion. A lab of  
ideas. It's like (George) Lucas opening a door and saying, `This is 
the new special effect that I'm working (on) for the film that I 
might be doing five or six years from now.' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is what haute couture is: a glimpse of what might be the  
future. Some of the ideas, we can never use them. But some of the 
things will trickle down to Levi jeans and the Gap.'' 
</P>
<P>
	I consider Galliano's hot pants and chain-link skirt get-up: On  
sale someday at Montgomery Ward? Mon Dieu! 
</P>
<P>
	But the more pressing goal of haute couture is to generate buzz  
(le buzz?) among the couture cognoscenti. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to be excessive so that you can make the point,''  
Rossellini explains. ``The daringness is important, because if it 
wasn't daring, we would still be busy wearing corsets. That's why 
I'm grateful to it!'' And she bursts out laughing. 
</P>
<P>
	Rossellini has just finished shooting ``Don Quixote,'' which  
will air on cable's TNT next season. She is about to appear in a 
new performance piece by Robert Wilson at Lincoln Center. And later 
this year she will launch her own cosmetic line, Isabella 
Rossellini's Manifesto. 
</P>
<P>
	Her own manifesto, after 47 years of classy singularity: Be  
yourself. 
</P>
<P>
	``You are successful if you are unique,'' declares the woman  
with the chipped front tooth she refused to fix when she began 
modeling. ``If you bow down, if you become common, then they don't 
want you. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's always this pressure to level out,'' she allows. ``But  
what they really want'' -- and by ``they'' she means the audience, 
whatever the show -- ``is people's specificity ... what you can give 
as an individual. 
</P>
<P>
	``Level out?'' She flashes a look of mock-horror. ``That's the  
LAST thing we want! Ignore that pressure! That's my advice.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> ABC Adding Minorities to TV Shows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- ABC, criticized along with the other  
major TV networks for planning nearly all-white fall series, is 
adding ethnic characters to at least five of its shows. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC executives said they began the effort to make their programs  
more inclusive in May, before the NAACP and other groups condemned 
TV's lack of racial diversity. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, we have an obligation to reflect society as it  
exists,'' Stu Bloomberg, ABC Entertainment Television Group 
co-chairman, told the Television Critics Association on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	As presented in pilot form this spring, none of the 27 new  
comedies and dramas set to premiere on the top four networks had 
minorities in a leading role, and few had them in supporting roles. 
</P>
<P>
	Minority characters are being added to ABC's ``Wasteland,'' a  
new drama about young Manhattanites, and to ``Once and Again,'' 
from ``thirtysomething'' creators Edward Zwick and Marshall 
Herskovitz. 
</P>
<P>
	Upcoming ABC shows ``Talk to Me'' and ``Bellevue'' will gain  
ethnic characters, as will returning series ``Sabrina.'' The 
sitcom's two new characters will include a Hispanic woman, the 
network said. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC Entertainment President Jamie Tarses said the changes were  
being made in an ``organic way.'' Producers were asked to look for 
opportunities to diversify their casts but were not issued a 
directive to do so, Ms. Tarses said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been waiting a very long time for this and it's a step  
in the right direction,'' said Lisa Navarrete, spokeswoman for the 
National Council of La Raza. The council and other Latino groups on 
Tuesday demanded more Hispanic representation on TV and called for 
a weeklong boycott of the four major networks. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. population is 11 percent Hispanic, but Hispanics make  
up less than 2 percent of the characters on primetime TV shows, Ms. 
Navarrete said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, the NAACP announced a new initiative to monitor  
how well the entertainment industry reflects America's ethnic 
diversity. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC said in a statement that minority representation ``continues  
to remain a top priority'' and expressed pride in minority actors 
on shows including ``ER'' and ``Law &AMP; Order.'' The statement added: 
``We realize there is still work to be done.''

<HEADLINE> Cadillac To Unveil New Logo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCHESTER, Mich. (AP) -- Cadillac's getting a new logo.  
</P>
<P>
	The familiar Cadillac crest-and-wreath logo will be replaced  
with a more modern version that will be unveiled in late August at 
the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance classic car show in 
California, Cadillac general manager John Smith said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith declined to reveal any details of the new logo. The  
current logo consists of a crowned crest surrounded by a wreath. 
Within the crest are the profiles of six duck-like birds. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, speaking to reporters after the unveiling of the 2000  
DeVille sedan, said the new logo has been reviewed by focus groups 
of consumers as part of Cadillac's campaign to recast its image to 
appeal to younger drivers. The effort began as Cadillac developed 
its Evoq concept roadster. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we developed Evoq, the poster child for who it is we're  
going to be, we felt (the logo's) identity wasn't as much forward 
looking as the form of that car,'' Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Smith noted that many loyal Cadillac fans aren't crazy about  
tinkering with the crest and wreath. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's evolved seven or eight times already,'' he said. ``But,  
without question, there are significant segments of the population, 
especially in this country, for whom that symbol has great 
meaning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new logo was a hit with the kind of new buyers Cadillac's  
trying to attract. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the end of the day, this particular new logo was very much  
favored by everyone in California, which is not a bad thing, and 
favored by people under 45 everywhere,'' he said.

	House Approves China's Trade Status  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House approved President Clinton's  
one-year extension of normal trade with China today, overcoming 
complaints that the Chinese government abuses its own citizens and 
spies on America. The annual debate over the future of U.S.-Chinese 
trade policy ended with lawmakers voting 260-170 to defeat a 
resolution to overturn the one-year trade extension announced by 
Clinton on June 3. Since 1980 no Congress has succeeded in 
rejecting a president's decision to extend what was formerly called 
most-favored-nation status, which gives China the same low tariffs 
enjoyed by other U.S. trading partners.

	Fog Hampers Colombia Plane Recovery  
</P>
<P>
	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Thick fog prevented recovery teams from  
reaching a remote mountainside to inspect wreckage thought to be 
that of a missing U.S. anti-drug reconnaissance plane, U.S 
officials said today. The wreckage was first sighted Sunday, and 
U.S officials speculated the plane, which disappeared Friday, had 
crashed into a mountaintop not specified on maps. Although the U.S. 
army says it is holding out hope for survivors, White House 
anti-drug chief Barry McCaffrey, on a visit to Colombia, said 
earlier that the five American soldiers and two Colombian airmen on 
board had probably died in the crash.

<P>
	JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) -- Passengers were evacuated safely today  
after a small cruise ship with more than 100 people aboard ran 
aground and was reported taking on water in Alaska coastal waters. 
Coast Guard spokesman Roger Wetherell said no injuries had been 
reported. A few crew members stayed behind to try to save the ship. 
The vessel was identified as the ``Spirit of '98,'' one of seven 
small cruise ships operated by Seattle-based Alaska 
Sightseeing-Cruise West.

	Consumer Confidence Falls in July  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After rising eight straight months to a 30-year  
high, consumer confidence fell in July, a sign that the Federal 
Reserve has succeeded in cooling off economic growth by raising 
interest rates. The Conference Board reported today that its index 
of consumer confidence, which measures consumers' propensity to 
spend, declined 3.4 points to 135.6 in July, from 139.0 in June. 
Consumer sentiment is an important economic indicator, since 
consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of the nation's overall 
economic activity. Economists had not been expecting so big a drop.

were expected. There have been at least 30 heat-related deaths in

naturalist and three Yosemite sightseers. Cary Stayner told a 
reporter from KNTV of San Jose in an off-camera jailhouse interview

</P>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- A national coalition of Latino civil rights  
groups demanded today an end to the ``brownout'' of Hispanics in 
the media. While Hispanics constitute 11 percent of the U.S. 
population, they comprise less than 2 percent of the characters on 
prime-time television shows, said Lisa Navarrete, a spokeswoman for 
La Raza, a national Hispanic advocacy organization. Navarrete said 
that only one Latino actor, Martin Sheen on NBC's West Wing, has 
been cast on a new network show set to premier in the 1999-2000 
season. La Raza is examining how to pressure broadcasters to 
diversify the faces on television.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks led the market to its  
strongest performance in more than a week today as investors hunted 
for bargains among shares that have been beaten down in recent 
sessions. On Wall Street, the Dow ended up 115.88 at 10,979.04. 
Advancing issues on the NYSE led decliners 1,629-1,367. The Nasdaq

</P>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- U.S. catcher Marcus Jensen hit two  
homers and drove in all of his team's runs in a 5-1 victory over 
Mexico today. Canada beat the U.S. team 7-6 on yesterday, scoring 
four two-out runs in the bottom of the 11th. The Americans, using 
professional players for the first time in international baseball, 
were visibly stunned after the loss. Today's victory all but 
assured the Americans a berth in Saturday's quarterfinals.

<HEADLINE> More Organ Donation Leave Sought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A House-passed bill would give federal  
employees additional paid leave for donating bone marrow or organs. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, introduced by Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., calls for  
seven days of paid leave a year for bone marrow donations and 30 
days for organ donations in addition to sick leave. 
</P>
<P>
	Current law allows federal employees only seven days of paid  
leave for organ donation. 
</P>
<P>
	No one spoke against the bill during a short period of debate  
just before the House passed it by voice vote on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	A similar bill has been introduced in the Senate by Sen. Daniel  
Akaka, D-Hawaii.

<HEADLINE> EU Widens Asbestos Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- The European Union today widened the  
ban on use of asbestos to cover almost all applications of the 
cancer-causing material. The prohibition won't take full effect for 
six years. 
</P>
<P>
	The EU's executive Commission said the 15 member nations have  
until Jan. 1, 2005, to remove from the market all white asbestos, 
otherwise known as chrysotile, which is still used in pipes and 
roofing, brake and clutch linings for heavy vehicles and various 
specialist uses. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Commission, many EU nations plan to bring in  
the ban sooner, or have already done so. 
</P>
<P>
	The only exception to the asbestos ban is the use of chrysotile  
in the production of chlorine, since no alternative product is 
available and the risk to health is low. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1991, the EU banned five of the six forms of asbestos and the  
use of chrysotile in 14 types of product. Exemptions were allowed 
for some uses of chrysotile while alternative products were 
developed. 
</P>
<P>
	The new EU ruling does not require existing asbestos to be  
removed from buildings. ``The risk to health from asbestos in 
buildings is usually very low, if it remains undisturbed,'' the 
Commission said.

<HEADLINE> Blood Tests Confirm Jagger's Baby </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Blood tests confirm that Mick Jagger is the father  
of Brazilian model Luciana Morad's son, the spokesman for the 
Rolling Stone lead singer said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy to confirm that -- the blood test was positive,''  
Jagger's spokesman Bernard Doherty told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	``But the tape stops here. Sorry I can't embellish, but it's a  
`legal matter, baby,' as The Who once said,'' Doherty added. 
</P>
<P>
	The test paves the way for Ms. Morad, 29, to seek a settlement  
from the 56-year-old rocker for their son, now three months old. 
</P>
<P>
	She named the baby Lucas Morad Jagger. But Jagger had refused to  
acknowledge paternity publicly. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas-born model Jerry Hall, Jagger's partner for 22 years,  
split with him over Ms. Morad's pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hall, 43, and Jagger announced this month that they were  
seeking to have their 1991 marriage on the Indonesia island of Bali 
annulled and had reached a financial settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	News reports said Jagger's lawyers told him the results of the  
blood test while he was in France, where he has a chateau. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hall and their four children, Elizabeth, 15, James, 13,  
Georgia May, 7, and Gabriel, 1, were also in France, the reports 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucas is Jagger's seventh child. He also has Karis, 28, by  
singer Marsha Hunt, and Jade, 26, with his ex-wife Bianca. 
</P>
<P>
	News reports said Ms. Morad had the blood tests done in New York  
two weeks ago, and samples were sent to a London clinic. 
</P>
<P>
	Details of Jagger's settlement with Ms. Hall have not been  
announced. 
</P>
<P>
	British newspapers carried estimates ranging from $15 million to  
$50 million, after Ms. Hall yielded to Jagger's insistence that 
they were never legally married. His lawyers said the civil part of 
the ceremony in Bali was not completed.

<HEADLINE> N.J. Governor Removes Prosecutor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- The head of the biggest county prosecutor's  
office in New Jersey has been removed amid claims of misconduct and 
spending on such things as a $120 leather wastebasket and a 
$250,000 recreational vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	Essex County Prosecutor Patricia Hurt, the second black woman to  
head a prosecutor's office in New Jersey, had served only 18 months 
of a five-year term. 
</P>
<P>
	The state attorney general said Tuesday that he was ordered to  
remove Ms. Hurt by Gov. Christie Whitman, who appointed Ms. Hurt to 
the post. The office, whose jurisdiction includes Newark, has 115 
lawyers and handles one-third of all criminal cases in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	The attorney general's office has subpoenaed at least eight of  
Ms. Hurt's employees for an investigation of her spending. The 
probe reportedly focuses on allegations she used employees for 
personal errands. 
</P>
<P>
	It is also investigating her use of money seized from criminals  
to buy office supplies that include the RV and wastebasket. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, a grand jury charged four investigators assigned to  
Ms. Hurt's narcotics unit with misconduct, saying they illegally 
searched a home for drugs, then lied about it. Two of those charged 
were appointed to top positions by Ms. Hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal and state agencies are also examining how her office  
handled the April 8 slaying of a police officer in Orange. Three 
people were detained, and one died in police custody, before 
someone else was arrested and confessed. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hurt had no comment Tuesday. She can continue drawing her  
$115,000 salary. 
</P>
<P>
	The last New Jersey prosecutor removed from office was Nicholas  
L. Bissell Jr. of Somerset County. He was ousted in 1995 after he 
was indicted on federal charges of tax evasion and abusing his 
office. Bissell was convicted but fled before sentencing, killing 
himself in a Nevada motel room in 1996 as U.S. marshals entered.

<HEADLINE> Civil Rights Judge Johnson Eulogized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HALEYVILLE, Ala. (AP) -- Frank Johnson, the fearless federal  
judge whose rulings in the 1950s and '60s ended the era of 
segregated buses, schools, parks and restaurants, was laid to rest 
Tuesday in the fiercely independent north Alabama hill country 
where he was raised. 
</P>
<P>
	About 100 people, including relatives, friends, judges, lawyers  
and former law clerks turned out under a hot, lunchtime sun for the 
graveside service for Johnson, who died Friday at age 80. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. T.B. Stringfellow eulogized Johnson as ``a giant in our  
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His silver casket was covered by an American flag that was  
presented to his wife of 61 years, Ruth. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson's body was brought from Montgomery after a memorial  
service Monday in his courtroom, where Rod Nachman, a lawyer and 
longtime friend, called him ``the Abraham Lincoln of the federal 
judiciary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson's rulings led to threats against him and his family and  
in some ways made him a social outcast in Alabama's capital. A 
cross was burned on his lawn, and his mother's Montgomery house was 
bombed. 
</P>
<P>
	City Clerk Larry Albright said before the burial that Johnson  
fit in well with Winston County's reputation for political 
independence. The county refused to join Alabama in seceding from 
the Union during the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
	``He took a stand and he believed in it. His actions as a judge  
stood for what he believed,'' Albright said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also attending the service was Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who wrote  
a book about Johnson in the mid-1970s. ``He is as much an American 
hero as the leaders of the Revolutionary War and the Civil War,'' 
Kennedy said after the service. 
</P>
<P>
	Those at the service said the no-nonsense judge was a warm  
friend in private life, a man who loved fishing, crafting wood, 
gardening and ``saluting the Constitution,'' a Johnson phrase for 
lifting a drink of Jack Daniels or George Dickel whiskey. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson's casket was in front of the judicial bench that in the  
1960s stood as a dramatic counterpoint to the segregationist 
rhetoric of then-Gov. George C. Wallace. 
</P>
<P>
	When he was appointed by President Eisenhower to the bench in  
Montgomery in 1955, Johnson was 37 and the youngest federal judge 
in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson made a pivotal 1956 decision that marked a victory for  
the Montgomery bus boycott, outlawing segregation across a wide 
spectrum -- on public transportation and in parks, restaurants, 
libraries and schools. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1960s, he signed an order to integrate the University of  
Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
	Mourners at Monday's service, mostly old or middle-aged, also  
included many blacks who lived through the civil rights battles. 
</P>
<P>
	Jack A. Mitchell, who once taught school with Johnson's wife,  
was among those paying his respects. He said both Johnsons were 
figures of strength when they were reviled by Wallace and much of 
white society. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a man of courage and conviction,'' Mitchell said.

<HEADLINE> Christian Conference Targets Gays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHEATON, Ill. (AP) -- A Christian umbrella group dedicated to  
persuading homosexuals to abandon their lifestyle and if possible 
take up with the opposite sex opened its largest annual conference 
with singing -- and protests. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 1,200 Exodus International enthusiasts attended a  
boisterous opening rally Monday night that included a musical 
comedy skit about the problematic process of changing sexual 
orientation. It was the biggest turnout since the group began in 
1976. 
</P>
<P>
	As the group clapped inside the hall, the Rev. Bradley Mickelson  
of the Metropolitan Community Church of the Incarnation in Oak Park 
led a quiet protest march of 50 people outside. 
</P>
<P>
	Exodus, based in Seattle, represents 131 independent ministries  
located in 38 states and the District of Columbia. Delegates from 
related ministries in 15 foreign nations are also in attendance 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The organization teaches that ``freedom from homosexuality is  
possible through repentance and faith in Jesus Christ'' and says it 
seeks to provide help for ``men and women who desire to overcome 
their homosexuality.'' The group acknowledges that for some 
homosexuals, changing their orientation will prove impossible, and 
says they should practice celibacy. 
</P>
<P>
	The conference, a mixture of training workshops and  
inspirational rallies, is meeting at Wheaton College, a prominent 
Evangelical Protestant school, but is not sponsored by the college. 
</P>
<P>
	The group's leader for North America, Presbyterian layman Bob  
Davies, told the rally that ``a whole new chapter has opened for 
Exodus'' because such ministries are now getting visibility and 
significant support from other American Christians. 
</P>
<P>
	He referred to an ad campaign in major newspapers last year  
promoting the message of sexual change through Christian 
inspiration, which was paid for by $500,000 in donations from 
Christian Coalition and other conservative groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Davies, himself a former homosexual who is now married, thinks  
publicity from the ads is the main reason attendance is up from 
last year's 850 participants. 
</P>
<P>
	Exodus said it received 3,900 phone inquiries in the six weeks  
after the ads ran. In a normal year, Exodus estimates that 5,000 to 
7,000 people contact its member ministries. 
</P>
<P>
	But the message is anything but welcome in some sectors of  
American Christianity, as well as in the secular gay and lesbian 
movement. At the protest near the Exodus meeting, placards read 
``Gay and Created by God'' and ``Gay Christian Called to Do 
Justice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to be a voice for people who think they're living in  
sin, to tell them how to be liberated and free,'' said Mickelson, 
who nevertheless called Exodus participants ``our brothers and 
sisters in the faith.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cynthia Marquardt, member of the Oak Park congregation, said  
sexual conversion is impossible and that Exodus' message 
contributes to violence against gays and lesbians. 
</P>
<P>
	``Exodus has a right to their message, and we will continue to  
proclaim that God loves us just as we are,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Exodus is closely aligned with Homosexuals Anonymous, a 12-step  
movement patterned after Alcoholics Anonymous, and with the 
National Association for Research and Therapy of Homosexuality, 
made up of psychological counselors who work for change through 
``reparative therapy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both the American Psychiatric Association and American  
Psychological Association have denounced Christian-based reparative 
therapy, saying it doesn't work and can cause psychological damage.

<HEADLINE>  U.S. Beats Mexico in Baseball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Ernie Whitt fumed, the U.S. baseball  
team blew it and Morgan White beamed. 
</P>
<P>
	On a day that White and teammate Jennie Thompson restored some  
pride in U.S. women's gymnastics at the Pan American Games, the 
nation's baseball team squandered a four-run lead and lost to 
Canada in its controversy-spiced opener Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	And there was more from Cuba, this time from the man at the top.  
President Fidel Castro accused Canada and the United States of 
dirty tricks aimed at harming Cuba during the games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are competing in enemy territory,'' Castro declared during  
his annual Revolution Day speech in Havana. 
</P>
<P>
	The baseball fireworks were ignited by Whitt, the Canadian  
manager, ejected in a rulings dispute with the umpires, then filed 
a protest that was rejected. The resulting 30-minute delay only 
served to inspire the Canadians, who trailed 6-3 at that point, but 
rallied for a 7-6 victory in 11 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	``The second he got ejected, he believed we were going to come  
back and win this game,'' said Canada's Andy Stewart, who had to 
admit, ``that was an unusual way to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This morning, the U.S. team bounced back to beat Mexico 5-1 as  
St. Louis Cardinals minor league catcher Marcus Jensen hit two 
homers and drove in all five runs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans now have a 1-1 record in Pool A.  
</P>
<P>
	Four of the five teams from Pool A and all four from Pool B will  
advance to Saturday's single-elimination quarterfinals. The United 
States still has pool games remaining against tournament favorite 
Cuba and Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans, Canada, Cuba, Brazil and Mexico comprise the  
stronger Pool A. Nicaragua, Panama, Guatemala and the Domnican 
Republic form Pool B. 
</P>
<P>
	White, 16, who is 4 feet, 10 inches short, is one of the  
youngest members of the entire U.S. delegation. She also came from 
behind. She was third heading into the final rotation of the 
all-around competition, but put together a strong routine on the 
uneven bars that was enough to give her a .031 margin over Canada's 
Michelle Conway. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson, second going into her last routine, held on for the  
bronze despite falling off the balance beam. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew I could be a consistent competitor, and I thought I  
could do well if I just believed in myself,'' White said. ``But I'm 
still in shock that I won. This builds my confidence enormously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The loss to Canada didn't do much for the confidence of the U.S.  
baseball team, It seemed to have its game well in hand before 
Stewart, who plays Double-A ball in the Phillies organization, hit 
a three-run homer off Scott Stewart to tie the score in the 11th. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada then loaded the bases on two walks and a hit batter  
before Stubby Clapp hit a routine popup into short left field. 
Shortstop Travis Dawkins appeared to be under the ball, but left 
fielder Shawn Gilbert called him off. 
</P>
<P>
	Bad move. Gilbert couldn't get to the ball, it plopped to the  
grass and the winning run scored. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to lose when you feel like you played hard all game  
long, you go up by three and got two outs,'' U.S. manager Buddy 
Bell said. ``You just pretty much figure things will work out the 
way you want them to. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I have been in this game long enough to know better than  
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whitt erupted after walking to the mound in the top of the 11th  
to talk to pitcher Chad Ricketts, who had just surrendered a 
two-run homer to Jason Hardtke that gave Team USA a 6-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Because Whitt talked to Ricketts the previous inning, the  
umpires said he exceeded the number of free trips allowed in a game 
and had to remove the pitcher. Whitt thought otherwise, a 20-minute 
discussion -- which eventually became an argument -- followed and 
Whitt got tossed. 
</P>
<P>
	He promptly filed a protest, which international baseball  
officials turned down. By the end of the game, Whitt had cooled 
down -- somewhat. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess they make the rules as they go,'' he said. ``Needless  
to say, I'm still upset about it, but it's nice to come back and 
win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the two gymnastics medals, coach Mary Lee Tracy felt much  
better leaving Winnipeg Arena than she did on Saturday, when the 
favored Americans finished second to Canada in the team race. 
</P>
<P>
	``It does help soothe a little bit of the pain from the team  
competition,'' Tracy said. ``Definitely to me that was painful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States leads the medals count with 63, including 24  
gold. Cuba has 37, with 15 gold, and Canada has 35, with nine gold. 
</P>
<P>
	Castro's comments followed the defection of a Cuban athlete and  
a journalist at the games. He echoed criticism by Cuban athletic 
officials that the Canadian media were encouraging Cuban athletes 
to defect. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have never seen so many tricks, so much filth in the Pan  
American Games,'' Castro said. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States lost a coach and a key athlete on Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	Assistant Harvey Glance took over as head coach of the men's  
track and field team after Ralph Lindeman was sent home to Colorado 
Springs on the advice of doctors. Lindeman, 48, the track coach at 
the Air Force Academy. 
</P>
<P>
	The freestyle wrestling team lost one of its top performers when  
two-time world champion Terry Brands became ill and went home to 
Iowa City, Iowa. He was replaced by Eric Guerrero in the 
competition that began today. 
</P>
<P>
	The American women survived a rugged water polo match with Cuba,  
winning 10-5 but emerging from the pool with bruises, scratches and 
torn bathing suits. Maureen O'Toole had a hat trick. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a very physical game,'' Heather Moody said. ``We didn't  
notice that in their play when we watched them two days ago, but 
they really took it out on us.''

youngest members of the entire U.S. delegation. She also came from 
behind. She was third heading into the final rotation of the 
all-around competition, but put together a strong routine on the 
uneven bars that was enough to give her a .031 margin over Canada's 
Michelle Conway. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson, second going into her last routine, held on for the  
bronze despite falling off the balance beam. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew I could be a consistent competitor, and I thought I  
could do well if I just believed in myself,'' White said. ``But I'm 
still in shock that I won. This builds my confidence enormously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The loss to Canada didn't do much for the confidence of the U.S.  
baseball team, It seemed to have its game well in hand before 
Stewart, who plays Double-A ball in the Phillies organization, hit 
a three-run homer off Scott Stewart to tie the score in the 11th. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada then loaded the bases on two walks and a hit batter  
before Stubby Clapp hit a routine popup into short left field. 
Shortstop Travis Dawkins appeared to be under the ball, but left 
fielder Shawn Gilbert called him off. 
</P>
<P>
	Bad move. Gilbert couldn't get to the ball, it plopped to the  
grass and the winning run scored. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to lose when you feel like you played hard all game  
long, you go up by three and got two outs,'' U.S. manager Buddy 
Bell said. ``You just pretty much figure things will work out the 
way you want them to. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I have been in this game long enough to know better than  
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whitt erupted after walking to the mound in the top of the 11th  
to talk to pitcher Chad Ricketts, who had just surrendered a 
two-run homer to Jason Hardtke that gave Team USA a 6-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Because Whitt talked to Ricketts the previous inning, the  
umpires said he exceeded the number of free trips allowed in a game 
and had to remove the pitcher. Whitt thought otherwise, a 20-minute 
discussion -- which eventually became an argument -- followed and 
Whitt got tossed. 
</P>
<P>
	He promptly filed a protest, which international baseball  
officials turned down. By the end of the game, Whitt had cooled 
down -- somewhat. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess they make the rules as they go,'' he said. ``Needless  
to say, I'm still upset about it, but it's nice to come back and 
win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the two gymnastics medals, coach Mary Lee Tracy felt much  
better leaving Winnipeg Arena than she did on Saturday, when the 
favored Americans finished second to Canada in the team race. 
</P>
<P>
	``It does help soothe a little bit of the pain from the team  
competition,'' Tracy said. ``Definitely to me that was painful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States leads the medals count with 63, including 24  
gold. Cuba has 37, with 15 gold, and Canada has 35, with nine gold. 
</P>
<P>
	Castro's comments followed the defection of a Cuban athlete and  
a journalist at the games. He echoed criticism by Cuban athletic 
officials that the Canadian media were encouraging Cuban athletes 
to defect. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have never seen so many tricks, so much filth in the Pan  
American Games,'' Castro said. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States lost a coach and a key athlete on Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	Assistant Harvey Glance took over as head coach of the men's  
track and field team after Ralph Lindeman was sent home to Colorado 
Springs on the advice of doctors. Lindeman, 48, the track coach at 
the Air Force Academy. 
</P>
<P>
	The freestyle wrestling team lost one of its top performers when  
two-time world champion Terry Brands became ill and went home to 
Iowa City, Iowa. He was replaced by Eric Guerrero in the 
competition that began today. 
</P>
<P>
	The American women survived a rugged water polo match with Cuba,  
winning 10-5 but emerging from the pool with bruises, scratches and 
torn bathing suits. Maureen O'Toole had a hat trick. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a very physical game,'' Heather Moody said. ``We didn't  
notice that in their play when we watched them two days ago, but 
they really took it out on us.''

<HEADLINE> Gizzi Works With First-Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREELEY, Colo. (AP) -- Watching Chris Gizzi work with the  
first-team Denver Broncos defense brought a wide smile to the face 
of his college coach, Fisher DeBerry. 
</P>
<P>
	Gizzi's promotion is only temporary and he won't be available to  
the Broncos this season because of his military commitment to the 
Air Force. But he was thrilled at the opportunity on Tuesday to 
work alongside starting linebackers Bill Romanowski and Glenn 
Cadrez. 
</P>
<P>
	Gizzi got his chance because of starter John Mobley's hamstring  
injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unfortunate the injury had to happen,'' he said. ``I'm  
just doing the best job I can to fill in and get as many reps as I 
can. It's an ideal situation. I'm in the military but I'm getting a 
chance to play football in some free time. 
</P>
<P>
	``And I'm having a lot of fun. This is vacation for me.''  
</P>
<P>
	Gizzi, an intense and highly productive player at the academy,  
has fully recovered from reconstructive knee surgery after the 
East-West Shrine Game in early 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't even thought about it,'' he said. ``I've gotten some  
shots on it and it's a little swollen, but it's fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Broncos coach Mike Shanahan said Gizzi ``brings some  
intangibles. He's a student of the game. I like the way he 
prepares. He's very physical. We're getting a chance to evaluate 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gizzi also made an impression on NFL MVP Terrell Davis, who told  
reporters that the young linebacker is ``a rock.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DeBerry, Air Force's coach, visited Tuesday's workouts and liked  
what he saw. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chris is practicing right now just like he did all the time at  
the academy,'' DeBerry said. ``He's a very competitive young man. 
It just is very gratifying to see them so high on him and see him 
doing so well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gizzi will coach the junior-varsity linebackers at the academy  
this fall. His two-year military commitment could end as soon as 
December. 
</P>
<P>
	``Beau Morgan was released after two years,'' DeBerry said. ``So  
was Steve Russ (another Broncos linebacker). That seems to be the 
guideline the Air Force uses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DeBerry said he likes to visit the Broncos training camp ``to  
learn something. I'm so impressed with their organization and the 
enthusiasm and intensity of the players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked the difference between the players on the field at Greeley  
and the ones he will supervise at the academy, he said with a 
laugh, ``Ability. I'd like to take about 22 of these athletes 
home.''

<HEADLINE> Armstrong Win Is Medical Victory Too </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	American cyclist Lance Armstrong's victory in the Tour de France  
was made possible by another incredible triumph -- medicine's 
ability to beat advanced cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, Armstrong's doctors in Austin, Texas, gave him the most  
feared of medical diagnoses: At age 25, he had cancer. Not just 
that, but it had already spread throughout his body. 
</P>
<P>
	In a way, though, he was lucky, because his form of malignancy,  
cancer of the testicles, is one of the unusual types of cancer in 
adults that can often be cured once it has spread. 
</P>
<P>
	For Armstrong, like most victims, the first sign of trouble was  
a painless lump in one of his testicles. He ignored it for 5 1/2 
months, thinking it was probably irritation from his competitive 
bicycle training. But when it grew sore and he began to cough up 
blood, he went to see a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
	He had never heard of testicular cancer, which strikes 7,400 men  
in the United States annually and represents just 1 percent of all 
male cancers. But for men in their 20s and 30s, it is the leading 
form of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong underwent surgery to have his right testicle removed  
and received one round of chemotherapy. Then he was sent to Indiana 
University Hospital in Indianapolis to see Dr. Lawrence Einhorn, an 
expert in testicular cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	What Einhorn found was especially ominous. Doctors grade this  
kind of cancer by how far it has spread. Stage one disease is 
confined to the testicles and is completely curable. Stage two has 
spread to the abdominal lymph glands and is 98 percent curable. 
Stage three has traveled through the bloodstream to the lungs or 
beyond. Typically doctors can cure 80 percent of these patients. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stage three is the worst,'' Einhorn said. ``He was a bad stage  
three.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His cancer had spread extensively throughout his lungs, and  
there were also traces of it in his brain that had begun to cause 
headaches. 
</P>
<P>
	Einhorn estimated that he had a 50 percent chance of being  
cured. Still, for an adult with widely spread malignancy, those are 
good odds. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-five years ago, such a diagnosis would have led quickly  
to death. That was before the development of cisplatin, a platinum 
derivative that has become standard treatment for many kinds of 
tumors but is especially effective against testicular cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	That fall and winter, Armstrong underwent three more five-day  
sessions of chemotherapy. Besides cisplatin, doctors gave him the 
drugs etoposide and ifosfamide. Ordinarily, they prefer the drug 
bleomycin to ifosfamide, because it is equally effective and less 
likely to cause nausea. But bleomycin can slightly injure the 
lungs. 
</P>
<P>
	``That damage is trivial for most people, but if someone is a  
world-class athlete, a slight reduction in lung function would 
lower their standing by several notches,'' Einhorn said. So the 
doctors settled on the nastier but ultimately safer ifosfamide. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong continued to ride between treatments, and by late  
December his chemotherapy was over. But it was still unclear 
whether he was saved. Doctors monitor progress with chest X-rays 
and blood tests. 
</P>
<P>
	His X-rays still showed abnormal growths in his lungs, but that  
could have been scar tissue, not cancer. Also, his 
alpha-fetoprotein levels were still high. Normally, this reading on 
blood tests is 1.5. Before treatment, his was 100,000. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the blood protein returned to normal in February 1997,  
and two months later, his chest X-ray was clear, too. He had 
reached an inmportant milestone: cancer-free a year after 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	``This disease grows so very rapidly that if you fail to kill  
all the cancer with chemotherapy, it doesn't come back years 
later,'' Einhorn said. ``It comes back months later. When a patient 
is one year cancer-free after chemotherapy, he has a 95 percent 
probability of a cure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, 2 1/2 years later, his chance of cure is about 98 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	The one possible long-term side effect is sterility. About half  
of patients cannot father children. However, Armstrong's wife is 
expecting a child in October. While babies can be conceived with 
sperm stored before treatment, Einhorm said he assumes Armstrong is 
fertile. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong's determination to get back into competitive cycling  
is staggering to the physician. Most patients are sapped by fatigue 
for months, sometimes even years, after chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really thought that Lance had so much determination, he  
would be back on his bicycle competing,'' Einhorn said. ``But to 
win the Tour de France is mind boggling. Just to enter is 
incredible. It could not have happened to a better person.''

<HEADLINE> Pastor Sentenced for Smuggling Kids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- A pastor has been sentenced to 27 months in  
prison for smuggling Estonian children into this country on the 
promise of a Christian education, only to force them to work 
15-hour days to support her lavish lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think these kids were worked to the bone,'' U.S. District  
Judge Marvin Garbis said Tuesday. ``They were cheated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joyce Perdue, the 55-year-old pastor at Word of Faith Outreach  
ministry in Woodbine, was ordered to pay back nearly $65,000 to the 
children and was fined $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Associate pastor Robert Hendricks, 37, who handled the business  
end of the operation, received two years in prison. Administrator 
Elizabeth Brown, 40, was sentenced to one year in a halfway house. 
</P>
<P>
	The three were allowed to remain free pending an appeal.  
</P>
<P>
	The defendants pleaded guilty in May to conspiracy to smuggle  
aliens and visa fraud after Garbis forbid them from claiming that 
church members and children lived and worked together as part of 
their Christian faith. 
</P>
<P>
	The children were told they would attend Calvary Chapel  
Christian Academy but from 1996 to 1998 they cleaned roach-infested 
apartments and bookstores and installed office furniture. 
Prosecutors said the children were threatened with being sent back 
to Estonia if they refused. 
</P>
<P>
	The children, ages 14 to 17, were paid $10 to $50 a week for  
working in the cleaning service. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Perdue used the money to buy a $600,000 home,  
go on a Mexican cruise and purchase $200 bottles of perfume. 
</P>
<P>
	``My intent was never to harm these very young people,'' Perdue  
said. ``I can state before the court, your honor, and the God of 
the Christian universe, I never remember abusing them. ... I now 
know it was wrong to allow these children to work.''

<HEADLINE>  All Umpires Rescind Resignations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In what appears to be an overwhelming defeat for  
major league umpires, their threatened walkout collapsed Tuesday 
when all of the umps withdrew their resignations. 
</P>
<P>
	However, about one-third of the 68 major league umpires will  
lose their jobs anyway, because the American and National leagues 
already have hired 25 replacements from the minor leagues, two 
high-ranking baseball officials said, speaking on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	AL president Gene Budig sent letters to nine AL umpires on  
Monday accepting their resignations, according to the officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar letters to as many as 13 NL umps will be sent by NL  
president Len Coleman later this week, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The umpires had escalated their labor battle with baseball on  
July 14 by voting to resign en masse on Sept. 2, but the strategy 
began to falter when some of the umps began to take back their 
resignations. 
</P>
<P>
	``They turned their backs on us,'' said Bruce Froemming, a  
senior NL umpire who helped hire union head Richie Phillips in 
1979. ``Obviously they think they're going to get a better deal 
somewhere else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, umpires sued the AL and NL in federal court in  
Philadelphia, seeking a court order that would allow them to 
withdraw the resignations prior to the Sept. 2 effective date. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for owners and umpires held a conference call Tuesday  
with U.S. District Judge Edmund V. Ludwig, who refused to issue a 
temporary restraining order to prevent owners from accepting the 
resignations, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Without such an order, the umpires not being taken back by  
baseball will be forced to spend years in court in an effort to 
regain their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not over with yet. Our contract doesn't expire until Dec.  
31 so we will go on through the year and then negotiate a new 
deal,'' NL umpire Randy Marsh said. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball commissioner Bud Selig declined comment, spokesman Rich  
Levin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips issued a statement saying ``a group of very fine  
umpires stand very tall and will hold their heads high forever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They are to be admired for their resolve and courage,''  
Phillips said. ``They are confident that they will eventually 
prevail in this very unseemly affair that was deliberately provoked 
by major league baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Phillips said ``unfair labor practice charges are being  
pursued before the National Labor Relations Board,'' the NLRB's 
Philadelphia office, where umpires usually file, said nothing had 
been received by Tuesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
	Several baseball lawyers said they expect a battle among the  
divided umpires on whether Phillips, their lawyer since 1978, will 
be in charge of negotiations this offseason for a new labor 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``You need solidarity,'' NL umpire Angel Hernandez said. ``I'm  
sure there will be turmoil down the road.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NL umpire Jerry Crawford said that Phillips will remain in  
charge because umpires voted 29-14 last spring in favor of giving 
him a new five-year contract. Crawford also said it was too early 
to term the strategy a defeat. 
</P>
<P>
	``I won't categorize it until after everything is all said and  
done,'' Crawford said. ``We were asked by a federal judge to 
withdraw our resignations to de-escalate the situation. We complied 
with what he asked. It is now in the hands of a judicial proceeding 
and we are willing to wait for the outcome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires announced their mass resignations after a meeting in  
Philadelphia on July 14, and 56 of the 68 umpires submitted 
resignation letters in the following week. 
</P>
<P>
	By last Friday, 14 of those 56 umpires had withdrawn their  
resignations. The rest of the withdrawals were sent to the leagues 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires decided on the resignation strategy because they feared  
owners would lock them out when their labor contract expires Dec. 
31, and the agreement contains a no-strike clause. 
</P>
<P>
	The nine AL umps who were sent letters Monday accepting their  
resignations are Drew Coble, Jim Evans, Dale Ford, Rich Garcia, Ed 
Hickox, Mark Johnson, Ken Kaiser, Greg Kosc and Larry McCoy. 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia was rated the third-best AL umpire by players in a survey  
last winter, while Coble was rated sixth. 
</P>
<P>
	The only NL umpires assured of keeping their jobs are Mark  
Hirschbeck, who never quit, and Wally Bell and Jeff Nelson, who 
withdrew their resignations last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``What they're saying is with the people they've hired, minor  
leaguers and the guys that jumped ship, they've got 13 guys, so 
they need 23 to fill out the staff,'' Froemming said.

<HEADLINE> House GOP Eyes Budget Surplus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Though they deny it, House Republicans'  
initial spending plans threaten to erode more than $14 billion of 
next year's projected budget surplus, jeopardizing Social Security 
surpluses they have promised not to touch. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP leaders insist that by the time their spending bills are  
approved, they will not use any Social Security money -- a pledge 
that has been a defining political theme for both political parties 
all year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will not go into those monies,'' House Majority Leader Dick  
Armey, R-Texas, told reporters Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But for now, House Republicans have written spending bills for  
the coming fiscal year with accounting devices letting them use 
more than $14 billion of next year's anticipated federal surplus 
for higher spending and for tax cuts, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
	That number is crucial because the Congressional Budget Office,  
Congress' official budget scorekeeper, has projected a $161 billion 
surplus for next year. Of that, $147 billion is to come from Social 
Security. So using more than $14 billion of the surplus eats into 
the Social Security portion of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like if the bills go through the way they're  
currently drafted, the $14 billion has already been committed to 
these various uses,'' said Susan Tanaka, the Congressional Budget 
Office's associate communications director. 
</P>
<P>
	Agreeing was Carol Cox Wait, president of the Committee for a  
Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan budget watchdog group. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would appear they're heading down a road that would have  
them at the end of the year not keeping their pledge to save every 
cent of the Social Security trust fund,'' Wait said. ``But it won't 
be the outcome at the end of the year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats and some moderate and conservative Republicans have  
criticized the accounting techniques used to spend the surplus 
funds. With support uncertain, some GOP leaders are trying to pare 
them back. 
</P>
<P>
	``All these plans are subject to change,'' said the House Budget  
Committee chairman, John Kasich, R-Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	To abandon some of the budget devices and avoid spending Social  
Security money, however, Republicans could have to cut spending 
further, which they may not have the votes to do. Armey said 
Republicans would not shrink their tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost everyone expects that at year's end, Congress and  
President Clinton will negotiate spending bills that are more 
expensive than the ones Republicans are now writing. And the 
bargainers may figure out a way to avoid spending Social Security 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if they do, the budget devices Republicans are using let  
them claim right now that they are living within spending limits 
set two years ago, while in actuality they are exceeding them. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton did the same thing in his budget earlier this year. He  
proposed spending $30 billion above the spending limits, but 
claimed to honor them by proposing to pay for the extra spending 
with cigarette tax increases and other proposals Congress 
steadfastly opposes. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, Republicans' use of next year's surplus includes:  
</P>
<P>
	--They set at $4.5 billion this year's piece of their $792  
billion, 10-year tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
	--They proposed budget ``emergencies,'' meaning spending limits  
can be ignored and the surplus spent, for the 2000 Census, 
veterans' health-care and disaster relief. The total is $10 
billion, though several billion of it may end up not being spent 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
	--They have so far ordered the Congressional Budget Office to use  
the White House Office of Management and Budget's spending 
estimates $15 billion lower than the CBO's. That in effect lets 
them squeeze $15 billion more into several bills, mostly for the 
Defense Department. 
</P>
<P>
	These figures exclude an emergency bill to help cash-strapped  
farmers that both parties concede will become law later this year. 
Democrats want it to cost nearly $10 billion, and Republicans are 
expected to propose at least $7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Also excluded are the costs for whatever natural disasters may  
occur this year, such as earthquakes or hurricanes.

<HEADLINE>  All Umpires Rescind Resignations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In what appears to be an overwhelming defeat for  
major league umpires, their threatened walkout collapsed Tuesday 
when all of the umps withdrew their resignations. 
</P>
<P>
	However, about one-third of the 68 major league umpires will  
lose their jobs anyway, because the American and National leagues 
already have hired 25 replacements from the minor leagues, two 
high-ranking baseball officials said, speaking on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	AL president Gene Budig sent letters to nine AL umpires on  
Monday accepting their resignations, according to the officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar letters to as many as 13 NL umps will be sent by NL  
president Len Coleman later this week, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The umpires had escalated their labor battle with baseball on  
July 14 by voting to resign en masse on Sept. 2, but the strategy 
began to falter when some of the umps began to take back their 
resignations. 
</P>
<P>
	``They turned their backs on us,'' said Bruce Froemming, a  
senior NL umpire who helped hire union head Richie Phillips in 
1979. ``Obviously they think they're going to get a better deal 
somewhere else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, umpires sued the AL and NL in federal court in  
Philadelphia, seeking a court order that would allow them to 
withdraw the resignations prior to the Sept. 2 effective date. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for owners and umpires held a conference call Tuesday  
with U.S. District Judge Edmund V. Ludwig, who refused to issue a 
temporary restraining order to prevent owners from accepting the 
resignations, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Without such an order, the umpires not being taken back by  
baseball will be forced to spend years in court in an effort to 
regain their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not over with yet. Our contract doesn't expire until Dec.  
31 so we will go on through the year and then negotiate a new 
deal,'' NL umpire Randy Marsh said. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball commissioner Bud Selig declined comment, spokesman Rich  
Levin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips issued a statement saying ``a group of very fine  
umpires stand very tall and will hold their heads high forever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They are to be admired for their resolve and courage,''  
Phillips said. ``They are confident that they will eventually 
prevail in this very unseemly affair that was deliberately provoked 
by major league baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Phillips said ``unfair labor practice charges are being  
pursued before the National Labor Relations Board,'' the NLRB's 
Philadelphia office, where umpires usually file, said nothing had 
been received by Tuesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
	Several baseball lawyers said they expect a battle among the  
divided umpires on whether Phillips, their lawyer since 1978, will 
be in charge of negotiations this offseason for a new labor 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``You need solidarity,'' NL umpire Angel Hernandez said. ``I'm  
sure there will be turmoil down the road.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NL umpire Jerry Crawford said that Phillips will remain in  
charge because umpires voted 29-14 last spring in favor of giving 
him a new five-year contract. Crawford also said it was too early 
to term the strategy a defeat. 
</P>
<P>
	``I won't categorize it until after everything is all said and  
done,'' Crawford said. ``We were asked by a federal judge to 
withdraw our resignations to de-escalate the situation. We complied 
with what he asked. It is now in the hands of a judicial proceeding 
and we are willing to wait for the outcome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires announced their mass resignations after a meeting in  
Philadelphia on July 14, and 56 of the 68 umpires submitted 
resignation letters in the following week. 
</P>
<P>
	By last Friday, 14 of those 56 umpires had withdrawn their  
resignations. The rest of the withdrawals were sent to the leagues 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires decided on the resignation strategy because they feared  
owners would lock them out when their labor contract expires Dec. 
31, and the agreement contains a no-strike clause. 
</P>
<P>
	The nine AL umps who were sent letters Monday accepting their  
resignations are Drew Coble, Jim Evans, Dale Ford, Rich Garcia, Ed 
Hickox, Mark Johnson, Ken Kaiser, Greg Kosc and Larry McCoy. 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia was rated the third-best AL umpire by players in a survey  
last winter, while Coble was rated sixth. 
</P>
<P>
	The only NL umpires assured of keeping their jobs are Mark  
Hirschbeck, who never quit, and Wally Bell and Jeff Nelson, who 
withdrew their resignations last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``What they're saying is with the people they've hired, minor  
leaguers and the guys that jumped ship, they've got 13 guys, so 
they need 23 to fill out the staff,'' Froemming said.

<HEADLINE> Internet Gambling Co. Loses Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- New Yorkers who gamble via the Internet are  
playing in a virtual casino inside their computers and are subject 
to state gaming laws even if the gambling company is based 
overseas, a judge ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer hailed the decision by  
State Supreme Court Justice Charles Edward Ramos against World 
Interactive Gaming Corp., of Suffolk County, as precedent-setting. 
He called it a victory for his office's recently established 
Internet Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were a couple of other cases concerning offshore  
gambling in the pipeline, but we believe this is the first ruling 
by a judge anywhere,'' Spitzer spokesman Scott Brown said. The 
ruling by the judge was made last week and made public Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The case began in February 1998 as a probe into allegations that  
WIGC had improperly sold shares in a casino gambling business for 
$10,000 each, taking in some $1.8 million from 114 investors, 10 of 
them in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	In June 1998, state investigators tapped into WIGC Web sites and  
placed bets, according to court papers. The company's computer 
didn't accept a bet from a state investigator when she typed in New 
York state as her home on a sign-in form, so she typed in Nevada 
instead, said WICG's attorney, Anthony Colleluori. 
</P>
<P>
	The company had contended that because its computer servers were  
located and licensed on the Caribbean island of Antigua, the state 
had no jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 20-page ruling, the judge dismissed that claim as  
irrelevant and set a Sept. 9 hearing on restitution for investors. 
</P>
<P>
	``The act of entering the bet and transmitting the information  
from New York via the Internet is adequate to constitute gambling 
activity within New York state,'' the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge said WIGC had violated state and federal laws,  
including the federal Interstate Wire Act, with a gambling Web site 
that ``creates a virtual casino within the user's computer 
terminal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an important decision for law enforcement throughout  
New York and perhaps throughout the nation,'' Spitzer said in a 
statement. ``The judge has clearly stated that it doesn't matter 
whether someone promoting gambling to state residents is based in 
Albany, Albuquerque or Antigua. New York state laws still apply.'' 
</P>
<P>
	World Interactive's Antigua subsidiary went online a year ago,  
but a state lawsuit forced it to halt operations, Colleluori said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that WIGC had never taken bets from New Yorkers, and he  
argued that there are no state or federal laws against Internet 
gambling. He said the company would appeal the ruling. Despite its 
name, in New York state the Supreme Court is just a trial-level 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	New York bars non-Indian gambling unless it's approved by the  
state Legislature, like horse racing and the state Lottery.

<HEADLINE> Dutch, British Firms To Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- Britain's Reckitt &AMP; Colman PLC and  
Dutch household products group Benckiser NV said Tuesday they will 
merge to form one of the world's largest manufacturers of home 
cleaning products. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal involves an exchange of stock that values the Dutch  
company at about $3.15 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies will combine all activities, creating a new  
company called Reckitt Benckiser that is expected to generate 
nearly $5 billion in annual sales and employ about 21,500 people. 
</P>
<P>
	The new company will be the largest in home cleaning product  
markets with the exception of laundry detergents, according to the 
statement announcing the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Reckitt &AMP; Colman's brands are Lysol disinfectant, Easy-Off  
oven cleaner, Mop &AMP; Glo floor cleaner and Woolite detergent. 
</P>
<P>
	Benckiser makes Calgon water softener, the dishwashing brands  
Finish, Electrasol and Jet Dry and Vanish fabric treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Benckiser shareholders will receive five shares in the new  
company for each Benckiser share, while Reckitt shareholders traded 
each of their shares for one share in the new company. 
</P>
<P>
	Reckitt shareholders will end up with a 59.1 percent stake in  
the new company, while Benckiser shareholders will hold 40.9 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	With a combined market capitalization of $7.7 billion,  
Benckiser's stake would be worth about $3.15 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal still needs to be approved by Reckitt &AMP; Colman's  
shareholders as well as regulatory approval.

<HEADLINE> Adopt-A-Grandparent Program in S.D. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WAKPAMNI, S.D. (AP) -- Emily Has No Horse struggles to make ends  
meet with her $513-a-month Social Security check and the few 
dollars she earns sewing clothes. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the 80-year-old widow's income doesn't provide enough for  
her family's needs in this small village on the Pine Ridge Indian 
Reservation, part of a county that has been labeled the nation's 
poorest. 
</P>
<P>
	That's where the Adopt A Grandparent Program comes in. Mrs. Has  
No Horse and other elderly Oglala Sioux have received money, 
clothing and other supplies from across the nation from people who 
have chosen to become their adopted grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the program came on, it really helped a lot of us. I know  
it really helped me,'' she says. ``That's the only help we do get 
from the outside world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The outside world often seems a long way from the sprawling,  
5,000-square-mile reservation in southern South Dakota. Wounded 
Knee is here. So are the Badlands. Diabetes, alcohol and traffic 
accidents are prolific killers in this windswept region where 
summers are hot and the winters savagely cold. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton called attention to the reservation's 75  
percent unemployment rate and lack of adequate housing during his 
visit earlier this month, the first by a president to Indian 
country in 60 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Shannon County, which includes the Pine Ridge, was the nation's  
most impoverished, according to 1994 Census Bureau data. A more 
recent report said 57 percent of the reservation's children lived 
in poverty in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The Adopt A Grandparent Program was started in 1987 by a  
free-lance photojournalist, Gail Russell, who had visited the 
reservation while on assignment for a magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was appalled,'' says Russell, who lives in Taos, N.M. ``I  
had no idea that living conditions were like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During one visit, she learned that three elderly people had  
recently frozen to death, and Russell discussed the problem with 
Nellie Red Owl, who has since died. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was nagged into it by a 73-year-old grandma,'' Russell says.  
``One time as I was leaving, she said: `Don't you think somebody 
down your way would like to adopt a grandparent?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Today, about 350 members from around the nation and abroad  
provide aid and letters to some 230 elderly reservation residents 
as part of the program. In exchange, sponsors get a chance to make 
a new friend and learn about the culture, tradition and history of 
the Oglala Sioux. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know everybody in her family,'' says Barbara Whitestone of  
Glen Ellen, Calif., who sponsors Mrs. Has No Horse and visits her 
adopted grandmother almost every year. ``It's an amazing 
experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year the nonprofit program spent $83,000 for salaries, rent  
and other operating expenses. An additional $63,000 paid for 
propane, wood, electrical bills and groceries for elders who needed 
quick help. 
</P>
<P>
	Members also sent an estimated $125,000 worth of clothes, food  
and other items directly to their adopted grandparents, Russell 
says. Cash is usually sent directly to a store or utility company. 
</P>
<P>
	Sponsors can choose to adopt grandparents from a list.  
</P>
<P>
	Sue Gerome, a school counselor in Guilderland, N.Y., has  
enlisted the help of students and staff at the Northeast Parent and 
Child Society Grout Park School to support Pine Ridge elders. 
</P>
<P>
	The students have held bake sales, sold flowers and put on a  
talent show to raise money. ``For the students, they are learning a 
lot of history and culture, that there are people in this country 
who need their help,'' Gerome says. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerome recently sent flannel sheets to elderly people in the  
Wakpamni community to help them stay warm in the winter. One woman 
cried because she had never before had new sheets. 
</P>
<P>
	``It can be discouraging. You can feel like you could spend  
every dime you had within that community for many years and it 
wouldn't make a dent,'' Gerome says. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm hoping over time through our school we can raise the  
standard of living in that community,'' she says. 
</P>
<P>
	Russell says she often makes the 12-hour drive from her home in  
Taos to deliver food and other supplies to the reservation. And she 
organizes a get-together for grandparents and sponsors during the 
Oglala Sioux's annual meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``So much of the things that happen with this program are things  
that are not measurable in dollars,'' Russell says. 
</P>
<P>
	Ben and Alvina Conquering Bear would like to have someone adopt  
them. The retired couple raised 10 children and now have 35 
grandchildren and 14 great-grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a struggle and a half for my family,'' Mrs. Conquering  
Bear says. ``Sometimes I have four families here.'' 
</P>

<P>
	Let the race for the Ryder Cup begin.  
</P>
<P>
	Justin Leonard booked a hotel room in Connecticut well in  
advance, but he didn't decide to play the Greater Hartford Open 
this week until after his playoff loss in the British Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I had won, I would have taken Hartford off,'' Leonard said.  
``But because I only moved to ninth, I'll play the next three 
weeks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The GHO, Buick Open in Michigan and PGA Championship are the  
last three events to earn Ryder Cup points. Since the PGA is a 
major, points will be doubled and could lead to a tournament within 
a tournament on the final day. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, Jeff Maggert closed with a 65 at Winged Foot to  
make the team. In 1995, Brad Faxon had a final-round 63 at Riviera 
to make the team. By playing all three tournaments, Leonard is 
giving himself every chance to, at worst, hold his position. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I play well, making the team will take care of itself,''  
Leonard said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also in the GHO is Jeff Maggert (No. 10) and Tom Lehman (No.  
14). 
</P>
<P>
	Phil Mickelson (No. 8) got back into the top 10 with his  
runner-up finish in the U.S. Open. He missed the cut at Carnoustie 
and won't play again until the PGA Championship. Steve Stricker and 
John Huston, at Nos. 11-12, decided against playing the GHO. 
</P>
<P>
	Europeans have four tournaments left, starting with the European  
Open in Ireland and ending the week after the PGA with the BMW 
International. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark James, at one point seventh in the standings, had planned  
to announce this week whether he will give up his captaincy to Sam 
Torrance to play. But after slipping to No. 9 after the Open, James 
said he'll wait to see how it pans out. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything is up in the air,'' James said. ``It's very  
possible that things will change a lot in the next few weeks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They already have. Bernhard Langer and Andrew Coltart bumped  
James to No. 11 this week, while 19-year-old Sergio Garcia is No. 
12. 
</P>
<P>
	Nick Faldo, who has played on every team since 1977, is off the  
map and likely would have to win this month to merit any 
consideration as a captain's pick. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *CHASING THE HALL:* Two players could get enough points for the  
LPGA Hall of Fame by winning the du Maurier Classic this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Juli Inkster, who won the U.S. Open and LPGA Championship in a  
span of 21 days to complete the career Grand Slam, needs only one 
more point to reach the required 27 points. If she doesn't win the 
rest of the year, she could still get a point for Player of the 
Year or Vare Trophy. 
</P>
<P>
	Annika Sorenstam, who was barely a teen-ager when Inkster won  
two majors as a rookie, moved into position with her victory in St. 
Louis two weeks ago. Sorenstam now has 25 points, and major 
championships are worth two points. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if Sorenstam were to win this week, she would have to wait  
until 2004 for her induction. New Hall of Fame criteria require 
players to be active LPGA members for 10 years. Sorenstam's rookie 
season was 1994. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *EUROPEAN UPRISING:* This may sound familiar. A petition is  
being circulated among players that seeks payment for those who 
miss the cut. 
</P>
<P>
	Call it the TPA of Europe.  
</P>
<P>
	Ryder Cup captain Mark James confirmed that about 70 to 80  
players already have signed the petition, although ``at least 150 
have not signed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among those opposed is Bernard Gallacher. He resigned from the  
PGA European Tour's board of directors, on which he has served 
since 1984, when he heard several players criticized his opinion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Golf is about winning and incentive. It always has been, even  
when I turned pro in 1967, Gallacher said. ``There are 65 prizes 
every week and the rewards are there. But paying those who miss the 
cut is dead against the grain. Where is the money going to come 
from?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The British Open paid about $1,500 to those who didn't qualify  
for weekend play at Carnoustie. Roger Chapman, a member of the 
tournament committee who has never won on the European tour, wants 
the same policy for regular events. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are the only sport where most of the players don't get paid  
for entertaining the public,'' he said. ``We are not whining and 
neither are we jealous about the big money being paid to -- or won 
by -- top stars. 
</P>
<P>
	``But there are a lot of players who do not have sponsors,'' he  
said. ``They merit something for their contribution to the week's 
entertainment.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *AMAZING GRACE:* Grace Park is not only winning on the SBC  
Futures Tour, she's starting to win big. Her six-stroke victory in 
the SmartSpikes Classic was the largest on the developmental tour 
this year and the third for Park in six tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Amateur and NCAA champion is third on the money list.  
If she holds that spot, Park will earn exempt status for the LPGA 
Tour next year without having to go to qualifying school. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *WATSON'S DEBUT:* Since Tom Watson turns 50 the week after the  
Senior Tour stop in his hometown of Kansas City, Mo., he will make 
his debut among what he calls ``old friends'' in the Comfort 
Classic on Sept. 10-12 in Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't wait to start playing, and I plan to hit the ground  
running,'' Watson said. ``I hope my game will be in good enough 
shape to compete at a top level right off and win as quickly as I 
can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He will give himself ample opportunity. Watson also has  
committed to play the inaugural Bank One Championship in Dallas, 
which he calls a ``second home.'' Five of his 34 PGA Tour victories 
came in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, four of them in the Byron 
Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
	Watson last played a regular PGA Tour event at Colonial, where  
he was defending champion. He will play the PGA Championship in two 
weeks, the one major he has never won. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DIVOTS:* British Open runner-up Justin Leonard on what would  
happen if golfers had to play a course like Carnoustie every week: 
``There would be a lot of turnover. You could reduce the number of 
tournaments to five at the minimum. We'd be off playing outings the 
other 20 weeks of the year.'' ... The Subaru Memorial of Naples 
will honor Kathy Whitworth at the 2000 tournament. Whitworth won 88 
tournaments, a record for both men's and women's tours. ... The 
International ballot for the World Golf Hall of Fame has been 
distributed to 400 voters. The top candidate among 17 names is 
two-time Masters champion Bernhard Langer, who last year came up 24 
votes short of the required 75 percent. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *STAT OF THE WEEK:* Seven of the past 10 du Maurier champions  
have won only one major championship. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *FINAL WORD:* ``Great, I'll try to finish my matches before  
18.'' -- Jean Van de Velde, told that he stands a good chance to 
make Europe's Ryder Cup team.

	Consumer Confidence Falls in July  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Consumer confidence declined in July, after  
eight months of consecutive gains pushed it to a 30-year high, the 
Conference Board reported today. The private business group's index 
of consumer confidence, which measures consumers' propensity to 
spend, declined 3.5 points to 135.6, from 139.0 in June. Lynn 
Franco, associate director of the board's consumer research center, 
said the dip in confidence may reflect concerns about higher 
interest rates, tighter credit and less rosy job prospects. In a 
pre-emptive strike against inflation, Federal Reserve policy-makers 
increased interest rates modestly in June.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Cox Communications Inc. plans to buy the cable  
TV assets of Gannett Co. for $2.7 billion in the company's second 
substantial acquisition this month, The Wall Street Journal 
reported today. Under terms of the agreement, Cox would get about 
525,000 cable subscribers in Oklahoma, Kansas and North Carolina, 
the Journal said, citing unidentified sources familiar with the 
all-cash deal. Cox would be paying about $5,100 per subscriber, a 
new high in the cable industry, the newspaper said. The deal would

	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc. plans to sell 43  
radio stations in nine markets to Entercom Communications Corp. for 
$821.5 million in cash. The deal announced yesterday would be the

limits on how many stations a single company may own were relaxed. 
Entercom, based in Bala Cynwyd, Pa., near Philadelphia, already 
owns 42 radio stations in six markets. The sale would also allow 
Sinclair to concentrate on its TV operations. The Baltimore-based

charges alleging the company boosted profits by pocketing unclaimed 
customer accounts. The sentencing by U.S. District Judge John G. 
Koeltl came less than two weeks after three former bank executives 
were indicted on charges they converted $15.5 million in unclaimed 
customer funds and credits into bank profits. The scheme allegedly 
took place between 1989 and 1996. Lawyers for Bankers Trust had 
entered a guilty plea on behalf of the company to charges that it 
made false entries in bank books and records to create the profits.

	EU Widens Asbestos Ban

<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- The European Union today widened the  
ban on use of asbestos to cover almost all applications of the 
cancer-causing material. The prohibition won't take full effect for 
six years. The EU's executive Commission said the 15 member nations 
have until Jan. 1, 2005, to remove from the market all white 
asbestos, otherwise known as chrysotile, which is still used in 
pipes and roofing, brake and clutch linings for heavy vehicles and 
various specialist uses. The only exception to the new ruling is 
the use of chrysotile in the production of chlorine, since no 
alternative product is available and the risk to health is low.

<HEADLINE> Actor Stabbed in Sword Fight Scene </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORTHAMPTON, Mass. (AP) -- An actor in an Elizabethan drama was  
rushed to the hospital after being accidentally stabbed during a 
swordfight scene. 
</P>
<P>
	Rydwyn Davies, 21, suffered a 2-inch puncture wound Saturday and  
was released from the hospital the same day. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was one of the scariest moments,'' director Tim Holcomb  
said Tuesday. ``We went from thrilling to chilling in a moment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davies was hurt Saturday when he failed to step out of the way  
of a thrust by fellow actor Lon Bull, 50, during a performance in a 
city park. 
</P>
<P>
	Davies walked off stage, and a nurse with the Hampshire  
Shakespeare Co. drove him to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	The swords were about 3 feet long with dulled edges and round  
tips. Holcomb said the sword slipped between pieces of the actor's 
costume armor, which was made of pickle barrels. 
</P>
<P>
	Davies was playing the role of Sir Henry Greene in ``Thomas of  
Woodstock.'' In the play, the character is slain. 
</P>
<P>
	After a short break, the show went on.  
</P>
<P>
	Davies returned to the stage Sunday and the play went off  
without incident.

<HEADLINE> Arafat, Barak To Discuss Peace Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- The time has come for Israeli Prime Minister  
Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to get down to 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	In their first working meeting today at the Erez crossing  
between Israel and the Gaza Strip, the two leaders are not only 
tackling the fate of the Wye River peace agreement, but setting the 
tone for their future relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	Arafat expects Barak to give him a detailed timetable for two  
Israeli troop pullbacks in the West Bank and the release of 
hundreds of Palestinian security prisoners, saying this is the 
minimum Israel must deliver to restore the trust eroded during 
three years of rule by Barak's hard-line predecessor, Benjamin 
Netanyahu. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak hopes to persuade Arafat to forego the second Wye  
pullback. 
</P>
<P>
	The Israeli prime minister, a former armed forces chief of  
staff, wants to avoid any withdrawal that would turn a number of 
Jewish settlements into isolated enclaves surrounded by 
Palestinian-controlled areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak argues that such settlements could become targets for  
attack by Palestinian militants. He has warned in the past that 
terror attacks would stop the peace talks and is trying to make 
Arafat see that it is also in the Palestinians' interest to avoid 
creating such flashpoints. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak is also reluctant to give back land now in the eastern  
part of the West Bank, including the Jordan Valley and the Judean 
Desert. Under the security doctrine held for years by his Labor 
Party, the Jordan Valley should always remain under Israeli control 
as a first line of defense against a surprise Arab attack. 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange for Arafat forgoing a second Wye pullback, Barak may  
offer a more appealing first withdrawal that would turn several 
scattered Palestinian-controlled areas into larger blocs, said 
Communications Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer who is close to Barak. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not saying, `let's not implement this section concerning  
the Judean Desert,'' Ben-Eliezer told Israel army radio. ``He is 
saying, `let's give you something else instead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After an initial troop pullback, Barak wants to begin  
negotiations on a permanent peace agreement, including the final 
status of the West Bank and Gaza as well as the fate of Jerusalem, 
the settlements and Palestinian refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	Opposition leader Ariel Sharon said that while Israel was  
obligated under the Wye accord to withdraw from 13.1 percent of the 
West Bank, it was entirely up to the Israeli government to decide 
which areas to hand over. 
</P>
<P>
	The pullback plan to which Barak has objections was proposed by  
the army, said Sharon who served as foreign minister under 
Netanyahu and was involved in negotiating the Wye accord. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Mr. Barak doesn't like this map, he can draw another one,''  
Sharon told army radio. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak has said he is prepared to implement the Wye agreement in  
full if the Palestinians insist. 
</P>
<P>
	The chief Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erekat, said today that  
Arafat would not settle for anything less then speedy and complete 
implementation. 
</P>
<P>
	Erekat said Arafat expected to hear details from Barak on how  
and when he would carry out troop pullbacks and release 
Palestinians held by Israel on charges of anti-Israeli violence. 
The Wye agreement also stipulates that Israel open two so-called 
``safe passage'' routes that link the West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
	Netanyahu implemented the first phase of Wye, a withdrawal from  
2 percent, but then froze the agreement in December, charging that 
the Palestinians had reneged on their security commitments, such as 
disarming Palestinian militants. 
</P>
<P>
	A complete implementation of Wye would leave the Palestinians  
with full or partial control over 40 percent of the West Bank, from 
27 percent now. Arafat is not expected to give on this point 
because he feels that as it is, he has few bargaining chips heading 
into the final status talks with Barak.

<HEADLINE> Fat Acceptance Group Gathering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- They use words like ``flabulous'' and refer to  
each other as ``people of size.'' Their message: It's OK to be 
overweight. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our concept is that big is beautiful,'' said Jody Abrams,  
activism chairwoman for the National Association for the 
Advancement of Fat Acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
	About 700 NAAFA members were in Boston today to kickoff the  
group's five-day convention, which is billed as an effort to spread 
the message that no one should feel self-conscious about their 
weight. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goal is to promote body diversity and size acceptance,''  
said the 38-year-old Abrams, who recently left a job as a social 
worker to open a Saugus clothing boutique called ``Bodacious 
Babes'' that caters to heavyset women. 
</P>
<P>
	NAAFA, based in Sacramento, Calif., has members all over the  
United States and in a handful of foreign countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Peggy Berg, who heads NAAFA's Connecticut chapter, said she used  
to worry about what people thought of her body. The 64-year-old 
retired bookkeeper discovered NAAFA nine years ago and also 
convinced her 37-year-old daughter to join. They both have become 
more comfortable with their plus-size bodies. 
</P>
<P>
	``She went back to school, she joined a bowling league,'' Berg  
said. ``You don't have to lose weight to find some self-respect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abrams and Berg both believe there is widespread discrimination  
against fat people in American society. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing is made in a size to fit a person who does not fit  
society's idea of what a normal-sized person is,'' said Berg.

<HEADLINE> MGM Reports $249.8 Million Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) -- Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. lost $249.8  
million during the second quarter as the company took charges to 
cover the cost of layoffs and other restructuring activities. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss, forecast by the company last month, amounted to $1.65  
per share. That compared to a loss of $55 million, or 84 cents per 
share, during the year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
	Restructuring charges included $85 million in severance and  
other personnel costs and $140 million in film-related writedowns. 
</P>
<P>
	The company reported revenues of $212.2 million in the three  
months ended June 30, down from $281.2 million in the year-ago 
period. 
</P>
<P>
	Film and television revenues also declined during the period, in  
part because MGM released only one theatrical film during the 1999 
quarter, compared to three a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The studio laid off 80 employees last year in a cost-cutting  
program. MGM also has said it would halt development of new 
television shows to focus its limited resources on 10 programs 
already scheduled to air this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	For the six months ending June 30, MGM lost $556 million, or  
$3.69 per share, on revenue of $470.9 million. In the first six 
months of 1998 the studio lost $73.7 million, or $1.12 per share, 
on revenue of 597.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The studio has struggled financially for more than a decade as a  
result of ownership changes and the sale of key assets. 
</P>
<P>
	MGM went public in 1997, a year after billionaire Kirk Kerkorian  
purchased the studio for a third time. In documents filed at the 
time of the public offering, MGM officials said they did not expect 
to turn a profit for several years. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week MGM said it was seeking approval from the Securities  
and Exchange Commission to sell $750 million in stock to pay debts, 
cover restructuring costs and raise working cash. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the money will go toward a $112.5 million payment MGM  
owes Warner Home Video to cover costs from the early termination of 
a video-distribution deal. Tracinda Corp. has agreed to buy any 
shares not purchased by existing stockholders and the public, MGM 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	MGM shares were down 93 3/4 cents to $19.43 3/4 in trading on the New  
York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Columbia/HCLA Beats Expectations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Second-quarter earnings for Columbia/HCA  
Healthcare slightly beat expectations, helped by strong patient 
admissions at its hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's largest hospital company, which for more than two  
years has been the target of a federal billing fraud investigation, 
reported income of $181 million, or 31 cents per share in the 
second quarter, down from $191 million or 30 cents per share in the 
same period a year ago. The profit excluded gains on the sale of 
hospitals, restructuring and investigation-related costs. Results 
beat Wall Street forecasts by 1 cent, according to First Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they are moving along very nicely from the standpoint  
of improving their financial results without sacrificing patient 
care,'' said Joe Chiarelli, an analyst with J.P. Morgan Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Including one-time charges and gains, income for the quarter was  
$106 million, or 18 cents per share, compared to $78 million, or 12 
cents per share, in the second quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues were down, totaling $4.2 billion for the quarter,  
compared to $4.8 billion in the second quarter of 1998. However, 
Columbia saw a 1.1 percent increase in patient admissions to 
hospitals the company operated at least one year. It was the third 
straight quarterly increase in admissions. 
</P>
<P>
	During the second quarter, Columbia completed the spinoffs of 61  
hospitals into two companies, LifePoint Hospitals Inc. and Triad 
Hospitals Inc., netting the company $900 million. LifePoint 
reported net income for the quarter of $1 million, or 4 cents per 
share, on revenues of $128.2 million. Triad will report its results 
next month. 
</P>
<P>
	Also during the quarter, Columbia sold its investments in eight  
hospitals and other assets for about $160 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Columbia officials continue negotiations with the  
federal government in an attempt to end the investigation. Earlier 
this month, two Columbia middle managers in Florida were convicted 
of defrauding the government by overcharging federal health 
programs. It was the first criminal convictions to stem from the 
investigation, which started more than two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia's profit for the first six months of 1999 was $428  
million, or 70 cents per share, on revenues of $8.8 billion, 
compared to $275 million, or 43 cents a share, on $9.7 billion in 
revenue during the first half of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Nashville-based Columbia now operates 220 hospitals and 85  
ambulatory surgery centers, compared to a year ago when it ran 335 
hospitals and 144 surgery center. 
</P>
<P>
	Edward Vanacore, an analyst with Sutro &AMP; Co., said Columbia  
benefitted from higher fees from managed care companies. ``That was 
really the key to the quarter,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia says the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, which reduced  
Medicare reimbursements to hospitals, cost the company $25 million 
to $30 million in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Columbia fell 18 3/4 cents to $23.50 in trading on the  
New York Stock Exchange.

	Brand, the NBA's top draft pick last month, signed a three-year  
contract Monday. He was to report today to the Bulls, who are 
participating in the Rocky Mountain Summer League in Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	A team source who requested anonymity said the package totals  
about $10 million, with most of the money coming at the end of the 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a dream of mine. I've been working hard for it,''  
Brand said after emerging from Bulls headquarters with his mother 
in suburban Deerfield. ``I'm ready to get started and help the 
Bulls. We want to start with the rebuilding and try to get back in 
the win column and get into the playoffs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-8, 260-pound forward who spent the last month playing  
with the U.S. national team in the Olympic-qualifying tournament in 
Puerto Rico is a solid building block for the Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	Brand said there's plenty he can do -- a short-range jumper and a  
perimeter game -- that he just never got to show at Duke. 
</P>
<P>
	``I realize the expectations that come with being the overall  
No. 1 draft pick, and I'm going to work hard to live up to those 
expectations,'' Brand said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Salt Lake City, Bulls coach Tim Floyd on Monday night didn't  
immediately return a telephone message. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls got the first pick by winning the draft lottery  
drawing on May 22. They finished 13-37 during the season and got 
into the lottery by virtue of not making the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls were six-time NBA champions in the 1990s, but slipped  
to near the bottom of the league when Jordan retired and Pippen was 
traded. Role players such as Rodman, Luc Longley, Steve Kerr also 
left the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Their .260 winning percentage was the lowest in franchise  
history, beating out the 1975-76 squad, which finished 24-58 with a 
.293 winning percentage. 
</P>
<P>
	Their average of 81.9 points was the lowest scoring average in  
NBA history since the inception of the shot clock. Entering this 
season, the lowest average was 87.4 points in 72 games by the 
Milwaukee Hawks in 1954-55, the season the clock was adopted. 
</P>
<P>
	Brand, a unanimous AP All-American this spring, averaged 16.2  
points, 8.9 rebounds and 1.88 blocks his two years at Duke. As a 
sophomore, he led the Atlantic Coast Conference in scoring with a 
17.7 average and rebounding with a 9.8 average. Brand averaged 17 
points and 9.2 rebounds in six NCAA tournament games as Duke 
finished as the 1999 runnerup. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago's other first-round selection, Ron Artest of St. John's,  
signed a three-year pact on July 15.

<HEADLINE> Report: Barry Sanders Will Retire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- Barry Sanders, apparently fed up with the  
Detroit Lions' mediocre record and coach Bobby Ross, will retire 
from the NFL, his agent told ESPN Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	David Ware, one of the two agents who handled the running back's  
affairs, said Sanders would issue a statement Wednesday announcing 
his retirement and wouldn't be available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	According to ESPN, Sanders told Ware and his other agent, Lamont  
Smith, of his retirement plans on Monday. The agents were unable to 
dissuade him, even with the argument that he's only 1,457 yards shy 
of the NFL career rushing record. 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN said Sanders would cite his ``desire to leave the game ...  
as greater than his desire to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lions wouldn't confirm or deny the report.  
</P>
<P>
	``At this point we really have no comment on the various reports  
regarding Barry,'' Lions spokesman Bill Keenist said Tuesday night. 
``If anything should materialize, there will be an announcement. To 
comment any further would be speculation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ware and Smith didn't return calls seeking comment from The  
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Ross said the Lions would not trade Sanders. That  
came after a report that the Washington Redskins were interested in 
pursuing a trade for the running back. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders was the only veteran absent from the Lions' mandatory  
minicamp in May. 
</P>
<P>
	Ross and other members of the front office said they had not  
heard from Sanders in the offseason, and missed the mandatory and 
voluntary minicamps. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been reports that Sanders was unhappy with the Lions,  
but Sanders has not spoken publicly -- to the Lions or the media. 
</P>
<P>
	Veterans are scheduled to report to camp on Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Smith, Sanders' Denver-based agent, said the player  
issued a gag order forbidding his representatives from discussing 
the situation. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders was a training-camp holdout in 1989, 1991 and 1997. All  
were related to contract negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders, 31, has 15,269 career rushing yards, trailing the  
Chicago Bears' Walter Payton by 1,457 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lions have won only one playoff game in Sanders' 10 seasons  
in Detroit. They have had two 5-11 seasons sandwiched around a 9-7 
record in 1997 that earned a wild-card spot in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Sanders hasn't spoken publicly this offseason, others  
have expressed the depth of his frustration. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders' father, William Sanders, of Wichita, Kan., had  
previously raised the possibility of retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's sick of them (the Lions),'' William Sanders said in May.  
``He's sick of losing.''

<HEADLINE> Shuttle Aiming for Night Landing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- With the first female commander at  
the controls, space shuttle Columbia streaked toward Earth late 
Tuesday after a short trip into orbit to drop off the world's most 
powerful X-ray telescope. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Force Col. Eileen Collins and her co-pilot fired the braking  
rockets an hour before the scheduled 11:20 p.m. touchdown, putting 
the shuttle on a gradual plunge. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins and her crew hoped the rare night landing would go more  
smoothly than their launch, which was delayed twice and plagued by 
a possible hydrogen fuel leak and a short circuit. NASA said 
neither problem would affect touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	The 42-year-old former test pilot, who twice served as a shuttle  
co-pilot, guided Columbia on a course that was to have it passing 
over central Texas, southern Louisiana, down across the Gulf of 
Mexico and on into Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA's landing strip was illuminated with xenon lights, and the  
moon was nearly full. It was to be the 12th night landing out of 95 
shuttle flights. 
</P>
<P>
	The mileage for the trip: a relatively modest 1.8 million miles.  
</P>
<P>
	Collins and her four crewmates blasted off Friday on NASA's  
shortest planned mission since 1990 -- five days. Only one flight, 
in 1997, was shorter; a defective fuel cell ended that 
laboratory-research mission after only four days. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia made it to orbit safely despite what photographs  
suggest was a hydrogen leak during the launch. An engine could have 
shut down if more fuel had seeped out, forcing the first emergency 
landing for a shuttle. 
</P>
<P>
	A leak could explain why Columbia ended up in a slightly lower  
orbit than planned. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA will examine the shuttle's engines to determine whether  
there indeed was a leak and also what caused the short circuit five 
seconds after liftoff. 
</P>
<P>
	The astronauts accomplished their main goal just seven hours  
into the flight, flawlessly releasing the $1.5 billion Chandra 
X-Ray Observatory, which began a five-year journey to search for 
signs of black holes and study galaxies and quasars. 
</P>
<P>
	Chandra is using its thrusters to eventually reach an orbit  
extending one-third of the way to the moon. 
</P>
<P>
	Next up for Columbia is a piggyback ride on a Boeing 747 to  
California for a yearlong overhaul. Columbia, the oldest of NASA's 
four shuttles, will become the second to be equipped with a modern, 
Boeing 777-style cockpit, featuring nine high-resolution, 
liquid-crystal computer screens rather than the three old-fashioned 
ones. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``glass cockpit'' -- which shuttle pilots say will help them  
deal better with emergencies -- will make its debut on a flight by 
space shuttle Atlantis late this year.

<HEADLINE> Cruise Ship Runs Aground in Alaska </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) -- More than 90 passengers were rescued from  
a small cruise ship after it struck a rock Tuesday in a coastal 
inlet and began flooding. 
</P>
<P>
	No injuries were reported.  
</P>
<P>
	The 192-foot ship was about 100 yards from shore in Alaska's  
Inside Passage -- a long, narrow stretch that offers spectacular 
views of glaciers, fjords, mountains and wildlife -- when it radioed 
a mayday call at 9:06 a.m., reporting that it was taking on water 
``out of control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All passengers were transferred to another tourist boat. A few  
crew members stayed behind to try to save the ship and reported by 
early afternoon that they were having success in pumping the water 
out. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've got it under control,'' Coast Guard spokesman Roger  
Wetherell said. The crew members were in no danger, he said. Water 
temperatures in the area are generally in the 50s. 
</P>
<P>
	Two helicopters dropped pumps to help with the flooding and the  
Coast Guard sent a cutter to the scene, Wetherell said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spirit of '98 is one of seven small cruise ships operated by  
Seattle-based Alaska Sightseeing-Cruise West. 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Novak-Beatty, vice president of sales and marketing, said  
there were 94 passengers and a crew of 22, for a total of 116 on 
board, when it hit a rock. Wetherell put the number of crew members 
at 26. 
</P>
<P>
	The ship, which has an 1890s decor and is built to resemble the  
old-time coastal cruising vessels, was on its way from Seattle to 
Juneau. 
</P>
<P>
	The site is 16 miles into Tracy Arm, a long, narrow fjord about  
40 miles southeast of Juneau, Alaska's capital. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the third small cruise ship to run aground this summer.  
The Wilderness Adventurer grounded last month in Glacier Bay 
National Park and Reserve, spilling more than 200 gallons of fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the Wilderness Explorer, owned by the same company as  
the Wilderness Adventurer, ran aground in an inlet 70 miles west of 
Juneau. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no injuries in either incident.

<HEADLINE> ABC Presents Paris Fashions Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Other people dress fit to kill. When I get  
dressed, I look fit to be killed. 
</P>
<P>
	I'm the kind of fashion fugitive who would buy clothes  
shrink-wrapped at the 7-Eleven if I could. My glad rags are 
depressed. As a clothes horse, I'm a nag. 
</P>
<P>
	For me and others likewise sartorially challenged, ``Paris  
Fashion Collections'' is sure to be an eye-opener. For everyone 
else, it will simply be eye-popping. 
</P>
<P>
	The one-hour special, which ABC airs Thursday at 9 p.m. EDT,  
showcases 25 of the world's top fashion designers (names like John 
Galliano for Christian Dior, Alexander McQueen for Givenchy, 
Jean-Paul Gaultier, Christian Lacroix) along with their 1999 lines, 
which were unveiled in Paris last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Still being edited, the program was unavailable for review. But  
a six-minute clip reel caught my eye tout de suite. 
</P>
<P>
	Here's a young woman wrapped in a white sheath with a huge Davy  
Crockett cap on her head. Here's a jumpsuit-clad model whose 
billowing train is a pink-and-orange parachute. And here's a rare 
bird: a gal in a dress all of feathers. 
</P>
<P>
	We're talking haute couture (say, ``oat koo tour''). Which means  
high fashion, bubba. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides spotlighting the very fabulous fashion shows (staged at  
very fabulous places like Versailles), ``Paris Fashion 
Collections'' hears from fabulous attendees like Madonna, Sean 
``Puffy'' Combs, Boy George and George Lucas. 
</P>
<P>
	And the program goes behind the scenes. For example, there's a  
peek inside the House of Chanel with Karl Lagerfeld, who 
demonstrates how a couture design starts as a concept and 
culminates in a fabulous gown. 
</P>
<P>
	Host for a second year is Isabella Rossellini, who as an  
internationally famous supermodel and acclaimed actress -- as well 
as author, daughter of Ingrid Bergman and director Roberto 
Rossellini, and former spokeswoman for Lancome cosmetics -- knows a 
little something about glamour and style. 
</P>
<P>
	``But why does fashion matter?'' I ask her.  
</P>
<P>
	``It matters for the same reason that film matters or music  
matters,'' she says brightly. ``It isn't necessary, you don't need 
it. But it's fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And, on second thought: ``Fun, we need!''  
</P>
<P>
	On the special, Rossellini will have fun wearing Chanel and  
Valentino, but for this recent interview she looks lovely in 
everyday finery: slacks and blouse. Her hair is shorn impishly 
short and she wears no makeup. Meanwhile, I am wearing scuffed 
Rockports and a $3 street-fair tie. It occurs to me I should go on 
``Sally'' for a makeover. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes fashion seems a little frivolous,'' I venture.  
</P>
<P>
	Rossellini smiles an incandescent smile.  
</P>
<P>
	``Fashion IS frivolity -- as music is melody or dance is rhythm!  
It really is the industry of playfulness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``But what exactly IS haute couture?'' I ask, pleased at having  
said it right. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very confusing,'' she replied. ``There's always been a  
misconception that these are clothes you have to wear.'' She shook 
her head. 
</P>
<P>
	``The haute couture is very experimental fashion. A lab of  
ideas. It's like (George) Lucas opening a door and saying, `This is 
the new special effect that I'm working (on) for the film that I 
might be doing five or six years from now.' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is what haute couture is: a glimpse of what might be the  
future. Some of the ideas, we can never use them. But some of the 
things will trickle down to Levi jeans and the Gap.'' 
</P>
<P>
	I consider Galliano's hot pants and chain-link skirt get-up: On  
sale someday at Montgomery Ward? Mon Dieu! 
</P>
<P>
	But the more pressing goal of haute couture is to generate buzz  
(le buzz?) among the couture cognoscenti. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to be excessive so that you can make the point,''  
Rossellini explains. ``The daringness is important, because if it 
wasn't daring, we would still be busy wearing corsets. That's why 
I'm grateful to it!'' And she bursts out laughing. 
</P>
<P>
	Rossellini has just finished shooting ``Don Quixote,'' which  
will air on cable's TNT next season. She is about to appear in a 
new performance piece by Robert Wilson at Lincoln Center. And later 
this year she will launch her own cosmetic line, Isabella 
Rossellini's Manifesto. 
</P>
<P>
	Her own manifesto, after 47 years of classy singularity: Be  
yourself. 
</P>
<P>
	``You are successful if you are unique,'' declares the woman  
with the chipped front tooth she refused to fix when she began 
modeling. ``If you bow down, if you become common, then they don't 
want you. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's always this pressure to level out,'' she allows. ``But  
what they really want'' -- and by ``they'' she means the audience, 
whatever the show -- ``is people's specificity ... what you can give 
as an individual. 
</P>
<P>
	``Level out?'' She flashes a look of mock-horror. ``That's the  
LAST thing we want! Ignore that pressure! That's my advice.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------

<HEADLINE> Angioplasty Better for Elderly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Angioplasty is slightly better than  
clot-dissolving drugs at saving the lives of heart attack victims 
over 65, researchers reported today in the Journal of the American 
Medical Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers also found that about half of the patients who  
were considered ideal candidates got neither treatment, suggesting 
the elderly are not getting adequate care. 
</P>
<P>
	``More attention needs to be paid to treating eligible elderly  
Americans with these life-saving techniques,'' said one researcher, 
Dr. Nathan Every, a professor of medicine at the University of 
Washington in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings, based on records of 80,356 heart-attack patients  
from 1994 to 1996, parallel similar research in younger patients. 
</P>
<P>
	A heart attack occurs when a clot forms in one of the arteries  
of the heart, blocking the heart muscle's blood supply. In 
angioplasty, a flexible tube with a tiny balloon at the tip is 
inserted into the blocked artery to clear the blockage. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the angioplasty patients studied had a 19 percent  
higher survival rate after one year compared with patients who 
received clot-dissolving drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Within six hours of arrival at the hospital, 2,038 patients  
underwent angioplasty, while 18,645 received clot-dissolving drugs. 
A total of 59,673 received neither treatment within six hours. 
</P>
<P>
	The study's findings are important because heart attacks are the  
leading killer of older Americans, according to the American Heart 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Sidney Smith, past president of the heart association, noted  
that the death rate after one year among subjects receiving either 
treatment was about half that of other patients -- 17.6 percent vs. 
33 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Many doctors have been cautious about using clot-dissolving  
drugs among the elderly because the drugs raise the risk of 
complications such as strokes. And most hospitals are not equipped 
to do angioplasties, so clot-dissolvers are the only option. 
</P>
<P>
	In the study, strokes indeed were more common among patients  
receiving clot-dissolvers -- 3 percent vs. 2.1 percent -- but the 
rate was relatively low in both groups, Smith noted. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Alan Berger, the study's lead author, said the choice of  
therapy is less important than the speed in using it. 
</P>
<P>
	He said more older people need to react quickly to heart attack  
symptoms, which can include pressure in the chest, shortness of 
breath, pain or pressure radiating down one arm, nausea and profuse 
sweating. 
</P>
<P>
	``All a patient can do is recognize when they have a heart  
attack and call 911 to get to the hospital,'' he said. Berger, 
formerly of Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington, is 
now a research fellow at Yale University School of Medicine in New 
Haven, Conn.

<HEADLINE>  Asian Stock Markets Close Mixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stock markets closed mixed Tuesday, with  
prices falling in Tokyo and Manila but surging in Seoul and Hong 
Kong. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 28.62  
points, or 0.16 percent, to close the session at 17,462.72. On 
Monday, the average lost 43.10 points, or 0.25 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei has fallen 1,069.86 points in five sessions as  
players take profits amid gains in the Japanese yen and on the 
sense that shares are overvalued. 
</P>
<P>
	Sachio Ishikawa, a stock division manager at Chuo Securities,  
said that in the absence of fresh trading factors, the market was 
focusing on the dollar-yen rate. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the dollar was quoted at 116.58 yen, up  
0.14 yen from late Monday in Tokyo but below its late New York 
level of 116.61 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Gains in the yen make Japanese exports more costly abroad and  
less competitive, while cutting the value of foreign revenue in yen 
terms. 
</P>
<P>
	Philippine share prices tumbled on heavy foreign selling  
triggered by renewed fears of higher U.S. interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Growing political controversy over Philippine President Joseph  
Estrada's proposed amendment to the country's constitution, aimed 
mostly at political and economic reforms, also weighed on the 
market, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-company Philippine Stock Exchange Index (PSE Index) fell  
113 points, or 4.8 percent, to 2,263.12. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korea share prices rebounded sharply higher, with the key  
index surging 6.4 percent as jitters over Daewoo Group's financial 
troubles eased in the financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The Korea Composite Stock Price Index rose 55.91 points to  
928.85. The index had fallen 11 percent, or 103.72 points, in the 
past two sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Kim Woo-choong, the head of Daewoo, pledged to  
faithfully carry out restructuring to retain trust from markets and 
investors because of concerns the group could drag down the entire 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong stocks rebounded after four straight sessions of  
declines. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of  
blue chips, rose 208.57 points, or 1.6 percent, to close at 
13,075.09. On Monday, the index had slumped 227.18 points, or 1.7 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Brokers described the rally as a technical rebound following  
recent sharp falls caused by fears of a possible rise in U.S. 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Rallies in some Asian bourses, especially South Korea, also  
boosted the Hong Kong market. 
</P>
<P>
	Singapore shares also surged as the market rallied after a week  
of sustained selling, dealers said. The benchmark Straits Times 
Index rose 59.45 points, or 3.1 percent, to close at 1,999.42. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA: Indonesian shares slumped for the third consecutive day  
on growing concerns over the domestic political situation ahead of 
the presidential election in November. The Composite Index fell 3.3 
percent, or 19.505 points, to 573.216. 
</P>

<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- President Clinton and Hillary Rodham  
Clinton, who is expected to seek a Senate seat from New York next 
year, will spend part of their summer vacation in the Finger Lakes 
region of the state. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons will spend Aug. 30 to Sept. 3 in Skaneateles, a  
quiet resort town of 7,500 people on Skaneateles Lake just 
southwest of Syracuse, said Marsha Berry, the first lady's 
spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple will stay at the lakeside home of Thomas McDonald, a  
real estate developer, aides said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons are heading back to Martha's Vineyard on Aug. 17  
for a fifth summer vacation. They plan to be there until Aug. 28 
when they will head to the posh Hamptons on Long Island for a 
series of fund-raising events staged by the Democratic National 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Skaneateles (pronounced scan-ee-AT-less) is a 205-year-old  
village that was once a stop on the Underground Railroad that 
ferried slaves north to freedom before the Civil War.

<HEADLINE> Pollution 'Hot Spots' ID'd in Serbia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- U.N. experts examining the  
environmental consequences of NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia urged 
Tuesday that action be taken immediately to clean up pollution 
``hot spots'' in Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
	Pekka Haavisto, head of the U.N. team that checked some of the  
sites targeted most often by NATO, urged the West to act ``quite 
rapidly to avoid any future damage to human lives and to the 
environment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. team found some ``hot spots'' of pollution affected by  
the NATO bombing -- particularly in the heavily targeted Serb towns 
of Pancevo and Kragujevac, where mercury, asbestos and other 
hazardous substances were found spilled into the environment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I strongly would recommend that this kind of action should be  
taken as part of humanitarian action to the area despite all the 
political problems that might be connected to the reconstruction,'' 
Haavisto told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States and its allies have refused to give any  
reconstruction aid to Yugoslavia while President Slobodan Milosevic 
is in power, saying they will provide only humanitarian assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. Environmental Program team carried out a nine-day  
investigation at some of the sites targeted most often by NATO 
during its 78-day campaign. Yugoslav officials have said strikes on 
factories and other targets caused widespread environmental damage 
and health hazards. 
</P>
<P>
	Haavisto suggested that the damage was not as severe as the  
Serbs had claimed. ``There are some hot spots where immediate 
action has to take place but there is not a countrywide 
catastrophe. This is our first judgment,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the environmental problems predated the NATO bombing,  
although airstrikes may have worsened some of them, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. team visited factories and oil refineries hit by NATO  
throughout Yugoslavia during the campaign, which began March 24. 
Haavisto said the discovery of the hazardous materials in Pancevo, 
northwest of the Yugoslav capital Belgrade, and Kragujevac in 
central Serbia was ``very worrying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the initial findings did not show an increased level of  
radioactivity from any bombs containing depleted uranium as was 
feared. But he noted there might be other consequences of such 
bombing that still need to be examined. 
</P>
<P>
	The team's final report -- expected by early September -- will go  
to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who will decide on possible 
corrective measures.

<HEADLINE> Fla. Eyes Marijuana-Killing Fungus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Florida may start testing a fungus that  
could kill marijuana plants -- a move that environmentalists say 
could ultimately backfire if the fungus mutates and attacks crops 
like tomatoes and corn. 
</P>
<P>
	Two state agencies have given approval for the tests to be  
conducted in a quarantine lab on the fungus Fusarium oxysporum, a 
bioherbicide designed to destroy plants like marijuana, 55,000 
plants of which were destroyed in the state last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida's anti-drug czar said Tuesday that nothing would happen  
anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we would be years away from using this,'' said James  
McDonough, director of the state Office of Drug Control. 
</P>
<P>
	McDonough said he hasn't made any recommendations to Gov. Jeb  
Bush about the idea of dusting suspected areas with the pot-eating 
fungus. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmentalists said they're concerned about fooling with  
Mother Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida Department of Environmental Protection Secretary David  
Struhs has warned that introducing the fungus into the wild could 
cause disease in crops, including tomatoes and corn. 
</P>
<P>
	Others are worried that the fungus could get out of control like  
the weed kudzu, a vine planted for soil stabilization that has 
grown like wild in South. 
</P>
<P>
	``We tend to manipulate the environment sometimes with these  
biological introductions,'' said David Gluckman, lobbyist for the 
Florida Wildlife Federation. ``We're paying the price for that 
now.''

<HEADLINE> Opposition to Hinckley Leave Dropped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government has decided not to appeal a  
court ruling that allows John W. Hinckley Jr., the man who tried to 
kill President Reagan, to take supervised day trips from the mental 
hospital where he has been confined since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department spokesman Myron Marlin confirmed Tuesday the  
government let Monday's deadline pass without appealing to the 
Supreme Court for review of a federal appeals court decision. He 
declined to give a reason. 
</P>
<P>
	Hinckley's lawyer, Barry Levine, said, ``He is no longer a  
danger to himself or to others.'' Levine declined to say whether 
Hinckley already has made any supervised trips away from St. 
Elizabeths Hospital since the appeals court cleared the way for 
such visits in April. 
</P>
<P>
	Over prosecutors' opposition, a three-judge federal appeals  
panel granted permission in January for off-campus trips supervised 
by hospital staff. The full U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the 
District of Columbia refused to reconsider the decision in April. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court's ruling gives hospital officials discretion  
to decide when and where Hinckley can take such day trips. 
</P>
<P>
	Court approval still would be required for unsupervised trips.  
</P>
<P>
	Hinckley, 43, has been confined to St. Elizabeths since 1982,  
when he was acquitted by reason of insanity in the 1981 shooting 
attack on Reagan outside a Washington hotel. The president, press 
secretary James Brady and two law enforcement officers were wounded 
in a shooting that Hinckley later said was an attempt to impress 
actress Jodie Foster. 
</P>
<P>
	Levine said the appeals court's ruling was ``the precursor to  
much larger liberties'' for Hinckley, such as the possibility of 
trips not supervised by hospital personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want the public ... to feel confident and comfortable that  
it is appropriate and that John is not a threat,'' Levine said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hospital officials have said that as part of his treatment,  
Hinckley should be allowed visits off hospital grounds, supervised 
by hospital staff. 
</P>
<P>
	But prosecutors who argued against the off-campus visits said  
Hinckley remained disturbed and unpredictable. 
</P>
<P>
	The Secret Service and U.S. attorney's office are to be notified  
whenever a trip is planned. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1986, Hinckley left the hospital for a visit with his family  
during the Christmas holiday. After that, prosecutors sought a 
court order that they be notified before such excursions. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge had turned down Hinckley's request for a  
Christmastime visit with his parents and girlfriend in 1997. 
Hinckley appealed to the three-judge appeals panel that decided to 
allow his off-campus visits.

<HEADLINE> Fumes Delay Flights Into Chicago </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AURORA, Ill. (AP) -- Flights into Chicago and through the Midwest  
were delayed Tuesday night when fumes from maintenance work in an 
air traffic control center bothered some of the controllers. 
</P>
<P>
	The fumes came from a nontoxic sealer that workers applied  
Monday in the center's attic said Eliot Brenner, spokesman for the 
Federal Aviation Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas Hartman, an officer in the local of the National Air  
Traffic Controllers Association, said 50 air traffic controllers 
left work Monday and Tuesday and five were hospitalized after 
complaining that the sealant caused nausea, blurred vision, 
headaches and rashes. 
</P>
<P>
	Brenner said the FAA sent home nonessential personnel, extended  
rest breaks and brought in ventilation fans after workers 
complained of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the incident caused delays of up to two hours for  
flights into Chicago's O'Hare and Midway airports, outbound flights 
were not affected. Traffic flying through the area was mostly 
rerouted to the south, which extended some flight times. 
</P>
<P>
	The Aurora Fire Department inspected the center Tuesday  
afternoon and declared it safe. A spokeswoman for the hospital 
where five controllers were taken said she expected them to be 
treated for chemical inhalation and released.

<HEADLINE> Monsanto Posts Strong Earnings Gain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Monsanto's second quarter earnings soared 34  
percent, spurred by strong sales of its Roundup herbicide and 
Celebrex arthritis treatment drug. 
</P>
<P>
	The St. Louis-based company's profit for the quarter was $344  
million, or 53 cents a share, up from $257 million, or 41 cents a 
share, in the same period in 1998. The results beat Wall Street 
forecasts by 8 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Monsanto rose 37 1/2 cents to $40.37 1/2 in trading on the  
New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Second-quarter sales rose to $2.6 billion from $2.1 billion in  
the year ago period. Those figures do not include sales for 
artificial sweeteners and biogums, which the company now classifies 
as discontinued operations because its planning to sell them. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of Celebrex, the hottest new prescription drug of 1999,  
rose 14 percent in the second quarter to $318 million, compared to 
the first quarter of 1999. The drug, which delivers relief from 
arthritis pain with a lower risk of causing ulcers, was introduced 
in January. Celebrex makes up more than one third of Monsanto's 
drug revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	Celebrex is now in heated competition with Vioxx, Merck's new  
arthritis and pain pill. Vioxx was introduced in May. 
</P>
<P>
	Searle, Monsanto's pharmaceutical division, had a $937 million  
in second-quarter sales. That compared to sales of $607 million in 
the second quarter of 1998. Celebrex became the most-prescribed 
arthritis prescription medication in the United States, with more 
than seven million prescriptions dispensed, company officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our performance so far this year is further evidence that our  
strategies are valid and that we're executing them effectively in 
the marketplace,'' said Robert B. Shapiro, Monsanto's chairman and 
chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	The agricultural division had sales of $1.6 billion, up from  
$1.4 billion a year ago. In addition to Roundup, Shapiro cited an 
accelerated adoption of crops using Monsanto's biotechnology 
traits. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first half of the year, Monsanto earnings rose 5 percent  
to $476 million, or 73 cents per share, on record sales of $4.9 
billion. In the first half of 1998, Monsanto earned $453 million, 
or 73 cents a share, on sales of $3.8 billion.

</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei has fallen 1,069.86 points in five sessions as  
players take profits amid gains in the Japanese yen and on the 
sense that shares are overvalued. 
</P>
<P>
	Sachio Ishikawa, a stock division manager at Chuo Securities,  
said that in the absence of fresh trading factors, the market was 
focusing on the dollar-yen rate. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the dollar was quoted at 116.58 yen, up  
0.14 yen from late Monday in Tokyo but below its late New York

	Gains in the yen make Japanese exports more costly abroad and  
less competitive, while cutting the value of foreign revenue in yen 
terms. 
</P>
<P>
	Philippine share prices tumbled on heavy foreign selling  
triggered by renewed fears of higher U.S. interest rates.

	The Korea Composite Stock Price Index rose 55.91 points to  
928.85. The index had fallen 11 percent, or 103.72 points, in the 
past two sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Kim Woo-choong, the head of Daewoo, pledged to  
faithfully carry out restructuring to retain trust from markets and 
investors because of concerns the group could drag down the entire 
economy.

<P>
	Hong Kong stocks rebounded after four straight sessions of  
declines.

<P>
	The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of  
blue chips, rose 208.57 points, or 1.6 percent, to close at 
13,075.09. On Monday, the index had slumped 227.18 points, or 1.7 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Brokers described the rally as a technical rebound following  
recent sharp falls caused by fears of a possible rise in U.S. 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Rallies in some Asian bourses, especially South Korea, also  
boosted the Hong Kong market.

<HEADLINE> GOP, Democrats Spar Over Tax Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans and Democrats sparred Tuesday on  
the eve of Senate debate over tax cuts, with Vice President Al Gore 
accusing the GOP of ignoring Medicare and Majority Leader Trent 
Lott saying Congress should return budget surplus money to 
taxpayers to let them ``choose how to use it best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lott, R-Miss., predicted passage of the $792 billion, 10-year  
tax cut measure before the week is out, and on that, there was 
little doubt. President Clinton has vowed a veto, though, and a 
final compromise, if there is one, is weeks or months away. 
</P>
<P>
	The centerpiece of the GOP proposal would reduce the 15 percent  
income tax rate to 14 percent, effective in 2001. Beginning in 
2005, the new 14 percent tax rate would apply to some income that 
is currently taxed at 28 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Additionally, the measure provides relief from the so-called  
marriage penalty and contains tax breaks for education, IRAs, 
long-term care insurance, small businesses and estates. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats said they would counter with a cut less than half the  
size of the GOP measure, or slightly under $300 billion over 10 
years. That and other amendments were designed to showcase their 
claim that Republicans were placing Medicare's future in peril. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle said that beginning in  
2005, the GOP proposal would begin siphoning money away from Social 
Security, despite a Republican pledge to safeguard the program. 
``Even worse, Republicans don't save one dime of the surplus for 
Medicare,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton criticized Republicans at the White House, while Gore  
journeyed to the Capitol. ``The option that is being offered by the 
Republican leadership, disguised by phony bookkeeping, is to take 
virtually all of the surplus and just blow it on a risky tax scheme 
that would not save one penny for Medicare or Social Security, and 
toward what end?'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president's remarks drew an unusually sharp response  
from Lott. ``It is deep on demagoguery and shallow on substance,'' 
the majority leader said. 
</P>
<P>
	He told reporters that Republicans had ``worked assiduously'' to  
set aside $1.9 trillion of an estimated $3 trillion surplus for 
Social Security because those funds come from payroll taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We also have funds that are available for Medicare, for  
Medicare reform and for the provision of prescription drugs for 
those that really need it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But we feel very strongly that of that $3 trillion, 25 cents  
on the dollar ought to go back to the people that actually paid the 
taxes -- the tax overpayment,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Beneath the rhetoric, though, some lawmakers in both parties  
displayed concern about the tax-cutting exercise and its impact on 
the nation's economy and key programs such as Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	A small group of lawmakers of both parties was crafting a  
compromise that would cut taxes in the range of $500 billion, far 
more than Clinton has proposed, but well below what the GOP 
leadership wants. The group included Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., a 
senior Republican on the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee, as 
well as Sens. John Breaux, D-La., and Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., who also 
sit on the panel. 
</P>
<P>
	One Democrat, Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, signaled he  
might oppose any tax cut, noting that Federal Reserve Chairman Alan 
Greenspan was less than enthusiastic about such proposals in a 
recent appearance before Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	And Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., questioned the surplus estimates  
that underpin calls for tax cuts. They come from economists ``who 
can't remember their phone numbers or their home addresses'' yet 
are projecting huge surpluses, he said in remarks on the Senate 
floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Senate rules, time for debate on the tax cut bill is  
limited, and a final vote was expected Thursday night or Friday. 
Lott told reporters he hoped for compromise talks beginning this 
weekend with the House, which approved a different measure last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	But efforts to fashion a quick compromise may run into  
resistance in the House, where some Republicans favor keeping the 
issue unresolved to increase political pressure on Clinton to agree 
to a larger tax cut and to enhance GOP leverage in year-end 
negotiations on spending issues. 
</P>
<P>
	The House bill, while the same size as the Senate measure,  
includes an across-the-board tax cut and a reduction in capital 
gains taxes. Neither provision is in the Senate measure.

<P>
	Sachio Ishikawa, a stock division manager at Chuo Securities,  
said that in the absence of fresh trading factors, the market was 
focusing on the dollar-yen rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Gains in the yen make Japanese exports more costly abroad and  
less competitive, while cutting the value of foreign revenue in yen 
terms. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section fell 2.21 points, or 0.15 percent, to 1,434.11. The 
TOPIX closed down 0.17 points, or 0.01 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange was  
estimated at 462.53 million shares, up from 395.37 million shares 
Monday. Retreating issues outnumbered advancers 698 to 483, while 
130 issues were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the dollar rose Tuesday following remarks  
by U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers late Monday at a 
seminar on poor country debt relief at the International Monetary 
Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	``As I have said many times, a strong dollar is very much in the  
interest of the U.S.,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Currency market players covered their short positions following  
Summers' remarks on dollar policy, said a dealer at a European bank 
on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	After the dollar fell as low as 115.48 yen in New York late  
Monday, market participants turned cautious towards pushing the 
dollar any lower as Japan's central bank was seen as likely to 
intervene. The Bank of Japan did not intervene Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market sentiment is to the downside for the dollar,'' said  
Hajime Sato, assistant general manager of the treasury department 
at Daiwa International Trust Bank. ``Without intervention, there is 
still plenty of downside room.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The BOJ has sold the yen to buy the dollar in recent weeks to  
stem the yen's rapid rise against the greenback as part of Japanese 
financial authorities' attempts to help the nation's fledgling 
economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro traded at 124.12 yen, above its  
level of 122.68 yen in late trading Monday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 214 10-year Japanese government  
bond fell to 1.6600 percent from Monday's finish of 1.7150 percent, 
driving its price up to 101.20 yen from 100.73 yen.

<HEADLINE> Stephen King Writing Again </HEADLINE>

<P>
	BANGOR, Maine (AP) -- Stephen King is writing again, when he's  
not tied up with physical therapy. 
</P>
<P>
	King suffered broken bones and a collapsed lung when he was  
struck by a minivan June 19 while walking on a country road. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, King said he is using a laptop computer to write  
for an hour and a half each day. But he added that most of his time 
is devoted to rehabilitation.

<P>
	``SK continues to work hard at his physical rehabilitation. He  
spends more time out of bed every day, using a walker or 
wheelchair,'' the horror writer said.

<HEADLINE> Late Payments-Mortage Link Ignored </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In record numbers, Americans are saving money  
for down payments, finding homes they can afford and taking the 
plunge. But many are fairly clueless about the vital link between 
one's credit record and one's chances of getting a home mortgage, 
according to a survey by mortgage giant Fannie Mae. 
</P>
<P>
	Only two in five Americans understand that if they chronically  
fail to pay bills on time, they will have major problems getting 
lenders' approval for a mortgage, the survey released Monday shows. 
</P>
<P>
	This lack of awareness is emerging just as other obstacles to  
home ownership, such as inability to save for a down payment and 
racial discrimination, are crumbling, Fannie Mae officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's home ownership rate rose to a near-record 66.7  
percent in the first three months of this year and set records for 
blacks and Hispanics, reflecting low interest rates and low 
unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
	Franklin Raines, Fannie Mae's chairman and chief executive  
officer, said the company's latest annual housing survey depicts 
``a vibrant mortgage marketplace'' marked by high levels of 
consumer confidence and satisfaction with the home mortgage 
process. 
</P>
<P>
	But he added, ``A shadow falling across the otherwise positive  
news is how many Americans don't fully comprehend the relationship 
between paying bills late, having bad credit, and experiencing 
difficulties in qualifying for a mortgage. This is a problem the 
mortgage industry needs to address.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Fannie Mae's nationwide survey of 1,812 adults, 41 percent of  
respondents said being more than 90 days late paying utility bills 
three times or more in recent years would be a major problem in 
getting a mortgage. Thirty-two percent said it would be a minor 
problem, but 18 percent said it would not be a problem. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey disclosure comes at a time when more people have been  
getting so deeply in debt they have filed for bankruptcy. Despite 
the strong economy, the number of Americans filing personal 
bankruptcies last year reached a record 1.4 million, up more than 
300 percent since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	Some experts blame soliciting by the credit card industry and  
the easy availability of credit in general for the apparent lack of 
understanding of the consequences of a bad credit record. 
</P>
<P>
	Efforts to educate consumers ``must compete with the most  
aggressive marketing campaign in the world'' by credit card 
companies that send out billions of solicitations a year, said 
Stephen Brobeck, executive director of Consumer Federation of 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey's margin of error is plus or minus 2.9 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	Fannie Mae, which describes itself as the world's biggest  
financial services company that is not a bank, is a 
government-chartered corporation whose stock is publicly traded.

<HEADLINE> Barclays Gets New Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Matthew Barrett, former chairman and chief  
executive of the Bank of Montreal, has been appointed group chief 
executive and executive director of Barclays PLC, the British 
banking giant said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Barrett succeeds Martin Taylor, who resigned unexpectedly on  
Nov. 27. 
</P>
<P>
	Sir Peter Middleton, who has filled the role of chief executive  
for the past eight months, said Barrett brings ``a track record of 
delivering strong performance in a complex multinational financial 
services company operating in a highly competitive environment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Middleton will continue as chairman after Barrett takes up his  
post. 
</P>
<P>
	Barrett, a native of Ireland, joined Bank of Montreal at its  
London office in 1962. He was appointed the president of the Bank 
of Montreal, Canada's third-largest bank, in 1987, chief executive 
officer in 1989 and chairman in 1990. Barrett negotiated a merger 
with the Royal Bank of Canada, the nation's largest bank, but that 
was blocked by the Canadian government last year. 
</P>
<P>
	He announced his resignation in February.  
</P>
<P>
	Forbes Magazine this year listed Barrett as the third highest  
paid chief executive outside of the United States, with a salary of 
$3.12 million a year at the Bank of Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
	Barrett, who also is an outside director of Canadian companies  
Seagram Co. and Molson Inc., will join Barclays on Oct. 1, Barclays 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Barclays previously appointed Michael O'Neill as chief  
executive, but the former Bank of America executive resigned for 
health reasons on the day he was to move into the job in April.

<HEADLINE> Racial Report Card Welcomes WNBA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- When the Northeastern University Center for Sport  
in Society released its annual racial report card, the news wasn't 
so much the grades as who was in the class. 
</P>
<P>
	Data from the WNBA was examined for the first time this year,  
making it the first women's league to be scrutinized. The title 
also changed this year from a ``Racial Report Card'' to a ``Racial 
and Gender Report Card.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The dimension of diversity has really changed,'' said the  
center's director, Richard Lapchick. ``For so many years, this was 
a portrait of black and white. When we look at sports in society 
today, that is no longer the case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 10th annual report indicates that the professional leagues  
do better than college sports at integrating their executive 
positions, and women are faring better than minorities. Among the 
pro leagues, the NBA is ahead of the other sports, especially in 
its spinoff WNBA. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there's a real consciousness in that league more than  
any other,'' Lapchick said. ``They represent, if anybody does, the 
whole concept of gender equity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NBA received the highest overall grades with an A- for race  
and a B for gender. The NFL got a B+ for its racial hiring 
practices but a D+ for gender. Major League Baseball got a B for 
race, and college sports received Cs for race and gender. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also examines the NHL and Major League Soccer for the  
first time. Leagues in the report for the first time are not given 
grades. 
</P>
<P>
	Other details from the report:  
</P>
<P>
	--Players: The percentage of black players decreased over the  
past year in all professional sports, as well as college Division 
I. In baseball, the 15 percent black participation was a 10-year 
low. 
</P>
<P>
	This decrease can largely be attributed to the increase of Latin  
players. In baseball, for example, the percentage of Latins reached 
an all-time high of 25 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Women: Women fare better than minorities in terms of off-field  
opportunities. Except in the NBA, though, they are overrepresented 
in support staff positions and underrepresented in executive 
positions. 
</P>
<P>
	The president of the WNBA, Val Ackerman, is a woman.  
</P>
<P>
	--International players: The number of foreign-born players in  
baseball and the NBA was an all-time high. There were also 
``extremely large numbers'' of international players in the WNBA, 
NHL and soccer. 
</P>
<P>
	--Colleges: The percentage of black Division I athletic  
directors, excluding historically black colleges, is 3.2 percent, 
down from 3.7 percent a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's kind of a scary number,'' Lapchick said.  
</P>
<P>
	--Owners: There were no black or Latin majority owners in any of  
the leagues examined by the report. There was one Asian majority 
owner in the MLS and the NHL, and three women were majority owners, 
two in the NFL and one in baseball. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Cruise Lines Reporting Crime to FBI </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- The cruise ship industry hopes a new policy  
requiring ships out of U.S. ports to report all crimes to the FBI 
will ease concerns prompted by recent the disclosure of onboard 
sexual assaults. 
</P>
<P>
	The policy, announced Tuesday, covers about 90 percent of the  
North American cruise industry and takes effect immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, the cruise lines left it up to the victims to report  
a crime once back in port. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new policy, cruise lines will report onboard crimes if  
the ship calls on U.S. ports or the offense involves Americans. It 
was unanimously approved last week by the 16 members of the 
International Council of Cruise Lines. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our companies, and industry as a whole, have zero tolerance  
for crimes committed on our vessels,'' the top executives of four 
of the largest cruise lines -- Carnival, Royal Caribbean, Princess 
and Crystal -- said in an open letter to the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement follows the disclosure earlier this month that  
Carnival crew members were accused of sexual assault 62 times in a 
five-year period. They were the first crime statistics released by 
a cruise line. 
</P>
<P>
	Carnival spokesmen said the cases covered a wide range of  
accusations during a period in which the line carried 6.5 million 
guests and tens of thousands of crew members. 
</P>
<P>
	The disclosure was ordered by a Florida judge hearing a lawsuit  
brought by a former employee who said that she was raped by a 
fellow worker and that the company tried to cover it up.

<HEADLINE> Kennedys Return to Work in D.C. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The two Kennedys in Congress returned slowly  
to the routine of meetings and votes Tuesday after a week of what 
Sen. Edward Kennedy called ``unspeakable grief'' over the deaths of 
John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife and sister-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
	The senator, D-Mass., flew into the capital late Monday and went  
to the Senate, where he cast two procedural votes. He has made no 
public statements since last Friday's eulogy for his nephew and 
Carolyn Bessette Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Patrick Kennedy, D-R.I., has had more public events than  
his father over the past two days -- thanking the people of Rhode 
Island on Monday for their support over the previous week. Yet he 
declined media requests Tuesday for interviews, a rarity for the 
usually accessible lawmaker. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the Kennedy and Bessette families issued a joint  
statement Tuesday asking people who want to honor the Kennedy 
couple and Lauren Bessette to contribute to their favorite 
charities, bring flowers or prayers to local hospitals or community 
centers, or spend time with friends or relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	``We gratefully acknowledge the outpouring of love and support  
by so many friends and members of the public during the tragic 
events of the past 10 days,'' the statement said. ``Your prayers 
and heartfelt wishes have brought great comfort to us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senate action was slow on Tuesday, and Sen. Kennedy spent the  
morning in his private Capitol office, meeting with staff 
concerning policy issues senators are to consider before the summer 
recess begins Aug. 6. He also attended the Democratic senators' 
weekly private luncheon and then spent the afternoon in his office. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Kennedy, meanwhile, was ``slowly easing back into his  
official duties,'' said his top aide, Tony Marcella. ``It will take 
a little while.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He returned to Washington late Monday to vote. On Tuesday, he  
met with staffers and outside groups, worked at the Democratic 
Congressional Campaign Committee -- the fund-raising organization he 
chairs -- and attended the House Democrats' afternoon caucus. 
</P>
<P>
	JFK Jr. and his passengers were killed July 16 when his private  
plane crashed into the ocean off Martha's Vineyard. 
</P>
<P>
	Both lawmakers spent most of last week in Massachusetts.  
Together with Sen. Kennedy's older son, Edward Jr., they were 
aboard the Navy salvage ship USS Grasp when the bodies were 
recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	``I loved my cousin John dearly and I am so grateful for the  
relationship I had with him,'' Rep. Kennedy said Monday in Rhode 
Island. ``I feel the loss immensely.''

<HEADLINE> Former NFL Player Killed by Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Although several NFL players knew Demetrius  
DuBose had fallen on hard times, the last thing they expected to 
hear was that he'd been fatally shot by police who chased him down 
after he fled a burglary scene. 
</P>
<P>
	Dubose, 28, a former linebacker for Notre Dame and the Tampa Bay  
Buccaneers, died Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how you go from being a (second-round) pick from  
Notre Dame to getting shot to death for burglary,'' said San Diego 
Chargers guard Aaron Taylor, who played with DuBose at Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't think it would end like this,'' added Chargers kicker  
John Carney, who played at Notre Dame a few years before DuBose, 
but knew him through mutual friends. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tragic. He had a lot going for him,'' Carney said. ``I  
knew people reached out to him, but he was a hard guy to reach. He 
didn't want the help.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DuBose fled when officers tried to question him outside a  
Mission Beach home that had been burglarized, Lt. Glenn 
Breitenstein said. Officers said they tried to stop him by spraying 
him with mace, but he ran. They caught him, scuffled and he got 
away again. 
</P>
<P>
	When they caught him a second time, they struggled with him and  
both officers pulled out nunchakus, a weapon that consists of two 
wooden sticks joined at the ends by a short chain or rope. 
Breitenstein said DuBose managed to disarm both officers of the 
martial arts weapons and charged them. The officers then shot 
DuBose. 
</P>
<P>
	``The officers believed that they were about to be assaulted in  
a dangerous manner with weapons that could kill them, and they 
fired,'' Breitenstein said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said DuBose seemed drunk or drugged. An autopsy was  
conducted Monday. Results of toxicology tests were not expected for 
a few weeks, Breitenstein said. 
</P>
<P>
	The two officers who shot DuBose were removed from field work  
pending an investigation, Lt. Tom Orden said. Their names were not 
released. 
</P>
<P>
	DuBose, whose last address was Mammoth Lakes, Calif., played for  
Notre Dame from 1989 to 1992. He was a second-round draft pick of 
Tampa Bay in 1993 and played four seasons with the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is so uncharacteristic,'' said Jerry Angelo, Tampa Bay's  
director of player personnel. ``If anything went bad in his life, 
it had to have come after football for it to get to the depths it 
did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Angelo said DuBose was let go because he wasn't a good player,  
not because of anything that happened off the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Ex-Tampa Bay coach Sam Wyche said he couldn't believe the news.  
</P>
<P>
	``He talked about (how) if it didn't work out, he'd do the next  
thing and take it on just as hard. He was just a positive guy,'' 
Wyche said. 
</P>
<P>
	DuBose signed with the New York Jets as a free agent in 1997,  
but was cut during training camp four months later. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor heard that DuBose was practically destitute and had lost  
his San Diego-area condominium. 
</P>
<P>
	``There would be like a `Demetrius sighting' -- he'd just  
disappear, then show up one day, for a night, then boom, he'd 
disappear. A buddy said, `God, the guy looked like he was sleeping 
in his car or something,''' Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, DuBose was arrested in South Bend, Ind., after he  
became belligerent at a nightclub. When an off-duty police officer 
working at the club ordered him to leave, DuBose allegedly grabbed 
a pipe from an overhead sprinkler system -- flooding the club with 
some 1,600 gallons of water. 
</P>
<P>
	He was charged with resisting address, disorderly conduct and  
possession of marijuana.

<HEADLINE> Royal Bank Buys Into AOL Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Royal Bank is paying $60 million US for a 20  
percent stake in AOL Canada Inc. and plans to make interactive 
marketing deals with the online services provider. 
</P>
<P>
	Royal Bank and its U.S. subsidiaries Security First Network Bank  
and Bull &AMP; Bear Securities will make marketing deals with AOL in 
the U.S. and Canada worth more than $7.5 million US, the bank said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	``Strategic alliances like this one will be absolutely vital to  
attracting and retaining customers in the online world,'' John 
Cleghorn, Royal's chairman and chief executive, told a news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe this collaboration can go a long way to getting  
more Canadians online and more Canadian companies e-commerce 
enabled.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's the latest move by a Canadian bank into the growing  
Internet field. 
</P>
<P>
	Toronto-Dominion Bank has been a market leader through its TD  
Waterhouse discount brokerage, formerly called Green Line in 
Canada. All the big banks offer Internet services and CIBC is 
trying to extend electronic banking -- like its President's Choice 
branches at Canadian Loblaw stores -- into U.S. Winn-Dixie 
supermarkets. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel this alliance will help Canada in its quest to become  
a global leader in electronic commerce initiatives,'' Cleghorn 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Internet also provides us with a powerful North American  
business platform to grow our customer base in the United States. 
This strategic alliance fits nicely with our U.S. growth 
strategy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Royal describes Security First Network Bank, based in Atlanta,  
as the world's first fully transactional Internet bank. Royal's 
Bull &AMP; Bear Securities is an online brokerage based in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Davies, president of AOL International, said the alliance  
will help AOL Canada become the leading Internet service in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	``Royal Bank offers leadership in online and offline financial  
services, a proven ability to create, manage and maintain customer 
relationships, and a powerful distribution system,'' Davies said. 
</P>
<P>
	``With Royal Bank as an alliance partner, we have the  
opportunity to introduce AOL Canada's signature convenience, 
ease-of-use, unmatched content and features and powerful brand to a 
base of 10 million customers, which includes 420,000 small and 
mid-size businesses, 1.7 million phone and 420,000 online 
clients.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Royal Bank said more than 10 million visitors monthly use its  
personal finance Web sites to manage portfolios, check stock quotes 
and use banking services. 
</P>
<P>
	``AOL and AOL Canada offer Royal Bank the scale and expertise to  
build on its leadership in providing financial services,'' Royal 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Toronto stock market today, Royal Bank shares rose 80  
cents to $66.80 each. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL Canada is an interactive online service tailored to the  
Canadian market, working with more than 70 content and e-commerce 
partners to serve more than 130,000 paying households.

<HEADLINE> Unready Brokerages Face Y2K Closing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal securities regulators will go to court  
starting Dec. 1 to shut down brokerage firms that are not ready for 
the Year 2000, under new rules adopted Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 5-0 vote, the Securities and Exchange Commission set a  
target date of Aug. 31 for brokerage firms to complete their Year 
2000 compliance efforts but allowed additional time for unprepared 
firms to show that they will be ready no later than Nov. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any firm that cannot achieve Y2K compliance in a timely  
fashion will be required to cease doing business by Dec. 1,'' SEC 
Chairman Arthur Levitt said before the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``A few firms' lack of readiness could have adverse consequences  
for countless others,'' Levitt said. ``We simply cannot allow firms 
to continue to operate if they threaten the integrity of the 
system, or if they are not able to assure customers' access to 
their funds and securities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Walker, the agency's enforcement director, said the  
regulators would go into federal courts starting Dec. 1 seeking 
injunctions that would force the unprepared brokerage firms to 
cease operations and notify their customers. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the regulators expect they will only have to go after  
``a few'' problem firms. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC estimates that only 1 percent or so of the 3,900  
brokerage firms covered by the new rules won't be ready by Aug. 31 
for the millennial date change. 
</P>
<P>
	By adopting the rules, the SEC ``is making it very clear that  
(brokerages) need to be Y2K compliant,'' said James Spellman, a 
spokesman for the Securities Industry Association, whose brokerage 
firm members conducted an industrywide Y2K test this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesmen for the National Association of Securities Dealers  
weren't immediately available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Concerns about the Jan. 1, 2000, date stem from the fact that  
some computer systems may read only the last two digits of a 
four-digit year and interpret the year 2000 as 1900, potentially 
wreaking havoc on financial transactions. 
</P>
<P>
	The new rules also apply to the 600 or so securities transfer  
agents that are not banks. Transfer agents are responsible for 
keeping records of shareholders of corporations and for issuing or 
canceling stock certificates when shares are bought and sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC has said failure of transfer agents to anticipate and  
fix Year 2000 computer problems could seriously disrupt 
corporations' dividend payments and other transactions with their 
shareholders. Only a small proportion of the agent companies, also 
around 1 percent, are expected to be unprepared. 
</P>
<P>
	The market watchdog agency also requires mutual fund companies  
and publicly traded corporations to disclose their readiness. 
</P>
<P>
	In the federal government's first major enforcement action  
related to the Year 2000 problem, the SEC charged 37 relatively 
small brokerage firms last October with failing to fully disclose 
the state of their computer readiness. Some of the firms agreed to 
settle the charges by promising to refrain from such violations in 
the future, being censured and paying civil penalties ranging from 
$5,000 to $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, the SEC accused nine transfer agents of allegedly  
failing to adequately disclose their readiness. Five of the agent 
companies settled the charges and four contested them.

<HEADLINE> Drought May Produce Fewer Pumpkins / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- Pumpkins could be fewer and smaller for  
this year's Halloween festivities if drought continues much longer 
in the mid-Atlantic and New England states. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray Waterman, a New York farmer who serves as president of the  
World Pumpkin Confederation, said two drought years earlier this 
decade were not so hard on pumpkin crops as the current drought. 
</P>
<P>
	``This year's got me a little scared,'' he said in a telephone  
interview from his farm near Buffalo. If fields don't start getting 
regular rain soon, Waterman said, those farmers who don't irrigate 
won't have much of a crop. 
</P>
<P>
	Few pumpkin farmers irrigate because it is so expensive, and  
many who do focus their efforts on more valuable crops such as 
corn, tomatoes and peppers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough out there,'' Waterman said.  
</P>
<P>
	In Lancaster County, where most of Pennsylvania's pumpkins are  
grown, farmer Steve Groff has 20 acres of pumpkins, half under 
irrigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we would get good rain in the next three weeks, this  
pumpkin crop could come around and be half decent,'' Groff said. 
``We're so dry that an inch of rain would only be good for a couple 
of days. We need consistent rain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike other crops, pumpkins have about another month before  
they begin to mature. Even if the rains don't come, there will 
still be pumpkins, just not so many and not so big as usual, Groff 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pennsylvania has 146 farmers growing pumpkins on 4,758 acres,  
according to the most recent figures provided by the National 
Agricultural Statistics Service. 
</P>
<P>
	Pumpkins don't need as much water as other vegetables, just a  
good soaking rain about once a week, but the severe heat and dry 
conditions has doubled that requirement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our yield is down quite a bit,'' said Gene Gardner, an Indiana  
County, Pa., farmer who has no irrigation for his three acres of 
pumpkins. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
	ASHLAND, Ala. (AP) -- Clay County's Blueberry Festival has come  
to an end after 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``There simply aren't enough growers anymore,'' said Theresa  
Strange, director of the Clay County Chamber of Commerce. ``We 
didn't think it was fair to import blueberries and pass them off as 
local.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the number of commercial blueberry farms dropped, so did  
attendance, with only 1,000 people showing up last year, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bobby Smith, who became Clay County's first blueberry grower in  
1982, said he stopped commercial production last year, when he was 
earning less for the crop than he was spending to harvest it. 
Smith, like several other county farmers, has converted his farm to 
a pick-your-own operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Farrow, Clay County Cooperative Extension agent, said damage  
from the Japanese beetle prompted some farmers to pull out, along 
with low prices and unstable weather 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Alabama Department of Agriculture, 470 acres of  
blueberries farmed statewide in 1997 produced 1,400 pounds per 
acre. Last year, that dropped to 310 acres with an average yield of 
1,300 pounds per acre.

<HEADLINE> Titans Sign Top Draft Pick </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Jevon Kearse planned to be playing  
football on the first day of training camp all along, and not even 
switching agents was going to stop him. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tennessee Titans' top draft pick kept to his plan Tuesday  
when he and his new agent, Leigh Steinberg, agreed to a five-year, 
$6.1 million contract hours before a mandatory team dinner for 
rookies and selected veterans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jevon clearly wanted to be in camp from the first day,''  
Steinberg said. ``It was a high priority for him as it was for all 
of us. We knew it was going to end up being on time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Titans hadn't expected any negotiating problems with  
Kearse's first agent, William ``Tank'' Black. But Kearse fired 
Black last spring after he was accused by the NFL Players 
Association of providing cars and money to former Florida players, 
including Kearse. 
</P>
<P>
	Kearse, the No. 16 pick, has declined to talk specifically about  
Black, who also is being investigated by University of Florida 
police. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida coach Steve Spurrier responded to the probe by banning  
Kearse and other former players from using campus facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just happy to get it all behind me and start my  
professional career,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be over real soon. It was an unfortunate situation,  
and I cooperated 100 percent with the authorities and let them know 
all they needed to know and I'd just like to get it behind me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The contract includes a $3.85 million signing bonus and the  
chance to boost his pay by up to $4.5 million more with incentives 
in the final two years. 
</P>
<P>
	To fit the contract under the salary cap, the Titans now must  
try to renegotiate contracts with a couple of players or may be 
forced to cut a veteran like linebacker Lonnie Marts. 
</P>
<P>
	But general manager Floyd Reese said the money will be well  
spent if Kearse lives up to what the Titans expect of him. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think Jevon has the chance to be special. We think he will  
be special, and we will put a lot of pressure on him to be 
special,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kearse was nicknamed ``The Freak'' for his play at linebacker  
and defensive end at Florida. He earned All-America and 
All-Southeastern Conference honors as a junior last season when he 
totaled 16.5 sacks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Titans, who had one of the worst pass rushes in the NFL last  
season, plan to keep Kearse at left defensive end. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we've mentioned, we're not going to move Jevon all over our  
defense. We're going to line him up in one place and let him 
play,'' coach Jeff Fisher said.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Lending Reaches $29B </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- World Bank lent a record $29 billion in the  
fiscal year that ended June 30, an increase of $1.5 billion over 
the previous year, the bank said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank's main lending arm, the International Bank for  
Reconstruction and Development, approved loans worth $22.2 billion 
at market-based interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The remaining $6.8 billion in commitments were made through the  
International Development Association, which lends funds at cheaper 
interest rates to poorer countries. 
</P>
<P>
	In the previous fiscal year, IBRD loans totaled $21 billion, IDA  
$7.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank's annual lending statement said actual loan payouts for  
fiscal year 1999 totaled $24 billion, down from $25.5 billion the 
previous year. In some cases, bank loans are not disbursed in the 
year they are approved. 
</P>
<P>
	``While we see, for a second fiscal year, that the (global)  
financial crisis has resulted in record loans, I am cheered to see 
that the increase in the quality of loans we have provided, as this 
points to real results on the ground,'' said James Wolfensohn, the 
bank president. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year the bank said the failure rate for its  
projects had declined, meaning more development contracts are 
completed as planned. Wolfensohn made this one of his objectives 
when he took over as bank president four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Nations in East Asia and the Pacific, where the financial crisis  
began in mid-1997, were leading recipients of bank loans, the 
statement said. Lending to Latin America and the Caribbean region 
also increased, partly in response to spread of the financial 
crisis and to Hurricane Mitch. 
</P>
<P>
	Loans to nations in East Asia amounted to $9.76 billion. Latin  
America and the Caribbean came next at $7.74 billion. European and 
Central Asian countries obtained $5.29 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Totals for South Asia reached $2.56 billion, while Africa  
obtained $2.07 billion with $1.58 billion for North Africa and the 
Middle East.

<HEADLINE> Man Sentenced in More Church Fires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- A man accused of setting fires at 12  
churches in Indiana and Georgia was indicted by a federal grand 
jury Tuesday on charges that he set 17 other church fires across 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment accuses Jay Scott Ballinger, 36, of burning a  
total of 29 churches in California, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, 
Missouri, Ohio, South Carolina and Tennessee since 1994. His 
stripper girlfriend allegedly was with him at 16 of the fires. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Attorney Judith Stewart said the investigation is  
continuing, but she declined to comment further. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballinger, who has long shown a fascination with the satanic,  
has been in federal custody since February when he was arrested in 
connection with an Ohio church fire that police said left him 
severely burned. He told federal agents he burned 30 to 50 churches 
in 11 states between 1994 and 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	In February and May, grand juries in Atlanta and Indianapolis  
charged Ballinger with 12 church arsons, including a blaze that 
killed a volunteer firefighter in Commerce, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's indictment adds charges of conspiracy to commit arson  
and church arson for 17 other fires. If convicted, Ballinger could 
face up to 215 years in prison and a fine of $3.25 million. 
</P>
<P>
	His attorney was out of town Tuesday night and unavailable to  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The motive for the arsons is unclear. When Ballinger, who is  
white, was first charged, Acting Assistant Attorney General Bill 
Lann Lee observed that the churches involved were predominately 
white. The new indictment does not address the racial breakdown of 
the 29 congregations. 
</P>
<P>
	According to an affidavit, Ballinger's girlfriend and another  
accomplice told federal agents they helped Ballinger burn an 
Indiana church where they painted an upside-down cross on the steps 
as part of a satanic ritual.

<HEADLINE> Fortune Brands Names CEO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENWICH, Conn. (AP) -- Fortune Brands Inc. named president  
Norman H. Wesley as its new chairman and chief executive, 
succeeding the retiring Thomas C. Hays at the helm of the consumer 
products company. 
</P>
<P>
	Fortune Brands' operating companies include such familiar brands  
as Moen faucets, Master locks, Titleist and Cobra golf equipment 
and Jim Beam bourbon. 
</P>
<P>
	Hays, who has been chairman and chief executive since January  
1995, announced last year that he would leave at the end of this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Wesley, 49, has been president and chief operating officer since  
January. Before that, he held a variety of executive positions in 
Fortune Brand's operating companies since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also announced a series of other executive changes  
on Tuesday, including the appointment of Craig P. Omtvedt, 49, as 
senior vice president and chief financial officer. Omtvedt has 
served as senior vice president and chief accounting officer since 
January 1998.

<HEADLINE> Little Rock's Clinton Ave. Limited </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- The drive to establish a President  
Clinton Avenue hasn't been the smoothest ride. 
</P>
<P>
	Little Rock's Board of Directors gave in to public pressure and  
reversed a 1997 decision to rename a 21-block stretch of Markham 
Street after the president. 
</P>
<P>
	The board voted 8-3 on Tuesday to limit the portion to be  
renamed to a small section, roughly two blocks, around the site of 
Clinton's presidential library, which has yet to be built. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure also calls for a series of public hearings, an  
element absent from the original resolution and one of the reasons 
the issue drew so much fire. The city's planning commission will 
also have to sign off on the change just like any street renaming. 
</P>
<P>
	If the proposal can clear those hurdles, the change would not  
take effect until after Clinton leaves office, rather than on Jan. 
1, 2000, as the original measure specified. 
</P>
<P>
	Board members last week voted to uphold their 1997 decision,  
saying the name change was a fitting tribute to Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	But the decision brought complaints from several Little Rock  
residents; City Hall received 60 to 70 letters and faxes a day on 
the issue. One woman at Tuesday's meeting shouted sarcastically 
that she was proud to be an Arkansan in light of Clinton's 
impeachment. Police escorted her out. 
</P>
<P>
	Markham Street passes several Clinton landmarks, including the  
Old State House where he celebrated election night victories in 
1992 and 1996, and the Excelsior Hotel, where Paula Jones claims 
Clinton propositioned her.

<HEADLINE> Royals Make Roster Moves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- The Kansas City Royals recalled pitcher  
Glendon Rusch and purchased the contract of infielder Ray Holbert 
from Triple-A Omaha on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbert and Rusch take the roster spots of infielder Steve  
Scarsone and pitcher Tim Byrdak, who were optioned to Omaha. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Sutton, who was recalled off a rehab assignment July 25,  
also was optioned to Omaha. 
</P>
<P>
	Pitcher Jose Santiago was recalled from his rehab assignment but  
remains on the disabled list. Pitcher Orber Moreno began his rehab 
assignment at Gulf Coast in the Rookie League on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rusch spent most of the past two years with the Royals. He was  
6-9 in 30 games, 27 of them starts, in 1997. He was 6-15 in 29 
games in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The 15 losses were high on the team and fourth-highest in the  
American League. He was 3-6 with a 4.02 ERA in 14 starts at Omaha. 
</P>
<P>
	``Young kids coming up here and struggling is nothing new. But  
it's not like you've got Nolan Ryan sitting in your minor leagues 
and you can make that exchange. We're not in that situation,'' 
Royals manager Tony Muser said.

<HEADLINE>  Dolphins' Rookies Sign Contracts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVIE, Fla. (AP) -- Miami Dolphins rookie running back J.J.  
Johnson stared at his first NFL paycheck in disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never seen that much money,'' Johnson said. ``I said,  
`You're going to hand that to me?''' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins' top draft pick received a $980,000 signing bonus  
Tuesday as part of a four-year, $2.65 million deal. 
</P>
<P>
	He was among six rookies signing contracts before reporting to  
training camp. The first practice for the newcomers is Wednesday, 
with the entire team taking the field for the first time Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Fullback Rod Konrad also signed a four-year contract. Signing  
three-year deals were running back Cecil Collins, center Grey 
Ruegamer, punter Brent Bartholomew and guard Joe Wong. 
</P>
<P>
	All seven Miami draft choices are now under contract. They were  
aware that coach Jimmy Johnson has little patience for rookies who 
report late because of a negotiating stalemate. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point in his career, he probably thinks it's kind of  
tedious to have to deal with,'' Konrad said. ``He's worried about 
winning the Super Bowl, not about a couple of thousand dollars here 
or there. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't want to make the boss angry, just like any other  
job. I think it was important to get here on time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, for one, had no complaints about the deal he signed.  
His family spent time on welfare when he grew up in Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most money you ever talked about was $487 in a summer job,  
and that was when you let it double up for two weeks,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, the 39th player taken in the draft, is expected to  
challenge incumbent Karim Abdul-Jabbar for a starting job. 
</P>
<P>
	Another candidate at running back, Collins, agreed to forgo the  
traditional lump-sum signing bonus. Instead he'll receive his 
$110,00 bonus in installments over the length of his three-year, 
$860,000 contract -- if he stays out of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins, a fifth-round draft pick, battled drug and legal  
problems that limited him to six games in college.

<HEADLINE> Columbia Makes 'Beautiful' Landing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- With the first female commander at  
the controls, space shuttle Columbia returned to Earth late Tuesday 
after a quick trip to orbit to drop off the world's most powerful 
X-ray telescope. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Force Col. Eileen Collins landed the shuttle at 11:20 p.m.,  
the first woman to ever do so. 
</P>
<P>
	The runway was illuminated with xenon lights for the rare night  
touchdown, and the moon was nearly full. 
</P>
<P>
	``Welcome home,'' Mission Control said as soon as the shuttle  
rolled safely to a stop. ``Eileen to you and the crew, just an 
outstanding job deploying Chandra (the telescope) and bringing 
Columbia home for a beautiful landing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 1 1/2 hours later, a beaming Collins posed for pictures in  
front of Columbia. ``Get over here you guys,'' she called to her 
four crewmates, who joined her for the photo shoot. She said she 
was proud of the successful flight. 
</P>
<P>
	The landing -- only the 12th in darkness out of 95 shuttle  
flights -- went much more smoothly than Friday's launch, which came 
after two delays and was plagued by a hydrogen fuel leak and a 
short circuit. Neither problem affected the ride home. 
</P>
<P>
	Video of the suspect engine nozzle following touchdown confirmed  
that fuel had, indeed, leaked during liftoff. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins, 42, a former test pilot who twice served as a shuttle  
co-pilot, guided Columbia over central Texas, southern Louisiana, 
down across the Gulf of Mexico and on into Florida, where 150 
people gathered to welcome the five astronauts home. Well-wishers 
included Collins' husband and 3 1/2-year-old daughter, Bridget. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia appeared as a gold and white streak in the sky as it  
passed over the home of Mission Control 15 minutes before 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	``You look great passing over Houston right now. Beautiful  
shot,'' radioed Mission Control. 
</P>
<P>
	At five days, it was NASA's shortest planned mission in nine  
years. Only one flight, in 1997, was shorter; a defective fuel cell 
ended that laboratory-research mission after only four days. 
</P>
<P>
	The mileage for the trip: a relatively modest 1.8 million miles.  
</P>
<P>
	Despite its brevity, the mission to deliver the $1.5 billion  
Chandra X-ray Observatory to orbit was a plum assignment for 
Collins. She was the first woman to command a space mission in 38 
years of U.S. human space flight, and the only woman to actually 
land a spaceship of any kind, anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia made it to orbit safely despite the hydrogen leak in  
one of the three main engines. The engine could have shut down if 
more fuel had seeped out, forcing the first emergency landing for a 
shuttle. 
</P>
<P>
	A leak explains why Columbia ended up in a slightly lower orbit  
than planned. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA will examine the shuttle's engines to determine why two or  
three hydrogen-circulating tubes in the engine nozzle leaked, and 
also what caused the short circuit five seconds after liftoff. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eileen Collins represents the very best of this country,''  
NASA Administrator Daniel Goldin said shortly after touchdown. 
``She was cool and calm and handled the problem she had.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The astronauts accomplished their main goal just seven hours  
into the flight, flawlessly releasing the Chandra X-Ray 
Observatory, which began a five-year journey to search for signs of 
black holes and study galaxies and quasars. 
</P>
<P>
	Chandra is using its thrusters to eventually reach an orbit  
extending one-third of the way to the moon. 
</P>
<P>
	Next up for Columbia is a piggyback ride on a Boeing 747 to  
California for a yearlong overhaul. Columbia, the oldest of NASA's 
four shuttles, will become the second to be equipped with a modern, 
Boeing 777-style cockpit, featuring nine high-resolution, 
liquid-crystal computer screens rather than the three old-fashioned 
ones. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``glass cockpit'' -- which shuttle pilots say will help them  
deal better with emergencies -- will make its debut on a flight by

<HEADLINE> Phone Tower in National Park Debated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Schoolchildren visiting Rock Creek national  
park often write down names of plants and animals they encounter. 
But soon they may come across something less natural to the 
terrain: cell phone towers. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Washington residents, including the mayor, say they don't  
want cell towers on the swath of greenery that bisects the city. 
But the Senate added a provision to the District of Columbia budget 
appropriations bill earlier this month that would require the 
National Park Service to allow two towers to be built there for 
cell phone use. 
</P>
<P>
	The House of Representatives' version of the bill, scheduled for  
a vote this week, does not have the cell phone tower provision. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell Atlantic asked to build the towers more than five years ago  
in response to complaints from customers that they lost service 
when they used the park's main road, a major commuting route, 
company official Howard Woolley said. 
</P>
<P>
	The tallest of the two Rock Creek towers would be 130 feet.  
Neither would contain lights, Bell Atlantic spokeswoman Audrey 
Schaefer said. 
</P>
<P>
	About a week before Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle,  
D-S.D., offered the cell tower provision, the cellular telephone 
industry contributed $50,000 to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign 
Committee, including $25,000 from Bell Atlantic, Federal Election 
Commission records show. 
</P>
<P>
	Daschle spokeswoman Molly Rowley said the senator was unaware of  
the DSCC donations, and that he learned about the cell phone 
problem from law enforcement officials. He did learn of Bell 
Atlantic's request for cellular towers last fall when he called the 
company after hearing of the law enforcement complaints, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell Atlantic's Woolley said the company had not asked Daschle  
to sponsor the amendment. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Anthony Williams and other D.C. politicians have opposed  
the towers, and environmentalists say they would destroy the park's 
beauty and prompt other companies to try to erect their own towers 
there. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is about preventing an antenna farm,'' said Libby Kelley,  
a San Francisco activist who flew to Washington recently to protest 
the Rock Creek proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	Daschle said park and city police want cellular technology in  
Rock Creek so they can respond more quickly to crimes and car 
accidents there. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cell phones provide a real measure of safety,'' Daschle said.  
</P>
<P>
	He also noted that the 1996 Telecommunications Act requires that  
federal property be leased to cellular companies if the technology 
is environmentally safe. ``This application has passed every 
environmental requirement,'' Daschle said. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue also has arisen in other national parks.  
</P>
<P>
	Cellular companies are currently upgrading their wireless  
equipment in Grand Teton National Park, and officials there are 
considering an application to build a new tower. There are three 
cell towers at nearby Yellowstone National Park.

<HEADLINE> Justice Defends Agribusiness Mergers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a rebuff to farm-state Democrats, the  
Justice Department's antitrust chief said Tuesday that agribusiness 
mergers did not cause the slump in commodity prices and sometimes 
even help producers. 
</P>
<P>
	``That price decline is not a product of increased  
concentration'' in agribusiness, Assistant Attorney General Joel I. 
Klein told the Senate Agriculture Committee. ``There are other 
factors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is no significant difference in competition in the  
industry now than in 1996, when commodity prices peaked, Klein 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists attribute the recent decline in crop prices to a  
worldwide glut of grain and economic problems in Asia and Europe 
that cut into their food imports. 
</P>
<P>
	But with the agricultural economy stuck in its worst downturn  
since the mid-1980s, many lawmakers have been pointing to declining 
competition among food processors, pesticide makers, seed companies 
and other agribusinesses as the culprit. For example, four 
meatpackers control 80 percent of the nation's beef, up from 36 
percent two decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
	After the hearing, Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., said Klein was  
ignoring a long-term decline in commodity prices relative to what 
consumers pay for food. ``Power in the marketing chain gives you a 
greater share of the retail dollar,'' Conrad said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, the Justice Department came under criticism  
from congressional Democrats for allowing Cargill Inc., North 
America's second-largest grain trader, to acquire the grain 
operations of Continental Grain Co. even though the companies were 
required to sell some of their assets. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure that is going to mean a darn thing back on the  
farm,'' Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, told Klein. 
</P>
<P>
	The Agriculture Department estimates the two companies control  
42 percent of U.S. corn exports, a third of soybeans sold overseas 
and at least 20 percent of wheat exports. 
</P>
<P>
	The forced divestiture would ensure buyers are still available  
to compete for farmers' grain, Klein said. It's in farmers' 
interest for U.S. companies to cut their costs, because they have 
to compete overseas, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we don't compete efficiently in Asia, if we don't compete  
efficiently in Europe to sell products, that's going to hurt the 
family farm,'' Klein said. 
</P>
<P>
	Klein also told the panel antitrust laws generally are adequate  
to protect farm interests, although he thinks Congress should give 
Justice responsibility for approving railroad mergers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Surface Transportation Board, which has authority over  
acquisitions in the railroad industry, approved a $5.4 billion 
merger three years ago between the Union Pacific and Southern 
Pacific over the opposition of the Justice, Transportation and 
Agriculture departments.

<HEADLINE> Royal Bank Buys Into AOL Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Royal Bank is paying $60 million US for a 20  
percent stake in AOL Canada Inc. and plans to make interactive 
marketing deals with the online services provider. 
</P>
<P>
	Royal Bank and its U.S. subsidiaries Security First Network Bank  
and Bull &AMP; Bear Securities will make marketing deals with AOL in 
the U.S. and Canada worth more than $7.5 million US, the bank said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	``Strategic alliances like this one will be absolutely vital to  
attracting and retaining customers in the online world,'' John 
Cleghorn, Royal's chairman and chief executive, told a news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe this collaboration can go a long way to getting  
more Canadians online and more Canadian companies e-commerce 
enabled.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's the latest move by a Canadian bank into the growing  
Internet field. 
</P>
<P>
	Toronto-Dominion Bank has been a market leader through its TD  
Waterhouse discount brokerage, formerly called Green Line in 
Canada. All the big banks offer Internet services and CIBC is 
trying to extend electronic banking -- like its President's Choice 
branches at Canadian Loblaw stores -- into U.S. Winn-Dixie 
supermarkets. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel this alliance will help Canada in its quest to become  
a global leader in electronic commerce initiatives,'' Cleghorn 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Internet also provides us with a powerful North American  
business platform to grow our customer base in the United States. 
This strategic alliance fits nicely with our U.S. growth 
strategy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Royal describes Security First Network Bank, based in Atlanta,  
as the world's first fully transactional Internet bank. Royal's 
Bull &AMP; Bear Securities is an online brokerage based in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Davies, president of AOL International, said the alliance  
will help AOL Canada become the leading Internet service in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	``Royal Bank offers leadership in online and offline financial  
services, a proven ability to create, manage and maintain customer 
relationships, and a powerful distribution system,'' Davies said. 
</P>
<P>
	``With Royal Bank as an alliance partner, we have the  
opportunity to introduce AOL Canada's signature convenience, 
ease-of-use, unmatched content and features and powerful brand to a 
base of 10 million customers, which includes 420,000 small and 
mid-size businesses, 1.7 million phone and 420,000 online 
clients.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Royal Bank said more than 10 million visitors monthly use its  
personal finance Web sites to manage portfolios, check stock quotes 
and use banking services. 
</P>
<P>
	``AOL and AOL Canada offer Royal Bank the scale and expertise to  
build on its leadership in providing financial services,'' Royal 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Toronto stock market today, Royal Bank shares rose 80  
cents to $66.80 each. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL Canada is an interactive online service tailored to the  
Canadian market, working with more than 70 content and e-commerce 
partners to serve more than 130,000 paying households.

<HEADLINE> Bears' Azumah Switches Sides </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PLATTEVILLE, Wis. (AP) -- When Jerry Azumah was in college, he  
ran and ran and ran. And then he ran some more. 
</P>
<P>
	He had four 1,000-yard rushing seasons, a first in Division  
I-AA. He twice scored five touchdowns in a game. His 6,193 career 
yards are more than any other Division I or I-AA player except some 
dreadlocked guy from Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the Chicago Bears rookie is on the other side of the ball,  
playing defense instead of shredding it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was up for the challenge,'' said Azumah, now a cornerback.  
``I've dreamed about playing in the league all my life and I just 
wanted to get here by any means possible. They think I can be more 
successful as a defensive back, so I went along with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not that this was an easy switch. Azumah had been a running back  
from the time he picked up a football as a 5-year-old. Not even his 
father, Theophilus, could pry the ball out of his hands. 
</P>
<P>
	Azumah's parents are from Ghana, where soccer is popular. When  
Theophilus Azumah saw his son running around all day, he wanted him 
to try soccer. No thanks, the younger Azumah said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just liked carrying the ball and scoring touchdowns,'' he  
said. ``That's all I did when I was little.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When he was big, too. Azumah led his high school in Worcester,  
Mass., to three state titles, running for 1,800 yards and 31 
touchdowns as a senior. At New Hampshire, he rushed for 1,105 yards 
in eight games as a freshman. 
</P>
<P>
	His senior year, he rushed for a 2,195 yards and 23 touchdowns,  
and set I-AA career records for yards (6,193), all-purpose yards 
(8,376), points (424) and rushing TDs (60). He also set four 
Atlantic-10 Conference and seven school marks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've seen people faster, but he's very quick, very shifty,''  
said Bears rookie linebacker Khari Samuel, who played against 
Azumah when he was at Massachusetts. ``It was quite a challenge for 
us, but I enjoyed it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though he had an impressive showing during the NFL's pre-draft  
combine, the Bears knew they wanted Azumah as a defensive back. 
Coach Dick Jauron called him one of the best athletes in the draft, 
and with his size (5-10, 195 pounds) and speed, he's a natural for 
the secondary. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you didn't know any better, you'd think he'd been playing  
defensive back a little bit for the past few years because he's 
made great progress,'' said Vance Bedford, the Bears' secondary 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
	In practice this week, he took a ball away from a receiver for  
what would have been an interception in a game. The rest of the 
secondary went wild, hooting and yelling as the players jogged back 
to the huddle. 
</P>
<P>
	It is different, Azumah said. Instead of running forward, he  
spends most of his time backpedaling. Instead of running for the 
end zone, he's got an entire part of the field to cover. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was tough at first, but now my whole mental process is in  
the flow of being a defensive back,'' he said. ``Running back is 
long gone, so I'm not even thinking about that. I'm thinking about 
being a defensive back and all the things I have to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No one knows the challenge Azumah faces better than Jauron. He  
was a running back at Yale, but became a safety when drafted by the 
Detroit Lions. 
</P>
<P>
	But Azumah is a better athlete than he was, Jauron said. And  
he's got a unique understanding of the offense and what it's trying 
to do after so many years as a running back. 
</P>
<P>
	``The challenge is going to be to learn it all, be able to  
recognize what you see, flip the whole thing around,'' Jauron said. 
``I know that he wants to make this change, so I don't think it's 
hard for him.''

<HEADLINE> Claridge To File For Bankruptcy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Claridge Casino Hotel, the smallest of the dozen casinos in  
Atlantic City, N.J., said Tuesday it plans to file for Chapter 11 
bankruptcy protection in August but will continue business as usual 
while it reorganizes its debt. 
</P>
<P>
	The 18-year-old casino, hurt by increasing competition in the  
seaside resort, also said it likely won't be able to pay $5 million 
in interest on its debt. That payment, on an $85 million mortgage 
taken out in 1994 in the form of bonds to pay for expansion, is due 
Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with that bad news, the casino's owner, Claridge Hotel and  
Casino Corp., also reported the casino lost $269,000 from April 
through June and lost a total of $1.5 million for the first six 
months of the year. However, those losses were less than in the 
same periods a year earlier: $395,000 for 1998's second quarter and 
$2 million for January through June of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``We simply cannot generate sufficient cash to meet our debt  
service,'' said Robert Renneisen, chairman and chief executive 
officer. ``We believe that with a restructuring of our obligations 
and an infusion of capital to permit rehabilitation of the 
property, the Claridge should be able to generate value for its 
creditors over the long run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Industry analyst John Leupp, a vice president at Donaldson,  
Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette in New York, agreed the casino needs new 
investment to reduce debt and add amenities to make the casino, 
which is in a 70-year-old hotel, more competitive. Several casinos 
have undergone extensive renovations in the last few years, and two 
mega-casinos and other competition are expected in Atlantic City 
over the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point, the Claridge is the weakest of all the  
properties in Atlantic City,'' Leupp said. 
</P>
<P>
	Leupp noted that financial reorganizations are nothing new in  
Atlantic City. The Sands Hotel &AMP; Casino is currently operating 
under bankruptcy protection, and several other casinos there 
previously have reorganized, including Resorts Casino Hotel and the 
Trump Taj Mahal Casino Resort. 
</P>
<P>
	Claridge's vice president of finance, Jean Abbott, said that  
over the next several weeks casino officials plan to meet with the 
holders of the $85 million in bonds from the mortgage -- chief among 
them New York billionaire financier Carl Icahn -- to discuss 
restructuring that debt. 
</P>
<P>
	The most common form of bankruptcy, a Chapter 11 filing frees a  
company from the threat of lawsuits by creditors pending the 
reorganization of its finances. 
</P>
<P>
	Claridge spokesman Glen Lillie said the casino will operate as  
usual during the reorganization, adding that no layoffs among the 
2,200 employees are planned.

<HEADLINE> Lemieux Has Money To Buy Penguins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Mario Lemieux has the money needed to purchase  
the financially troubled Pittsburgh Penguins, with at least $50 
million wired into escrow accounts, his lawyer said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hall of Fame center still needs to finalize details and  
close on the deal, a process that could be completed in less than 
10 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyer Douglas Campbell was confident Lemieux would be able to  
purchase the bankrupt team for whom he played. The money needed to 
buy the Penguins was wired by investors into accounts by Monday, a 
deadline set by a federal bankruptcy judge, Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything's there. We're there,'' Campbell said. ``Now we  
just have to hammer out a series of agreements and so forth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The money to purchase the team won't come out of escrow until  
all the deals with investors, creditors and other involved parties 
have been signed. Campbell said he hoped Lemieux would be able to 
close on the purchase early next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell refused to name all the investors or detail how much  
they have invested, but said there is enough money in the escrow 
accounts now to pay for the Penguins, an amount believed to be $50 
million to $55 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the sale is completed, Lemieux needs signed agreements  
with several major creditors, his investors, Civic Arena operator 
SMG, Fox Sports Pittsburgh, the NHL and the players' union, said 
Joseph McDonough, a lawyer who represents insurance companies and 
banks owed more than $43 million. 
</P>
<P>
	With so much work remaining, McDonough said he was not surprised  
that Lemieux needed extra time -- including a 10-day extension by 
the court -- to complete the fund-raising part of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll be waiting for all of this to come to fruition,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though Monday came and went without a definitive word from  
Lemieux's lawyers about whether the money was in place to buy the 
team, other lawyers associated with the deal said they did not 
believe the delay hinted at any problems. 
</P>
<P>
	They said the deadline set by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Bernard  
Markovitz was considered more of a goal for Lemieux than a hard 
deadline. Further, finalizing the paperwork may take longer than 
the 10 days Lemieux's people are predicting, McDonough said. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of that documentation has to be done with all of the  
parties. Then it needs to be handed around to each other,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	McDonough said he has heard of ``no new or fresh problems'' that  
would prevent the agreement from being finished in the near future.

	Shuttle Streaks Toward Earth  
</P>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- With the first female commander at  
the controls, space shuttle Columbia streaked toward Earth late 
today after a short trip into orbit to drop off the world's most 
powerful X-ray telescope. Air Force Col. Eileen Collins and her 
co-pilot fired the braking rockets an hour before the scheduled 
11:20 p.m. touchdown, putting the shuttle on a gradual plunge. The 
42-year-old former test pilot, who twice served as a shuttle 
co-pilot, guided Columbia on a course that was to have it passing 
over central Texas, southern Louisiana, down across the Gulf of 
Mexico and on into Florida. NASA's landing strip was illuminated 
with xenon lights, and the moon was nearly full.

returning home from the United States received joyful welcomes 
today from loved ones they thought they might never again 
see.''This is the greatest day of all time,'' said Eshref Latifi, 
who returned home after almost four months. ``We had doubts about 
ever being together again, but hope kept us alive.'' Latifi and his 
family were among the first 275 Kosovo Albanians to return to the 
province from the United States. Many more of the nearly 10,000 who 
were brought to the United States are expected to follow. They 
returned to a radically different Kosovo, with Albanian flags 
fluttering on buildings and no sign of the hated blue-uniformed 
Serb police who imposed the discriminatory policies of the past.

	China's Trade Status Extended  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Overcoming complaints that the Chinese  
government abuses its own citizens and spies on America, the House 
today approved President Clinton's one-year extension of normal 
trade with China. The annual debate over the future of U.S.-Chinese 
trade policy ended with lawmakers voting 260-170 to defeat a 
resolution to overturn the one-year trade extension announced by 
Clinton on June 3. Since 1980 no Congress has succeeded in 
rejecting a president's decision to extend what was formerly called 
most-favored-nation status, which gives China the same low tariffs 
enjoyed by other U.S. trading partners.

	Prayer Books Stolen by Nazis Sought  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Descendants of a Jewish art collector are suing  
a Manhattan gallery for the return of eight rare prayer books, 
valued at $15 million, stolen by Nazis. The books belonged to 
Alphonse Kann, who collected more than 1,200 pieces of art, 
including paintings by Picasso, Manet and Matisse. He left his home 
in 1939, ahead of the Nazi occupation of France. In a lawsuit filed 
in State Supreme Court, descendants and heirs of Kann said the 
15th, 16th and 17th century hand-lettered and 
colorfully-illustrated manuscripts, known as ``Books of Hours,'' 
are currently at the Wildenstein Gallery.

	Russia Destroys Pirated Software  
</P>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Police destroyed half a million counterfeit  
computer discs today in a bid to show the Russian government's 
commitment to combatting software piracy. The discs, worth $1 
million, were scattered on the ground and crushed by a steamroller 
at a dump site outside Moscow. The public destruction was aimed at 
demonstrating that police were stepping up their fight against 
pirates, who are believed to control 90 percent of the Russian 
software market and cost Western firms and the government hundreds 
of millions of dollars a year. The discs -- including computer games 
and Windows 98 software -- were seized by agents posing as buyers 
from a Moscow-based company that police say is one of Russia's 
biggest pirates.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Al Martin hit two solo homers, including one to  
lead off the game, and Kris Benson made it hold up with his first 
career complete game tonight to lead the Pittsburgh Pirates to a 
5-1 victory over the New York Mets. Brant Brown also hit a solo 
homer for the Pirates, who stopped the Mets' season-high six-game 
winning streak and won for just the fourth time in their last 18 
games at Shea Stadium. Benson (8-8) threw first-pitch strikes to 25 
of 33 batters in holding the Mets to six hits and no walks. He 
struck out five. The only run scored on Robin Ventura's homer in 
the seventh.

<HEADLINE> Lack of Hispanics on TV Decried </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Two weeks after the NAACP decried a scarcity of  
minority faces on network television, a national coalition of 
Latino civil rights groups demanded Tuesday an end to the 
``brownout'' of Hispanics in the media. 
</P>
<P>
	While Hispanics constitute 11 percent of the U.S. population,  
they comprise less than 2 percent of the characters on prime-time 
television shows, said Lisa Navarrete, a spokeswoman for La Raza, a 
national Hispanic advocacy organization. She spoke at the annual 
convention of the National Council of La Raza. 
</P>
<P>
	Navarrete said that only one Latino actor, Martin Sheen on NBC's  
West Wing, has been cast on a new network show set to premier in 
the 1999-2000 season. 
</P>
<P>
	At a meeting with representatives of the National Hispanic Media  
Coalition and the National Hispanic Foundation for the Arts, La 
Raza was examining how to pressure broadcasters to diversify the 
faces on television. 
</P>
<P>
	La Raza President Raul Yzaguirre said a lack of Hispanic faces  
on television contributes to marginalizing and stereotyping. 
</P>
<P>
	``People build perceptions of the world around them based in  
part by what they see on television,'' Yzaguirre said. ``We want a 
balanced picture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NBC said in a statement that minority representation ``continues  
to remain a top priority'' and expressed pride in minority actors 
on shows including ``ER'' and ``Law &AMP; Order.'' The statement added: 
``We realize there is still work to be done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other major networks had no immediate response to requests for  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago at its national conference in New York, the NAACP  
announced it would begin to monitor the ``virtual whitewash'' in 
fall TV programming. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to requesting congressional and Federal  
Communications Commission hearings on licensing and ownership of 
the networks, campaign organizers are considering lawsuits and 
boycotts of advertisers. 
</P>
<P>
	The NAACP also plans to study whether the 1934 Communications  
Act mandating public ownership of the airwaves can be used as a 
basis for suing.

<HEADLINE> Company Accused in Suture Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- The nation's biggest maker of surgical  
sutures has been accused in a federal class-action lawsuit of 
selling a contaminated product that gave patients serious 
infections and caused at least one death. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the lawsuit, ``contaminated sutures'' made by  
Ethicon Inc. in 1994 were used in surgeries and other medical 
procedures, causing serious injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of these victims had to be rehospitalized for a  
significant amount of time,'' attorney Wendy York of Sacramento, 
Calif., said Tuesday. She said a woman from the San Francisco Bay 
area died as a result of an infection caused by the sutures. 
</P>
<P>
	Ethicon, a Johnson &AMP; Johnson company based in Somerville,  
recalled 3.5 million packages of its Vicryl brand of sutures in 
1994 -- under pressure from federal regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	However, because hospitals use up sutures quickly, only  
one-fourth were returned to the manufacturer and destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We recalled the sutures ... not because we believed the  
product was contaminated, but because we could not assure (its) 
sterility,'' said Susan Odenthal, director of communications at 
Ethicon, which makes about 80 percent of the sutures used in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	She declined to discuss specific allegations. The company has  
made confidential settlements with some plaintiffs, but Odenthal 
said she did not know how many. 
</P>
<P>
	Some patients had to have additional surgery to clean up the  
infection or redo the original operation, the lawsuit said. One Las 
Vegas police officer was permanently disabled. 
</P>
<P>
	York said she represents 35 plaintiffs who developed  
post-operative infections along the suture lines, causing such 
symptoms as fevers, chronic fatigue, extreme nausea and painful 
swelling. Other lawyers represent additional clients, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Food and Drug Administration inspected the company's plant  
in July 1994 and warned Ethicon to resolve its sterilization 
problem or face sanctions. According to the FDA, it was satisfied 
with the company's recall and subsequent sterilization process. 
</P>
<P>
	An FDA letter to two California congressmen who had inquired  
about the recall states that there was only ``a low to moderate 
risk of serious adverse health consequences'' from the sutures. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter notes 73 reports to the FDA of infections in patients  
stitched with sutures from the Vicryl lots that were recalled, but 
there was insufficient data on the type of bacteria involved to 
prove a connection. 
</P>
<P>
	Ethicon maintained in a letter to Congressional investigators  
that, ``We believe that the cases reported to be related to this 
suture were in fact typical post-surgical infections due to usual 
causes.'' Such infections occur in about 2.5 percent of operations.

<HEADLINE> Reform Party Has Long Way To Go </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- The Reform Party has a star in Minnesota  
Gov. Jesse Ventura and nearly $13 million in federal matching funds 
to hand to a presidential candidate next year, but it doesn't have 
much else. 
</P>
<P>
	The economic issues that used to focus third-party anger are  
dormant, the relationship between Ventura and party founder Ross 
Perot is chilly, and the party has no presidential strategy yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Are they a major force in American politics? Are they offering  
answers to vexing problems that aren't arising elsewhere? No,'' 
said Thomas Mann, director of governmental studies at the 
nonpartisan Brookings Institution in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The party comes off a fractious convention weekend where  
activists chose Jack Gargan of Cedar Key, Fla., as chairman to 
succeed Russ Verney, a Perot ally. 
</P>
<P>
	Gargan was Ventura's pick, and a key Minnesota leader said  
Gargan's election will open the party as never before for 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	But there's a long way to go.  
</P>
<P>
	The Wall Street Journal ran an editorial Tuesday with a picture  
of Ventura and the words ``among the zanies'' below it. Despite the 
pro wrestler's shocking victory last year, analysts say the Reform 
Party isn't in a position to do well in elections anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota Reform Party founder Dean Barkley, now director of the  
state agency in charge of long-range policy and planning, literally 
laughed off the skepticism. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm amused with all these pundits writing our obituary and the  
election is still a year and three months out,'' Barkley said. 
``It's the same ones who would have given us no chance that Ventura 
could win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mann, however, said the party has only three things going for  
it: ballot access in 19 states, the federal matching funds and 
Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no image for the Reform Party. There's no serious  
identification of citizens for the party. There's not much of an 
organizational base, so there's not much to it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Third parties tend to struggle without economic discontent or  
ideological extremism in the major parties. The Reform Party 
originally appealed to voters on the issues of a balanced budget, 
trade protectionism and term limits, but those no longer register. 
</P>
<P>
	A Pew Research Center for the People and the Press poll released  
last week showed no single burning issue concerning voters. Shortly 
before Perot first ran for president in 1992, more than four out of 
10 voters surveyed named the economy as the top issue. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wall Street Journal editorial said the party runs the risk  
of being ``taken over by a faction lured primarily by the $13 
million in federal funds that Reform has coming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the money, no candidate has emerged to lead the ticket  
and Ventura's status only helps the party so much. He doesn't 
credit the party for his own victory, he hasn't spoken with Perot 
in months and doesn't plan to become a party builder. Ventura has 
also ruled out a presidential bid himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Pew Center director Andrew Kohut said the party is in  
better shape now ``without seeming to be under the thumb of Ross 
Perot. The public looks at him much more skeptically than they do 
Jesse Ventura, although neither is considered presidential timber 
this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barkley believes the party will find a good centrist candidate.  
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people giggled when Jesse Ventura was first  
announced, and they aren't giggling right now,'' Barkley said.

<HEADLINE> Williamsburg Tries To Depict Slavery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILLIAMSBURG, Va. (AP) -- On a recent sweltering summer day,  
tourists at Colonial Williamsburg were talking to five ``slaves'' -- 
actors in period costume -- behind the cabinetmaker's shop. 
</P>
<P>
	Suddenly, three armed ``colonists'' stormed into the crowd,  
yelling into the faces of the tourists and demanding to know who 
had called this illegal meeting of slaves. 
</P>
<P>
	One slave by the name of Peter scuffled with the colonists.  
Others quietly protested that they did nothing wrong, then left. 
</P>
<P>
	This mini-drama acted out for the tourists evoked raw emotion  
among the mostly white visitors. Some gasped in shock. Tears welled 
up in the eyes of others. 
</P>
<P>
	The tourists got the message Colonial Williamsburg was trying to  
send. 
</P>
<P>
	Colonial Williamsburg, a reconstructed colonial capital of  
houses, shops and cobblestone streets where employees in period 
costume teach visitors about life in the 18th century and portray 
historical figures such as Thomas Jefferson and Patrick Henry, 
wants to show visitors that the nation's birth involved more than 
patriotic speeches by white men. 
</P>
<P>
	``We couldn't continue to tell the story of Colonial  
Williamsburg without telling the whole story,'' said spokeswoman 
Lorraine Brooks. More than half of the 2,000 people who lived in 
Williamsburg in the late 18th century were black, and most of them 
were slaves. 
</P>
<P>
	Colonial Williamsburg has been staging historical re-enactments  
involving blacks for about 20 years. But this year, it is making a 
greater effort, with daily walking tours and re-enactments. The 
program, called ``Enslaving Virginia,'' began in March, and the 
illegal slave gathering scene is one of the most popular parts. 
</P>
<P>
	Blacks ``have been omitted from so much,'' said Joan Carroll of  
Paterson, N.J., a black woman visiting with her husband, daughter 
and grandson. ``I think it's good they are trying to make Americans 
aware of all of their history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Josey, who portrays the slave Peter, said the program  
seems to have really struck a chord with children. Josey said 
children have even tried to help Peter escape. 
</P>
<P>
	At times, spectators have challenged the colonists' authority to  
break up the meeting. (In 1775, it was illegal for five or more 
slaves to gather.) One tourist tried to snatch away a musket, 
program manager Mark Howell said. More common are shocked 
expressions, nervous laughter and tears. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most people don't want to be made to feel awkward,'' Howell  
said. ``This program does that, for both blacks and whites. I don't 
think that's bad. Our challenge is to make people on vacation to 
try to come to grips with'' the tragic aspects of America's 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at Colonial Williamsburg believe ``Enslaving  
Virginia'' is important not just for the sake of historical 
accuracy but to broaden the tourist attraction's appeal. Colonial 
Williamsburg gets about 1 million paying visitors a year, and only 
about 4 percent this year are black, Ms. Brooks said. That's up 
from 1 percent a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Enslaving Virginia'' was a gamble for Colonial Williamsburg.  
Five years ago, its re-enactment of a slave auction drew protests 
from blacks. 
</P>
<P>
	The new program works because it is presented in context, said  
King Salim Khalfani, executive director of the Virginia NAACP. The 
slave auction was insulting to blacks because it was one small part 
of a weekend of activities focused on King George III's coronation, 
Khalfani said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our feeling was that they did things differently this time,''  
he said. ``Even though it may be painful, I think it's a part of 
history that needs to be dealt with and looked at.''

<HEADLINE> British Fine Rail Co. in Collision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- A passenger train company was fined $2.4 million  
today after being found guilty of dereliction of duty in a 
collision which killed seven people. 
</P>
<P>
	The fine was the largest ever imposed in Britain for violations  
of the Health and Safety Act. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Scott Baker also criticized Great Western Trains chief  
executive Richard George or other executives for not appearing in 
court ``to express personally remorse ... and to allay any 
impression of complacency that may have been conveyed to the 
victims, their families and the public.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seven people died and 150 people were injured on Sept. 19, 1997,  
when the high-speed train from Swansea, Wales, hit a freight train 
near Paddington Station in west London. 
</P>
<P>
	Testimony at the three-day hearing indicated the passenger train  
had gone through a red light, and an automatic warning device in 
the cab was not working. Baker said the train, which had a 
locomotive at each end, should have been turned around before 
heading to London to insure that the driver had a working warning 
device 
</P>
<P>
	``Those who travel on high speed trains are entitled to expect  
the highest standard of care from those who run them. Great Western 
Trains failed to meet that standard and in my judgment they failed 
to meet it by a greater extent than they have been prepared to 
admit,'' Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company later issued a statement expressing ``our extreme  
regret at the loss of lives and injury in this appalling tragedy. 
Whilst working within the rules, we have accepted there was a 
serious breach of the health and safety laws by failing to do all 
we reasonably could to avoid risk.''

<HEADLINE> Study Probes Campaign Contributions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore has raised more money  
from the entertainment industry than any other presidential 
candidate, and Texas Gov. George W. Bush has taken in the most 
money from the high-technology industry, a political watchdog group 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, former Sen. Bill Bradley, who was a consultant to  
financial companies, trailed only Bush in the amount of money 
raised from Wall Street, and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., raised more 
money from gambling interests than anyone else during the first six 
months of 1999, according a study by the Center for Responsive 
Politics, a Washington-based nonpartisan research group. 
</P>
<P>
	The study examined contributions to the Democratic and  
Republican presidential candidates between Jan. 1 and June 30. Bush 
set a record by raising $37 million, and had $30 million in the 
bank at midyear. Gore raised $17.5 million, plus an additional $2 
million for legal and accounting expenses, and had $9.4 million in 
the bank. Bradley reported raising $11.7 million and had a balance 
of $7.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore took in $479,245 from the entertainment industry, with Bush  
second at $357,802 and Bradley third at $320,874. Like President 
Clinton, Gore has a list of supporters studded with such Hollywood 
luminaries as actor Kevin Costner, actress and singer Barbra 
Streisand and producer Quincy Jones. Employees and executives of 
Viacom, which owns Paramount Pictures and MTV, gave Gore $70,250, 
second only to members of the accounting firm of Ernst &AMP; Young, 
which contributed $114,200. 
</P>
<P>
	But Bradley also has his supporters in the entertainment  
industry; former Paramount Pictures chief Barry Diller has hosted a 
fund-raiser for him. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, meanwhile, received more than 20 donations from executives  
of the Warner Bros. entertainment conglomerate, including $1,000 
each from Robert A. Daly and Terry Semel, who are stepping down as 
co-leaders of Warner Bros.' movie, television and music divisions. 
</P>
<P>
	While Clinton and Gore also have courted the high-tech industry,  
Bush led the way, taking in $379,200 from computer companies. Gore 
was second at $178,085 and Bradley a close third at $166,975. Among 
Bush's contributors: the Technology Network political action 
committee, which spent $5,000 on a newspaper ad featuring high-tech 
executives backing Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, a former oil company executive, took in $1 million from  
the oil and gas industry, six times more than the rest of the other 
presidential candidates combined. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore led the way in contributions from the telephone industry,  
raising $200,665. A former top aide to the vice president, Roy 
Neel, now heads the U.S. Telephone Association. McCain raised 
$138,850 from the industry; he chairs the Senate Commerce 
Committee, which has jurisdiction over telecommunications issues. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain raised $51,663 from gambling interests, more than the  
other candidates combined. McCain backed legislation in 1995 paving 
the way for gambling ``cruises to nowhere'' and strongly supports 
Indian casinos. Las Vegas casino executives Steve Wynn and J. 
Terrance Lanni have given him $1,000 each. In addition, McCain 
``never misses a championship fight in Las Vegas,'' according to 
former Republican National Chairman Frank Fahrenkopf Jr., who now 
lobbies for casinos as president of the American Gaming 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wall Street, Bush has raised $1.8 million, but Bradley is  
right behind at $1.6 million. Bradley's top five contributors all 
were financial firms, led by employees and executives of Lehman 
Brothers and their families, who gave him $81,500. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest contributors to Bush, Gore and Bradley were lawyers.  
Both Bush and Gore each raised $2.9 million from members of law 
firms, while Bradley raised $1.8 million. Bush's top contributors 
were members of the law firm of Vinson &AMP; Elkins and their families, 
who gave him a total of $189,850.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Up Against Most Currencies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar rose against most major currencies  
Tuesday, recovering slightly against the euro after a weeklong 
rally by the struggling European currency. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0620, down  
from $1.0654 reached late Monday. Earlier Monday, it rose as high 
as $1.0724, its highest level in 10 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the dollar also was quoted at 116.36 yen, down from  
116.61 yen at the same point on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the euro slid to an all-time low of $1.0108 before  
staging a sharp rebound amid signs of renewed economic growth in 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	In other trading Tuesday, the dollar was quoted at 1.5064 Swiss  
francs, up from 1.5052 late Monday, and 1.5143 Canadian dollars, up 
from 1.5095. The British pound rose to $1.5911, up from $1.5906 
late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are  
no longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed 
rate. Based on Tuesday's late euro rate, the dollar was worth: 
1.8416 German marks, up from 1.8359 late Monday; and 6.1767 French 
francs, up from 6.1576.

TV assets of Gannett Co. for $2.7 billion in the company's second 
substantial acquisition this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of the agreement announced today, Cox would get  
about 525,000 cable subscribers in Oklahoma, Kansas and North 
Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Cox would be paying about $5,100 per subscriber, a new high in  
the cable industry. The deal would clean out the cable television 
assets of Gannett, an Arlington, Va.-based publishing giant. 
</P>
<P>
	News of the deal was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.  
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, Cox agreed to swap its AT&AMP;T stock valued at  
$2.8 billion for AT&AMP;T-owned cable television systems in seven 
southern and western states. Cox also plans to buy TCA Cable TV in 
a $4 billion deal involving 883,000 subscribers, Cox's biggest 
acquisition to date. 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta-based Cox stands to have around 6 million  
subscribers, putting it in contention for the industry's No. 3 spot 
alongside Comcast Corp. and behind AT&AMP;T. 
</P>
<P>
	About 75 percent of the Gannett systems have been upgraded to  
handle interactive television, high-speed access and telephone 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	A few years ago, cable customers fetched about $1,500 each. In  
June 1998, AT&AMP;T spent $3,500 per subscriber for the customers of 
Tele-Communications Inc., a record at the time. Earlier this year, 
AT&AMP;T agreed to spend $4,700 for each subscriber of MediaOne Group. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, which has been approved by Gannett's board of  
directors, is still subject to regulatory approval. It is expected 
to be completed by early next year. 
</P>
<P>
	In early afternoon trading, shares of Cox were down 93 3/4 cents to  
$37.87 1/2, while shares of Gannett were up $2 to $76.50, both on the 
New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Yosemite Mystery May Be Solved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Carole Sund and Silvina Pelosso were  
strangled in their motel room, then stuffed into the trunk of their 
rental car. Fifteen-year-old Juli Sund was taken to a remote lake, 
where her head was nearly cut off the next day. 
</P>
<P>
	That is the account given by motel handyman Cary Stayner, who  
confessed to the slayings. If he's telling the truth, it solves the 
Yosemite sightseers mystery, a case that has bedeviled the FBI 
since the three women disappeared from the Cedar Lodge on Feb. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Sund, 42, a member of a wealthy real estate family in  
Eureka, was on a trip through the Sierra foothills with her 
daughter Juli and their Argentine friend Ms. Pelosso, 16. 
</P>
<P>
	They were found dead weeks later and hours away from where they  
were last seen. The burned bodies of Mrs. Sund and Ms. Pelosso were 
found in the trunk of their charred rental car. Juli's body was 
discovered more than 30 miles away on a hill. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner, 37, described the crimes in detail to the FBI and again  
in a jailhouse interview, saying he had fantasized about tying up 
and killing women since he was 7. He also confessed to beheading 
Joie Armstrong, a naturalist at Yosemite. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am guilty,'' Stayner said, according to Ted Rowlands, a  
reporter with KNTV in San Jose who questioned him through thick 
glass in the Sacramento County jail. ``I did murder Carole Sund, 
Juli Sund, Silvina Pelosso and Joie Armstrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner escaped detection until he was taken in Saturday in last  
week's slaying of Ms. Armstrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Blaming voices in his head for driving him to murder, Stayner  
claimed he acted alone. And based on details from his confession 
and evidence recovered since then, the FBI apparently believes him, 
the Los Angeles Times reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner also said during the KNTV interview that none of the  
women was sexually abused or tortured in any way. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI hasn't released any details about Stayner's confessions,  
and the KNTV report and the Times story, which cites unidentified 
sources, provide no insights as to how he singlehandedly 
overpowered three women. 
</P>
<P>
	Carole Carrington, Mrs. Sund's mother, learned of Stayner's  
admissions Monday night. She said ``I hope that's true,'' but 
remained skeptical he could have carried out the killings alone. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like for it to be solved but I can't help but wonder if  
sombody else wasn't involved, too,'' she told the Eureka Times 
Standard. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner said he strangled Mrs. Sund and Ms. Pelosso in their  
room at the Cedar Lodge, where he also lived. He then took Juli to 
a point overlooking Don Pedro Reservoir, where he killed her early 
the next morning and hid the body in thick underbrush. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he left wet towels in the motel room to make it seem as  
if they had taken a morning shower and left without trouble. He 
then drove the sightseers' rental car with the bodies of Mrs. Sund 
and Ms. Pelosso in the trunk to Long Barn, a tiny town hours to the 
north along twisting mountain roads. 
</P>
<P>
	He abandoned the car and took a taxi and bus back to the lodge.  
Two days later, he returned to burn the car, and to confuse police 
further, he took Mrs. Sund's wallet and dropped it on a Modesto 
street. 
</P>
<P>
	Questioned and ruled out as a suspect early in the sightseer  
probe, he took a risk by sending an anonymous letter to the FBI 
tipping them to the whereabouts of Juli's body. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner told KNTV he figured he had gotten away with the  
murders, especially after news reports said the FBI had focused on 
a ring of ex-convicts in Modesto. He kept working and living at 
Cedar Lodge to avoid drawing suspicion. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the risks, he said he couldn't help himself from killing  
again after he encountered Ms. Armstrong last week and realized she 
was alone. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sorry that all their loved ones were where they were when  
they were. I wish I could have controlled myself and not done what 
I did,'' Stayner said, according to KNTV. 
</P>
<P>
	The kidnapping of his younger brother Steven by a child molester  
-- a case that made headlines when Steven resurfaced seven years 
later -- had nothing to do with his criminal behavior, he said.

<HEADLINE> Early Euro Cash Distribution Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- European citizens may get their hands  
on euro cash sooner than expected, according to a European Union 
report that urges countries using the new common currency to ditch 
their national moneys earlier than planned. 
</P>
<P>
	The report says the 11 euro-zone nations should consider  
distributing small quantities of the new coins and banknotes to 
people some days ahead of the Jan. 1, 2002, launch date to avoid a 
sudden rush on euros and to allow people to become familiar with 
the new money. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the report, due to be debated by the EU executive  
Commission on Wednesday, euro-zone nations should also complete the 
switch from national currencies to euros within one to three months 
of the introduction of euro cash, cutting down the six-month 
transition currently foreseen. 
</P>
<P>
	``Keeping in circulation a too-large number of notes and coins  
of the national currency alongside the introduction of the euros 
will be a source of confusion,'' said the report compiled by Manual 
Marin, acting president of the EU Commission, and Finance 
Commissioner Yves-Thibault de Silguy. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the euro nations should seek to ensure a ``critical  
mass'' of euro notes and coins are circulating within a few days of 
the launch. 
</P>
<P>
	If approved by the EU executive body on Wednesday, the report  
will be presented to EU finance ministers at a meeting starting 
Sept. 10 in Turku, Finland. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro was launched on Jan. 1 when the 11 nations permanently  
locked their exchange rates. Although it has become widely used for 
non-paper transactions by banks, large companies and financial 
markets, the EU set aside a three-year transition period before 
euro cash is introduced and a further six months before the new 
notes and coins finally replace the old money. 
</P>
<P>
	The new report urged EU governments to relaunch information  
campaigns on the euro, complaining that companies and citizens were 
taking too long to adapt to the new money. ``Despite a successful 
launch, the entry of the euro reveals some gaps which justify a 
rapid resumption of information actions,'' Marin and de Silguy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Just 1.35 percent of private individuals were asking for their  
credit card bills in euros, according to a survey cited in the 
report. 
</P>
<P>
	It also acknowledged that many citizens were disappointed by the  
lack of obvious benefits from the euro's launch, particularly 
because bank charges for transferring money among euro-zone nations 
had not fallen. 
</P>
<P>
	Although some 35 percent of companies mention euros in bills to  
clients and many major international companies had switched to the 
euro for internal accounts, the report said many smaller companies 
were waiting until 2001 before adopting the new money.

<HEADLINE> FDA OKs Drug Despite Panel Concerns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An inhalant drug for the treatment of simple  
influenza has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration, 
despite an advisory panel recommendation that the drug be rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug, to be marketed under the name Relenza, was approved by  
the FDA based on U.S., Australian and European clinical studies 
that showed it reduced the duration of flu symptoms by one to one 
and a half days. 
</P>
<P>
	An FDA advisory panel in February voted 13-4 against  
recommending approval of Relenza, saying the drug showed only a 
small benefit for flu sufferers. The panel called for more studies, 
particular among nursing home populations. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA rarely approves a drug over an advisory committee's  
negative recommendation, but the agency has the authority to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Heidi M. Jolson, director of the FDA's antiviral drug  
product division, said Relenza's manufacturer, GlaxoWellcome, Inc., 
provided more information about the drug after the February 
committee meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``We felt we had sufficiently addressed the concerns that the  
advisory committee had brought up,'' Jolson said, though she 
admitted that going against an advisory committee's recommendation 
``doesn't happen commonly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the drug offers only a modest benefit, it adds a new  
weapon to a flu-fighting arsenal that now is very limited, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Influenza is an important public health problem and this will  
provide another option for treatment,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	But some experts said the drug offers little relief and could  
cause serious side effects for some patients. 
</P>
<P>
	``This drug should never have been approved,'' said Dr. Sidney  
Wolfe of the Public Citizen Health Group. ``The benefits are close 
to zero.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wolfe, a frequent critic of the FDA, said the action is an  
example of new and lower standards the agency is now using for drug 
approvals. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the drug could pose a breathing risk for asthma  
patients. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA announcement did warn that asthma sufferers might face  
breathing problems and recommended that they be ready to use 
bronchodilator therapy when taking Relenza. 
</P>
<P>
	Glaxo officials said the drug is the first of a new class,  
called neuraminidase inhibitors, that attacks both type A and type 
B flu strains. The drug is approved for prescription use by adults 
and by adolescents 12 years and older who have had flu symptoms for 
no more than two days. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Michael J. Elliott of Glaxo, based in Research Triangle  
Park, N.C., said the drug has been tested on about 6,000 people 
total in its clinical trials. In Australian and European trials, he 
said, flu sufferers reported the inhaled drug shortened the 
duration of flu symptoms by about a day and a half. 
</P>
<P>
	In U.S. studies, patients using the drug said their symptoms  
went away about a day earlier than people taking a placebo. Elliott 
said these findings were based on the self-reporting of people 
involved in the clinical trials and were not proven by laboratory 
tests. 
</P>
<P>
	The American studies mean the course of a flu illness that would  
last from 6 to 10 days would be reduced to 5 to 9 days, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Influenza affects 25 million to 50 million Americans annually  
and is blamed for more than 20,000 deaths and about 300,000 
hospitalizations. Flu incidence tends to peak in the fall and 
winter. Symptoms include headache, muscle aches, fever, cough and 
sore throats. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA said the Relenza was only effective among patients who  
started treatment within two days after symptoms appeared, and was 
less effective among patients who did not have fever or severe 
symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug was not proven effective in preventing the flu, the FDA  
found. Jolson said the drug was not indicated for use in stopping 
the spread of influenza in such places as nursing homes. This was 
an issue the advisory panel recommended be studied. 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott said Glaxo had not determined the price of the drug, but  
it is expected to be available this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very pleased that Relenza will now be available for the  
1999-2000 flu season,'' Dr. James Palmer, a Glaxo vice president, 
said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug works by inhibiting the action of neuraminidase, an  
enzyme the flu virus uses to break away from an infected cell and 
move to another cell. Blocking the enzyme's action limits the 
spread of the virus. 
</P>
<P>
	Relenza is to be sold in 10-dose packages. It is to be taken  
twice daily for five days. Relenza is dispensed through a device 
that lets the patient inhale the drug into the lungs through a 
mouthpiece.

<HEADLINE> US Said To Ignore Latin America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the Cold War over and democracies in  
place almost everywhere, Latin America appeared to some to be 
poised for takeoff a decade ago. But with the new millennium in 
sight, the trends in the region are largely negative, leaving some 
analysts deeply worried about the seeming inattention of the 
Clinton administration. 
</P>
<P>
	They cite the weak democracies in many countries, accelerating  
urban crime, persistent corruption, untamed drug trafficking, low 
economic growth rates, yawning gaps between rich and poor and 
stubbornly high rates of extreme poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Shifter, an analyst at the Washington-based  
Inter-American Dialogue, says, ``We have to really try to 
strengthen the capacity of governments to address these problems. 
It deserves high-level attention, which it is not getting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Says Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga., chairman of the Senate Foreign  
Relations Western Hemisphere subcommittee: ``I can't remember 
another time in our recent history when we have paid less attention 
to developments in our own hemisphere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As an example of the administration's East-West orientation,  
secretaries of state routinely attend meetings of NATO and of 
Asia-Pacific foreign ministers each year. No secretary of state has 
attended the annual meeting of Western Hemisphere foreign ministers 
meeting in a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials note that virtually all of the security threats the  
United States faces come from Europe and Asia. And for all of Latin 
America's problems, development of weapons of mass destruction is 
not one of them, they point out. 
</P>
<P>
	And as an example of administration awareness of troubling  
trends in the Latin America, they cite a May speech by Secretary of 
State Madeleine Albright in which she said the ``gaping 
inequality'' between haves and have-nots in Latin American 
threatens democracy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Neither democracy nor prosperity can endure unless they are  
broadly based,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Colombia, such inequalities have fueled a three-decade civil  
war. Of more direct concern to Americans is what the 
administration's top drug control official, Gen. Barry McCaffrey, 
calls ``the serious and growing emergency'' of cocaine and heroin 
trafficking to the United States from Colombia. McCaffrey is on a 
three-nation visit to the region this week. War and drug 
trafficking are forcing many Colombians to flee to the United 
States and other countries. 
</P>
<P>
	In neighboring Venezuela, widespread disgust with 40 years of  
multiparty democracy has led to the emergence of a populist leader, 
President Hugo Chavez, who reminds some of the Fidel Castro of a 
generation ago. As an Army colonel in 1992, Chavez staged a failed 
coup attempted against the elected government. Elected himself in 
December, Chavez has broad-based support, but some worry he may 
assume dictatorial powers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every colonel in Latin America is watching to see if what  
Chavez does works,'' says Mark Falcoff, who watches hemispheric 
affairs at the American Enterprise Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	A series of ``economic shocks in Latin America,'' many of them  
imported from other regions, has kept down economic growth rates 
over the decade, says Nora Lustig of the Inter-American Development 
Bank. She estimates the number of Latin Americans living in extreme 
poverty at 150 million. Collectively, she anticipates a zero growth 
rate for Latin America this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Says Falcoff: ``The market-driven model has exhausted its  
possibilities, but there is nothing else out there that can solve 
problems. When countries lose their economic viability, they move 
to criminality.'' He foresees an immigration wave from Latin 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	John Sweeney of the Heritage Foundation says protection could  
wreck the goal of a hemispheric free trade area by 2005. ``It looms 
ever further away,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Another concern of Sweeney's is Mexico where, he says, at least  
three states qualify as ``criminal states'' -- meaning the local 
governments are controlled by drug traffickers. Ecuador is 
``staggering toward economic collapse,'' he says. Peru increasingly 
behaves like a military dictatorship under President Alberto 
Fujimori, he adds. 
</P>
<P>
	Falcoff goes further: ``All the Andean countries are falling  
apart.''

<HEADLINE> House GOP Would Cut NASA 10 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Members of both parties say they will try to  
ease a 10 percent cut in NASA's budget that has been approved by a 
House subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Alan Mollohan, D-W.Va., criticized the ``enormous,  
devastating'' reduction in the space agency's budget as a House 
Appropriations Committee subcommittee, on a voice vote Monday, 
approved a $93.8 billion measure financing housing, veterans, 
science and environmental programs for next year. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA Administrator Daniel Goldin said such cuts, if ever  
enacted, would result in the agency having to lay off workers, 
close two or three of its 10 centers and sustain delays in 
deploying the space station. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're talking about gutting space exploration,'' he told  
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Subcommittee Chairman James Walsh, R-N.Y., the bill's chief  
author, said the cuts in space spending were ``perhaps the most 
difficult and painful choices'' he made in writing the measure. 
</P>
<P>
	Referring to that and other reductions, he said he would ``make  
every effort to address these difficulties'' later this year, when 
the legislation is likely to be part of budget negotiations with 
the Clinton administration expected to result in higher spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the legislation, the National Aeronautics and Space  
Administration would get $12.3 billion for fiscal 2000, which 
begins Oct. 1. The space agency received $13.7 billion this year, 
and President Clinton requested $13.6 billion for next. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure would provide $2.4 billion for the international  
space station, one of NASA's highest priorities. That's $100 
million more than this year, only half the boost Clinton requested. 
</P>
<P>
	It is elsewhere that NASA would feel the pinch. The legislation  
would deny the president's $150 million request for future missions 
of the Earth observing system, which studies climate, and trim $75 
million from future Mars exploration missions as well. The space 
shuttle would get $150 million less than Clinton wants. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill's cuts reflect the GOP's efforts to try living within  
spending limits enacted in 1997 in the budget-balancing agreement 
with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	To help stay within those limits, the subcommittee would  
designate $3 billion in veterans health-care spending and $2.5 
billion in disaster assistance as ``emergencies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under budget law, that means those items would be exempt from  
spending limits. Clinton had proposed making the disaster spending 
an emergency, but not the veterans' money. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel also claimed savings by reducing the Tennessee Valley  
Authority's ability to borrow by $3 billion -- loans the agency is 
not expected to seek anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would provide $7.3 billion for the Environmental  
Protection Agency, $100 million above Clinton's request but nearly 
$300 million below this year. Within that total, it would provide 
$115 million for climate change technology -- a favorite of Vice 
President Al Gore -- just half the administration's request. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans would provide $18.3 billion for veteran's health  
care, $1 billion more than this year and Clinton's original 
request. Gore said Monday the administration now wants $1 billion 
more as well, as veterans' groups apply pressure for more spending. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure also provides $26.1 billion for the Department of  
Housing and Urban Development, $2 billion less than Clinton 
requested but $2 billion more than this year. Money for inner-city 
development and aid for public housing renters would be cut below 
Clinton's requests. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo said the cut  
``strikes a terrible blow against families and communities in need, 
ensuring that those left behind on America's road to prosperity 
will fall even further back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the GOP-dominated Senate voted to restore a rule it  
abandoned four years ago that will make it harder to use spending 
bills to change laws. The near party-line vote to renew that rule 
was 53-45. 
</P>
<P>
	The lack of the rule in recent years made it easier for  
Democrats to slow work on spending bills and force debate -- and 
often votes -- on patients' rights and other issues.

<HEADLINE> Ravens Hire Firm To Manage Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- The Baltimore Ravens have hired an investment  
banking firm to handle the sale of part of the debt-ridden team to 
a new investor. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ravens retained Baltimore-based Deutsche Bank Alex. Brown to  
help evaluate proposals and negotiate an agreement. The process is 
expected to take several months, the Ravens said Tuesday in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Ravens owner Art Modell has said the new partner will not have a  
controlling share of the Ravens, but could receive first refusal 
rights if the team is sold. The controlling share will remain with 
Modell's wife, Patricia. 
</P>
<P>
	Modell said taking on a new investor would help reduce debt,  
which the team incurred beginning in Cleveland. Because it is a 
private company, the team does not report its finances. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ravens went heavily into debt when Modell moved the team  
from Cleveland after the 1995 season. Two years ago, the Ravens 
took $185 million in loans and other forms of credit to help reduce 
the deficit.

<HEADLINE> House GOP Eyes Budget Surplus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Though they deny it, House Republicans'  
initial spending plans threaten to erode more than $14 billion of 
next year's projected budget surplus, jeopardizing Social Security 
surpluses they have promised not to touch. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP leaders insist that by the time their spending bills are  
approved, they will not use any Social Security money -- a pledge 
that has been a defining political theme for both political parties 
all year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will not go into those monies,'' House Majority Leader Dick  
Armey, R-Texas, told reporters Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But for now, House Republicans have written spending bills for  
the coming fiscal year with accounting devices letting them use 
more than $14 billion of next year's anticipated federal surplus 
for higher spending and for tax cuts, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
	That number is crucial because the Congressional Budget Office,  
Congress' official budget scorekeeper, has projected a $161 billion 
surplus for next year. Of that, $147 billion is to come from Social 
Security. So using more than $14 billion of the surplus eats into 
the Social Security portion of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like if the bills go through the way they're  
currently drafted, the $14 billion has already been committed to 
these various uses,'' said Susan Tanaka, the Congressional Budget 
Office's associate communications director. 
</P>
<P>
	Agreeing was Carol Cox Wait, president of the Committee for a  
Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan budget watchdog group. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would appear they're heading down a road that would have  
them at the end of the year not keeping their pledge to save every 
cent of the Social Security trust fund,'' Wait said. ``But it won't 
be the outcome at the end of the year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats and some moderate and conservative Republicans have  
criticized the accounting techniques used to spend the surplus 
funds. With support uncertain, some GOP leaders are trying to pare 
them back. 
</P>
<P>
	``All these plans are subject to change,'' said the House Budget  
Committee chairman, John Kasich, R-Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	To abandon some of the budget devices and avoid spending Social  
Security money, however, Republicans could have to cut spending 
further, which they may not have the votes to do. Armey said 
Republicans would not shrink their tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost everyone expects that at year's end, Congress and  
President Clinton will negotiate spending bills that are more 
expensive than the ones Republicans are now writing. And the 
bargainers may figure out a way to avoid spending Social Security 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if they do, the budget devices Republicans are using let  
them claim right now that they are living within spending limits 
set two years ago, while in actuality they are exceeding them. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton did the same thing in his budget earlier this year. He  
proposed spending $30 billion above the spending limits, but 
claimed to honor them by proposing to pay for the extra spending 
with cigarette tax increases and other proposals Congress 
steadfastly opposes. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, Republicans' use of next year's surplus includes:  
</P>
<P>
	--They set at $4.5 billion this year's piece of their $792  
billion, 10-year tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
	--They proposed budget ``emergencies,'' meaning spending limits  
can be ignored and the surplus spent, for the 2000 Census, 
veterans' health-care and disaster relief. The total is $10 
billion, though several billion of it may end up not being spent 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
	--They have so far ordered the Congressional Budget Office to use  
the White House Office of Management and Budget's spending 
estimates $15 billion lower than the CBO's. That in effect lets 
them squeeze $15 billion more into several bills, mostly for the 
Defense Department. 
</P>
<P>
	These figures exclude an emergency bill to help cash-strapped  
farmers that both parties concede will become law later this year. 
Democrats want it to cost nearly $10 billion, and Republicans are 
expected to propose at least $7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Also excluded are the costs for whatever natural disasters may  
occur this year, such as earthquakes or hurricanes.

<HEADLINE> NBA Tests Out New Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- New York Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy needed only  
33 seconds to decide that he doesn't like the NBA's new crackdown 
on contact. 
</P>
<P>
	That's how long it took for the referees to call three fouls on  
the Knicks during an exhibition game against the Philadelphia 76ers 
on Monday. New York first-round draft pick Frederic Weis picked up 
the first one just 10 seconds into the game, and he had three total 
in its first three minutes and 16 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think NBA players are going to be asked to play like  
that. You don't want the best athletes in the world to try to play 
with no contact,'' Van Gundy said. ``It's OK in the summer leagues 
with Frederic Weis. But I don't think people want to pay to see 
Allan Houston sit on the bench with two touch fouls, or Tim 
Duncan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pace of the whistles eventually slowed as the players  
learned what the officials would allow. But there were still 76 
fouls in the 40-minute exhibition, about twice the rate of a 
typical NBA regular-season game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough for me, because every time I touch somebody, they  
call a foul,'' said Weis, who learned to play rough in, of all 
places, France. ``In Europe, you can push, even kill somebody, and 
there's no foul. After I learn how you play defense here, I'll be 
OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new guidelines were created this summer after a panel of  
coaches, general managers, players and owners brainstormed over 
ways to improve the quality of the game. The consensus: Cut down on 
the pushing and grabbing that make it impossible for the offensive 
player to make his move. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to let scorers score,'' said Boston Celtics coach  
Rick Pitino, who served on the panel and would like to see a 
backdoor pass or pick-and-roll every once in a while. ``Those were 
the great things about basketball during the '60s, '70s and the 
early part of the '80s that we don't see anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the ``new'' rules are just a crackdown on practices that  
have long been outlawed. Veteran NBA referee Dick Bavetta, 
monitoring the new rules in four summer leagues, puts the changes 
in four different categories: 
</P>
<P>
	-- *Post play*: Any attempt by the defensive player to ``dislodge  
or displace'' the offensive player from his position will be 
considered a foul. 
</P>
<P>
	-- *Cutting*: When the defender uses his shoulder, forearm or  
anything else to ``reroute'' the offensive player trying to cut 
through the middle, it will be called a foul. 
</P>
<P>
	-- *Screens*: The offensive player setting a screen must give the  
defensive player a chance to go around. In other words, no more 
moving picks. 
</P>
<P>
	-- *Off-ball contact*: Clutching and grabbing to prevent the  
``fluid movement'' of the offensive player is a foul. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to differentiate between aggressive play and  
rough play,'' Bavetta said. ``We will allow aggressive play. We 
will not allow rough play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bavetta spent four hours Sunday night teaching the officials  
what they should be looking for, and talked to each team before its 
game. He will report back to the league, which will decide whether 
to continue the experiment in the exhibition season, and then there 
could be more tinkering before the regular season starts. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, it might take a little while for individual players to  
adjust their games to the new fluidity. And some teams that have 
tailored their rosters towards a physical style could be in for a 
major overhaul. 
</P>
<P>
	If the rules stick, that is.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think the league is committed to going in this direction,''  
said Boston general manager Chris Wallace, whose team played a 
50-minute first quarter when the rules were being tested in Los 
Angeles earlier this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to take a while to filter out. This is what summer  
leagues are for.''

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Robin Williams and partner Pete Sampras  
traded shots and barbs in a celebrity tennis match against Billy 
Crystal and Andre Agassi. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams and Sampras, the second-ranked tennis player in the

<HEADLINE> Shuttle Aims for Night Landing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) -- The crew of the first space shuttle  
to be commanded by a woman headed for an uncommon night landing 
Tuesday after a short trip into orbit to drop off the world's most 
powerful X-ray telescope. 
</P>
<P>
	Eileen Collins and her Columbia crew hoped the landing,  
scheduled for 11:20 p.m. EDT, would go more smoothly than their 
launch, which was delayed twice and plagued by a possible hydrogen 
fuel leak and a short circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA said neither problem would affect the landing at Cape  
Canaveral, Fla. The weather forecast was favorable. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins, a 42-year-old Air Force colonel who previously served  
twice as a shuttle co-pilot, was to guide Columbia toward the 12th 
night landing out of 95 flights. 
</P>
<P>
	She and her four crewmates blasted off Friday on NASA's shortest  
planned mission since 1990 -- five days. Only one flight, in 1997, 
was shorter; a defective fuel cell ended that laboratory-research 
mission after only four days. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia made it to orbit safely despite what photographs  
suggest was a hydrogen leak during the launch. An engine could have 
shut down if more fuel had seeped out, forcing the first emergency 
landing for a shuttle. 
</P>
<P>
	A leak could explain why Columbia ended up in a slightly lower  
orbit than planned. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA will examine the shuttle's engines to determine whether  
there indeed was a leak and also what caused the short circuit five 
seconds after liftoff. 
</P>
<P>
	The astronauts accomplished their main goal just seven hours  
into the flight, flawlessly releasing the $1.5 billion Chandra 
X-Ray Observatory, which began a five-year journey to search for 
signs of black holes and study galaxies and quasars. 
</P>
<P>
	Chandra is using its thrusters to eventually reach an orbit  
extending one-third of the way to the moon. 
</P>
<P>
	Next up for Columbia is a piggy-back ride on a Boeing 747 to  
California for a year-long overhaul. Columbia, the oldest of NASA's 
four shuttles, will become the second to be equipped with a modern, 
Boeing 777-style cockpit, featuring nine high-resolution, 
liquid-crystal computer screens rather than the three old-fashioned 
ones. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``glass cockpit'' -- which shuttle pilots say will help them  
deal better with emergencies -- will make its debut on a flight by 
space shuttle Atlantis early next year.

<HEADLINE> Redskins Ban TV Cameras at Practice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FROSTBURG, Md. (AP) -- Upset after watching footage of gimpy  
quarterback Brad Johnson on the evening news, Washington Redskins 
coach Norv Turner banned TV cameras from Tuesday's training camp 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Print reporters and still photographers were permitted at the  
practice, which was open to the public. The one still photographer 
present put down his camera and took no pictures of players in a 
show of solidarity. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, who had knee surgery May 5 and is wearing a brace,  
limped through the team's light practice Monday morning. He was 
still favoring the knee during Monday afternoon's more aggressive 
workout, but not so noticeably. 
</P>
<P>
	After watching the morning and afternoon versions of Johnson on  
a Washington news channel Monday night, Turner decided to keep 
cameras away from the morning session. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going three-quarters,'' Turner said. ``We're in a  
teaching session that's based on slowing things down so we can get 
some real specific assignments down. 
</P>
<P>
	``If someone's ability is being portrayed, whether it's a  
receiver or a defensive back, an end, a defensive end or an 
offensive tackle based on what they're doing half-speed or 
three-quarters speed, yeah, that concerned me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday morning, with the cameras not rolling, Johnson was  
limping again in a practice that included extensive, high-speed 
pattern work with wide receivers. 
</P>
<P>
	Turner said Johnson's knee is not a problem, although trainers  
are monitoring it for soreness and swelling. 
</P>
<P>
	Turner said he would reevaluate his camera ban Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't realize it would be that big of an issue,'' Turner  
said. ``You guys are an awful influential group, so I'm sure it'll 
get resolved.''

<HEADLINE> Americans Dominate Hammer Throw </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Age took precedence over youth at the  
Pan American Games track Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hammer thrower Lance Deal and women's shot putter Connie  
Price-Smith, among the old guard of a generally young U.S. track 
and field team, repeated as champions. 
</P>
<P>
	Deal, 37, the 1996 Olympic silver medalist and American record  
holder, hurled the hammer a Pan Ams record 261 feet, 2 inches to 
lead a 1-2 U.S. finish. 
</P>
<P>
	Price-Smith, also 37, won her fourth Pan Ams medal, tossing the  
shot 62-6 1-2. In addition to her two consecutive golds, 
Price-Smith won a shot put silver in 1991 and a discus bronze in 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
	The two victories enabled the Americans to take sole possession  
of the gold medal lead in track and field, 7-5 over Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Three other men's finals were scheduled Tuesday night: the pole  
vault, javelin and 10,000 meters. 
</P>
<P>
	Deal, ranked sixth in the world, uncorked his winning throw on  
his first attempt, shattering the previous Pan Am Games record of 
253-5 by Jud Logan in 1987 and 13 feet beyond Deal's winning throw 
in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``The games record was one of my goals,'' Deal said, ``and I  
wanted to do it in my first throw to set up the rest of the 
competition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On his next two attempts, the overanxious Deal said he ``started  
swinging for the fences,'' hoping to surpass his American record of 
270-9. Instead, he fouled both times. Then he settled down and had 
good throws in the final three rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``After the first throw, I was competing against the lines,''  
Deal said. ``I knew I would win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin McMahon, who didn't arrive in Winnipeg until 3 a.m.  
Tuesday and got only 3 1-2 hours sleep, finished second at 243-4. 
</P>
<P>
	Price-Smith's winning throw came on her second attempt and no  
one seriously challenged her after that. She called this the 
toughest of her four medals in Pan Ams competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a lot of pressure,'' said Price-Smith, who's ranked  
fourth in the world. ``You have to defend your title from the last 
games. The field was very strong. I expected to win and prepared to 
give myself the best possible chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. baseball team also came up with a victory, recovering  
its shocking loss to Canada the day before with an early-morning 
5-1 win over Mexico. Catcher Marcus Jensen had two home runs and 
drove in all five runs. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was huge for us,'' U.S. manager Buddy Bell said. ``It  
might have been best for us to come out at 9 a.m. and get after it 
before yesterday's game was out of our system. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we were all concerned, because it was such a  
disappointment. We were concerned how we could come out today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Next up: world champion Cuba on Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	One American involved in a heated rivalry with a Cuban, 85-kilo  
freestyle wrestler Les Gutches, felt he got some revenge. After he 
beat Yoel Romero in overtime, the American lightly pounded the back 
of the Cuban with his hands. Both stood up and began yelling at 
each other, with Gutches, of Corvallis, Ore., taunting Romero and 
screaming in his face. 
</P>
<P>
	Romero pointed his finger in Gutches' face and yelled right back  
before the referee separated them. 
</P>
<P>
	``He did the same thing to me the last time,'' said Gutches, the  
1997 world champion, who lost to Romero in their two most recent 
meetings. ``In Spokane, the love taps went the other way. I'm not 
proud of it, but it goes both ways.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The intensity with which he attacked his first throw gave Deal  
the feeling he was competing at next month's world championships in 
Seville, Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't back off,'' he said. ``Probably what I will use for  
future competition is the way I walked into the ring for the first 
throw. I didn't do that at Atlanta (in the 1996 Olympics).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Teri Tunks, bothered by a lower back injury for the past three  
weeks, got the bronze medal for the United States in the women's 
shot at 59-2. As she competed, her husband, Jason, a discus thrower 
for Canada, cheered loudly in the nearly empty stands at the 
University of Manitoba. 
</P>
<P>
	Men's and women's individual gymnastics were held later Tuesday.  
U.S. gymnast Chris Young left the team due to a family emergency 
and missed the vault competition, his only event.

<HEADLINE> Tour Escapes Scandal, Not Suspicion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- This was supposed to be the Tour of Reconciliation.  
</P>
<P>
	As it turned out, this Tour de France was not completely free of  
drug problems. But the race did take tentative steps toward 
recovery from the scandal that threatened its very future. 
</P>
<P>
	Not one cyclist failed a drug test during the three-week event  
that ended Sunday in Paris. But so strong was the impact from last 
summer that doubt still shadowed the cycling showcase. 
</P>
<P>
	``Admiration and suspicion'' was the headline in the France-Soir  
daily after Lance Armstrong's triumph. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted it to be a tour of reconciliation,'' Tour director  
Jean-Marie Leblanc said. ``I would say it got a mark of 13 out of 
20.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, the Festina team was thrown out of the Tour after it  
admitted to systematic drug use. 
</P>
<P>
	An ensuing drug scandal spiraled out of control, with riders  
staging a protest and six teams withdrawing to protest police 
tactics. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, only Ludo Dierckxsens, the 11th stage winner, was  
thrown out of the Tour because of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Belgian passed Tour drug tests. But he admitted he had  
earlier taken a banned synthetic hormone to treat a knee injury, 
and was ordered home by his Lampre team. 
</P>
<P>
	That fueled skepticism during the Tour. After all, last year's  
scandals didn't arise because cyclists failed tests. Rather, French 
authorities uncovered huge stashes of banned drugs among teams, 
even raiding team hotels as riders slept. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, they adopted a lower profile, perhaps fearful similar  
tactics could alienate a French public that embraces the Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	There were was a drug controversy even before the race began.  
The International Cycling Union, the sport's governing body, 
overturned the Tour decision to ban Richard Virenque, one of the 
Festina riders expelled last year. 
</P>
<P>
	And just after Dierckxsens' expulsion, French rider Christophe  
Bassons abandoned the race. He said other riders, including 
Armstrong, had hounded him out because of his newspaper column that 
suggested the Tour wasn't completely clean. 
</P>
<P>
	Leblanc was angered at suggestions in the French media that  
Armstrong, recovering from cancer, was taking banned substances. 
</P>
<P>
	``We started the Tour with tension, with an atmosphere of a  
little mistrust,'' he said. ``Over the days, over the stages, it 
was calmed despite certain affairs and some pseudo revelations that 
poisoned the Tour a little.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leblanc said cyclists have taken a new approach to racing. He  
added that the use of EPO, the banned drug at the center of last 
summer's scandal, has ``practically disappeared.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a Tour of transition,'' French Sports Minister  
Marie-George Buffet said. ``Those who say that nothing has changed 
are wrong. Riders and teams wanted a new Tour, one that respects 
the ethics of sport and respects their health.''

<HEADLINE> Thomas Excited About Packers' Youth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- Emmitt Thomas won't be surprised if three  
rookies get significant playing time in his defensive backfield 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
	A little worried, maybe, but not surprised.  
</P>
<P>
	The Packers defensive coordinator followed Ray Rhodes to Green  
Bay from Philadelphia last winter, and he quickly had concerns 
about his new team's secondary. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFC Central's best receivers -- Randy Moss, Cris Carter and  
Herman Moore -- all had tremendous games against Green Bay in 1998, 
and the Packers' season ended when San Francisco's Terrell Owens 
threaded through the secondary for a game-winning touchdown catch 
in the closing seconds of their playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's an issue we saw immediately, and we took steps to  
correct it,'' Thomas said. ``And the way we addressed it was to get 
young players in here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Ron Wolf spent the team's first three draft  
picks on cornerbacks for the first time in franchise history. 
Clemson's Antuan Edwards, Vanderbilt's Fred Vinson and Memphis' 
Mike McKenzie were selected to begin filling the gaps. 
</P>
<P>
	But Edwards and Vinson came to training camp with catches. Both  
had recently undergone surgery, Edwards in late April on a badly 
sprained big toe and Vinson in January on a torn foot ligament. 
</P>
<P>
	``The doctors say they're ahead of where they need to be  
medically,'' Thomas said. ``They're progressing very well, but it's 
tough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both cornerbacks are taking it easy in training camp, with each  
participating in one of the two daily sessions. On Tuesday, Vinson 
worked out in the morning and Edwards in the afternoon, and Rhodes 
plans to ease both backs into the defense. 
</P>
<P>
	But that will change when the two are healthy enough to go full  
tilt. Rhodes expects both to play in the Packers' exhibition opener 
against the New York Jets on Aug. 14. 
</P>
<P>
	Vinson's injury during his senior year at Vanderbilt was the  
first significant one of his life. His trademark in college was his 
blazing speed, but he was unable to run for scouts before the 
draft, and even now he's not back to full strength. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very anxious to get going,'' Vinson said. ``I've spent a  
lot of time learning the defense, and I'd like to get to put that 
to use on the field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McKenzie, who broke a bone in his hand during the last minicamp,  
also will get ample playing time. 
</P>
<P>
	Though all three players are expected to contribute, they'll  
have a hard time uprooting the Packers' veterans. Cornerbacks 
Tyrone Williams and Craig Newsome, along with safeties Darren 
Sharper and LeRoy Butler, are firmly entrenched in the starting 
lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	``The competition really starts when the veterans get here (on  
Friday),'' Rhodes said. ``That's when the rookies will know what's 
really going on. There's some guys they'll have to go through to 
get in the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas is excited but wary about his young players.  
</P>
<P>
	``We got three or four defensive backs earmarked for us when we  
got here, and we're going to use them,'' Thomas said. ``How much? 
Nobody knows yet. We can do some things a little different with 
some quality young legs out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The defensive rookie making the biggest splash for the Packers  
is Cletidus Hunt, a defensive lineman picked in the third round. 
After signing a contract on the eve of camp, Hunt has continued his 
run of strong play that he began during minicamp earlier in the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a staff and an organization, we're happy about him,''  
Thomas said. ``This year we're going to try to place him in good 
matchups on the line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Packers are using Hunt at defensive end until the team's  
veterans report to camp on Friday, when he'll move inside to 
tackle.

<HEADLINE> NBA Tests Out New Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- New York Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy needed only  
33 seconds to decide that he doesn't like the NBA's new crackdown 
on contact. 
</P>
<P>
	That's how long it took for the referees to call three fouls on  
the Knicks during an exhibition game against the Philadelphia 76ers 
on Monday. New York first-round draft pick Frederic Weis picked up 
the first one just 10 seconds into the game, and he had three total 
in its first three minutes and 16 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think NBA players are going to be asked to play like  
that. You don't want the best athletes in the world to try to play 
with no contact,'' Van Gundy said. ``It's OK in the summer leagues 
with Frederic Weis. But I don't think people want to pay to see 
Allan Houston sit on the bench with two touch fouls, or Tim 
Duncan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pace of the whistles eventually slowed as the players  
learned what the officials would allow. But there were still 76 
fouls in the 40-minute exhibition, about twice the rate of a 
typical NBA regular-season game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough for me, because every time I touch somebody, they  
call a foul,'' said Weis, who learned to play rough in, of all 
places, France. ``In Europe, you can push, even kill somebody, and 
there's no foul. After I learn how you play defense here, I'll be 
OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new guidelines were created this summer after a panel of  
coaches, general managers, players and owners brainstormed over 
ways to improve the quality of the game. The consensus: Cut down on 
the pushing and grabbing that make it impossible for the offensive 
player to make his move. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to let scorers score,'' said Boston Celtics coach  
Rick Pitino, who served on the panel and would like to see a 
backdoor pass or pick-and-roll every once in a while. ``Those were 
the great things about basketball during the '60s, '70s and the 
early part of the '80s that we don't see anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the ``new'' rules are just a crackdown on practices that  
have long been outlawed. Veteran NBA referee Dick Bavetta, 
monitoring the new rules in four summer leagues, puts the changes 
in four different categories: 
</P>
<P>
	-- *Post play*: Any attempt by the defensive player to ``dislodge  
or displace'' the offensive player from his position will be 
considered a foul. 
</P>
<P>
	-- *Cutting*: When the defender uses his shoulder, forearm or  
anything else to ``reroute'' the offensive player trying to cut 
through the middle, it will be called a foul. 
</P>
<P>
	-- *Screens*: The offensive player setting a screen must give the  
defensive player a chance to go around. In other words, no more 
moving picks. 
</P>
<P>
	-- *Off-ball contact*: Clutching and grabbing to prevent the  
``fluid movement'' of the offensive player is a foul. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to differentiate between aggressive play and  
rough play,'' Bavetta said. ``We will allow aggressive play. We 
will not allow rough play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bavetta spent four hours Sunday night teaching the officials  
what they should be looking for, and talked to each team before its 
game. He will report back to the league, which will decide whether 
to continue the experiment in the exhibition season, and then there 
could be more tinkering before the regular season starts. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, it might take a little while for individual players to  
adjust their games to the new fluidity. And some teams that have 
tailored their rosters towards a physical style could be in for a 
major overhaul. 
</P>
<P>
	If the rules stick, that is.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think the league is committed to going in this direction,''  
said Boston general manager Chris Wallace, whose team played a 
50-minute first quarter when the rules were being tested in Los 
Angeles earlier this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to take a while to filter out. This is what summer  
leagues are for.''

<HEADLINE> FAA Proposes New De-Icing Procedures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government is proposing to change the  
de-icing procedures used on 17 types of planes frequently used by 
commuter airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Aviation Administration said Tuesday that a rule it  
has drafted would require the immediate use of equipment known as 
de-icing boots at the first sign of ice formation anywhere on the 
aircraft or upon alert of the aircraft's ice detector system, 
whichever occurs first. 
</P>
<P>
	It would also require continued use as long as icing conditions  
are present. The rule would take effect after an industry comment 
period. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, pilots often delay using the boots to avoid ice  
bridging. Those are ice formations above the boots, which typically 
occurs with older equipment that is not powerful enough to 
completely shed ice. 
</P>
<P>
	Research since the mid-1990s has found that modern de-icing  
boots do an effective job in both shedding ice and preventing ice 
bridging, the FAA said. 
</P>
<P>
	The rule change would affect 3,018 U.S. registered aircraft.  
Compliance would cost the industry an estimated $181,080. Most U.S. 
regional airlines would be affected by the rule change given their 
heavy reliance on modern turboprop aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	The airplanes affected by the proposed rule are: Aerospatiale  
Model ATR-42 and ATR-72; Bombardier Model DHC-7 and DHC-8; British 
Aerospace Model HS 748; CASA C-212 and CN-235; Cessna Models 500, 
501, 550, 551, and 560; Dornier Model 328-100; and Fairchild Model 
F27 and FH227. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Fokker Model F27 Mark 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600 and  
700; Fokker Model F27 Mark 050; Gulfstream Aerospace Model G-159; 
Gulfstream American (Frakes Aviation) Model G-73 (Mallard) and 
G-73T; Jetstream Model BAe ATP and Model 4101; Lockheed Model L-14 
and L-18 and Model 1329-23 and 1329-25; and McDonnell Douglas Model 
DC-3 and DC-4. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Mitsubishi Model YS-11 and YS-11A; Saab SF-340A, 340B and  
Saab 2000; Sabreliner Model NA-265-40, NA-265-60, and NA-265-80; 
Short Brothers SD3-30, SD3-60, SD3-Sherpa and SD3-60 Sherpa.

<HEADLINE> McDougal Discusses Her Acquittal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- The folks attending the 10th annual conference  
of the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners have a new star: 
Susan McDougal. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. McDougal, who spent 18 months in jail for refusing to  
testify against President Clinton in the Whitewater probe, easily 
won over the 1,100 people in attendance. 
</P>
<P>
	Fraud investigators, auditors and attorneys mobbed her Tuesday,  
asking for autographs and pictures. Ms. McDougal, 45, waited until 
everyone who wanted an autograph got one. 
</P>
<P>
	``Overwhelming,'' she said outside a conference room at Caesars  
Palace. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think she has a lot of integrity,'' Ray Lichauer, a fraud  
analyst from Pittsfield, Mass., said as he admired his newly signed 
autograph. 
</P>
<P>
	Conference organizers invited Ms. McDougal to speak on ``beating  
embezzlement charges.'' Ms. McDougal was acquitted in November of 
stealing $50,000 from famed conductor Zubin Mehta and his wife, 
Nancy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The abuses in the jail system in this country are  
unbelievable,'' she said in a news conference after her speech. Ms. 
McDougal said she was not paid for her appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	``She certainly is believable,'' said David Reuben, a private  
investigator from San Francisco. ``She won a lot of people over 
here.''

<HEADLINE> Sinclair To Sell Radio Stations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc. plans to sell 43  
radio stations in nine markets to Entercom Communications Corp. for 
$821.5 million in cash. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal announced Monday would be the latest in a wave of sales  
in the radio industry since federal limits on how many stations a 
single company may own were relaxed. Entercom, based in Bala 
Cynwyd, Pa., near Philadelphia, already owns 42 radio stations in 
six markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale would also allow Sinclair to concentrate on its TV  
operations. The Baltimore-based broadcaster owns or provides 
programs for 59 TV stations in 38 markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of a letter of intent, Entercom would also buy $5  
million worth of advertising on Sinclair's television stations 
during the next five years and pay for up to $2 million in capital 
improvements that Sinclair had committed to undertake. 
</P>
<P>
	Sinclair expects to realize $650 million from the deal after  
taxes and will initially use the money to pay down debt. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sinclair is now positioned to take advantage of the next wave  
of station consolidation, the advent of digital television and the 
convergence of television and the Internet,'' Sinclair chief 
executive David Smith said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the company would also consider buying its own stock.  
</P>
<P>
	The deal excludes Sinclair's radio stations in St. Louis.  
</P>
<P>
	The companies expect to need three weeks to complete  
negotiations on the deal, which is also subject to approval by the 
Federal Communications Commission and Department of Justice as well 
as the boards of both companies.

<HEADLINE> Crayola Replaces Indian Red Crayon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Indian Red is out. Chestnut is in.  
</P>
<P>
	After sifting through more than 250,000 suggested names, Crayola  
has renamed its reddish-brown crayon to avoid misunderstandings 
over the color's origin. 
</P>
<P>
	The color indian red, which Crayola said was based on a  
reddish-brown pigment commonly found near India, was dropped 
because teachers complained students thought it described the skin 
color of American Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	The new name will appear on 15 million crayons each year  
beginning in September. It is only the third time in the company's 
96-year history that a color has been changed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were looking for a name that would be helpful to teachers  
working in the classroom, and we thought chestnut was 
appropriate,'' company spokeswoman Stacy Gabrielle said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 100,000 people from age 3 to 90 submitted names,  
including 155 people who suggested chestnut. Other popular 
suggestions included red clay, clay red and mars red. 
</P>
<P>
	Other rejected names included ginger spice, crab claw red, old  
penny and baseball mitt. One person even suggested ``the crayon 
formerly known as indian red,'' in honor of the rock musician 
formerly known as Prince. 
</P>
<P>
	The 155 people who suggested the winning name will be awarded a  
Certificate of Crayon Authorship and a 64-color crayon box 
containing the renamed crayon. 
</P>
<P>
	Crayola has renamed only two other colors. In 1958, Prussian  
blue was renamed midnight blue because children could no longer 
relate to Prussian history, according to teachers. In 1962, flesh 
was renamed peach to recognize that not everyone's skin is the same 
shade. 
</P>
<P>
	Indian red -- with a lower-case ``i'' -- debuted in the Crayola  
lineup in 1958, when the 64-crayon box was introduced.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Higher; Dow Up 115.88 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks led the market to its  
strongest performance of the month as investors hunted for bargains 
Tuesday among shares that have been beaten down in recent sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average gained 115.88 points, or by 1.1  
percent, to close at 10,979.04. The blue-chip index rose as much as 
168 points during the session, rebounding strongly from Monday's 
shiftless 47.80-point loss. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's  
500 rose 15.08 to 1,362.84, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 
60.14 to 2,679.33. 
</P>
<P>
	A wide range of computer-related stocks soared Tuesday, helping  
the Dow and the technology-dominated Nasdaq alike. Computer makers 
rose, including IBM, up 3 1/4 to 126 1/4, and Hewlett Packard, up 3 9/16 
at 109 1/4. Chip maker Intel gained 4 11/16 to 67 9/16 after a Wall 
Street analyst raised his 1999 earnings forecast. 
</P>
<P>
	After last week, when the Nasdaq dropped 172.08 points, a loss  
of 6.1 percent, analysts said investors were ready to scoop up 
technology stocks at their discounted prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``We saw a pretty big downdraft over the past few days, so  
there's definitely some bottom-fishing going on,'' said Hank 
Herrmann, chief investment officer at Waddell &AMP; Reed of Overland 
Park, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors had several diverse reasons for swinging away from  
technology stocks last week. The shares had been bid to record 
highs at the start of July on the promise of strong corporate 
earnings. As a majority of high-tech companies met or beat 
expectations, many investors sold off their shares, hoping to lock 
in profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks were also threatened after Federal Reserve  
Chairman Alan Greenspan indicated that the Fed remains willing to 
raise interest rates if it determines that doing so would hold off 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's gains spread beyond the high-tech sector, with banks  
and brokerages also rallying. American Express rose 5 7/8 to 142 3/8 
following its strong earnings report, released Monday. Analysts 
said growth prospects for the credit-card provider are robust, 
especially as the company develops an online bank and a Web-based 
service for corporate and travel-related products. 
</P>
<P>
	A modest rise in bond prices helped stocks Tuesday. By late  
afternoon, the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond was at 6.01 
percent, compared with 6.03 percent late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks and bonds received some support from a Conference Board  
report Tuesday that showed consumer confidence declined in July, 
after eight months of consecutive gains and a rise to a 30-year 
high. Analysts said the report suggested that the nation's 
continued economic growth may not be reaching inflationary levels. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, market watchers are more interested in upcoming reports  
on the employment costs index and the gross domestic product, both 
scheduled for release Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Greenspan will address a Senate panel on Wednesday. While  
most do not expect him to break new ground, analysts will listen 
carefully for any clues about the central bank's sentiment on the 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Until then, many remain unconvinced of the market's strength.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is still a market laboring under the lack of real  
momentum in either direction,'' said Gregory Nie, technical analyst 
at Everen Securities in Chicago. He said modest volume indicated 
that many traders are staying out of the market for now. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 6-to-5 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange. Composite volume totaled 867.36 million 
shares, compared with a paltry 751.75 million in the previous 
session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index rose 4.79 to 640.69, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index gained 1.83 to 792.62. The Russell 
2000 index of smaller companies rose 3.61 to 446.48. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell for the fifth  
straight session, slipping 0.16 percent. European indexes were 
mostly higher, as Germany's DAX index rose 0.3 percent, Britain's 
FT-SE 100 rose 1.5 percent, and France's CAC-40 closed 0.7 percent 
higher.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- A photograph of the late Carolyn Bessette  
Kennedy has bumped Kim Basinger off the cover of Vanity Fair.

<HEADLINE> Fledgling Conference May Wait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) -- The fledgling Mountain West  
Conference likely will have to wait one year before gaining an 
automatic berth in the NCAA men's basketball tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	At the conference's inaugural Football Media Day on Monday,  
commissioner Craig Thompson said an NCAA subcommittee will make a 
recommendation ``that probably will ask us to wait one year in 
men's basketball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA's championships competition committee recommended  
earlier this month that the Mountain West Conference wait two 
years, but Thompson has challenged that suggestion. He noted that 
both the men's basketball committee and the Collegiate 
Commissioners Association endorsed a one-year waiting period. 
</P>
<P>
	``My understanding is that the NCAA subcommittee is going to  
recommend that we wait one year across the board in all sports,'' 
Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that's something that we can live with, but I still  
say we shouldn't have to wait, based on interpretations made in 
similar cases, particularly the Big 12. It has become a highly 
politicized environment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eight schools formerly belonging to the Western Athletic  
Conference broke ranks and formed the MWC, which officially began 
operations July 1. The MWC schools are Air Force, Brigham Young, 
Colorado State, New Mexico, San Diego State, UNLV, Utah and 
Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
	The new conference will fare better when it comes to football  
bowl appearances, boasting agreements with both the Liberty and Las 
Vegas bowls this season. The MWC champion will meet the Conference 
USA champion in the Liberty Bowl. A second MWC team will meet the 
WAC champion in the Las Vegas Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson said the new conference also might be considered for  
two other bowls. The Humanitarian Bowl faces an uncertain future 
because of the impending breakup of the Big West Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The commissioner said a startup bowl scheduled to begin in 2000  
in Houston ``is talking about a Mountain West participant against a 
Big 12 participant. We're very strongly in the mix there, but the 
bowl hasn't been certified yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although WAC schools have threatened legal action against MWC  
schools because of the breakup, Thompson said the ``summer of 
transition has gone about as smoothly as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson reiterated that the MWC, unwilling to repeat the WAC's  
mistake of expanding to 16 teams, will not consider expansion for 
at least two years.

	Another medal hopeful for the United States, Jennie Thompson,  
injured her ankle in the vault, the first event, and had to scratch 
from the bars and floor exercise. 
</P>
<P>
	White had won the gold medal in the all-around on Sunday night  
and Thompson the bronze. But on this night, the Canadians turned in 
the most spectacular performances and delighted a crowd of 6,116 by 
winning three of the four gold medals. 
</P>
<P>
	Lopez and his Cuban teammates enjoyed similar domination on the  
men's side. He won three golds and a silver in the individual 
events Tuesday to give him six medals for the games, five of them 
gold. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. men did not medal at all in the individual competition.  
</P>
<P>
	Canada, which had edged the favored United States for the  
women's team title on Saturday, got golds from Yvonne Tousek in the 
uneven bars and floor exercise and Lise Leveille on the balance 
beam. Cuba's Arazay Jova won the gold in the vault. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other Canadians won silver medals, Julie Beaulieu in the  
bars and Michelle Conway in floor exercise. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a really strong team right now, a lot of team spirit,  
and the crowd was just amazing,'' Tousek said. ``They not only 
cheered for the Canadians, but for all the performers. There was so 
much energy in the building. It really helped our performances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White, at 16 the youngest member of the U.S. women's team,  
scored 9.537 on the bars to trail Tousek (9.662) and Beaulieu 
(9.60). She was fourth in the floor exercise and fifth in the vault 
but still left the Winnipeg Arena with a smile -- and a bouquet for 
earning a medal. 
</P>
<P>
	Her floor exercise score of 9.687 had her in third place until  
Tousek, the next-to-last competitor, scored a 9.712. Fans clapped 
rhythmically while the scores on Tousek's routine were tallied and 
the crowd roared when her score was flashed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was hoping to medal in both events,'' White said. ``I  
thought I did a really good routine. I was very consistent the 
whole meet. I had no falls. I feel really proud.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The downer for White was seeing Thompson hurt her left ankle on  
her second vault landing. Thompson was to have X-rays on the ankle, 
U.S. coach Mary Lee Tracy said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was really hard,'' White said. ``She's my teammate. It's  
almost like me getting injured. I pray she'll be OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tracy said White, one of the up-and-comers in U.S. gymnastics,  
showed she has the potential to make the Olympic team. White had 
the second-best all-around score during the team competition before 
winning the all-around the following night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Morgan did a great job,'' Tracy said. ``She has to concentrate  
on getting some bigger skills and learning some new things, but the 
biggest thing is she made a statement in an international meet that 
she is a contender and a competitor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the men's competition, Lopez won the the pommel horse, rings  
and parallel bars and the silver on the high bar. He also won the 
gold medal in the all-around and earned another gold in helping 
Cuba win the team championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Teammate Abel Driggs won the vault and finished third in the  
parallel bars. The other gold medals went to Canada's Alexander 
Jeltkov on the high bar and Argentina's Eric Pedercini in the floor 
exercise. 
</P>
<P>
	The top U.S. finishers were Michael Dutka, fifth in the floor  
exercise, and Stephen McCain, fifth in the rings.

<HEADLINE> SD Ballpark Ballot Measure Survives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- A ballot measure that authorized the city to  
help the San Diego Padres build a stadium and renovate a 26-block 
section of downtown has survived a court challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	A three-judge panel of the state's 4th District Court of Appeal  
unanimously rejected a lawsuit filed by a former city councilman 
claiming the November ballot measure should have specified that the 
city would incur $225 million in new debt from the project. 
</P>
<P>
	The judges also rejected arguments that Proposition C required a  
two-thirds vote and that an environmental impact report regarding 
the project was required before the city and Padres could negotiate 
a deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Prop C passed with 60 percent of the vote and an environmental  
impact report is set for completion by September. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision upholds a San Diego Superior Court ruling earlier  
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``While designation of dollar amounts may have been preferable,  
the ballot question adequately alerted voters that public funds 
were required for the project,'' according to the 33-page opinion 
issued Friday but reviewed by city officials Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Former councilman Bruce Henderson, who filed the lawsuit on  
behalf of ballpark opponent Jerry Mailhot, said he will appeal the 
case to the state Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought we had made a real convincing argument that they  
really needed that environmental impact report in order to properly 
negotiate the agreement with the Padres, and we also felt that 
there were some major flaws with the election,'' Henderson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The judges ruled that the city and Padres were not required to  
have an environmental impact report completed before they 
negotiated their agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Proposition C authorized the city to create a partnership with  
the Padres to build the ballpark and redevelop a 26-block area of 
downtown near the Gaslamp Quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Stadium costs are estimated at $411 million, with $225 million  
coming from a city bond issue repaid from a hotel tax imposed on 
tourists. The Padres pay $115 million and the remainder is paid by 
the city's downtown redevelopment agency and the port district. 
</P>
<P>
	The Padres are also responsible in securing retail, office,  
hotel and residential development surrounding the ballpark, 
bringing the total project cost to $1 billion.

killed a microbiologist who worked with infectious bacteria at the 
state public health laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
	Lisa Colson, 34, died at a hospital Friday, two weeks after  
falling ill.

<P>
	State and CDC investigators are trying to identify the

potential infectious materials,'' said Dr. Kathleen Gensheimer, 
state epidemiologist. 
</P>
<P>
	State health officials said Tuesday the CDC told them it could  
take weeks before test results are back, and that they may never

<HEADLINE> Parkinson's Drug Side Effects Slight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- New research presented Tuesday shows that a  
relatively new drug for treating Parkinson's disease produces less 
of a debilitating side effect than the most widely prescribed drug 
used for the disorder. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Oliver Rascol of the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire,  
Toulouse, France, presented the study at a medical conference in 
Vancouver, British Columbia. The study was paid for by the drug's 
maker, SmithKline Beecham, but run independently. 
</P>
<P>
	The study compared the widely used levadopa with the newer drug  
Requip, made by SmithKline Beecham, which has its U.S. headquarters 
in Philadelphia. Requip was approved by the federal government just 
two years ago while levadopa, also known as Sinemet, has been 
available for 35 years and is given to 75 percent of patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Levadopa is the most effective treatment for the symptoms of  
Parkinson's, which include tremors, slow movement, rigidity and 
poor balance. But it has a side effect -- involuntary body 
movements. 
</P>
<P>
	For most patients, this is mostly a social embarrassment. But in  
some patients, ``it can be even more troublesome, preventing you 
from being able to eat or to sit up in a chair,'' Rascol said. 
</P>
<P>
	An expert not involved in the study agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the longer-term complications are much more difficult  
to manage ... and can be as disabling as the disease itself,'' said 
Dr. Matthew B. Stern, director of the Parkinson's Disease and 
Movement Disorders Center at the University of Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	Requip is one of a promising new class of drugs called dopamine  
agonists. They still have side effects, including confusion, upset 
stomach, lightheadedness, hallucinations and sleepiness, but they 
are not as disabling as the involuntary body movements, Stern said. 
</P>
<P>
	The five-year study shows that treating patients with Requip at  
the outset, and using levadopa only when Parkinson's symptoms 
become bad enough to require the stronger drug, resulted in fewer 
involuntary body movements than the common treatment of using 
levadopa from the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can delay the levadopa and you can use lower doses of  
levadopa,'' Rascol said. In a minority of cases, no levadopa is 
needed at all, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Previous studies supported a similar conclusion, but Rascol's  
study had more reliable conclusions than earlier ones, Stern said. 
</P>
<P>
	For one thing, this study selected the patients early on and  
tracked them throughout their treatments. Also, this was a 
``double-blind'' study in which neither the patients nor the people 
tracking the symptoms knew which drugs were in use. 
</P>
<P>
	According to SmithKline Beecham, 130 people completed the study,  
85 on Requip and 45 on levadopa. Among those given Requip, 27 
percent suffered side effects, compared with 29 percent of those on 
levadopa. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the incidence of uncontrollable body movements was 5  
percent for Requip and 36 percent for levadopa.

<HEADLINE> Unready Brokerages Face Y2k Closing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal securities regulators will go to court  
starting Dec. 1 to shut down brokerage firms that are not ready for 
the Year 2000, under new rules adopted today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Securities and Exchange Commission voted, 5-0, to approve  
the rules. They set a target date of Aug. 31 for brokerage firms to 
complete their Year 2000 compliance efforts but allow additional 
time for unprepared firms to show that they will be ready no later 
than Nov. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any firm that cannot achieve Y2K compliance in a timely  
fashion will be required to cease doing business by Dec. 1,'' SEC 
Chairman Arthur Levitt said before the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``A few firms' lack of readiness could have adverse consequences  
for countless others,'' Levitt said. ``We simply cannot allow firms 
to continue to operate if they threaten the integrity of the 
system, or if they are not able to assure customers' access to 
their funds and securities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Walker, the agency's enforcement director, said the  
regulators would go into federal courts starting Dec. 1 seeking 
injunctions forcing the unprepared brokerage firms to cease 
operations and notify their customers. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the regulators expect they will only have to go after  
``a few'' problem firms. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC estimates that only 1 percent or so of the 3,900  
brokerage firms covered by the new rules will be unprepared for the 
millennial date change. 
</P>
<P>
	Concerns about the Jan. 1, 2000, date stem from the fact that  
some computer systems may read only the last two digits of a 
four-digit year and interpret the year 2000 as 1900, potentially 
wreaking havoc on financial transactions. 
</P>
<P>
	The new rules also apply to transfer agents that are not banks.  
Transfer agents are responsible for keeping records of shareholders 
of corporations and for issuing or canceling stock certificates 
when shares are bought and sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC has said failure of transfer agents to anticipate and  
fix Year 2000 computer problems could seriously disrupt 
corporations' dividend payments and other transactions with their 
shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	The market watchdog agency also requires mutual fund companies  
and publicly traded corporations to disclose their readiness.

<HEADLINE> Astros 6, Rockies 3  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Matt Mieske went 3-for-4 and had three RBIs for  
the second straight night as the Houston Astros rolled to their 
13th win in 15 games, beating the Colorado Rockies 6-3 Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lima (14-5) allowed all three runs and nine hits in eight  
innings, tying Kent Bottenfield of St. Louis and Curt Schilling of 
Philadelphia for the NL lead in wins. 
</P>
<P>
	Lima struck out four and walked none before Billy Wagner  
finished with a one-hit ninth for his 27th save in 29 chances, 
sending Colorado to its fifth straight loss. 
</P>
<P>
	Mieske also had three RBIs Monday, going 4-for-5.  
</P>
<P>
	Russ Johnson and Craig Biggio drove in a run each for the  
Astros, who at 61-40 are 21 games over .500 for the first time this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Bohanon (9-8), 0-5 with a 9.56 ERA in seven starts since  
June 20, allowed five runs and 10 hits in 5 2-3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Walker reached 30 homers for the third time in his career  
but went 1-for-4, dropping his average .370. Walker had two 
assists, raising his career total to 101. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston loaded the bases in the second with out out, but Tim  
Bogar flied out to right and Walker threw out Mieske at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
	Mieske then hit a two-run single with the bases loaded in the  
third, and Lima escaped a two-on, one-out jam in the bottom half 
when Walker flied out and Dante Bichette grounded out. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston made it 4-0 in the fifth on Johnson's RBI double and  
Mieske's run-scoring single, and Biggio had an RBI double in the 
sixth. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker homered leading off the bottom half, and the Rockies  
added a pair on Jeff Barry's RBI single and Terry Shumpert's 
sacrifice fly. 
</P>
<P>
	Glen Barker added sacrifice fly in the ninth off David Lee.  
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* The start was delayed by rain for 31 minutes. ... The  
Astros are 21-8 against left-handed starters. ... The Astros are 
10-3 since manager Larry Dierker returned from brain surgery. ... 
Kurt Abbott is expected back in the lineup after missing five games 
with a concussion sustained last Thursday at Los Angeles.

<HEADLINE> Golfer Scores Two Holes-in-One  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLTON, Mass. (AP) -- A hole-in-one is remarkable enough. Two  
in one round is extraordinary. 
</P>
<P>
	Neil Bartholomew, a 3-handicapper who plays out of Holden Hills  
Country Club, did just that Sunday, acing two holes in the same 
round of the Harold Krause Memorial Tournament at Heritage Country 
Club. 
</P>
<P>
	Using an 8-iron, he scored his first career ace on the 165-yard  
13th hole. Three holes and less than an hour later, he grabbed his 
second with a 7-iron on the 175-yard 16th hole. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if I'll ever come down from this,'' Bartholomew,  
42, told the Telegram &AMP; Gazette of Worcester. ``I've had shots 
inside of 2 inches, shots hanging on the hole. I've been very close 
a lot of times, so many times that I thought it would never 
happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the 13th hole, his shot landed 2 feet in front of the hole,  
took two hops and rolled in. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of pocketing the ball for posterity's sake, he continued  
to play it. 
</P>
<P>
	On the 16th, the shot landed and rolled toward the hole.  
</P>
<P>
	``It looked like it was just hanging on the edge,'' Bartholomew  
said. ``After a second or two delay, it fell in. We just went 
crazy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the second hole-in-one, he took the ball out of play.  
</P>
<P>
	He won a set of clubs for the first ace, and $250 in merchandise  
from a local pro shop for the second. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the two aces, however, Bartholomew didn't win the  
tournament. His play didn't make up for that of his three 
teammates, said Shane Bacigalupo, a member of that team and one of 
the tournament organizers. 
</P>
<P>
	Richie Powers, a co-owner of the course who has worked there  
since 1964, estimated that five or six holes-in-one are made at the 
course each year. 
</P>
<P>
	As far as two aces in one round were concerned, Powers said: ``I  
know we never had it happen here before.''

<HEADLINE> Heat Wave Blamed in 30 Deaths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The heat gripping the eastern half of the nation is exacting a  
mounting toll, claiming more than two dozen lives, withering crops 
and offering no promise of relief. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like a blast furnace,'' Greg Woods said Monday as he  
mowed grass near Louisville, Ky., where it was 100 degrees for the 
first time in eight years. ``This has got to be what hell is like, 
but without the grass.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasts say there's no immediate relief in sight for much of  
the nation, though lower temperatures were forecast for parts of 
the upper Midwest and Great Lakes today. 
</P>
<P>
	Heat advisories were posted again today from the Mississippi  
Valley into the Southeast. Highs in the 90s were expected. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been at least 30 heat-related deaths in the past  
week: 11 in Illinois, eight in Ohio, nine in Missouri and two in 
North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, a 12-year-old boy was in critical condition today  
in Oklahoma City after suffering heat stroke during football 
practice, said Damon Gardenhire, spokesman for Integris Baptist 
Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``The heat's not going to go away,'' Hamilton County (Ohio)  
Coroner Carl Parrott said. ``Unless people modify their behavior, 
there will be more deaths.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With 19 days of above-90 temperatures this year, Cincinnati  
officials extended the hours for city pools and air-conditioned 
centers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really hot, but I've seen it worse,'' said Martha Haile,  
48, a lifelong city resident. ``It's gotten over 100 some summers, 
but this is bad because it just seems to keep hanging on. I just 
hope there's a break soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And in addition to the high temperatures, some areas have a  
shortage of rain. Pennsylvania has declared a drought emergency, 
bringing mandatory restrictions on water use. Areas of Virginia are 
considered agriculture disaster areas, and Maryland and Delaware 
have issued drought warnings. 
</P>
<P>
	In Des Moines, Iowa, community groups handed out electric fans  
and bottled water as they checked on shut-ins. 
</P>
<P>
	It was 102 in St. Louis on Monday, the hottest day in a 12-day  
span of temperatures above 90. Highs in the 90s were expected to 
continue at least through Saturday. City officials say five victims 
were found there on Monday alone, and highway crews shut down three 
roads that were buckled by the heat. 
</P>
<P>
	The heat index, a combination of temperature and humidity,  
reached 119 degrees in Memphis, Tenn., on Monday. Carriage horses 
were sent home in Charleston, S.C., where the high was a record 
100. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's difficult to give a carriage tour with no horse,'' said  
Tom Doyle, manager at Palmetto Carriage Works. 
</P>
<P>
	In Louisville, Debra Cook and her mother took in ``Eyes Wide  
Shut'' on Monday in a blissfully air-conditioned theater. 
</P>
<P>
	``The movie was steamy, but not nearly as hot as it is out  
here,'' Ms. Cook said. ``It's unbearable. It's got to break 
sometime soon, doesn't it?''

<HEADLINE> Bonds Prices Rise / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices rose Tuesday as investors snapped up  
some attractive long-term yields and a private survey cooled off 
inflation fears by hinting that U.S. consumer spending might be 
slowing. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, trading remained light ahead of Wednesday's two-year note  
auction and congressional testimony by Federal Reserve Chairman 
Alan Greenspan. Traders are also awaiting economic reports due out 
Thursday that may provide further clues on inflation's course. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 9/32  
point, or $2.81 1/4 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves 
in the opposite direction, fell to 6.01 percent from 6.03 percent 
late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds rose as the Conference Board said its index of consumer  
confidence fell to 135.6 in July from 139 in June, a sign higher 
interest rates may be slowing the economy. The Fed raised rates in 
June and Greenspan has said it is ready to act again if inflation 
resurfaces. 
</P>
<P>
	A slowing economy helps raise bond prices because it reduces the  
risk of a resurgence of inflation.

<P>
	On Wednesday, the Treasury Department will auction $15 billion  
in new two-year notes. On Thursday second-quarter gross domestic 
product and the employment cost index report will come out. 
</P>
<P>
	Both indicators will likely play a role in determining the  
market's expectations about what might happen at the central bank's 
next policy meeting on Aug. 24.

	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
were rose 1/32 point to 3/32 point across the board, and 
intermediate-term Treasurys rose 1/16 point to 9/32 point, reported 
Bridge Telerate, a financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.69 percent as the  
discount rose 0.03 percentage point from Monday's auction to 4.57 
percent. Six-month yields were 4.75 percent, as the discount rose 
0.05 percentage point from the weekly auction to 4.57 percent. 
One-year yields were 5.00 percent as the discount fell by 0.02 
percentage point from late Monday to 4.75 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Lauds Legal Service for Poor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Even a remarkably prosperous America needs the  
dedication of lawyers who help the needy when they could make more 
money doing something else, President Clinton said Tuesday on the 
25th anniversary of a federal agency that gives free legal aide to 
the poor. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also used the celebration of the Legal Services Corp.'s  
birthday to chastise the group's congressional critics as 
shortsighted, and to laud the service of his wife, Hillary Rodham 
Clinton, as a legal aid attorney and board member of the group. 
</P>
<P>
	``You and I know there are still a lot of poor folks out  
there,'' Clinton said during an East Room salute to the 
congressionally-chartered group, which has been under annual attack 
in the Republican-led House for four years. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a need, a crying need, for the Legal Services  
Corporation,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	A House Appropriations subcommittee voted last week to roughly  
halve the Legal Service budget to $141 million. The same House 
panel also voted to halve funding last year, but that vote was 
later reversed by the full House. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency has had a rough year. In April, it admitted that a  
few regional offices had overstated their workloads. And in June, 
an independent investigation showed that the organization's five 
largest offices also reported 75,000 cases they couldn't document. 
</P>
<P>
	The Baltimore and New York City offices reported twice as many  
legal cases as they should have, according to a General Accounting 
Office report, while offices in Chicago, Los Angeles and Puerto 
Rico overstated their caseloads by small margins. 
</P>
<P>
	Cases were double-counted, cases that should have been closed  
were counted as open, and cases paid for from nonfederal sources 
were included with the federal count, the audit said. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican lawmakers asked the GAO to look into Legal Service's  
case reporting after The Associated Press reported in April that 
the agency overstated tens of thousands of cases handled in 1997. 
An AP review of five other offices among the agency's 269 regional 
programs found officials had overstated their caseload by at least 
90,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress uses the reported workload to gauge the agency's  
budget, and Republican critics said the GAO report revealed serious 
management problems or worse. 
</P>
<P>
	``LSC's waste and mismanagement are hardly cause for  
celebration,'' House Majority Leader Rep. Dick Armey said Tuesday. 
``The agency has been coy with Congress and wasted taxpayer 
money,'' Army said. 
</P>
<P>
	Agency officials say that the number of overstated cases is  
small by comparison to the millions of poor people served since the 
agency's founding. They denied the agency hid anything, and 
promised an internal review of case-reporting problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Legal Services gave $283 million in federal money to  
about 260 local affiliates to finance legal help for about 1 
million poor Americans with civil cases such as tenant problems or 
those needing protection from domestic violence.

<HEADLINE> Duchovny Loses Signature Battle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- David Duchovny has lost his battle over what  
he believes is a real-life conspiracy to sell his forged signature. 
</P>
<P>
	Duchovny, a star of ``The X-Files,'' and Dean Cain from the TV  
show ``Lois &AMP; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman'' filed 
separate lawsuits earlier this year against Truly Unique 
Collectibles, an Internet firm that sells signed celebrity 
photographs. 
</P>
<P>
	The suits claimed New York-based Truly Unique was selling phony  
signatures of the actors and was ``stealing fame'' by using 
unauthorized photographs of them to promote its products in 
advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
	The company denied the charges and U.S. District Judge Robert J.  
Kelleher agreed, ruling June 4 that the allegations were 
groundless. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've always sold a legitimate product, so naturally, I feel  
exonerated. We took on Superman and won,'' Truly Collectibles 
president James Ferrazzano said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Truly Unique Collectibles was selling Duchovny's signed photo  
for $50. Other photos included those of Sean Connery ($95), Mel 
Gibson ($110) and the Spice Girls ($150). 
</P>
<P>
	Plaintiffs' attorney Farhad Novian said the actors will appeal.  
</P>
<P>
	``The claims made by Mr. Duchovny and Mr. Cain are  
misappropriation of their fame and likeness,'' he said. ``It's a 
bad decision. We'll go all the way to the Supreme Court if we have 
to.''

<HEADLINE> San Diego May End Burglary Probes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- City police may no longer investigate home  
burglaries unless there is a known suspect, a compelling lead or 
extensive evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Chief Dave Bejarano said resources would be better spent  
by sending more officers to neighborhoods where drugs are widely 
sold and used, since many burglars are drug addicts trying to 
support their habits. 
</P>
<P>
	``By having proactive narcotics teams, we will prevent many of  
these cases from ever becoming burglaries,'' said Bejarano, who as 
a new chief is evaluating how the department uses its officers. 
</P>
<P>
	The move follows a study showing that of the 7,000 annual  
burglaries in the city, only 12 percent were solved. And few 
resulted in arrests and even fewer garnered convictions. 
</P>
<P>
	For six months, San Diego will divert about 18 burglary  
detectives to three narcotics investigation teams. If home burglary 
crimes do not substantially increase and the teams are successful 
in making more drug arrests, Bejarano could make the change 
permanent. 
</P>
<P>
	If so, San Diego would be only one of a few police departments  
in the country that no longer investigates all home burglaries. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York City Police Department is considering a similar  
step after completing a six-month study of 89,082 burglaries, which 
resulted in the arrests of only 142 people after detectives spent 
94,784 hours investigating. Only 12 went to prison. 
</P>
<P>
	San Diego Capt. John Magian said officers will still take home  
burglary reports by person or phone, but a detective won't get 
assigned to every case. 
</P>
<P>
	``If somebody violates your home, you deserve to have a police  
officer there,'' he said this week. ``But if somebody breaks into 
your garage and steals your barbecue or bicycle, maybe a police 
officer's time could be better spent someplace else.''

<HEADLINE> Angioplasty Is Better for Elderly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Angioplasty is slightly better than  
clot-dissolving drugs at saving the lives of heart attack victims 
over 65, a study found. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers also found that about half of the patients who  
were considered ideal candidates got neither treatment, suggesting 
the elderly are not getting adequate care. 
</P>
<P>
	``More attention needs to be paid to treating eligible elderly  
Americans with these life-saving techniques,'' said one researcher, 
Dr. Nathan R. Every, a professor of medicine at the University of 
Washington in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings, based on records of 80,356 heart-attack patients  
from 1994 to 1996, were published in Wednesday's Journal of the 
American Medical Association. The results parallel similar research 
in younger patients. 
</P>
<P>
	A heart attack occurs when a clot forms in one of the arteries  
of the heart, blocking the heart muscle's blood supply. In 
angioplasty, a flexible tube with a tiny balloon at the tip is 
inserted into the blocked artery to clear the blockage. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the angioplasty patients studied had a 19 percent  
higher survival rate after one year compared with patients who 
received clot-dissolving drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Within six hours of arrival at the hospital, 2,038 patients  
underwent angioplasty, while 18,645 received clot-dissolving drugs. 
A total of 59,673 received neither treatment within six hours. 
</P>
<P>
	The study's findings are important because heart attacks are the  
leading killer of older Americans, according to the American Heart 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Sidney E. Smith, past president of the heart association,  
noted that the death rate after one year among subjects receiving 
either treatment was about half that of other patients -- 17.6 
percent vs. 33 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Many doctors have been cautious about using clot-dissolving  
drugs among the elderly because the drugs raise the risk of 
complications such as strokes. And most hospitals are not equipped 
to do angioplasties, so clot-dissolvers are the only option. 
</P>
<P>
	In the study, strokes indeed were more common among patients  
receiving clot-dissolvers -- 3 percent vs. 2.1 percent -- but the 
rate was relatively low in both groups, Smith noted. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Alan K. Berger, the study's lead author, said the choice of  
therapy is less important than the speed in using it. 
</P>
<P>
	He said more older people need to react quickly to heart attack  
symptoms, which can include pressure in the chest, shortness of 
breath, pain or pressure radiating down one arm, nausea and profuse 
sweating. 
</P>
<P>
	``All a patient can do is recognize when they have a heart  
attack and call 911 to get to the hospital,'' he said. Berger, 
formerly of Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington, is 
now a research fellow at Yale University School of Medicine in New 
Haven, Conn.
