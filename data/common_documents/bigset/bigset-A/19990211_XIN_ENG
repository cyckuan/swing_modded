first half of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The survey says wholesale and retailers anticipate a drop for
the period while catering trade establishments express positive
sentiments.
</P>
<P>
But hoteliers report otherwise, the survey notes.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, firms engaged in transport &AMP; storage
and real estate foresee a business slowdown in the next six
months, the business services industry is also less optimistic
about the situation, and financial institutions forecast a
downward trend in their business activity for the period from
January to June 1999.

industrials on the business expectation of the manufacturing
sector show that majority expect business condition to remain
similar to the fourth quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Industrials predict lower levels of output, export orders and
overseas deliveries as compared to the fourth quarter of 1998.

The survey says a weighted 60 percent of the industrials expect
business situation to remain the same and a 22 weighted percent
predicts a weakening.
</P>

expenditure in 1999 with a weighted 74 percent of the
manufacturing establishments having plans to invest in plant and
machinery in the next 12 months while a weighted 20 percent of the
establishments are planning to invest in buildings.
</P>
<P>

competition from overseas competitors as well as political and
economic conditions abroad remain the two most crucial factors
affecting firms' ability to secure more export orders in the first
quarter of 1999.

<HEADLINE> Norwegian Scientists Discover A Sub-sea Crater </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 10 (Xinhua) -- A research team of Norway
has discovered a undersea meteor crater in the Arctic left over by
a collision 150 million years ago.
</P>
<P>
According to a report from the Associated Press, the meteor
crater is 25-mile wide, and located in the ocean floor 125 miles
north of Norway.
</P>
<P>
The meteor, more than a mile wide, was traveling about 18,600
MPH when it plunged into the Earth estimated 150 million years
ago. The impact caused a tidal wave that stretched from Canada
to Russia, and sent a plume of hot debris into the atmosphere,
darkening most of the Earth.
</P>
<P>
Scientists said samples from the crater in August suggested
quarts grains deformed by the impact, and traces of iridium, a
rare element more often found in space but rare found on Earth.
</P>
<P>
Up to now just seven such sub-sea craters are known to exist,
while there are more than 150 on land.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Conflict Causes A flood of refugees in EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The Kosovo conflict led to a
sharp rise in the number of refugees arriving in the European
Union (EU) last year, the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees said Wednesday in Bonn.
</P>
<P>
Some 299,000 refugees applied for asylum in the 15 EU member
states last year, an increase of 27 percent over 1997, said the
UNHCR in a statement, adding the Kosovo conflict was the main
reason for the growing flood of refugees.
</P>
<P>
Some 100,000 Yugoslav nationals applied for asylum in the EU
last year, most of whom were ethnic Albanians from Kosovo, said
the statement. This was double the number of Kosovo refugees for
1997.
</P>
<P>
Germany received the biggest number of the refugees last year
with 33 percent, followed by Britain with 19 percent and the
Netherlands 15 percent, according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
There were 98,644 asylum applicants in Germany in 1998, of whom
34,979 were from Yugoslavia, mainly from Kosovo, the German
Interior Ministry said.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Deputy PM to Visit Turkey to Boost ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz will visit Turkey for talks on bilateral ties and
issues of common concern, the Iraqi News Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The agency did not say when Aziz will go to Turkey, but Turkish
Foreign Ministry said Wednesday that he is due in Ankara on
February 15 at the invitation of Turkish Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit.
</P>
<P>
Political observers here believe that bilateral trade and
economic ties, issues regarding the Kurds and the Turkish Incirlik
Air Base will be top on the agenda for discussion.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq following its invasion of
Kuwait in 1990, which sparked the 1991 Gulf War, have dramatically
reduced trade between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Though trade picked up to some extent under the oil-for-food
deal between the U.N. and Iraq, which started in November 1996,
diplomats said Baghdad has recently diverted most of its
commercial dealings to Syria and Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Besides, political ties between the two countries are at low
ebb because Turkey put its Incirlik base in the south at the
disposal of the U.S.-British warplanes for reconnaissance missions
over northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and its allied nations set up no-fly zones in southern
and northern Iraq after the Gulf War with a claimed aim to protect
the Kurds in the north and Shiite Muslims in the south from
alleged Baghdad's suppression.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has voiced concern recently over the regular clashes
between Iraq and U.S.-British fighter jets patrolling the no-fly
zone.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has urged Turkey not to be used by foreign forces as a
spring-board to launch attacks on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's repeated incursion into northern Iraq to fight against
the Turkish Kurdish rebels, who sought shelters there, is another
source of dispute between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has attacked the incursions as a violation of its
sovereignty and a threat to its security and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
The outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party has since 1984 been
fighting for an independent Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey.

<HEADLINE> WFP Closely Monitoring Ethio-Eritrean Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations World
Food Program (WFP) in Ethiopia said Wednesday that it is
monitoring closely the border conflict between Ethiopia and
Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
WFP Country Director Judith Lewis said in a statement issued
here that WFP Ethiopia is currently undertaking an accurate and
complete assessment of the situation.
</P>
<P>
"This week, the Emergency Operation for Ethiopia, developed by
the country office in conjunction with the Ethiopian government,
was approved by WFP headquarters in Rome," said Lewis, adding that
"WFP is working closely with the Relief Society of Tigray, an
indigenous non-governmental organization, in identifying
appropriate distribution sites in the region."
</P>
<P>
"There is enough food in the country to handle a humanitarian
crisis, and the logistics unit is also prepared to transport the
food where it is needed," she said.
</P>
<P>
Some areas of the Tigray region was short in agricultural
production last year and people there need food aid by the WFP.
However, the current border conflict will affect the relief
program in the region.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to remain alert" and "if neccessary, we are
prepared to respond to an emergency situation," noted Lewis.
</P>
<P>
Referring to food situation in Gode area of the Somali region
in southeastern Ethiopia, Lewis said WFP Ethiopia is attempting to
assess the food needs in the area which had suffered two
consecutive seasons of significantly below average rainfalls.
</P>
<P>
Approximately 10,000 Somalis have also crossed the border into
Ethiopia because of drought and food shortages, which has further
strained the food supplies, she added.

BEIRUT, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Salim
Hoss Wednesday left here for Amman to extend his late condolences
for the death of Jordan's King Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Hoss was absent at Hussein's funeral on Monday as he was being
in Saudi Arabia on an official visit at the time. Lebanon sent
Deputy Prime Minister Michel Murr to the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Lebanon's former President Elias Hrawi,
former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, three former cabinet ministers
and five parliament members had flown to Amman to offer
condolences.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Lebanese President Emile Lahoud telephoned Jordan's
new King Abdullah Bin Hussein and drove to the Jordanian Embassy
in Beirut to deliver his condolences.
</P>
<P>
But he is still criticized by public opinion for not personally
attending the funeral, which brought together world's key leaders,
especially rulers in the Middle East.

<HEADLINE> German Government Approves Tax Reform II </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The German government approved on
Wednesday the second phase of the government's tax cut plan while
leaving open the question of earlier corporate tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
"This is a fiscally solid and economically reasoned reform,"
the German Finance Minister Oscar Lafontaine said here at a news
briefing.
</P>
<P>
The government's tax reform delivers modest income tax cuts.
Personal income tax, which ranged from 25.9 percent for low
earners to 53 percent for upper incomes, will be trimmed
step-by-step through 2002 when levels will fall to 19.9 and 48.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
Under the reform, Germans would enjoy a net annual tax cut of 9
billion dollars by 2002, said Lafontaine.
</P>
<P>
Seeking to pacify business which has criticized the reform,
Lafontaine announced certain tax write-offs would be maintained
for both the publishing sector and for the "Mittelstand",
Germany's crucial small and medium-sized companies.
</P>
<P>
But he said no decision had been made on whether to cut
corporate income tax to 35 percent in 2000, instead of 2002 as is
currently planned. He added, "recommendations will be made in
April".
</P>
<P>
Although Schroeder's Social Democrats (SPD) lost their majority
in parliament's upper chamber, the Bundesrat, as a result of Hesse
state elections last weekend, the government has vowed to win
necessary Bundesrat approval for the tax reform before Hesse's old
SPD-led government leaves office.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Opposes Missile Deployment on Grete Island </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Ministry
deputy spokesman Sermet Atacanli said Wednesday that Turkey
opposes the Greek decision on the deployment of Russian-made
S-300 missiles on its Crete island.
</P>
<P>
Atacanli made the remark at a weekly press conference here. He
said that the Greek decision is not a "very rationalist policy"
and Turkey never leaves a threat without response from Greece.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the issue of the S-300 missiles can not be
accepted as a matter of bargaining.
</P>
<P>
"Foreign Minister Ismail Cem had said that the solution of the
issue is up to the Greek-Greek Cypriot duo, which had created the
problem," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The deployment of S-300 missiles on Crete will add a new
problem into the existing complicated relations between Turkey and
Greece," he said, "Thus it can't be accepted that this policy of
Greeks and Greek-Cypriots is very accurate and rationalist."
</P>
<P>
He said that the Greek-Greek Cypriot front in recent years
have entered into a continuous armament race within the framework
of their military doctrines, adding that those steps would give
rise to a new tense atmosphere in eastern mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus struck the deal with Russia to purchase the S-300
surface-to-air missile system in January 1997, in a bid to cement
its air defense capability against Turkey.
</P>
<P>
A close ally of independence-seeking Turkish Cypriots in
northern Cyprus, Turkey has threatened to launch preemptive
strikes if the missiles are deployed on the divided island.
</P>
<P>
Greece and the Cypriot government decided to bring the missile
system on Greece's Crete island, leaving Turkey out of its range
to avoid provocation.
</P>
<P>
The delivery of the missiles had already been put off several
times under Turkish and international pressures.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Greek Cypriots-controlled
south and the Turkish Cypriots-dominated north after Turkey
landed its troops on and took over the northern third of the
country in 1974 in the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup.

<HEADLINE> Serb President to Be in Rambouillet for Kosovo Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RAMBOUILLET, France, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The president of
the Republic of Serbia, Milan Milutinovic, will arrive here on
Thursday, as the peace talks on Kosovo remained deadlocked on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret said
that the co-chairmen of the talks, French Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine and his British counterpart Robin Cook, will also be here
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Officials close to the talks said that the delegates
representing Serbs and ethnic Albanians in Kosovo are continuing
their talks in a "studious" way, despite the difficulties met in
the talks over the past several days.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a group of Serb Orthodox Church leaders arrived here
on Wednesday to show their support to the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine and Cook are increasing pressure on the negotiators to
focus their talks on the peace plan presented by the six-nation
Contact Group.
</P>
<P>
Both the Serb and Albanian delegates have stuck to their
original stand and have shown little sign of accepting a
compromise.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic reaffirmed on
Wednesday that Kosovo must remain part of the Serb Republic.
</P>
<P>
But the ethnic Albanian side has called for a referendum on the
future of the province after a three-year interim period, the
participation of NATO in signing a ceasefire agreement, and the
deployment of troops by NATO in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The Albanian demands have been poorly received by the
international mediators -- U.S. diplomat Christopher Hill, Russian
diplomat Boris Mayorski and Austrian diplomat Wolfgang Petritsch,
who have been shuttling between the two delegations in the chateau
of Rambouillet.
</P>
<P>
The two delegations have been holding separate meetings with
the mediators, as the Serb delegation refuses to meet face-to-face
with the Albanian delegation.
</P>
<P>
The Serbs said that some members of the Albanian delegation are
members of the Kosovo Liberation Army, which Belgrade considers to
be a "terrorist" group.

<HEADLINE> IAEA Calls for Intrusive Inspection of Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The International
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on Wednesday submitted plans for
long-term monitoring of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In a report to the United Nations Security Council, the agency
director Mohammed el-Baradei said the monitoring would cost at
least 10 million U.S. dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
The report concluded once again that Iraq is denying the agency
documents and material it has requested, including documentary
evidence that Iraq has abandoned its nuclear weapons program, and
the agency said it could not verify that Iraq had not hidden away
banned nuclear equipment or materials.
</P>
<P>
The agency has therefore concluded that any long-term monitoring
must be comprehensive, rigorous, and, as a result, intrusive.
</P>
<P>
It said it would use such measures as unannounced inspections
of previously uninspected locations and examine records equipment,
materials products, and other measures would include interviews,
environmental monitoring, radiation surveys and the sampling of
water, vegetation, air and soil.
</P>
<P>
The agency said it would also need to conduct unannounced
inspections at new sites to detect any signs of banned activities.

<HEADLINE> Further Warning Strikes in German Metalworking Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Tensions heated up further
Wednesday in Germany's metalworking sector as thousands of
employees took part in warning strikes around the country to press
their wage demands.
</P>
<P>
The metalworkers union IG Metall called workers off their jobs
in the states of Bavaria, Saxony, Hessen, Rhineland-Palatinate,
Lower Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, and Saarland as well as in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
In Bavaria alone, estimated 50,000 workers took part in the
walkout, according to reports of the German Press Agency.
</P>
<P>
The strikes come a day after negotiations in the state of
Baden- Wuerttemberg broke down amid a continuing wide gap between
union demands and what employers are offering.
</P>
<P>
IG Metall wants a 6.5 percent pay increase for Germany's some
3.5 million metalworkers. Employers have offered a 2.3 percent
rise plus a one-time bonus of 0.5 percent depending on companies'
earnings situations.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, regional wage commission officials are to meet to
discuss workers' next moves. It was expected they would ask the IG
Metall executive board to call a vo te of rank-and-file members on
whether to stage an all-out strike.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council on Wednesday began closed-door consultations on
cross-border war between Eritrea and Ethiopia, which broke out
early on Saturday in the heart of the disputed border area between
the two neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan attended the morning session
of the 15-member Security Council. HE is expected to brief the
Council on the latest situation in the region, U.N. sources said.
His briefing, previously scheduled for early this week, was later
postponed due to his trip to Jordan to attend the funeral of late
King Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed Sahanoun, the special envoy of the Secretary-General in
Africa, was back in New York on Tuesday from a visit to the
region, where he met with leaders of the two warring countries in
a bid to promote the peace process initiated by the Organization
of African Unity (OAU). He is also expected to brief the Security
Council on what is going on on the ground in the region.
</P>
<P>
In dispute between the two nations are sections of their
1,000-kilometer border that have never been clearly demarcated.
The border differences simmered before they became a pretext for a
fierce round of fighting in May and June that left up to 1,000
dead.
</P>
<P>
Since the outbreak of the latest armed clashes in the region,
both the United Nations and the OAU has called for an end to the
fighting.
</P>
<P>
The president of the Security Council, Robert Fowler, said in a
Tuesday statement that "Council members demand the fighting cease
immediately, in line with Council's previous resolution."

<HEADLINE> Israeli-Syrian Talks Could be Resumed in Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 10 (Xinhua) -- A senior adviser to Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Wednesday that peace
talks with Syria could be resumed before Israel's general
elections on May 17.
</P>
<P>
David Bar-Illan, Netanyahu's communication adviser, told Israel
Radio that there were signs recently that progress could be made
in Israeli-Syrian negotiations before Israelis go to polls in
May. But he did not specify what exactly the signs were.
</P>
<P>
After attending the funeral of Jordan's King Hussein on Monday,
Netanyahu told Israel's media that he was inspired by Hussein to
make extra efforts to proceed in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu also repeated that he hoped to sign a peace deal with
Syria by the end of this year. But Syria has dismissed Netanyahu's
remarks as "an election propaganda."
</P>
<P>
Israeli-Syrian peace talks broke off in February 1996 and
efforts to resume them have stumbled over the issue of the Golan
Heights, captured by Israel in 1967 war and later annexed to the
Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Syria wants negotiations to be resumed where they were left off
under Israel's former Labor government - with an agreement in
principle for a return of the Golan in exchange for security
guarantees and a full peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has refused to be tied to the Labor government's
stance and insisted that the peace talks should be restarted
without any preconditions.

international agreements on non-proliferation of missile,
nuclear-missile and dual-purpose technologies," First Deputy Prime
Minister Yuri Maslyukov said.
</P>
<P>
The denial was in response to a CIA report to U.S. Congress,
which listed Russia among countries described as main suppliers of
dual-purpose technologies and military hardware to the world
market, Itar-Tass reported.
</P>
<P>
"Russia possesses an efficient enough system of export control
to prevent lead of missile technologies and other technologies
connected with creation of weapons of mass destruction," said
Maslyukov, who heads a government commission for Russia's military
and technical cooperation with foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Foreign Intelligence Service also denied the CIA
report.
</P>
<P>
"According to data available, no facts of violation of
international agreements by Russia on a state level exist," Tass
quoted the service's press department as saying.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Jets Attack Iraqi Air Defense Sites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. jet fighters on
Wednesday attacked two Iraqi air defense sites in the southern
no-fly zone, U.S. military officials said.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time in a week since the last confrontations
between the U.S. warplanes and Iraqi planes and air defense sites.
</P>
<P>
The incidents occurred near Talil and An Najar, all in the
southern no-fly zone, between 2:30 a.m. and 4:30 a.m. (0730 and
0930 GMT).
</P>
<P>
The= officials said Iraqi MiG-23 or MiG-25 jets entered the
no-fly zones in three separate times. When U.S. patrolling
planes came to challenge, they immediately turned tail.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. pilots were not targeted by the Iraqi jets or by the
anti-aircraft missile sites, but struck against the air defense
systems as a self-defensive measure, said Navy Lt. Cmdr. Ernest
Duplessis, a spokesman for U.S. Central Command in Florida. "It
was a provocation."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. warplanes struck six Iraqi targets, including
surface-to-air missiles batteries and associated command and
control system, according to Duplessis, who said a damage
assessment was still under way to determine if the sites were
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
There were no incidents in the northern no-fly zone, the
Pentagon said.

<HEADLINE> Israel Rejects U.N. Resolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Israeli government on
Wednesday rejected a United Nations resolution calling for an
unprecedented Geneva Convention conference to discuss Jewish
settlement activities in occupied Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry issued a statement saying "Israel
completely rejects" the resolution, which was passed by the
U.N. General Assembly by a large majority Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The resolution "was passed for narrow political motives and not
because of humanitarian considerations," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Arab-sponsored resolution called on the signatories to the
Fourth Geneva Convention, a humanitarian law on the treatment of
civilians in war-time, to convene in July to denounce illegal
Israeli activities in occupied territories.
</P>
<P>
This will be the first such conference since the Geneva
Convention was adopted in 1949. The U.N. General Assembly has held
four emergency sessions since April 1997 on the Palestinian
demand that such a conference be convened.
</P>
<P>
The latest emergency session, which resulted in the adoption
of the resolution, began after the United States vetoed two
Security Council resolutions that would have condemned Israel for
its plans to build in the disputed Har Homa in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry statement said Israel will not
participate in the Geneva conference.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Govt Poised to Destroy Savimbi's War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Angola's new Council of
Ministers Standing Commission held its first session Wednesday and
decided to concentrate all the country's forces to destroy the war
machine of Jonas Savimbi, chairman of the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
The session, presided over by President Eduardo dos Santos,
deliberated on the current political and military situation in the
southern African country.
</P>
<P>
A press communique issued after the meeting said, due to the
re-starting of civil war by the opposition UNITA, the present
domestic situation is" grim" with large scale of war which
inflicted countless personnel and material losses.
</P>
<P>
The communique reiterated that the government will no longer
negotiate with the UNITA led by Savimbi. It also decided to turn
the country's political, military, social and economic sectors
into wartime position and mobilize all forces to completely
destroy Savimbi's war machine.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also approved a government financial program in the
state of war. In addition to current military situation, the
program also takes into consideration the relief work of
increasing refugees as well as solutions to other social problems,
according to the communique.
</P>
<P>
The government "pledged to carry out its foreign debt
obligations and pay salaries to the civil servants in time."
</P>
<P>
The plummeting crude oil price on the international market has
brought Angola, a country dependent on oil export, on the verge of
a financial crisis. At present, some international monetary
institutions have suspended loans to the Angolan government and
civil servants have not been paid for over half a year.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government headed by President dos Santos had a
major cabinet reshuffle on January 30 and decided that the Council
of Ministers Standing Commission will be in charge of "daily
military, political, social and economic affairs."
</P>
<P>
The new Council of Ministers Standing Commission set up on
February 3 consists of ministers from nine important ministries
including defense, foreign affairs, planning, finance and the
interior.

<HEADLINE> .     EU Looks For Way to Ease Beef Row with US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brussels, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) will look
for how to deal with the disputes with the United States and Canada
over beef hormones by assessing three different possible options the
European Commission put forward here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The commission said the options could be introduced as interim
measures pending the finalization of the additional scientific studies
that were undertaken last year.
</P>
<P>
The options are paying compensation through trade concessions,
transforming the EU hormone-treated beef ban on imports into a
temporary one on the basis of available pertinent evidence, or lifting
the ban on imports and applying labelling, the EU executive branch
said.
</P>
<P>
A EU commission spokesman said the commission will initiate talks
with the complaining parties, namely the U.S. and Canada, in order to
evaluate the merits of these options and in particular to analyze the
feasibility of compensation.
</P>
<P>
The World Trade Organization (WTO) granted the EU a "reasonable
period" which expires on May 13, 1999 to bring its measures on beef
hormones into conformity with the provisions of the Sanitary and
Phytosanitary Agreement (SPS).
</P>
<P>
The EU ordered eight risk-assessment studies on beef hormones after
it lost a WTO appeal last year. The WTO has been in favor of the U.S.
assertion that hormone-treated beef exports are safe and the meat
should be allowed into the EU market.
</P>
<P>
According to U.S. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman on Tuesday, the
U.S. expected the EU to give green light for U.S. imports of
hormone-treated beef after the May 13 deadline, regardless of whether
the EU has completed its studies.
</P>
<P>
However, the European Commission said in a statement today that
the final results from most of these studies are expected to become
available only later in the year or in 2000, while some preliminary
results are likely available by the end of April or early May.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the EU organ responsible for proposing and
enforcing legislation, also said it intended through the options to
deal with the situation in which the EU now finds itself, in the
run-up to the May 13 deadline and during the subsequent interim period
that is necessary to complete the complementary risk assessment.
</P>
<P>
The hormones are widely used in the United States to help cattle
grow bigger and faster. The U.S. has threatened retaliatory sanctions
unless the EU meets the WTO ruling.
</P>
<P>
The beef row began in 1989, when the beef sales of the United
States to the European Union market reached about 100 million U.S.
dollars annually.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 10 (Xinhua) -- South Africa "warmly
welcomed" the release from prison of Xanana Gusmao of East Timor,
the Foreign Affairs Department said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"This was an important step forward in the search for a
solution to the East Timor issue," the department quoted Foreign
Minister Alfred Nzo as saying in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Gusmao, who led the independence drive in East Timor, was
arrested in 1992. He was released earlier Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Nzo reiterated South Africa's long-standing commitment to
support all efforts on the issue, including those under the aegis
of the U.N. Secretary- General Kofi Annan, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement noted that South African President Nelson Mandela
and Nzo had met Gusmao in prison on two separate occasions and
that both remained convinced that Gusmao had an important role to
play in the negotiations on the future of the disputed territory.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, which had been a Portuguese colony, was invaded by
Indonesia in 1975. But Jakarta's sovereignty over East Timor is
not recognized, according to the statement.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 10 (Xinhua) -- A conference to
celebrate the International Year of Older Persons 1999 will take
place here Wednesday at the headquarters of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The theme of the conference is on "Caring Communities for the
21st Century: Villages and Cities For All Generations -- Towards
a Society for All Ages".
</P>
<P>
The meeting is organized by the International Council for
Caring Communities in collaboration with the Secretariat of the
International Year of Older Persons and the UN Department of
Public Information.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the fields of architecture, advertising, design,
community planning, health, government, real estate development
and technology, will discuss the impact of longevity on cities
and villages.
</P>
<P>
Longevity is one of mankind's greatest achievement. However,
there are challenges that accompany this achievement.
</P>
<P>
In 1950, there were about 200 million persons aged 60 or
older -- persons in this age group now number almost 550 million
and are rising. One in five persons will be 60 years or older by the
year 2050 and one in three persons by 2150. currently, persons
80 years and older constitute 11 percent of the population aged
60 and above. By 2050, 27 percent of the older population will
be over 80 years old.
</P>
<P>
With the ageing of populations worldwide, the public sector is
faced with demands to increase the standard of housing and provide
decent living conditions for the older generations.

<HEADLINE> UN Body Agrees to Ivory Trade for Conservation Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations conservation
body CITES said here on Wednesday that it has taken important
steps towards agreeing to a limited experiment of trade in African
elephant ivory to support conservation and community development
projects in Zimbabwe, Namibia and Botswana.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release by the Secretariat for the
Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild
Fauna and Flora (CITES), the Standing Committee of the CITES
decided that Namibia, Zimbabwe and Japan fully meet the conditions
on enforcement and ivory control set down at the last conference
of CITES parties in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The committee also decided that Botswana almost meets these
conditions but there is a need for a further visit by the CITES
secretariat's verification team to confirm that further
improvements outlined to the meeting have been put in place.
</P>
<P>
The decision will allow Japan to buy up to 20 tons of ivory
from Zimbabwe and up to 13.8 tons from Namibia, under strict
conditions laid down by the UN body. Botswana has declared stocks
of 25.3 tons.
</P>
<P>
The conditions set down at the 1997 conference included:
</P>
<P>
- Improvements to the legislation and enforcement capabilities
in the four countries concerned;
</P>
<P>
- A commitment to international cooperation in law enforcement;
</P>
<P>
- New and strengthened mechanisms to ensure the proceeds fo
ivory sales go into further elephant conservation;
</P>
<P>
- Agreement of an international system for reporting and
monitoring legal and illegal trade and illegal hunting.
</P>
<P>
CITES parties accepted by a large majority that elephant
populations in the three African countries are stable or growing
and no longer under threat, according to the press release.

<HEADLINE> Fewer Americans Trust U.S. Media, Poll Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Fewer American people trust
the accuracy of the news media in the country, says a pool
released by Pew Research Center for the People &AMP; the Press
recently.
</P>
<P>
The pool says the number of respondents who said the U.S.
media reports "are often inaccurate" increased to 65 percent in
1998 from 35 percent in 1985.
</P>
<P>
"Polls show Americans don't trust the media. But Media
critics say the public is still profoundly influenced by media
spin. People also aren't aware how widespread bias is among
Journalists," Investor's Business Daily said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The public is often unable to see that "news judgement" by
U.S. reporters is always subjective, the Daily said, adding
quest for "objectivity" may mask other biases.
</P>
<P>
Marvin Olasky, editor of World magazine and professor of
journalism at the University of Texas in Austin, said the public
holds the U.S. media in low regard, but accepts much of its
reporting uncritically. This is especially true of foreign news
in U.S. papers and on TVs, which the public can't verify and
tends to accept on faith, he said.
</P>
<P>
Olasky said most journalists know absolute objectivity is
impossible but the public expects it. So journalists pretend to
be objective by offering "disguised subjectivity", a sly balance
of views that coaxes the audience to see truth as the journalist
sees it, he added.
</P>
<P>
Jack Dvorak, professor of journalism and director of the
High School Journalism Institute at Indiana University, has an
identity of views with Olasky. He said "everyone realizes that
this whole concept of objectivity is a goal no one can reach
because there is no such thing as anyone being totally
objective."

<HEADLINE> Gloomy Picture of Zimbabwe's Economy Painted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The Confederation of Zimbabwean
 Industries (CZI) said Wednesday the recent increase in prime
lending rates by commercial banks will cripple efforts by industry
to expand due to the high cost of money.
</P>
<P>
Although the increase had been expected for some time, this
was going to hit hard on the commercial and industrial sectors,
said CZI chief economist Farai Zizhou in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to witness a considerable reduction in the rate
of economic activity as a result of the high cost of money,"
Zizhou said, adding "Small and medium size business will be the
hardest hit as most such firms do not have cash reserves of their
own."
</P>
<P>
The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) last week hiked the repo
rate from 38. 5 percent to 42.5 percent, a move that has triggered
the increase in prime lending rates by commercial banks, with
Stanbic Bank having increased its prime lending rate to 43.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
Other commercial banks are soon expected to adjust their
lending rates upward as well.
</P>
<P>
Zizhou said this move came at a time when Zimbabwe was
negotiating for the establishment of the SADC (Southern African
Development Community) Free Trade Area.
</P>
<P>
He noted that if the situation was not reversed soon, local
businesses would fail to compete with those from other SADC
states, let alone those from other low inflation countries, and
the consequent loss of jobs, investment, incomes and social
stability.
</P>
<P>
"The CZI urges the government to urgently take measures to
bring down inflation (now 46.6 percent) before it irreversibly
damages most of our industries," he said.

<P>
ANKARA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Ministry has
decided to summon the Spanish ambassador here Wednesday to voice
its complaints over Spain's permitting a meeting of the so-called
"Kurdish parliament in exile."
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry deputy spokesman Sermet Atacanli said at a
weekly news conference that the permission will not contribute
positively to the Turkish-Spanish relations.
</P>
<P>
Spanish Basque parliament has permitted the "Kurdish parliament
in exile," which is regarded by Ankara as a wing of the outlawed
Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), to hold a meeting.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting since 1984 a guerrilla war for an
independent Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey. The conflict
have claimed at least 37,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
Atacanli said the Foreign Ministry had conveyed the
"inconveniences" to be created by such a meeting to the Spanish
government.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Turkey is closely following the issue from
the beginning, saying that necessary measures had been launched in

<HEADLINE> Norway to Continue Promoting Bicommunal Contacts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Norwegian Deputy Foreign
Minister Aslaug Haga said here Wednesday that Norway will continue
promoting bi-communal contacts in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Haga made the remarks at the end of her three-day official
visit here, during which she held talks with Cypriot President
Glafcos Clerides, Foreign Minister Ioannis Kasoulides and some
political party leaders.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Haga visited northern Cyprus controlled by Turkish
Cypriots and met their leader Rauf Denktash.
</P>
<P>
She also had meetings with the business forum of the two
communities.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Greek Cypriot-dominated south and
Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The international community has been trying for decades to
reunite the island through a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation
formula, but so far no tangible results have been achieved.
</P>
<P>
Haga noted that she had "very constructive and useful talks"
with both sides, which gave her "a much better and clearer view on
what is the situation on the island."
</P>
<P>
Haga explained that the reason she visited the north was "to do
quite the same as she has done in the south to promote the
people-to-people contacts."
</P>
<P>
She also said that "what I have been told is that there is an
interest to follow up on this track. We have to find the right
modalities for doing that." But she did not give further details.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Gets $82m IMF Loan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The International
Monetary Fund (IMF) has approved an 82-million-U.S.-Dollar loan
for Tanzania to bolster the east African country's economic
reforms.
</P>
<P>
"The IMF board has approved a loan of 82 million U.S. Dollars
for Tanzania on Monday. It will be released in two phases," Tsidi
Tsikata, the lending agency's resident representative, was quoted
by media reports Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Of the total, a half will be be handed out immediately while
the second half will be released after an assessment of the
situation by an IMF team of experts in April, Tsikata said in Dar
es Salaam Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The loan will help Tanzania to keep balance of payments and
boost economic growth, which was affected by floods linked to El
Nino that immensely hindered exports and damaged infrastructure
last year.
</P>
<P>
Tsikata said the IMF loan was effected after initial assessment
of Tanzania's economic performance during the last three years.
</P>
<P>
He said the country's economic reforms are encouraging but
there is need to press ahead with tax reform and privatization and
to ease bottlenecks including fluctuating commodity prices in the
world market.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the European Union has granted Tanzania
35 million Euros to reduce the government's domestic debts and
inject cash in private sector. In exchange, the government is
expected to increase spendings on primary education.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Representatives of all Duma
factions, including Yabloko, support the initiative of Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov to stabilize the situation in Russia,
speaker of the lower house Gennady Seleznyov said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Seleznyov said Primakov and parliamentary leaders, during their
two-hour meeting earlier in the day, decided to set up a working
group to deal with the matter, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
Primakov, describing the dialogue as very useful, said the
sides now have to meet each other halfway to achieve the political
accord, which calls on President Boris Yeltsin, the government and
the parliament to each cede some of their constitutional powers to
ensure stability in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Yabloko faction, which has been skeptical of a draft of the
political accord, understands the necessity of agreement but has
not decided what final document should be approved, Seleznyov
said.
</P>
<P>
The Communists favor stability, Seleznyov, himself a Communist
member, said.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Varsities Urged to Share Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni has urged university authorities across the country to
share resources among their institutions as an effective way of
addressing the problem of inadequacy of resources available for
higher learning.
</P>
<P>
The president made the call when officiating at a graduation
ceremony at Islamic University of Uganda (IUIU) in the western
district of Mbale Wednesday, according to a press release from the
President's Office.
</P>
<P>
At the function at which 180 graduates were conferred degrees
and awarded diplomas, Museveni said he was gratified that by
sharing laboratories with Makerere University, IUIU has managed to
graduate scientists while part-time lecturers from Makerere have
helped the institution offer various courses.
</P>
<P>
On vocational training, Museveni appealed to all Ugandans to
understand that technical education is not inferior to any other
type of education and noted that people with technical skills are
more marketable in the labor market.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the importance of popularizing vocational
training in educational institutions so that school leavers are
people who can work with their brains as well as their hands.
</P>
<P>
The 54-year-old president also called on religious-affiliated
institutions to educate people about separation of religion and
state in a non-theocratic state such as Uganda.
</P>
<P>
IUIU has graduated 1,020 students since it opened 10 years ago
and has students from 11 African countries.

MOSCOW, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Russian Communist Party leader
Gennady Zyuganov enjoys the widest support among the country's
presidential hopefuls, an opinion poll shows.
</P>
<P>
If presidential elections were held next Sunday, 23 percent of

individuals who planned to take part in elections were taken into
account, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
Zyuganov was followed by Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov and Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov, both with 14 percent.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Egypt Works out New Oil Exporting Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has decided to concentrate
on exporting oil products rather than crude, Oil Minister Hamdi
el-Banbi said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
El-Banbi told reporters that Egypt's strategy is aimed at
dampening adverse effects of sagging oil prices in the world
markets.
</P>
<P>
The world oil prices have dropped to as low as 10 U.S. dollars
a barrel due to low demand and excessive supply.
</P>
<P>
The new policy, however, would not affect the contracts signed
with foreign oil companies for exporting their share of crude, the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is also striving to introduce a policy aimed at
developing small oil fields to increase production and reserves and
make use, whenever possible, of facilities in adjacent oil fields
to accelerate production and reduce expenses, el-Banbi said.
</P>
<P>
A third axis in the new policy is to encourage the private
sector, foreign companies and national insurance companies to
finance and set up oil industries to ease the burden on the state
budget.
</P>
<P>
El-Banbi urged leading oil exporting countries to strictly
adhere to production quotas up to the second half of next year in
an effort to shore up the oil prices.
</P>
<P>
He maintained that Egypt is in no position to further slash its
production after its announcement last March of a cut of 20,000
barrels a day to 830,000 barrels because of its foreign
commitments and home needs.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has 1.187 billion tonnes of proven oil reserves. Oil
provides 92 percent of the country's energy demand. Its export
earned for Egypt 1.728 billion dollars in 1998.

<HEADLINE> One Iraqi Civilian Killed in U.S. Missile Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 10 (Xinhua) -- One Iraqi civilian was killed
and several others were injured Wednesday when U.S. warplanes
attacked the southern Iraqi city of Najaf, an Iraqi military
spokesman announced.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman was quoted by the Iraqi News Agency as saying
that at 11:33 a.m. local time (0833 GMT), 12 formations of "enemy
planes" from Saudi and Kuwaiti bases violated Iraq's southern
airspace and launched 14 missiles and bombs at Najaf and Dheqar
provinces.
</P>
<P>
He said that at 5:38 p.m. local time (1438 GMT), "enemy
planes" violated Iraq's southern airspace again and launched four
missiles at an Iraqi air defense site in Basra.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that at 10:56 a.m. local time (0756 GMT),
10 formations of "enemy planes" from a Turkish military base
violated Iraq's northern airspace, and that Iraqi air defense
units opened fire at one plane that was approaching an
anti-aircraft site.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led western allies imposed the no-fly zones in
northern and southern Iraq in the wake of the 1991 Gulf War with
a claimed aim of protecting the Kurds in the north and the Shiite
Muslims in the south from alleged Baghdad's suppression.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain bombarded Iraq in mid-December to
retaliate what they said Iraq's non-cooperation with U.N. arms
inspectors in charge of eliminating Iraq's banned weapons.
</P>
<P>
After the mid-December attacks, Iraq announced that it would
not recognize the no-fly zones and would fire at U.S. and British
jets patrolling the zones. Clashes between Iraqi air defense
forces and U.S. and British warplanes have since then become
commonplace.
</P>
<P>
Last month, U.S. and British warplanes bombed three residential
quarters in southern Iraq, killing dozens of civilians and
wounding nearly 100 others.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has posted awards for anyone
who shoots down U.S. or British planes, or missiles, or capture
their pilots.

<HEADLINE> New Smart Tyre Tells All </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. engineers have developed a
new smart tyre that will tell drivers when it needs replacing or
inflating, New Scientist magazine reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Instruments that tell drivers the condition of their tyres are
already available, but they are expensive and unreliable.
</P>
<P>
The new smart tyre, developed by researchers from Case Western
Reserve University, in Ohio, and the tyre company Goodyear, uses
specially designed tiny temperature and pressure sensors.
</P>
<P>
Those sensors contain microscopic components known as
microelectromechanical systems, which the researchers said made
the sensors reliable, cheap and remain stable over up to 10 to 12
years.
</P>
<P>
Each tyre also contains an ID chip that helps tyre makers keep
track of their stock. To identify a tyre, or read its temperature
or pressure, a radio signal is sent out by a transmitter built
into a vehicle or a handheld scanner.
</P>
<P>
The incoming signal provides enough power to run the sensors
and beam back the tyre's vital statistics.
</P>
<P>
Though Goodyear has successfully tested the sensors in truck
tyres, it refuses to reveal when the tyres might reach the
marketplace, New Scientist said.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Rebels Attack Diamond Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone Rebels renewed
their attacks on the diamond town of Kenema in the east Wednesday,
according to a report from the west African country.
</P>
<P>
 a fierce battle was raging one day after soldiers from the
west African force ECOMOG and pro-government militia fought off a
fifth rebel assault, a spokesman for the regional force backing
elected president Amad Kabbah was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The rebels attacked Kenema again today in larger numbers and
heavy fighting is now going on for the town as the ECOMOG troops
and the traditional hunters' militia known as Kamajors are
fighting back to hold the town against the rebel invasion," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the presidency said the rebels had penetrated
defenses on the approaches to the town. Other sources in the
Kenema area said 10 civilians were killed in cross fire on
Tug5OMOG spokesman claimed that 40 rebels had been killed.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leone's west Afskcan neighbors have sent in
reinforcements to bolster the 15,000-strong ECOMOG force.
</P>
<P>
The rebels -- an alliance of the Revolutionary United Front
(ruf) and soldiers who toppled Kabbah in May 1997 -- captured the
diamond capital of Koidu last year before marching on the capital
Freetown, which they came close to capturing in January.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said the fall of Kenema would put much of the
impoverished former British colony's diamond production in rebel
hands -- a trump card ahead of peace talks offered by Kabbah in a
weekend broadcast to the nation.
</P>
<P>
Kabbah's spokesman called the attacks unfortunate.
</P>
<P>
"This means that the rebels are not ready to talk peace with
the government," he said.

<HEADLINE> Four To Die In Ghana for Treason </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 10 (XInhua) -- Four out of five persons who
were charged with plotting to overthrow the Ghanaian government in
August 1994, were sentenced to death Wednesday after a High Court
in Accra found them guilty, the Ghana News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
They pleaded not guilty.
</P>
<P>
The four, convicted on conspiracy to commit treason and
treason, are Alex Offei, Kwame Ofori Appiah, Sylvester Addai
Dwomoh and John Owusu Boakye, who are all members of the Cherubim
and Seraphim Church in London. They have 30 days to appeal against
their conviction.
</P>
<P>
The court found the fifth accused, Emmanuel Osei Kofi, a
driver, not guilty on conspiracy and treason, and was accordingly
acquitted and discharged.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution had stated that the four conspired in London,
came down to Ghana and contacted some soldiers in August 1994 to
assist them to overthrow the government but the soldiers reported
them to the authorities.
</P>
<P>
The court upheld the case of the prosecution on the grounds
that there was enough evidence to convict them.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-American
Development Bank approved on Wednesday a soft loan of 45 million
U.S. dollars to Bolivia to help reduce communicable disease and to
support reform of the health sector.
</P>
<P>
The resources will enable the Ministry of Health and Social
Insurance of Bolivia to take actions to halt the spread of Chagas
disease, which accounts for 13 percent of the deaths of Bolivians
between the ages of 15 and 75, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The blood transfusion controls instituted under the program
will also help block the transmission of other communicable
disease, such as hepatitis and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The project will strengthen Bolivia's National Epidemiological
Surveillance System, including the laboratory network, and it will
support health sector reform, financing activities such as pilot
reform initiatives and human resources training.
</P>
<P>
With the project, spread of Chagas disease by insects and by
blood transfusions is expected to be stopped in five years.
</P>
<P>
The total costs of the program are 53.7 million dollars. The
IDB loan from the Fund for Special Operations is for a 40-year
term, with a 10-year grace period. It will carry a 1 percent
interest rate during the grace period and a 2 percent rate
thereafter.

<P>
OTTAWA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Canada's new housing price
index increased 0.6 percent between December 1997 and December
1998, Statistics Canada reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The federal agency said the index was the 22nd straight month
of increases after 31 months of decline. Between July 1994 and
January 1997, it declined each month, then started to rise.
</P>
<P>
The index, which uses 1992 prices as a base line of 100, stood
at 100.3 at the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
StatsCan said the changes last year varied considerably from
city to city in the country. Where the active Calgary market rose
6.8 percent, Victoria actually dropped by 7 percent and Vancouver
was off 5.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Between November and December last year, the national index
rose 0.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The federal agency attributed the modest increase last year to
attractive mortgage rates, an improved resale market and rising
levels of consumer confidence in Ontario province and on the
Prairies.

ADDIS ABABA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Foreign Minister
Seyoum Mesfin said Wednesday that Ethiopia has the capacity to
drive out the aggressive Eritrean forces from the occupied

<P>
Speaking at a press conference here, Seyoum said Eritrea's

exercise its right of self- defense.

"Ethiopia has no option but to fight the aggressor army, to
root it out of our own territory, and Ethiopia has full confidence
that it has the capacity and capability to achieve this
objective," he noted, adding that there would be no cease-fire
with Eritrea unless Eritrea withdraws or is pushed out of the
territory it occupied.

Seyoum said, "Ethiopia has always made it clear that it would
never allow the violation of its sovereign territory to be
rewarded and the dignity of its people to be insulted."
</P>

Eritrea has so far refused to respect the call of Africa for
the peaceful settlement of the crisis, he said. Ethiopia has
called on international community to impose economic and political
pressure on Eritrea to accept the peace plan of the Organization
of African Unity (OAU).

suffered terrible losses," Rwandan army spokesman Major Emmanuel
Ndahiro, told Rwanda News Agency (RNA).
</P>
<P>
Ndahiro argued that Rwandan troops in Congo (K) are deployed in
the east of the country and therefore, the report that Rwandan
soldiers were captured in an area where they have no presence is
totally false, said RNA, in a special dispatch to Xinhua based in
Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
"That claim is baseless," Ndahiro insisted. "The furthest we
have gone is Kisangani," he explained. A Kampala-based paper had
quoted a Chadian military officer as saying over the weekend that
121 Rwandan and Ugandan soldiers had been captured in Gbadolite,
in northern DRC.
</P>
<P>
The Rwandan army official also refuted reports that Rwanda and
Uganda walked out of the Lusaka peace initiative aimed at
brokering a cease-fire in Congo, and that they have given a green
light to the Congolese rebels they are backing to capture the
important towns of Mbuji-Mayi, in Oriental Kasai, and Lubumbashi,
in Katanga.
</P>
<P>
"This is mere propaganda which is aimed at making people
believe we are no longer committed to the peaceful settlement of
the Congolese conflict," Ndahiro told RNA.
</P>
<P>
He said both Rwandan and Ugandan delegations at the Lusaka
talks which ended over the weekend had insisted that the
Congolese rebels should be directly involved in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"If the rebels were included in those talks, this may make the
capture of the towns not even occur," he underlined.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda and Uganda have deployed troops in eastern and northern
DRC where they are supporting the rebellion fighting to oust
embattled President Kabila from power.
</P>
<P>
Chad, Zimbabwe, Namibia, and Angola, as well as a cocktail of
regional militia, notably Rwandan Hutu extremist ''Interahamwe''
and defeated former Rwandan government soldiers (ex-FAR), are
fighting for Kabila.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 10 (Xinhua) -- South African Deputy
President Thabo Mbeki and U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen
Wednesday discussed U. S. support for an African peace-keeping
force, South African Press Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The two men held a 30-minute meeting in Cape Town Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said after the meeting that the Organization of African
Unity had been dealing with the issue of an African crisis
response initiative and there was general agreement that the
continent's peace-keeping capacity had to be built up.
</P>
<P>
U.S. support for this initiative was very important, he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to talks earlier in the day between Cohen and his
South African counterpart, Joe Modise, Mbeki said the two men had
very good, warm and comprehensive discussions about U.S. and South
African military cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Modise announced after a meeting with Cohen that the U.S. would
offer assistance to a regional peace-keeping exercise code-named
Operation Blue Crane, which is scheduled for April in South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. will provide two C130 cargo planes to help some
cash-strapped Southern African Development Community (SADC)
countries bring their personnel to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The Americans would also help create a simulation center for
peace- keeper training.
</P>
<P>
Modise said he and Cohen discussed the issue of an African
peace-keeping force, but he emphasized that South Africa was
operating within the SADC and not in isolation on the question.
</P>
<P>
The two men also agreed that conflicts in Angola and the
Democratic Republic of Congo could only be solved through
diplomacy.

HARARE, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government will

Zimbabwean Minister of Education, Sports and Culture Gabriel

to host the finals.
</P>
<P>
"We are waiting to hear the deliberations at a CAF meeting
being held in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire by our delegation which is
also attending that meeting. We will preserve our dignity by

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Leader Stresses Marine Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Vice-President
Omar Ali Juma said Wednesday that strict measures should be taken
to reduce sea accidents.
</P>
<P>
Opening a two-day national maritime safety seminar in Zanzibar,
Juma observed that the increase of marine accidents in Tanzania
was a result of concerned authorities' failure in enforcing marine
regulations.
</P>
<P>
He called on the authorities to regularly inspect vessels to
determine their sea-worthiness, saying this would help improve the
safety standard of the marine industry.
</P>
<P>
According to reports from Zanzibar, the vice-president said
plans are underway to establish a maritime authority in Tanzania
which will have the mandate to inspect vessels and review the
marine laws so that they could meet international standards.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president urged ministries concerned with sea
transport to develop rescue services so as to make quick response
to marine accidents.
</P>
<P>
He said the sinking of Mv. Bukoba in Lake Victoria in May of
1996 which claimed more than 600 lives, was a proof that the
rescue services were "too poor" and need immediate improvement.
</P>
<P>
Marine accidents were frequently reported in Tanzania. Last
November, media reports said 10 Tanzanian fishermen got drowned
after strong winds hit their dhow near the Pemba Island.
</P>
<P>
Juma also appealed to businessmen to continue investing in
marine sector and urged them to launch speed boats services in
Lake Victoria to ease transport bottlenecks particularly in the
route between riparian regions of Mwanza and Kagera.
</P>
<P>
Omar further lashed out at the growing habit of youths who
stowed away on cargo ships bound for other countries in hopes of
having a better life.
</P>
<P>
He said the government will continue to take stern measures
against the culprits so as to discourage such activities. He
appealed to government and non-governmental institutions to
educate the youths on the problems they may encounter in stowaway
activities.
</P>
<P>
The seminar is organized by the merchant navy officers
association of Tanzania and funded by Zanzibar Port Corporation.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Foreign Minister
Seyoum Mesfin said Wednesday that Ethiopia has the capacity to
drive out the aggressive Eritrean forces from the occupied
territory.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here, Seyoum said Eritrea's
full-scale attack has left Ethiopia with only one option to
exercise its right of self- defense.
</P>
<P>
"Ethiopia has no option but to fight the aggressor army, to
root it out of our own territory, and Ethiopia has full confidence
that it has the capacity and capability to achieve this
objective," he noted, adding that there would be no cease-fire
with Eritrea unless Eritrea withdraws or is pushed out of the
territory it occupied.
</P>
<P>
Seyoum said, "Ethiopia has always made it clear that it would
never allow the violation of its sovereign territory to be
rewarded and the dignity of its people to be insulted."
</P>
<P>
Eritrea has so far refused to respect the call of Africa for
the peaceful settlement of the crisis, he said. Ethiopia has
called on international community to impose economic and political
pressure on Eritrea to accept the peace plan of the Organization
of African Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ethiopian government spokesperson Selome Taddesse
announced here Wednesday evening that fighting continues on the

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The breakaway organization of
the rebel UNITA Renovation Committee leader Engenio Manunvakula
apologized Wednesday over "the atrocity" committed by the rebel
organization's leader Jonas Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
The Renovation Committee of the rebel National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) said Angola should forget the
past and march ahead for the progress of the nation.
</P>
<P>
Manuvakula was elected UNITA chairman at the ninth special
congress of the organization held in mid-January, when Savimbi was
driven out of the party's leadership.
</P>
<P>
Manuvakula said the series of wars Savimbi launched was a
scheme by international forces, aiming at grasping power by their
agent in central Africa.
</P>
<P>
Some countries, especially some African countries had backed up
Savimbi during the 1975-91 civil war, he said, adding that the
same African powers are still supporting Savimbi with an eye on
the diamond resources in the country.
</P>
<P>
The UNITA Renovation COmmittee leader said that the Savimbi
group is occupying the diamond area in Angola and using diamond to
trade for military supplies.
</P>
<P>
The leader also said that the United Nations lack the ability
to carry out the Lusaka Peace Protocol signed in 1994.

<HEADLINE> German Metal Workers Strike Looming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February (Xinhua) -- Union negotiators for German metal
workers Thursday declared failure in wage talks with employers and
proposed a vote among rank-and-file members for an all-out strike.
</P>
<P>
Reports here said that wage negotiators for the metalworkers
union, IG Metall, in four regions, including the states of North
Rhine-Westfalia, Lower Saxony and Bavaria as well as the coastal
areas, have declared failure in the wage talks as their demands
for more pay were not met.
</P>
<P>
IG Metall has demanded a 6.5 percent wage hike for the country'
s 3.5 million metalworkers while the employers' offer was a 2.3
percent increase with an 0.5 percent annual wage bonus on a
company-by-company basis, depending on earnings.
</P>
<P>
Union officials, however, have criticized the bonus offer as an
attempt to undermine the practice of blanket wage accords.
</P>
<P>
Juergen Peters, deputy chairman of IG Metall, said in Leipzig
that strike action could get underway on March 1. Echoing union
chairman Klaus Zwickel, he said that Germany's largest union did
not want a strike, but that it would survive such a test of
strength.
</P>
<P>
IG Metall's executive board has decided to meet on Sunday to
decide whether to call a vote after the union's regional wage
commissions have outlined their stance.
</P>
<P>
Under current plans, the vote would take place from February 22
to 24. The union needs 75 percent approval for any strike action.
</P>
<P>
IG Metall organized its last major strike in 1995, causing
considerable damage to industries in the state of Bavaria before
a wage settlement was reached.
</P>
<P>
Amid the union threats, the employers' association,
Gesamtmetall, said that a wage hike between 2.5 and three percent
was "reasonable". Some top industrialists have issued warnings
against any strike action.
</P>
<P>
Hans Peter Stihl, president of the German Council of Trade and
Industry, and Hans-Olaf Henkel, president of the Federation of
German Industry, said that if a labor conflict broke out, they
would oppose any further roundtable talks led by the chancellor on
the envisioned "jobs alliance".
</P>
<P>
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder told the Munich daily Sueddeutsche
Zeitung that he did not see the jobs alliance in danger, no matter
what the wage dispute outcome was. He hoped there would be no
strikes and that a "macro-economically justifiable" wage accord
would be reached.

<HEADLINE> Bank of Thailand Lowers Target of Export Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Thailand (BOT) has
revised its export growth target this year from five percent to
below four percent, a level still high enough to help the economy
recover with growth of one percent, a BOT official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Kiettisak Meecharoen, assistant governor of BOT, said the
revision followed talks with a team of officials from the
International Monetary Fund, which is doing a quarterly review of
the Thailand support program in preparation for the seventh letter
of intent.
</P>
<P>
He said the downward revision of exports is due mainly to the
slowdown in global economic growth, primarily slower demand in the
United States and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Export prospects in the Asian markets have improved because
their economies have stabilized and shown signs of recovery.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese market, in particular, remains strong, he said.
</P>
<P>
As for the Thai economy, the assistant governor said there are
signs of improvements in some key indicators.
</P>
<P>
Sales of vehicles have climbed since October last year, so have
the sales of beverages and retail trade at department stores while
industrial output also posted increases.

WASHINGTON, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Three Republican senators declared on Wednesday that they
will vote against convicting President Bill Clinton of high crimes
and misdemeanors, becoming the first to break party lines as
closed-door deliberations in the impeachment trial stretched
through a second day.
</P>
<P>
-- The one-year investigation and impeachment against President
Clinton have reinforced negative trends in politics and the news
media, widened the gulf between Washington and the American people
and left the leaders of the country's major institutions on trial,
according to scholars, public opinion experts and political
analysts.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton is so furious at House Republicans over
his impeachment that he has vowed to mount an all-out offensive to
knock out many of his foes and win back the House for Democrats in
2000, his advisors say.
</P>
<P>
-- A Federal judge ordered pilots at American Airlines to
return to work on Wednesday, apparently ending five days of
widespread disruptions that had grounded more than 2,500 flights,
inconvenienced tens of thousands of passengers and left businesses
scrambling to find other carriers for their cargo.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal
</P>
<P>
-- A jury in San Francisco slammed Philip Morris Cos. with 50
million U.S. dollars in punitive damages on behalf of a former
smoker with lung cancer, serving abrupt notice on the tobacco
industry that it remains vulnerable to suits brought by individual
smokers.
</P>
<P>
-- The farm economy's problems are spreading, suggesting that
rural America is heading for a prolonged downturn and raising
speculation that farmers may seek another federal bailout.

The House set up a 17-member special committee to vet the bill

<HEADLINE> GITIC Bankruptcy Ends "Showcase" Company's Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The bankruptcy of the
Guangdong International Trust and Investment Corporation (GITIC)
marks the end of the mission of Guangdong's "showcase" companies
and enterprises will have to establish credibility on their own,
Vice-governor Wang Qishan said today.
</P>
<P>
Wang discussed the financial situation of Guangdong Province
with consular officials from 16 countries, in Guangzhou today, and
said that a combination of violations of standard international
practices in borrowing and lending, going against market rules,
resulted in the bankruptcy last month.
</P>
<P>
This means that the mission of "showcase" companies has come to
an end, he said, and in the future companies will have to
establish their credibility through market competition. At the
early stage of China's reforms and opening-up, he explained, they
were given unprecedented authority, but the credibility of "
showcase" companies was not credibility in the real sense, nor was
it the credibility of the local government, let alone state
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, many overseas financial institutions did not
follow accepted international practices in evaluating Chinese
companies and projects in giving loans to them, he said, and bet
their stake on guarantees, promises, and letters of support from
the local government, in direct violation of rules, and some
institutions even confused these promises with sovereign
credibility.
</P>
<P>
GITIC's bankruptcy was done in accordance with the law and it
exposed the confusion involved and, no doubt, both the borrower
and the lender have had to pay for their violation of regulations,
market rules, and standard international practices, he said. But,
a new type of credibility based on responsibility and rights has
arisen, which represents a milestone on the march toward a market
economy.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong was in the forefront of China's reforms and opening-
up over the past two decades and is ready to continue to be a pace-
setter in the country's economic transformation process, he said,
and as long as it sticks to that its attractiveness to investors
will increase.

<HEADLINE> Controlled Sales of Stock Ivory Permitted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Namibia and Zimbabwe are
allowed to each go forward with a single shipment of existing
ivory stocks to Japan, according to a news release from the
Nairobi-based U.N. Environment Program (UNEP) available here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The shipment is agreed by the Standing Committee of the
Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild
Fauna and Flora (CITES), the release said.
</P>
<P>
The money from the sales will go to support conservation and
community development projects in the two elephant range states,
said Klaus Toepfer, UNEP Executive Director.
</P>
<P>
The CITES Standing Committee met in Geneva from February 8 to
12, and agreed that conditions set for an experimental and limited
trade in ivory had been met in the case of two of the three
intended exporters and in the case of the recipient Japan.
</P>
<P>
The release noted that as a result, Namibia and Zimbabwe might
ship 13.8 tons and 20 tons, respectively, of their ivory stocks
to Japan on or after March 18, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Botswana, another African country that also wants to sell its
ivory, was found not to have satisfied one important condition
and will be subject to a further inspection mission by the CITES
secretariat's verification team before any final decision is made,
the release added.
</P>
<P>
The CITES Standing Committee's action is a follow-up to the
1997 June decision at the 10th meeting of the Conference of the
Parties to CITES held in Harare, Zimbabwe, to permit some highly
controlled export of ivory for the first time since 1989.
</P>
<P>
Concerning the decision would not have an adverse impact on the
elephant' s conservation status, the Standing Committee also
agreed that a comprehensive and rigorous set of verification and
control procedures be put into place before any trade could
resume, the released said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The China National Committee
on Aging (CNCA), China's largest non-governmental organization of
older people, attended a hook-up global video conference on aging
here tonight.
</P>
<P>
The conference was held at the Untied Nations Headquarters in
New York by the UN NGO Committee on Aging as part of the
International Year of Older Persons.
</P>
<P>
Kofi Annan, UN Secretary-General, and Kensaku Hogen, UN Vice

elderly. China's goal is to establish a support network for senior
citizens that provides medicare, helps them avoid loneliness
through study and entertainment, and encourages them to serve the
society by using their knowledge.
</P>
<P>
China will have 130 million people above the age of 60 by next
year, 10 percent of its population, and increased life expectancy
and other factors may bring that to 400 million in the mid-21st
century.
</P>
<P>

recent years has been the national law protecting senior citizens'
rights and interests that was passed in 1996 and CNCA has
cooperated with government departments to see that it gets
implemented.
</P>
<P>
Increasing public awareness of issues facing the elderly will
be another goal of the committee, he said, and CNCA will play a
role as policy advisor to help set up a security network for older
persons that can be linked to family, community, and government
efforts.

WASHINGTON, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Three Republican senators declared on Wednesday that they
will vote against convicting President Bill Clinton of high crimes
and misdemeanors, becoming the first to break party lines as
closed-door deliberations in the impeachment trial stretched
through a second day.
</P>
<P>
-- The one-year investigation and impeachment against President
Clinton have reinforced negative trends in politics and the news
media, widened the gulf between Washington and the American people
and left the leaders of the country's major institutions on trial,
according to scholars, public opinion experts and political
analysts.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton is so furious at House Republicans over
his impeachment that he has vowed to mount an all-out offensive to
knock out many of his foes and win back the House for Democrats in
2000, his advisors say.
</P>
<P>
-- A Federal judge ordered pilots at American Airlines to
return to work on Wednesday, apparently ending five days of
widespread disruptions that had grounded more than 2,500 flights,
inconvenienced tens of thousands of passengers and left businesses
scrambling to find other carriers for their cargo.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal
</P>
<P>
-- A jury in San Francisco slammed Philip Morris Cos. with 50
million U.S. dollars in punitive damages on behalf of a former
smoker with lung cancer, serving abrupt notice on the tobacco
industry that it remains vulnerable to suits brought by individual
smokers.
</P>
<P>
-- The farm economy's problems are spreading, suggesting that
rural America is heading for a prolonged downturn and raising
speculation that farmers may seek another federal bailout.

<HEADLINE> China Increases Efforts To Stop Smuggling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 11 (Xinhua) -- China dealt with 4,305 cases
of smuggling, with goods valued at 13.48 billion yuan, from July
to December last year, according to Liu Jing, deputy director-
general of China's General Administration of Customs.
</P>
<P>
After a major meeting in July to discuss smuggling, Chinese
customs, industry and commerce, and public security departments
joined hands to increase the anti-smuggling effort, Liu said today
in a report on the work at a public lecture.
</P>
<P>
According to Liu, judicial departments arrested 614 people
suspected of smuggling, 177 of whom were subject to penalties,
from July to December.
</P>
<P>
This helped offset the effects of the Asian financial crisis
and protect normal production and stimulated the domestic markets.
He said that the country's monthly tax revenues increased by a
large margin after July. In 1998, total tax revenues at the State
treasury reached 87.9 billion yuan, a 3 percent increase from the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
He said that there will be even tougher measures this year,
especially in the Zhujiang valley and Guangxi in south China,
where smuggling is still a very serious problem.
</P>
<P>
The public lecture was sponsored by the CPC Central Committee
Publicity Department and several other departments.

way a given situation can be defined as an emergency," Rakhmanin
said.
</P>
<P>
While "the maintenance, dissolution or amendment of an
alliance is up to its participants, in a new environment alliances
are logically expected to be purely defensive in nature, not to be
directed against third countries, not to disturb the regional
balance of force and, above all, to adapt to the post-
confrontational situation and the emerging climate of confidence",
the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, alliances "must be as transparent as possible and
avoid the expansion of their range of activities", he said.
</P>
<P>
"Alliances must not supersede or circumvent the chief
instrument guaranteeing international peace and security, the
United Nations and its Security Council," Rakhmanin said.
</P>
<P>
The Russian leaders "are convinced that the future lies with
the collective efforts of the international community to safeguard
peace and stability everywhere on the globe, rather than with
military blocs", he said.
</P>
<P>
"We expect the U.S. and Japanese to openly explain their
position," Rakhmanin said.

</P>
<P>
The spokesman told a weekly briefing at the Foreign Office that
an advanced Indian team will arrive here Friday to hold discussion

<HEADLINE> Interview: Pak Tries to Solve Child Labor Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government has
chalked out a four-pronged strategy to curb child labor in the
country, Minister for Labor and Manpower Sheikh Rashid said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We identify children involved in labor, rehabilitate them into
schools by bringing them into education network, provide some sort
of sustenance to their families and then we try to follow up the
efforts so that there is no relapse of the children into the
workplace," Rashid told Xinhua in an exclusive interview.
</P>
<P>
In Pakistan, children under the age of 14 are not allowed to
work in high intensity, poisonous or dangerous industries such as
carpet weaving, construction and transportation.
</P>
<P>
However, child labor constitutes about eight percent of the
country's total workforce which stands at 36 million, said the
minister, adding it is poverty and unemployment that force
children to go for labor.
</P>
<P>
According to local media reports, about one third of Pakistan's
population still live under the poverty line.
</P>
<P>
While providing jobs to children's parents, the minister said
the government is trying to give more incentives for education,
especially the primary education.
</P>
<P>
During the current financial year starting from July 1, 1998,
for the first time in the country's history, the allocation for
education by the government reached 2.8 percent of the Gross
National Product, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Ministry of Labor and Manpower is planning to set
up schools on the land to be provided by members of parliament.
Under this program, he said 200 schools will be established in two
to three years in the country.
</P>
<P>
A total of 67 members of parliament have so far identified land
and construction work will be gradually started, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that the association of carpet manufacturers is
undertaking a project to ensure child labor is removed from the
carpet manufacturing industry in another three to four years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, "we have had a special quarterly publication The
Future which lists the work being done by the provinces,
government agencies and different groups in helping us raise
awareness of the issues of child labor so that we can tackle the
child labor problem," Rashid said.
</P>
<P>
"It is not an easy job to control child labor," the minister
said, adding that child labor exists in many developing countries,
even in some developed countries.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani government is determined to eliminate child
labor, he said.
</P>
<P>
With the help of NGOs, he said the government is trying to
ensure children to get proper schooling and be removed from the
job market by providing jobs to their elders.

<HEADLINE> Fund Manager of the Year Awards 1998 Announced in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Two global fund management
groups have won the awards for the Best Performing Fund Management
Group of the 1998 Fund Manager of the Year Awards presented by the
South China Morning Post, in association with Standard &AMP; Poor's
Micropal.
</P>
<P>
This was announced on Thursday by the South China Morning Post,
a premier English language daily established in Hong Kong nearly
100 years ago, and Standard &AMP; Poor's Micropal, which offers the
most comprehensive performance measurement service available for
mutual funds worldwide with extensive data on more than 40,000
funds in 19 countries.
</P>
<P>
ABN AMRO Asset Management, headquartered in the Netherlands,
and Mercury Asset Management Ltd., based in London, were presented
the awards for Best Performing Fund Management Group for funds
over 3 years and 5 years respectively.
</P>
<P>
Mercury Asset Management also ranked 2nd for funds over 3 years
and Courtts Funds Managers Ltd. based in Britain won the 2nd and 1
st runners-up for funds over 3 years and 5 years respectively. The
2nd runner-up for funds over 5 years was Morgan Grenfell,
headquartered in London.
</P>
<P>
Other 55 certificate awards in 31 different categories were
also presented on Thursday. The annual event of the Fund Manager
of the Year Awards has entered its 7th season.
</P>
<P>
The method for assessing the funds, compiled by global mutual
fund data specialists Stand and Poor's Micropal, was based on
relative risk adjusted returns.
</P>
<P>
This method looks beyond simple out-performance and rewards
funds for consistency, and the ability to pull ahead of
established benchmarks.
</P>
<P>
Funds that moved steadily ahead of their peers were rewarded
over those that were more erratic, even if outright performance
was similar.
</P>
<P>
This methodology is used to emphasize the importance of
choosing funds which can provide steady long-term accumulations
rather than spectacular short-term gains.
</P>
<P>
The underlying calculations showed that bond and money market
funds produced solid performances which were consistent with
reasonable levels of risk.

The radio quoted Israeli police as saying they estimated that

But the police did not rule out the possibility that this could
be committed by suspected Jewish nationalists, who have killed and
wounded several Arabs living in east Jerusalem in recent months.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Edges Higher on U.S. Buying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar edged
higher Thursday as aggressive United States buying overshadowed
negative sentiment over the domestic employment data.
</P>
<P>
NM Rothschild &AMP; Sons senior manager foreign exchange Paul
Macarounas said a U.S. investment house was actively buying
Australian dollars just above the 64.50-U.S.-cent mark.
</P>
<P>
At the close of trading the domestic unit was at 64.52 U.S.
cents from 64.33 U.S. cents Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
During the day it fell to a low of 64.49 U.S. cents and reached
a high of 64.74 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
Macarounas said, "other than that it has been a very, very
quiet day and volume has been very light and the range has been
very tight."
</P>
<P>
He said that was largely due to a public holiday Thursday in
Tokyo. The Australian Bureau of Statistics reported a net
fall of 400 jobs, seasonally adjusted, in January from a
53,600-rise in last December.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment was steady at 7.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Most people were expecting a growth for jobs on the month of
15,000 or 16,000 so the lower jobs growth suggests possibly the
economy is slowing down and the possible chance for interest rate
cuts," Macarounas said.
</P>
<P>
At the close the local currency was buying 0.5700 euro from
0.5697, while it was trading at 73.65 from 74.11 against the
Japanese yen.

<HEADLINE> Australia's jobless Rate Holds Steady at 7.5 pct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Australia's jobless rate held
steady at a lower-than-expected 7.5 percent in January despite a
small drop in the number of people in work.
</P>
<P>
Against economists' expectations, the Australian Bureau of
Statistics (ABS) said in its report released Thursday that 400
fewer people were employed in January, bringing the total
workforce to 8.69 million people.
</P>
<P>
Analysts had expected the unemployment rate to edge up to a
seasonally adjusted 7.7 percent after it plunged to 7.5 percent -
its lowest level for eight years - in last December.
</P>
<P>
The bureau said that in January, the participation rate of
people in the workforce fell slightly to 63.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The ABS said a slight fall in full-time employment was offset
by a rise in part-time employment.
</P>
<P>
The jobless rate for men fell marginally to 7.7 percent while
the rate for women was steady at 7.2 percent, it said.
</P>
<P>
The number of long term job seekers - those registered as
unemployed for more than a year - rose by three percent to
378,304.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz said on Thursday that Iraq is determined to go on
confronting the U.S.-British violation of Iraqi airspace.
</P>
<P>
Aziz told reporters that the violations "are tantamount to an
aggression and a blatant breach of international law and
U.N. Security Council's resolution."
</P>
<P>
Iraq will continue with encountering this aggression
regardless of the sacrifices, he added.
</P>
<P>
Aziz's remarks came one day after an Iraqi civilian was killed
and several others injured when U.S. warplanes launched missiles
and bombs at the southern Iraqi city of Najaf on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Last month, U.S-British warplanes bombed three residential
quarters in southern Iraq, killing dozens of civilians and
injuring near 100 others.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led western allies imposed the no-fly zones in
northern and southern Iraq in the wake of the 1991 Gulf War with
a claimed aim of protecting the Kurds in the north and the Shiite
Muslims in the south from alleged Baghdad's suppression.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain bombarded Iraq in mid-December last year
to retaliate what they claimed Iraq's non-cooperation with
U.N. arms inspectors in charge of eliminating Iraq's banned
weapons.
</P>
<P>
After the mid-December attacks, Iraq announced that it would
not recognize the restricted zones and would fire at U.S.-British
jets patrolling the zones. Clashes between Iraqi air defense
forces and U.S.-British warplanes have since become commonplace.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has posted awards for anyone
who shoots down U.S.-British planes, or missiles or captures
their pilots.

<P>
MOSCOW, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Russia will launch the service
module of the International Space Station (ISS) in the third
quarter of this year, Russian Space Agency Director Yuri Koptev
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Koptev told a cabinet session on the country's space program
that budget funds permit the launch, but further performance of
the Mir space station depends on foreign investments, according to
Interfax.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that foreign orders with Russia's space program
could reach one billion U.S. dollars by the year 2000, up from 40
million dollars in 1993 and 880 million dollars in 1998.
</P>
<P>
"Russia is capable of maintaining its position among key
powers on the space market," he said.
</P>
<P>
Koptev also urged the government to invest more money in the
satellite projects, noting that about 75 percent of Russia's
operating space satellites have completed their life under
warranty and 50 percent have passed their service life.
</P>
<P>
"We must protect the interests of Russia in this technological
sphere," he said.
</P>
<P>
Russia has 131 spacecraft in orbit, including 43 civilian, 28
dual-purpose and 60 primarily military satellites, Koptev said.

<HEADLINE> Khatami Hopes New Millennium An Era of Amity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami expressed hope that the new millennium would be an era of
amity and understanding among all nations and governments with
various cultures and civilizations.
</P>
<P>
Khatami made the remark Wednesday night to foreign envoys in
Tehran on the occasion of the 20th anniversary of the Islamic
Revolution, the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He expressed regret that the second millennium, especially its
last century, has witnessed bitter events, and stressed that in
the 21st century, discriminations should be eliminated and
sovereign rights of nations should be recognized.
</P>
<P>
The third millennium should be opened with the motto of "real
peace" because it is only in this context that all human beings
will be respected and their rights will be preserved, the Iranian
President said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that peace and security have been consolidated in the
region and adherence to the policy of detente and dialogue has
brought regional countries closer together.
</P>
<P>
Khatami noted that an atmosphere of friendship and consensus
has prevailed over the region, saying that Iran's disputes with
other countries are being rapidly settled and improvement of
relations with Europe are taking momentum.
</P>
<P>
He said that by relying on the principle of mutual respect,
Iran is opening a new chapter in its ties with Europe, and the
same trend will be followed in its dealings with the world as a
whole.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed, "we strongly defend our interests and
reject relations with countries which are after our submission in
favor of their illegitimate interests."
</P>
<P>
Reiterating his call for dialogue among cultures and
civilizations, Khatami said that some of the biased foreign
judgments about the Islamic revolution are not due to hostilities
but rather misunderstandings of cultural backgrounds which should
be clarified through dialogue.
</P>
<P>
The initiative for dialogue among cultures and civilizations
is consistent with Iran's mentality and is within the framework of
its revolutionary principles, he added.

a claimed aim of protecting the Kurds in northern Iraq and the

</P>
<P>
On his expected visit to Turkey, the deputy premier said that
he would brief the Turkish officials on the use of the Turkish
Incirlik Air Base by the U.S. and Britain to attack Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey is a neighboring country, and we hope neighbors should
respect each other and do not let foreigner interfere in their
internal affairs," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the three panels formed recently by the U.N. Security
Council to review Iraq's obligations to the relevant
U.N. resolutions, Aziz said it was an act of procrastination aimed
at prolonging the U.N. sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"We do not see any benefit to the legitimate case of Iraq in
dealing with those panels," he added.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the U.N. Security Council agreed on forming three
panels to study the issues of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction,
Iraq's humanitarian situation and Kuwaitis and foreigners
allegedly detained in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
These panels are required to finish their work by April 15 and
make recommendations as to what more needs to be done in those
fields.
</P>
<P>

sustained damage due to heavy flooding that hit five villages in
Lasusua sub-district, South Sulawesi, Indonesia, in the last three
days.
</P>
<P>
According to head of the local social affairs office A. Rusman,
the flood also caused damage to tens of hectares of plantations of
cocoa, coconuts, sago palm and fishpond worth billions of rupiah,
Antara News Agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said a newly built bridge at the Timokari village was also
damaged during the floods which were caused by the incessant rain,
lasting for three days.

<HEADLINE> Defense Minister: Foreign Bases Possible in Azerbaijan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Azerbaijan will consider having
a Turkish, U.S. or NATO military base established in the country
in order to form a new balance of power in the region, Defense
Minister Safar Abiyev said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Obschaya Gazeta newspaper, Abiyev said
Azerbaijan wanted to "restore the military-strategic balance
broken by Armenia", Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
"All Russian military equipment supplied to Armenia will be
used in Nagorno-Karabakh if Armenia resumes military actions
against Azerbaijan," he said.
</P>
<P>
Russia has already indicated that arms supplies to Armenia
were conducted in accordance with bilateral accords and were not
intended for use against any third country.
</P>
<P>
Nagorno-Karabakh, an enclave inside Azerbaijan where the
majority of the population were ethnic Armenians, has been at the
center of a dispute between Azerbaijan and Armenia over the past
decade.
</P>
<P>
Violence erupted in the region after ethnic Armenians demanded
independence in 1988, claiming about 15,000 lives. Nagorno-
Karabakh declared itself independent from Azerbaijan in 1991, but
no country has formally recognized this "republic".
</P>
<P>
A cease-fire in 1994 has not failed to bring about a permanent
peace settlement to the dispute.
</P>
<P>
Abiyev said international inspections are frequently conducted
in both Armenia and Azerbaijan, but the inspectors "are not able
to control Nagorno-Karabakh and the six Azerbaijani districts
occupied by Armenian armed formations".
</P>
<P>
The defense chief said Baku considered the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization a highly reliable strategic ally.
</P>
<P>
During a recent visit to Turkey, he said he had "probed the
possibility for forging an Azeri-Turkish military union, similar
to the Russia-Armenian military treaty".

<HEADLINE> China Calls for Prevention of Arms Race in Outer Space </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- China has renewed its call for
the prevention of an arms race in outer space and the re-
establishment of the ad hoc committee on the issue in the
Conference on Disarmament (CD).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the CD plenary here on Thursday, Chinese Ambassador
Li Changhe reminded the conference of some new developments in the
area which have raised grave concerns.
</P>
<P>
He said that the recent announcement of programs to develop the
National Missile Defense (NMD) and Theater Missile Defense (TMD)
systems and the intention to amend and even withdraw from the Anti-
Ballistic Missile Treaty (ABM) "run counter to the trend of the
times" when the international relations should move towards
greater relaxation 10 years after the end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
"They are detrimental to the international efforts in arms
control and disarmament and may even trigger a new round of arms
race and break regional strategic balances in the next century,"
he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"As is known to all, some of the above mentioned missile
defense systems are to be deployed entirely in outer space or
target at objects in outer space and some will rely on space to
provide target information and guidance for ground weapon systems,
" Li said. "The ultimate consequence will be turning outer space
into a new battlefield and a base for weapon systems."
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, if any country insisted on amending or even
abolishing the ABM, thus having a free hand in developing and
deploying such missile defense systems, it would certainly upset
the global strategic balance.
</P>
<P>
"This cannot but raise grave concerns from the international
community and makes the prevention of an arms race in outer space
more relevant and more urgent," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Li urged the CD to "live up to its obligations and
responsibilities to address this important issue before it is too
late".

<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban militia
and representatives of opposition commander Ahmed Shah Massood
have held talks in Turkmenistan under the aegis of the U.N.,
diplomatic sources said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Taliban's senior official responsible for foreign affairs
Maukvi Abdur Rahman, currently in Turkmenistan, met with Masood's
delegation in Asghabad, the capital city, and the two sides
decided to continue the talks in the future, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
However, the sources gave no details about the talks.
</P>
<P>
It was the first high-level face-to-face meeting between the
Taliban and the opposition after the collapse of their talks in
Islamabad last May.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban, controlling about 90 percent of Afghanistan, have
been under tremendous pressure to start talks with the opposition
and find out a negotiated settlement of the long-standing crisis
in the war-shattered country, the source said. The militia had
been declining dialogue with their foes.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the sources said that the Taliban official met with
Turkmen Foreign Minister Sheikh Boris Muradov and discussed with
him bilateral issues focusing on the promotion of trade ties
between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> EDS-ICBC-Loans ICBC to Increase Project Financing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The Industrial and Commercial
Bank of China (ICBC) said today that it will extend more loans
this year to support the steady growth of the country's national
economy.
</P>
<P>
The ICBC plans to grant more than 100 billion yuan in project-
financing loans, the bulk of which will go to the state's key
highway construction projects, and telecommunications, power,
water and gas supply, medical care and public facilities in large
and medium-sized cities.
</P>
<P>
The bank will also commit itself to technical upgrading and
promotion of high-tech products while cutting loans for sunset
industrial, energy-consuming projects and projects that cause
environment pollution.
</P>
<P>
To improve the management of loans this year, the bank will
strengthen supervision on the credit funds and reduce non-
performing loans.
</P>
<P>
The ICBC, one of the leading commercial banks in the country,
extended 107 billion yuan in loans in 1998, a surge of 50 percent
year on year. Some 80 billion yuan of the loans went to
infrastructure construction and energy and raw materials
production.
</P>
<P>
The bank said loans granted to capital construction last year
amounted to 38.4 billion yuan, six times the 1997 figure.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises with ratings above A level absorbed 93 percent of
the ICBC's loans last year, among which AAA companies accounted
for 26 percent of the total loans.

of the Sybase Open Tennis Tournament for a series of "audible
obscenities" while fourth seed Michael Chang advanced to the
quarter-finals with a 6-4 7-6 (7-5) victory over Argentina's
Franco Squillari on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Chang will face Norwegian sensation Christian Ruud in the
quarter-finals, who took down young American Paul Goldstein 6-1, 7-
6 (7-4).
</P>
<P>
Eighth seed Ramon Delgado of Paraguay won his first-round match
5-7, 6-4, 7-5 over New Zealand's Brett Steven. Delgado is best
known for his upset of Pete Sampras at the 1998 French Open.
</P>
<P>
Agassi, defending champion and No. 2 seed in the tournament,
won the first set 6-0 over Cecil Mamiit. In a tiebreaker in the
second set, trailing four points to none, Agassi began cursing.
</P>
<P>
Linesman Al Klassen reported Agassi's comment to chair umpire
Steve Ulrich and Ulrich warned Agassi. But Agassi made another
comment as Klassen returned to his chair. This time, he was
penalized a point.
</P>
<P>
As Klassen returned to his chair a second time, Agassi repeated
his previous obscenity before ATP tour supervisor Tom Barnes was
called to the court who discussed with Ulrich and the latter
defaulted Agassi and awarded the match to his opponent.
</P>
<P>
Barenes said he felt sorry for Agassi but he should not violate
again after the umpire had assessed a warning and a penalty point.
</P>
<P>
Agassi won his first-round match easily Monday night over Todd
Woodbridge, and seemed to be heading for another easy win over
Mamiit when he made several mistakes to fall behind in the
tiebreaker.
</P>
<P>
Agassi could also face a fine, a loss of ranking points and a
loss of prize money earned at the Sybase Open because of the
default.

<HEADLINE> China to Closely Monitor Fireworks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese law enforcement
departments have been urged to expand inspections of fireworks
production, transportation and sales during the forthcoming Spring
Festival, the peak season for fireworks.
</P>
<P>
Twentyone explosions of fireworks since last December have
caused 96 deaths and injured 83 persons and 90 percent of the
explosions were attributed to illegal production and sales and
unsafe transportation of fireworks, according to a circular issued
by the Ministry of Public Security.
</P>
<P>
The deadliest of the 21 explosions, which occurred on January 9
in Jinchong Village of Toncheng City, Anhui Province, claimed 14
lives and injured three others.
</P>
<P>
"Measures to ensure the safe distribution of fireworks are far
from adequate in spite of ministry's November call for improved
security," according to the circular.
</P>
<P>
Local public security bureaus have been ordered to mount an
extensive campaign against illegal production of fireworks in
rural areas, and to cooperate with concerned departments to remove
hidden dangers in the market.
</P>
<P>
Fireworks have been an important part of Spring Festival
festivities in China for over 1,000 years. This year's Spring
Festival begins on February 16.
</P>
<P>
Major cities, including Beijing, have banned the use of
fireworks in an effort to prevent fires, serious injuries and
pollution. Nonetheless, fireworks are still a major part of
festivities in many areas throughout the nation during the Spring
Festival holidays.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The ratio of malaria detection
in Laos  in the 1997-1998 period declined by 2.4 percent compared
to the 1996-1997 period, according to a report of Lao official
news agency KPL reached here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
However, KPL said that malaria still caused high percentage of
mortality in Laos.
</P>
<P>
Children between five and nine are five times more vulnerable
to malaria than adults, according to the statistics of the Lao
Ministry of Public Health compiled during the period of 1997-1998.
</P>
<P>
The 1997-1998 statistics also showed that the number of malaria
cases was 71 per 1,000 persons per year, and 33,611 patients were
hospitalized, while 458 people died as a result of malaria.
</P>
<P>
Malaria, one of the most dangerous diseases over the past

<HEADLINE> Debate on Philippine-U.S. Accord Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The debate on the controversial
Philippine-U.S. Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA) continued in the
senate Thursday and focused on the relevance and practical value
of the 1951 Philippine-U.S. Mutual Defense Treaty.
</P>
<P>
The VFA, now pending at the senate for ratification,
constitutes part of the Mutual Defense Treaty's (MDT))
implementing scheme.
</P>
<P>
In Thursday's public hearing, critics of the VFA from a wide
range of non-government organizations, urged the senate not only
to junk the VFA, but also terminate the MDT, which they said
failed to strengthen the country's national defense posture since
its approval in 1951.
</P>
<P>
VFA critics said that there is no serious threat to national
security, and the so-called threat is just "a fabrication
orchestrated by certain officials."
</P>
<P>
But government officials, including Defense Secretary Orly
Mercado, Foreign Affairs Secretary Domingo Siazon and National
Security Adviser Alexander Aguirre, said that the MDT remains a
cornerstone of the country's national security.
</P>
<P>
According to its original schedule, the senate hopes to vote on
the VFA and dispose of it before it goes on recess for the Holy
Week next month.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine and U.S. governments reached the VFA a year ago.
Although U.S. President Bill Clinton has already signed it as an
executive agreement, the Philippine government submitted to the
senate for ratification last October.
</P>
<P>
Many Filipinos described some provisions of the FVA as
discriminatory or unconstitutional and demanded re-negotiations
over the agreement.

<HEADLINE> Tri-therapy Introduced in Rwanda to Fight AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The Rwandan National Center
for AIDS Control (PNLS) has introduced the tri-therapy to improve
the quality of life of HIV/AIDS sufferers in reducing the
mortality rates caused by opportunistic infections, Rwanda News
Agency (RNA) reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The RNA quoted Director of the PNLS, Innocent Ntaganira as
saying that the drugs known as AZT, EPIVIR, CRIXIVAN are imported
at a cheaper price.
</P>
<P>
"The three, which must be taken at a go, will cost 586.2 U.S.
Dollars per month per person, instead of 1230.77 Dollars they cost
at the open market,'' Ntaganira indicated.
</P>
<P>
The PNLS director regretted that the above price in private
drug stores in Kigali is too high, thus compelling patients to go
abroad for it.
</P>
<P>
"We want to stop these pharmacies from selling it because they
lack committed and qualified personnel to ensure medical and
psycho-social follow-up," said Ntaganira.
</P>
<P>
The director said that last year, the Rwandan Ministry of
Health had set up a technical committee which has been charged
with evaluating the feasibility of the introduction of these drugs
in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
There has been a step forward in the management of HIV/AIDS
infection, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the PNLS information officer, Jean Marie
Mudakikwa, AIDS is the second killer disease in Rwanda after
malaria.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that the most recent survey shows that overall HIV
 prevalence is 11.1 percent in the country. The youngest age
group of 12-14 years has a prevalence rate of 4.1 percent.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Laments Lack of Progress in Disarmament Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- United States Ambassador to the
Conference on Disarmament (CD) Robert Grey said here on Thursday
that he felt disappointed that there had been no progress since
the CD's 1999 session began on January 19.
</P>
<P>
"The CD now has spent a month wrangling about whether or not to
adopt a program of work which would enable the 1999 session to
begin where it left off in 1998," Grey said in his departing
remarks as the CD's president.
</P>
<P>
Grey said he had held bilateral meetings with as many
delegations as possible for the past month. Many bilateral
meetings, he complained, while privately encouraging, have yielded
no public results.
</P>
<P>
"We are not here just to talk," he said. "We are not here to
resolve regional disputes which are beyond the competence of this
conference."
</P>
<P>
"What we must do is to negotiate multilateral arms control
agreements. That, at the end of the day, is the reason we are here,
" the U.S. ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
Grey called on the CD to focus on the negotiation of a Fissile
Material Cut-off Treaty.
</P>
<P>
He told the CD that it also failed to agree on admitting five
new members.
</P>
<P>
However, Grey expressed hope that what he has done has laid the
ground for the success of his successor, Ambassador Rodriguez
Cedeno of Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
The CD, created in 1978, now consists of 61 members. It works
on the basis of consensus. The first part of the three-part 1999
session convenes between January 19 and March 26.

<HEADLINE> Botswana Grants Asylum for Namibian Illegals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Botswana has decided to
grant political asylum to 15 Namibians who crossed into the
country illegally to allegedly avoid persecution in Namibia, South
African Press Association (SAPA) reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Louis Selepeng, permanent secretary in the president's office,
said in a statement that the government asked the United Nations
High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) to resettle the 15 outside
Botswana.
</P>
<P>
"Whilst awaiting resettlement, the Namibians will be allowed to
remain in Botswana," he said.
</P>
<P>
They were free to move and there were no restrictions except
that they could not engage in any activities deemed as continuing
their political objectives against Namibia.
</P>
<P>
Among those granted asylum were former Namibian opposition
leader Meshake Muyongo, regional governor of the Caprivi area
Johannie Mabuku, national councillor Francis Sizimbo, and
traditional leader from the Caprivi area Chief Boniface Mamili.
</P>
<P>
The Namibian government claimed that the group was seeking the
secession of the Caprivi strip from Namibia.
</P>
<P>
Applications for asylum from the remaining 2,096 people who
crossed into Botswana were still being considered.
</P>
<P>
A refugee advisory committee, on which the UNHCR has a
representative, had completed its assessments of their
applications and it was now up to the Botswanan government to make
decisions, according to SAPA.
</P>
<P>
Selepeng said the Botswanan government remained committed to
the notion of voluntary repatriation as the most durable solution.
</P>
<P>
"We want the Namibian government to assure them of their safety
so they will return voluntarily," he said.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Urges Quick Confirmation of Cabinet Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada Thursday called on the Commission on Appointments (CA) to
speed up the confirmation of Cabinet secretaries, whose
nominations have yet to pass the scrutiny of the bicameral body.
</P>
<P>
In an interview here, Estrada stressed the important role of
the CA in determining whether his top-level appointees are
qualified or not to assume their posts.
</P>
<P>
"That's why there's the CA to find out really whether they are
qualified or not. These are mere questions and they want to know
if there is truth in those allegations," the President added,
referring to the rigorous process that cabinet members have to go
through to pass the CA wringer.
</P>
<P>
But he said that the CA should speed up the confirmation
process.
</P>
<P>
"They are all my cabinet members, they belong to my official
family, so I have to take care of them," he said.
</P>
<P>
The CA, which screens top-level appointees made by the
president, has yet to act on the nominations of Secretaries Mario
Tiaoque of the Department of Energy, Rey Antonio Cerilles of the
Department of Environment and Natural Resources, Gregorio Vigilar
of the Department of Public Works and Highways, and newly
appointed Secretary Felimon Uriarte of the Department of Science
and Technology.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, some members of the CA raised the question of fitness
of two cabinet officials to assume their respective posts, even as
the president continued to express his trust in them.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Industrial Production Index Down 7.2 Pc in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's Index of
Industrial Production was 144.9, down by 7.2 percent in 1998
compared with 156.1 registered in 1997, according to the
Statistics Department Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The decline for the year under review was solely due to the
drop of 10.2 percent in the index of Manufacturing Division to
148.7 against 165.6 in for the year 1997, the department said in a
statement here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The index of the mining division rose 1.1 percent to 123.6 in
1998 compared to 122.3 in 1997 while the index for the electricity
increased 3.4 percent to 173.0 from 167.3, it said.
</P>
<P>
In the manufacturing division, the department said, out of a
total of 23 major groups, only four -- rubber products, plastic
products, wearing apparel except footwear, and professional and
scientific, measuring and controlling equipment -- recorded higher
indices for 1998 while the rest 19 major groups registered lower
indices in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The department said the increase in the index of the mining
division for 1998 was due to the increase in the indices of tin
and crude oil while in the electricity division, the rise in the
index for 1998 was due to the increase of 3.4 percent in the
generation of electricity to 58,972 million kilowatt-hours in 1998
from 57,009 million kilowatt-hours in 1997.

<P>
NEW DELHI, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Japanese ambassador to India
Hiroshi Hirabayashi said here Thursday that Japan would enlarge
the scope of lending to India only after the latter signs and
ratifies the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT).
</P>
<P>
"Lending for basic human needs would be considered only after
India signs and ratifies the CTBT. No policy has been framed for
infrastructure lending yet," he said soon after he signed an
accord extending debt relief grant of 69 million rupees (1.66
million U.S. dollars) to India by Japan.
</P>
<P>
"We will be lifting ban on our economic cooperation loans and
grants, which are categorized as basic human needs after CTBT is
ratified," the ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
Basic human needs include education, environment, drinking
water and other facilities relating to human welfare. Japan had
frozen all lending to India soon after New Delhi conducted five
successive underground nuclear tests in May last year.

<HEADLINE> Singapore to Exert Utmost to Enhance Workers' Knowledge, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Prime Minister Goh
Chok Tong said his government will exerts itself to raise workers'
knowledge and skill with a view to increasing national
competitiveness and individual life-long employability as well as
to meeting the needs of the developed markets.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony of the Bukit Merah Skills
Development Center Thursday, Goh said the government will build
the framework for continuously enhancing workers' knowledge and
skills with a goal to train and retrain workers so that they can
continue to take on new jobs or enlarged duties, emphasizing this
is the essence of life-long employability and essential to help
the country's economy and workers to meet new challenge.
</P>
<P>
Noting the regional economic crisis will be with Singapore for
a few more years and his country has a window of three to five
years to restore competitive gap between Singapore and its
neighbors, the prime minister said the next step is to increase
productivity and upgrade capabilities following the implementation
of the government measures to cut production costs.
</P>
<P>
"This is especially important as we transform the Singapore
economy to a knowledge-based economy with products and services
that meet the needs of developed markets in Europe and the United
States," he said.
</P>
<P>
"If we want our wages to go up to these (developed) countries'
level, we have to match their workers in technical skill and
productivity," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"In the information and knowledge age, it is skill, knowledge
and capabilities, rather than abundant resources and cheap labor,
that will critically determine our competitiveness," he concluded.

<HEADLINE> Khatami: Rule of Law Strengthens Islamic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami on Thursday reiterated his emphasis on the rule of law,
terming it as the "most important slogan" of the third decade of
the Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
"The Islamic revolution will be strengthened with rule of law
in the country," Khatami told the grand rally in the Azadi
(Freedom) Square, western Tehran, marking the 20th anniversary of
the Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of Iranians gathered in the largest
square of Tehran to celebrate the anniversary of the 1979 Islamic
revolution led by late Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Musavi
Khomeini which overthrew the pro-U.S. shah regime.
</P>
<P>
Shouting slogans of "Death with the U.S.," " No talks with the
U.S.," " Lasting struggle against the U.S.," the crowd burned the
effigy of Uncle Sam and the U.S. flags in the square, an almost
ritualized action for like occasions.
</P>
<P>
However, reformist President Khatami focused his speech on
domestic issues, he even did not touch the name of the United
States in his speech.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the most important task for the government
in the third decade of the revolution is to push forward
political developments in the country to stabilize the Islamic
revolution.
</P>
<P>
Khatami termed the forthcoming elections for councils of
cities and villages slated on February 26 as an important step
for people's participation in the country's political affairs and
called on the people to help make the elections success through
their solidarity.
</P>
<P>
With the realization of the elections, the people's
representatives will have a major share in the state's affairs,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The reformists spearheaded by Khatami and the conservatives,
who now took most of the key posts of the cleric regime, have been
engaged in heated power struggle in face of the coming elections.
</P>
<P>
Terming the Islamic Revolution as one of the greatest events in
the century, Khatami said despite of all difficulties, economic
sanctions, the revolution remains strong and is entering the
period of stabilization.
</P>
<P>
Khatami admitted that the country is still facing various
difficulties, particularly economic problems caused by the fall
in oil prices in recent years.
</P>
<P>
"Of course our oil revenues have been halved, but with
God's help we will turn this weakness into a strength," he
said, referring to his plan to shift the country's oil-dependent
economy to non-oil oil economy.
</P>
<P>
Oil income now makes up some 80 percent of the country's
revenues.
</P>
<P>
He vowed that his government will make efforts to tackle the
mounting economic crisis.

<HEADLINE> Agassi Expelled from Sybase Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Andre Agassi was thrown out
of the Sybase Open Tennis Tournament for a series of "audible
obscenities" on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Agassi, defending champion and No. 2 seed in the tournament,
won the first set 6-0 over Cecil Mamiit. In a tiebreaker in the
second set, trailing four points to none, Agassi began cursing.
</P>
<P>
Linesman Al Klassen reported Agassi's comment to chair umpire
Steve Ulrich and Ulrich warned Agassi. But Agassi made another
comment as Klassen returned to his chair. This time, he was
penalized a point.
</P>
<P>
As Klassen returned to his chair a second time, Agassi repeated
his previous obscenity before ATP tour supervisor Tom Barnes was
called to the court who discussed with Ulrich and the latter
defaulted Agassi and awarded the match to his opponent.
</P>
<P>
Barenes said he felt sorry for Agassi but he should not violate
again after the umpire had assessed a warning and a penalty point.
</P>
<P>
Agassi won his first-round match easily Monday night over Todd
Woodbridge, and seemed to be heading for another easy win over
Mamiit when he made several mistakes to fall behind in the
tiebreaker.
</P>
<P>
Agassi could also face a fine, a loss of ranking points and a
loss of prize money earned at the Sybase Open because of the
default.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Economy on Track in 1999: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's economy is on track in
1999 due to the strict fiscal discipline, Kenyan Finance Minister
Simeon Nyachae has said.
</P>
<P>
It is the government expenditure-cutting in the budget that has
helped make the economy stronger, a Kenyan leading newspaper Daily
Nation reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In his mid-term report on the implementation of the 1998/99
budget, Nyachae said Wednesday that the government has sold about
2,453 cars out of the total 13,238 to reduce the cost of
transport. Ministries have received orders to dispose of more
vehicles while a further cut of the inventory is required.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the number of telephone lines has been reduced by 72
direct lines, while the number of mobile phones decreased and fees
on mobile phones limited to 10,000 Shillings (about 167 U.S.
Dollars) a month.
</P>
<P>
The minister announced that additional spending could only be
approved for buying maize and for the cost of the Constitutional
Review Commission.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government has satisfied all the conditions for
renewed aids granted by the International Monetary Fund (IMF),
Nyachae said.
</P>
<P>
An IMF mission is expected to visit the country at the end of
this month to review whether to resume talks on IMF loans.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's gross domestic product (GDP) growth dropped to 1.6
percent last year from 2.3 percent in 1997 due to the 1997
suspension of the IMF aid to the east African country.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has vowed to
eliminate by the end of next year iodine deficiency (IDD) which
has widely affected the health of people, especially women and
children.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Health Minister Tatu Ntimizi told parliament in central
Dodoma city Wednesday that to deal with the situation, a program
on adding iodine to salt has been launched by her ministry in
collaboration with the Ministry of Energy and Minerals and the
United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).
</P>
<P>
Iodine deficiency is one of major nutritional problems in the
country, which caused goiter, retardation of growth, mental
retardation, pregnancy complications and increased infantile
deaths, local media Thursday quoted the deputy minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
She said that production and marketing of salt which is not
iodated is illegal, noting that 10 percent of people in the
country cannot gain access to iodated salt, especially those in
the mountainous areas.
</P>
<P>
About a quarter of Tanzanians with IDD problems developed
goiter, manifested by swelling of glands in the neck, she added.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Calls on Eritrea to Evacuate Civilians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 11 (Xinhua) --The Ethiopian government
Thursday called on Eritrea to evacuate civilians from Battle
zones.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian Foreign Minister Seyoum Mesfin said Wednesday here
that Ethiopia would continue to fight until it regains control of
its territory.
</P>
<P>
The Office of Ethiopian Government Spokesperson Selome Taddesse
said, " Recent reports by journalists and the Eritrean government
have claimed that five civilians were killed in the village of
Laili Deda on February 9. The Ethiopian government sincerely
regrets these civilian deaths, if indeed such accounts are
accurate."
</P>
<P>
The Office said, "Ethiopia has never intentionally targeted
civilians. The village of Laili Deda is within the military zone
of the Badme triangle and close to the front line."
</P>
<P>
It said, "What is perhaps not realized is that the Eritrean
government themselves settled Eritreans in a tented camp in this
area last June, thereby putting the lives of anyone residing there
at risk."
</P>
<P>
"The Eritrean authorities must have been aware that a camp
adjacent to the military front would have been seen as a military
target," it added.
</P>
<P>
The Office also said that Ethiopian defence forces Wednesday
resisted Eritrean forces attempt to recapture positions they lost
in the last few days of fightings.
</P>
<P>
The Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the United Nations
Security Council earlier this week called on both Ethiopia and
Eritrea to immediately stop their renewed border fighting.

<HEADLINE> 21 Children Missing in Nepal Border Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-one children have
been missing in one year in the border areas of Ilam district,
eastern Nepal, The Kathmandu Post said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The figure may be much higher because a large number of missing
cases went unreported, the daily said, adding that the majority of
the missing children were aged between 14-16.
</P>
<P>
The growing cases of children missing have raised panic in the
border villages, it said.
</P>
<P>
Local police have drafted a report stressing the need to
generate awareness among the local people and make the security
system more effective, the English-language newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the Child Workers in Nepal Concerned Center recorded a
total of 123 cases of children missing including 27 abduction and
kidnapping cases while the police record showed that about 500
children were reported missing that year.

<HEADLINE> Israel Accuses Dutch of anti-Semitism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Israel's national airline
El Al is considering cutting back its flights to the Netherlands
because of the "anti-Semitic atmosphere" there, President of the
El Al Joel Feldschuh said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Transportation Minister Shaul Yahalom has also demanded
that the Dutch government take immediate action to stop the
attacks on El Al, a local daily Haaretz reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The responses were made following constant attacks in the Dutch
media against the El Al after it admitted recently that one of its
cargo planes which crashed into an Amsterdam suburb in 1992 had
been carrying hazardous toxic cargoes.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli crew on board the plane and dozens of local
residents on the ground were killed in the crash.
</P>
<P>
And there had been reports repeatedly saying that the area
witnessed a rising incidence of serious illnesses among its
residents during the past years.
</P>
<P>
While admitting that the plane was carrying hazardous cargo,
some 200 liters of chemicals, the El Al maintains that the cargo
was legal and that the company complied with all international
regulations and reporting procedures.
</P>
<P>
But it has been under heavy criticisms by the Dutch media.
</P>
<P>
The atmosphere in the Netherlands is very grave, Yahalom said,
saying it started with phone calls and anti-Semitic slurs.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Haaretz reported, a member of the Dutch
parliamentary commission investigating the crash exposed Wednesday
a recording showing that Dutch flight administration officials had
known about the cargo but decided to keep it secret.
</P>
<P>
In the recording, an El Al worker warned his Dutch counterpart
at the Dutch airport half an hour after the plane crashed that the
plane's cargo included "explosives, ammunition, poison and various
gases."
</P>
<P>
The recording then proceeded to a conference call that same
day between seven Dutch flight administration officials. They
decided to keep the information about the cargo secret.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng Stresses Grass Roots Democracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Democratic elections in China'
s villages have laid a solid foundation for the development of
democracy throughout the nation, according to Li Peng, chairman of
the National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
Democracy in villages should include democratic elections, as
well as democratic management and supervision, said Li during a
visit to east China's Fujian Province between February 4-10.
</P>
<P>
China has introduced a direct election system for village
committees which are grass roots organizations serving China's 900
million rural residents.
</P>
<P>
Li expressed great concern about the promotion of democracy on
the grass roots level during his fact-finding tour conducted in
advance of the annual plenary session of the Ninth National People'
s Congress, China's highest legislative body. The Congress is
scheduled to open in Beijing on March 5.
</P>
<P>
The main characteristic of the development of democracy is
based on grass roots democracy which is practiced by village
committees, workers' congresses in factories and neighborhood
committees in cities, said Li.
</P>
<P>
He said China should promote the development of grass roots
democracy, encourage public participation in democratic management
and improve public awareness of democracy.
</P>
<P>
Li attended a court session in Xiamen and noted that people's
congresses at various levels and related standing committees
should select and supervise cases with a great social impact in
order to ensure justice.
</P>
<P>
Li also visited factories, schools and families in both urban
and rural areas in order to determine the actual status of the
reform of state-owned enterprises, as well as efforts to re-employ
and ensure the basic living standard of laid-off workers.

</P>
<P>
He said that religious people also contributed to the fight
against last summer's floods, and that cash donations for this
purpose from religious circles surpassed 33.6 million yuan (4.2
million U.S. dollars) by early September last year.
</P>
<P>
"We shall further implement the central government's principles
and policies, and make greater efforts to safeguard social
stability and the unity of ethnic groups," Ye noted.

Committee, and the Bureau of Religious Affairs under the State
Council.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Fortress Unearthed in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 11 (Xinhua) -- An Egyptian archaeological team
has unearthed an ancient fortress built to protect Egypt's western
border, the Egyptian Gazette newspaper reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report said the Egyptian team excavated the fortress in
cooperation with a team from Liverpool University of Britain. But
it did not say when the two teams did the excavations.
</P>
<P>
Head of the Egyptian Antiquities Sector Mohamed Al Saghir was
quoted by the newspaper as saying that the fortress is situated at
Zawiet Om Al Rakhm in the western governorate of Matruh, 400
kilometers northwest of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
The fortress was set up within a series of similar
fortifications for defense during the reign of Ramsis II, who
ruled Egypt from 1304 B.C. to 1237 B.C. in the 19th Dynasty, Al
Saghir said.
</P>
<P>
It has silos made of mud brick and was covered with a layer of
gypsum, he said, adding that many earthenware pots were found
inside the fortress.
</P>
<P>
Excavators have also found houses, royal stamps and hair pins
made of bones, and unearthed stone remains that bear the name of
Ramsis II and his military leader Nebt Ra.
</P>
<P>
The fortress is considered to occupy one of the key positions
in a defense line introduced by the ancient Egyptian king to
repulse Bedouin attacks on the country's western borders.

<HEADLINE> Abdullah said to be for Strong Ties With Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's King Abdullah is
keen on maintaining close ties with Israel, local daily The
Jerusalem Post quoted a source close to the Israeli Defense
Ministry as saying on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The source said that Abdullah had visited Israel and held
secret talks with Israeli defense officials in the past year.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Abdullah had visited the Defense Ministry in Tel
Aviv twice, on one occasion he delivered a message to then Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai from late Jordanian King Hussein. But
the source declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
The strategic relations between Jordan and Israel have not
suffered any setback since Hussein died of cancer on Sunday, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah, then the commander of Jordan's Special Forces, had
invited Mordechai to secretly observe a training exercise. And
Mordechai was the first-ever Israeli general invited to observe an
Arab army in training.
</P>
<P>
Israel and Jordan signed a historic peace agreement in
1994. Since then, Jordan has been the closest ally of Israel in
the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah was sworn in as king on Sunday following his father's
death.
</P>
<P>
Hussein's funeral was also a chance for Mordechai to meet with
Abdullah and Mordechai was the only Israeli guest Abdullah
hugged. The two reportedly have forged warm ties since their
meeting in March 1997.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai, who is heading a new centrist party, will compete
with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for premier in the general
elections in May.

<HEADLINE> Longest-Held Arab Prisoner in Israel Back Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Mahmoud Sawarka, the
longest-held Arab prisoner in Israeli jails, has been set free and
returned to Egypt after a 22-year detention, the Egyptian Gazette
newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Sawarka, 69, came back to the Sinai Peninsula on Wednesday
through the Rafah border checkpoint, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
He is expected to be hospitalized soon after his return as,
according to his family, he is suffering from stomach ailments and
eye problems.
</P>
<P>
He was reportedly released under an order by Israeli President
Ezer Weizman as part of a wider review of the cases of Arabs and
Arab-Israeli prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Israel's move has been seen as an effort to ease the tensions
with the Arabs due to its failure to carry out the Wye peace
accord signed last October with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Israel should pull back from another 13
percent of the West Bank in three phases. But Israel suspended the
implementation of the agreement after the first phase of
withdrawal in early December.
</P>
<P>
Sawarka was arrested in 1977 for attacking Israeli forces in
the Sinai, which was then occupied by Israel, and sentenced to 45
years in prison. Israel withdrew from the Sinai in 1979 after
sealing a peace treaty with Egypt.

<P>
LAGOS, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Head of State General
Abdulsalami Abubakar has sent a special message to President Ahmad
Kabbah of Sierra Leone, reiterating Nigeria's commitment to peace
in that country.
</P>
<P>
Delivering the message to Kabbah in capital Freetown of Sierra
Leone Tuesday, Nigeria's Police Inspector-General, Alhaji Ibrahim
Ahmodu Coomassie said Nigeria will continue to explore diplomatic
resolution to the crisis in Sierra Leone while still pursuing the
military option, New Nigerian newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Coomassie said that his visit to Freetown is a follow-up of
his recent visit to Libya where he met Libyan leader Colonel
Muammar Qadaffi with a view to finding a peaceful resolution to
the Sierra Leone crisis.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Liberian President Charles Taylor Wednesday urged
Sierra Leonean rebel leader Foday Sankoh to take up the olive
branch lately offered by President Kabbah towards ending that
country's civil war.
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday, President Kabbah announced that he would allow
detained rebel leader Sankoh to meet face-to-face with the field
commanders of the rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF) and he
also agreed to hold direct talks with the rebel leaders.
</P>
<P>
CharlesTaylor's office said in a statement, "This positive
initiative on the part of the Kabbah government is the first step
towards achieving a realistic dialogue with the rebels."
</P>
<P>
Togolese Foreign Minister Joseph Kokou Koffigoh said Wednesday
that his country is willing to host the proposed peace talks
between Sierra Leonean government and the RUF rebels.
</P>
<P>
He said in Lome that Togo, which currently holds the presidency
of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), "has a
responsibility to seek peace in Sierra Leone."
</P>
<P>
Francis Okelo, special representative of the U.N.
Secreary-General Kofi Annan, has said that President Kabbah had
taken a "positve step" and that the ball was now in the rebels'
court.
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.N. Security Council will meet on Friday in
New York " to fully endorse (Kabbah's) statement and also take
stock of the humanitarian conditions in Freetown in particular,
which desperately need to be addressed."

<HEADLINE> Nepal to Host Socio-Economic Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The Federation of Nepalese
Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FNCCI) will host a
socio-economic summit on February 20 to formulate strategies for
the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
About 800 people including senior government officials,
political leaders, leading intellectuals, leaders of the business
community and trade unions will participate in the summit, the
first of its kind in the country, the FNCCI said.
</P>
<P>
It said that with the increased competition at the global
level, it is becoming essential and pertinent to discuss the
realities of the socio-economic characteristics of the economy.
</P>
<P>
During the last few years, there is an increased realization in
Nepal that national consensus on basic tenets of socio-economic
policy among various players should be reached.
</P>
<P>
"We feel that this is more important and relevant for a
transition economy like ours," the FNCCI said in a booklet about
the summit. "In response to this concern and to facilitate the
development of such consensus, FNCCI has decided to organize a
one-day Socio-Economic Summit Nepal-1999 with the theme 'Strategy
for the New Millennium.'"
</P>
<P>
Nepali Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala is scheduled to
inaugurate the summit while former Bangladeshi President Hussain
Muhammad Ershad, former Pakistani President Farooq Ahmed Khan
Leghari, former Indian Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral and
former Thai Prime Minister Anand Panyarachun will host the plenary
sessions and the valedictory session of the summit.
</P>
<P>
Four former ministers from India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and
Pakistan will also address the summit.
</P>
<P>
"A special focus of the summit will be to share experiences of
these distinguished speakers on the pertinent problems and issues
of Nepal," the FNCCI said.
</P>
<P>
As an umbrella organization of the Nepalese private sector, the
FNCCI has been actively involved in promoting socio-economic
development of the country through private sector initiatives.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz is expected to visit Turkey on Monday in a bid to
improve bilateral relations between the two neighboring countries,
said a source of Turkish Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The Daily News quoted the source, who declined to be named, on
Thursday as saying that, at the invitation of Turkish Prime
Minister Bulent Ecevit, Aziz's visit is a "very important"
development when the tense situation in Iraq is continuing.
</P>
<P>
Sabah daily, one of the largest newspapers in Turkey, also
reported on Thursday that "Aziz's coming to Ankara is more
important than its results."
</P>
<P>
"At a time when Washington is trying to weaken the Iraqi regime
with air attacks, this invitation does not seem to please the
United States," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. embassy officials in Ankara has said that they would hope
that the Turkish government will take the opportunity to stress
again to Aziz the need for Iraq to comply with the relevant United
Nations Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.' use of Incirlik Air Base in Adana, southern Turkey,
in patrolling the two no-fly zones in northern and southern Iraq
has been a major dispute between Turkey and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
After the four-day U.S.-British air strike on Iraq last
December, the U.S. and Britain have launched waves of bombings and
strikes on Iraqi targets recently. Many of the warplanes involved
took off from their Turkish base.

<HEADLINE> Longest-Held Arab Prisoner in Israel Back Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Mahmoud Sawarka, the
longest-held Arab prisoner in Israeli jails, has been set free and
returned to Egypt after a 22-year detention, the Egyptian Gazette
newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Sawarka, 69, came back to the Sinai Peninsula on Wednesday
through the Rafah border checkpoint, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
He is expected to be hospitalized soon after his return as,
according to his family, he is suffering from stomach ailments and
eye problems.
</P>
<P>
He was reportedly released under an order by Israeli President
Ezer Weizman as part of a wider review of the cases of Arabs and
Arab-Israeli prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Israel's move has been seen as an effort to ease the tensions
with the Arabs due to its failure to carry out the Wye peace
accord signed last October with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Israel should pull back from another 13
percent of the West Bank in three phases. But Israel suspended the
implementation of the agreement after the first phase of
withdrawal in early December.
</P>
<P>
Sawarka was arrested in 1977 for attacking Israeli forces in
the Sinai, which was then occupied by Israel, and sentenced to 45
years in prison. Israel withdrew from the Sinai in 1979 after
sealing a peace treaty with Egypt.

<HEADLINE> EDS-China Investment Abroad Leading Manufacturers Increase Overseas Investments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 11 (Xinhua) -- An increasing number of major
Chinese electrical appliance and machinery manufacturers have
increased investments abroad, according to the Ministry of Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC).
</P>
<P>
A recent MOFTEC report indicated that well-known companies such
as the First Automobile Works Group based in northeast China's
Jilin Province, as well as the Hai'er Group and Little Swan Group,
both of which manufacture household appliances ranging from
refrigerators to air conditioners, and several motorcycle
producers have led the nation in overseas investments in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
Related companies have not only sparked fierce competition on
the domestic market, but have also tapped overseas markets in
order to take full advantage of new business opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Chinese companies have established over 5,600 projects in more
than 160 countries and regions in Asia, Africa, Latin America,
Eastern Europe and Central Asia. The projects involve total
investments of over nine billion U.S. dollars, with contracted
investments from the Chinese side accounting for 6.33 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The wide-ranging projects cover resources development,
processing and assembly, transportation, engineering construction,
pharmaceuticals, tourism and consulting services, in addition to
other areas common to the trade sector.
</P>
<P>
China has significantly improved the technical level for
overseas investments in recent years. More Chinese companies have
established overseas plants to produce computer disks, movements
for wristwatches and other sophisticated equipment.
</P>
<P>
According to the ministry, Shanghai companies have invested in
52 productive projects in South Africa, with approximately half of
them currently in operation.
</P>
<P>
"China will continue to formulate policies to encourage
qualified firms to invest abroad," according to one MOFTEC
official. "We will ensure China's overseas investments proceed in
a reasonable manner."

<HEADLINE> EDS-Illegal Freight Agents Abolished MOFTEC Abolishes Illegal Freight Agents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 11 (Xinhua) -- China's Ministry of Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) recently abolished 19
companies which did not have approval certificates from
international freight forwarding agents.
</P>
<P>
This was another major step in the campaign that began last
October to crack down on illegal operations and improve business
operations in the international freight forwarding market, Wang
Faxing, director general in charge of transportation at MOFTEC,
said today.
</P>
<P>
Prior to this latest move, the ministry had put 19 other agents
out of business last year, Wang added.
</P>
<P>
Local governments and departments of foreign trade, customs,
commerce and industry, and taxation have acted jointly to shut
down and fine other companies and individuals involved in illegal
operations.
</P>
<P>
With these measures, market order has been improved and the
volume of business for legal agents has been increased, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the country's international freight forwarding
industry adopted a special invoice on January 1, he said, adding
that the ministry is drawing up a new regulation on bill of lading,
and plans to strengthen annual examinations to create a favorable
transportation environment for the development of foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
China has now approved 1,542 international freight-forwarding
enterprises, 444 of which are Sino-foreign joint ventures. These
enterprises account for 80 percent of the country's import and
export transportation.

<P>
KAMPALA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Angola has accused Uganda and
Rwanda of backing Jonas Savimbi's National Union for Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
The move of Uganda and Rwanda is to destabilize central Africa
and is putting international security in danger, Ugandan newspaper
Monitor Thursday quoted Angolan Ambassador to the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC) Joao Batista Mawete as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan ambassador said Wednesday that there are hundreds
of Rwandans and Ugandans in the ranks of the Angolan rebel
movement and UNITA men had received training in the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Kigali and Kampala governments are supplying
arms to the Angolan rebels.
</P>
<P>
However, Uganda has on more than one occasion said that it is
not supporting the UNITA, nor is it linked to the Angolan
rebellion in any way.
</P>
<P>
Angola is among the main military backers of DRC President
Laurent Kabila's government against the rebels who control the
eastern part of the country with allegedly support from Rwanda and
Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Uganda has admitted its military presence in eastern DRC, but
said it is to protect the safety of its borders against possible

BEIJING, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Agricultural experts today
suggested that the Chinese consume more milk products to build up
health and promote the development of the dairy industry.
</P>
<P>
China's per capita consumption of milk now stands at six
kilograms a year, only one-fifteenth of the world average,
according to statistics provided by the Ministry of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
"In terms of nutrition, what Chinese people lack in their diets
can be found in diary products," said Jia Youling, director of the
ministry's animal husbandry and veterinary bureau.
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organization has listed the per capita
consumption of diary products as one indicator of a country's

</P>
<P>
An expert from the National Animal Husbandry and Veterinary
Service said that China should encourage its children to develop
the habit of drinking milk.
</P>
<P>
Northeast China's Liaoning Province is considering providing
milk to children at their schools, with the support of the local
government.

LUSAKA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The security of the banking

organized criminals who seek to clean their dirty money in the
country, a Zambian minister has said.

<P>
Addressing an anti-money laundering workshop in Lusaka

Kalumba said.

Zambia must arrest this scourge now, the Post newspaper
Thursday quoted Kalumba as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The instrument for this is the Prevention of Money Laundering
Bill," he added.
</P>
<P>
Money laundering is like a cancer to good economics and a
sabotage that undermines the efforts of decent hard working
Zambians, the minister stressed.

KAMPALA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government has
denied the Zambian newspaper report that Uganda had imported a
large shipment of weapons and supplies.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan State Minister of Regional Cooperation, Amama Mbabazi

Mbabazi described as not true the Zambian independent newspaper

Uganda is one of the regional countries involved in the war in

<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Attorney General Elyakim Rubinstein announced Wednesday that
he is opening an investigation into the verbal attacks on Supreme
Court President Aharon Barak launched by the ultra-Orthodox, who
called him a "Jew-baiter" and "anti-Semite."
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Former presidents Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres negotiated
with the Palestine Liberation Organization as far back as 1988,
when they were serving as defense and foreign ministers in the
national unity government headed by Yitzhak Shamir.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations took place in Paris in August and September of
1988, some nine months after the Palestinian uprising broke out
and two months before Israel's general elections.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Israel Wednesday released one of the longest-serving Arab
security prisoners, convicted Egyptian spy Mohammed Suleiman
Sawarka, who was sentenced to life in prison in 1977 for planting
a land-mine which killed an Israeli soldier in the Sinai.
</P>

This was seen as a gesture to improve the chance that Egypt
will release Israeli spy Azzam Azzam.

TIRANA -- Albanian Prime Minister Pandeli Majko suggested that
all Albanians in the Balkan region are entitled to organize
themselves for collective defense.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference Tuesday, Majko said the peace
talks being held in Rambouillet, near Paris, is only the first
step in solving the Kosovo problem, not a final formula. He said
withdrawal of Serbian troops from Kosovo province should top any
recipe for the issue. (Albania-Balkans)

PANAMA CITY -- The United States reiterated its commitment to
the 1977 Torrijos-Carter Treaty that obliges it to withdraw all
troops from Panama and to transfer control of the Panama Canal to
the Panamanian government by the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Colonel David J. Henter, a senior officer of the U.S. Southern
Command, made this statement at a press conference here Wednesday.
By December 31, 1999, the U.S. will remove all military personnel
and their dependents from Panama's territory and hand over control
of the canal to Panamanian authorities on time, said Henter,
adding that the U.S. pullout began in 1979 and now the number of
the military staff has decreased from 10,200 to less than 4,000. (

The car was so badly damaged that policemen had to cut through
it with an electric saw to remove the badly mutilated bodies.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The Kenya's Parliamentary
Anti- Corruption Select Committee has asked Kenyans to help it
identify key perpetrators and beneficiaries of corruption, local
media reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The committee Wednesday appealed the public to send it before
March 15 memoranda showing names of perpetrators and beneficiaries
of corruption, description of the corrupt transaction and
practices and any available documentary evidence to support the
allegations.
</P>
<P>
The committee's chairman Musikari Kombo said that the memoranda
should also bear the senders' names, address and, where possible
their telephone numbers.
</P>
<P>
Kombo also made known to the public of his committee's address
and fax number for the senders of written information.
</P>
<P>
He said that Kenyans were the most taxed in Africa and that
one-third of the total income earned was paid back to the state in
taxes.
</P>
<P>
"Yet only 35 percent ends up in the treasury and is available
for public service, 65 percent of all taxed paid in Kenya ends up
in the pockets of individuals," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that his committee had already studied and investigated
the causes, nature, extend and impact of corruption which is the
first term of reference.
</P>
<P>
The second mandate is to identify the perpetrators and
beneficiaries of corruption, to recommend immediate effective
measures and to recover public property corruptly appropriated.
</P>
<P>
A draft bill providing for stiff penalties on all
corruption-related offenses will be ready in September this year.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' San Miguel Makes Profits in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Despite the Asian financial
crisis, the Philippines' food and beverage giant -- San Miguel
Corporation posted a consolidated net income of 24.4 billion pesos
(633 million U.S. dollars) in 1998, the company said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
San Miguel Senior Vice President Albert M. de Larrazabal told a
press conference here Thursday afternoon that the company's
consolidated sales last year rose by 16.5 percent to 78.2 billion
pesos (2 billion dollars) from 67.1 billion pesos (1.7 billion
dollars) in 1997.
</P>
<P>
But the company's total sales volume grew by only 2 percent
"against the backdrop of continuing economic difficulties," he
said.
</P>
<P>
De Larrazabal said that operating profits improved by 12.6
percent last year despite higher costs, currency volatility and
weak consumption growth in the Asian region.
</P>
<P>
The company fared well in 1998, driven by the strong
performance of its domestic operations, he said.
</P>
<P>
"As a result of the group-wide effort to conserve financial
resources, and improve capital and asset productivity, San Miguel
Corporation ended the year with a much stronger financial
position," he said.
</P>
<P>
De Larrazabal said debt-to-equity ratio improved to 0.86 from
1.11 in 1997, current ratio improved to 2.97 from 1.31 in 1997,
and return on equity was 42.2 percent compared to only 6.6 percent
in 1997.

BEIJING, February 11 (Xinhua) -- China's State Environmental
Protection Administration (SEPA) has asked local governments to
enhance efforts on prevention of pollution accidents during the
Chinese Lunar New Year period to be celebrated in mid-February.
</P>
<P>
The SEPA said in a circular that environmental departments at
all levels should take preventative measures according to the
pollution situation in their own administrative regions and make
plans for emergency actions.
</P>
<P>
"When accidents happen, leading environmental officials should
be at the site and strengthen inspection so as to prevent
expansion of pollution," the circular said.
</P>
<P>
The SEPA asked environmental departments to have officials on
duty around the clock.
</P>
<P>
The administration stressed that severe punishment should be
meted out to the enterprises and people who cause pollution
accidents.
</P>
<P>
"Departments or officials who conceal pollution facts or do not
strictly enforce environmental laws will also be punished," the
circular said.
</P>
<P>
Some 400,000 citizens in east China's city of Xuzhou suffered
from drinking water shortage because of pollution accidents before

KATHMANDU, February 11 (Xinhua) -- China Thursday handed over
to Nepal sports facilities constructed under its grant assistance,
which are part of the infrastructure for the 8th South Asian
Federation Games.
</P>
<P>
The facilities include swimming complex, shooting range,
synthetic tracks and illumination, scoreboard, broadcasting and
public address systems.
</P>
<P>
The sports facilities project in Kathmandu started on March 20,
1998 and was completed on February 6, 1999. The total investment
of the project was about 15.3 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of the Nepali Ministry of Youth, Sports and Culture
Biswa Nath Sapkota and Chinese Ambassador to Nepal Zeng Xuyong
signed a certificate in this regard on behalf of their respective
governments.
</P>
<P>
Secretary Sapkota said that the facilities of world standard

<HEADLINE> EDS-Chinese-English-Study English Still Chinese Favorite Foreign Language </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 11 (Xinhua) -- A national survey has found
that about 70 percent of urban Chinese have studied the English
language, and English remains the first choice of foreign language
students in China.
</P>
<P>
Japanese was the second most favored foreign language,
replacing Russian which had the majority of learners in the 1950s
and 60s, according to the survey which was jointly conducted by
Chinese and Japanese researchers among 3,000 residents in 100
cities.
</P>
<P>
As for the native language, 80 percent of urban Chinese have
mastered and frequently speak putonghua, also known as mandarin,
the official dialect among the more than 70 Chinese dialects.
</P>
<P>
More than 90 percent of young people aged 15-20 are able to
speak putonghua, compared with 46 percent of people over 60. These
results indicate that most people learned putonghua at school or
after work, according to a report in today's China Youth Daily.
</P>
<P>
Over 95 percent of those polled consider putonghua essential
for communicating in China.
</P>
<P>
Encouraging the use of the official putonghua speech, whose
pronunciation is based on the Beijing dialect with a vocabulary
formed mainly of other northern China dialects, was begun after
the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949.
</P>
<P>
However, it will still take some time before the entire country
is adept at using the standard language since many dialects still
dominate the daily life throughout China even in the economically
developed eastern and southern regions, said the report.
</P>
<P>
"Local residents in those areas, such as Guangdong, Jiangsu,
and Fujian provinces and the city of Shanghai, seem to gain a
sense of superiority by speaking their own dialects," the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The survey was jointly conducted by the Journalism School under
People's University of China and a national language research
institute in Japan.

<HEADLINE> Lawyers Urge Legislation for Y2K Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Lawyers in Beijing have called
on relevant judicial and government departments to issue a law or
regulations to settle the legal conflicts concerning the Year 2000
(Y2K) problem.
</P>
<P>
"The Y2K problem, which has already begun to throw up glitches
even before the year 2000 arrives, is not only a technical issue
but also a matter of political and social concern," said Chen
Jihong, a lawyer from the Beijing Gaopeng Law Office.
</P>
<P>
"The effect of the Y2K problem may be greater than we have
imagined, especially in the fields of national defense, finance,
telecommunications, transport and electricity , which are reliant
on computer operations," Chen and his colleagues said in an
interview with the Legal Daily.
</P>
<P>
Various mishaps involving the Y2K bug have already happened in
China and overseas, including the wiping of credit card records,
medical accidents and failures in production lines, according to
the paper's report.
</P>
<P>
"China must be legally as well as technically prepared to solve
these problems to guarantee a stable social situation," Chen
added.
</P>
<P>
He went on to explain that since computer operations and
electronic data exchanges are widely used in big and middle-sized
enterprises in China, regulations which enable them to share
information about solutions to the Y2K problem are badly needed.
</P>
<P>
The United States has enacted an act for such sharing of
information which was put into effect on October 19, 1998.
</P>
<P>
"Only with the help of the law can China deal effectively with
the Y2K problem and reduce its potential mischief making to a
minimum," Chen said.

The government also plans to establish a National Water and
Sanitation Council to promoted the reform in the sector.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Philippines Works Out Strategy to Promote Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has
worked
out new strategies to make tourism a major economic sector and
help the
Philippines catch up with other Asian countries in the domestic
and
foreign markets.
</P>
<P>
"The Philippines is positioned at the epicenter of global
travel and
tourism growth and development... Yet among ASEAN countries, the
Philippines come in a poor fifth to Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia
and
Indonesia," said Tourism Secretary Gemma Cruz Araneta in a speech
published here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In her speech, Araneta revealed the following six major
strategies to
promote the country's tourism sector:
</P>
<P>
-- A combination of the niche and mass market strategies to
develop
both special interest tourism and vacation resort destinations
oriented
to both domestic and foreign markets.
</P>
<P>
-- An institutional streamlining of tourism management to
ensure the
changes necessary for long-term sustained growth.
</P>
<P>
-- Equal focus on resort, cultural and heritage tourism.
</P>
<P>
-- A cluster development approach based on the gateway and
satellite
destination concept -- to develop destinations in Luzon, Visayas
and
Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
-- A balanced development of domestic and foreign markets.
</P>
<P>
-- An improvement of support system and services, such as
transport
services, ground infrastructure, existing tourism plan and overall
peace
and order climate in the country.
</P>
<P>
The secretary said that the government will also focus on
developing
community-based eco-tourism and a nationwide scale cultural
tourism.
</P>
<P>
Personal consumption on travel and tourism in the country grows
at 6.5
percent yearly, and will nearly double over the next decade, she
said.
</P>
<P>
She said that travel and tourism contributed 8.7 percent of
gross
domestic product (CDP) in the Philippines as of 1997 and would
grow more
than two full percentage points to 10.9 percent by 2007.
</P>
<P>
In employment terms, tourism generates 2.3 million jobs or 8.7
percent
of the country's work force, and is expected to add 1.4 million
new jobs
by 2007, the secretary said.

<HEADLINE> EDS-Adult-Higher Education Institutions of Adult Higher Education to Enroll 900,000 Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese institutions of adult
higher education are expected to enroll some 900,000 students this
year, and the exam for candidates will be held on May 8, the
Ministry of Education said today.
</P>
<P>
These schools are mainly for people who have jobs, and adult
higher vocational institutions also enroll graduates from
polytechnic schools, adult secondary schools, and vocational high
schools.
</P>
<P>
A ministry notification issued today said that those who want
to pursue advanced studies at these institutes must have completed
their high school education or have two years of working
experience and hold a diploma from a professional school.
</P>
<P>
Officials at the ministry disclosed that national model workers
will be admitted to pursue their studies without taking the exam.
Consideration will be also given to exam participants over 25
years old and those applying for fields of study which would lead
to arduous working conditions.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has asked educational departments at all levels to
strengthen management and ensure the quality of enrollment in
these programs.

BEIJING, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue said here on Thursday afternoon that
foreign powers should not interfere in the domestic issue of the
Hong Kong court ruling on the right of abode of Hong Kong
residents' children born on the mainland.
</P>

The spokeswoman said at a routine news briefing that the
ruling of the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal on the right of
abode of Hong Kong residents' children born on the mainland and
other relevant questions are "purely China's domestic issues."
</P>
<P>
She made the remarks in response to a question on the comments

<HEADLINE> CITES Permits Experimental Ivory Trading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The Convention on International
Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) has granted Zimbabwe and
Namibia permission to engage in experimental ivory trade with
Japan within their declared quotas.
</P>
<P>
Acting CITES Secretary-General Reuben Olembo said in a
statement issued here Wednesday that the convention's standing
committee had taken important steps toward agreeing on a limited
experiment of trade in African elephant ivory to support
conservation and community development projects in Zimbabwe,
Namibia and Botswana.
</P>
<P>
"Namibia, Zimbabwe and Japan fully meet the conditions on
enforcement and ivory control set down by the last conference of
CITES Parties," Zimbabwe's Herald newspaper Thursday quoted the
statement as reporting.
</P>
<P>
After full and careful consideration of the report from the
secretariat and thorough discussion, the CITES standing committee
had decided that Namibia, Zimbabwe and Japan fully meet the
conditions of enforcement and ivory control set down by the last
Conference of Parties, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Botswana also met the conditions, but the standing committee
said there was need for a further visit by the CITES secretariat
verification team to Botswana to confirm that further improvements
had been put in place.
</P>
<P>
At the last CITES conference held in Harare in June 1997,
Botswana's declared quota of raw ivory to be traded under
experimental trade is 25.3 tons. Namibia is 13.8 tons and
Zimbabwe 20 tons.

<P>
Caracas, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Deon Burton, one of the heroes
of Jamaica's World Cup qualifying campaign, headed in a cross by
Paul Gall in the 82nd minute, saving Jamaica from losing a home
friendly with Costa Rica on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Gerald Drummond scored a header in the 35th minute for Costa
Rica and the visitors dominated most of the match, almost
finishing Jamaica's record of 37 home games without a loss.
</P>
<P>
Drummond missed a golden chance in the eighth minute when he
was sent clear by midfielder Rolando Fonseca, with advancing
goalkeeper Aaron Lawrence beaten.
</P>
<P>
Jamaica nearly broke the deadlock in the 27th minute, but Costa
Rican goalkeeper Erick Lonnis luckily saved Andy Williams' shot.
</P>
<P>
Drummond grasped a chance 10 minutes before the interval, his
header flying into the near post.
</P>
<P>
The striker also came close to scoring twice in the second half.
His 20-yard shot in the 64th minute was tipped over the crossbar
by Lawrence, and in the 80th minute he eluded two defenders and
Lawrence, but his tame shot went just wide.
</P>
<P>
Jamaican Substitute Deon Burton leveled the score with a header
in the 82nd minute, saving Jamaica's home record.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia, Senegal Sign Investment Guarantee Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 11 (Xinhua) - Malaysia and Senegal
signed Wednesday an investment guarantee agreement aimed at
intensifying trade and investment between the two countries,
according to an official statement here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement signed in Montego Bay, Jamaica, on the sideline
of the G-15 summit there, put in place a framework for expanding
and deepening economic and industrial cooperation between the two
countries, the statement issued by Malaysia's Ministry of
International Trade and Industry said.
</P>
<P>
"The agreement protects investments by investors of both
countries made prior to as well as after the signing of the
agreement," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The pact provides certainties and addresses the concerns of
investors on matters such as expropriation and nationalization,
repatriation of profits in terms of free transfer of income
accruing to investment, and settlement of investment disputes
through the International Center for Settlement of Investment
Disputes.
</P>
<P>
The two governments agreed to provide the necessary assistance
and encourage their private sectors to work with each other, it
said.
</P>
<P>
Senegal is the ninth member of the G-15 grouping to seal
investment guarantee agreement with Malaysia. The other eight G-15
members with similar pact with Malaysia are Argentina, Chile,
Egypt, India, Indonesia, Peru, Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
G-15, actually consisting of 17 countries, also includes
Brazil, Mexico, Venezuela, Jamaica, Algeria, Kenya and Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
G-15 leaders are having their summit in Jamaica.

<HEADLINE> Indian Exports Need to Be Diversified </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Incentives to diversify in
line with international demand are required to boost the declining
Indian exports, economic experts said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
With the new Union Budget just round the corner, it is time
once again for retrospective analysis. The country's exports of
the current financial year 1998-99 (April 1, 1998-March 31, 1999)
have emerged as one of the main areas of concern, they said.
</P>
<P>
A look at the statistics reveals a decline of 3.9 percent in
Indian exports in U.S. dollar terms this year. The reasons most
widely touted for the fall in the growth rate of exports are the
depreciation of the rupee (local currency) against the U.S. dollar
and general recessionary conditions at the global level, which
have adversely affected the demand for Indian products in
international markets.
</P>
<P>
The third factor is India's inability to diversify its export
basket in line with the commodities having the largest shares and
the highest growth rates in world trade. It is this factor that
comes within the ambit of policy making and incentive designation
under the Union Budget, and which, if properly handled, can pave
the way to a better export scenario for the country, they said.
</P>
<P>
As far as growth rates of the exports are concerned, there was
a respite from the disappointing export performance continuing
over the current fiscal during November 1998 when exports
increased by 3.81 percent. In October 1998 exports had fallen by a
massive 14.9 percent and the cumulative export growth over the
period of April to November 1998 was a negative 3.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Clearing up domestic constraints through freeing
infrastructural bottlenecks, facilitating export credit and
bringing in policies conducive to the export sector would
definitely give a limited boost to India's present exports. Yet
diversifying the country's export basket in line with the
commodities having the largest demands in international markets is
the only way towards a sustained a good export performance, they
stressed.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Takes Initiative to Reorganize Int'l Jute Body </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
taken fresh initiative to reorganize the International Jute
Organization (IJO) as a stronger forum wooing back some of its
important members who pulled out for different reasons, the New
Nation daily newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
As the first step of the fresh initiative, the government will
convene a meeting of the ambassadors and high commissioners of the
member states within this month in a bid to find ways of bringing
the old members back to the IJO.
</P>
<P>
Now, the IJO is facing a crisis since four of its members --
Australia, Pakistan, the United States of America and India --
have relinquished their memberships.
</P>
<P>
The IJO is an inter-governmental agency with 26 member states,
established in 1984 with headquarters in Dhaka, to implement the
provisions of the 1982 International Agreement on Jute and Jute
Products.
</P>
<P>
The agreement came into being under the Integrated Program for
Commodities adopted by the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development. The original agreement was replaced by the
International Agreement on Jute and Jute Products in 1989, which
will remain in force until April 11, 2000.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Exports Increase 5 Percent in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, February 11 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Minister for
International Trade Lockwood Smith Thursday praised NZ exporters
for playing "a key role" in the country's return to economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
In a media statement, Smith said he was informed that the value
of New Zealand exports in 1998 increased by five percent to 22.519
billion NZ dollars (12.4 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
"The trade statistics show that our export industries are
making a solid contribution to New Zealand's return to strong,
sustainable economic growth," Smith said.
</P>
<P>
According to Statistics New Zealand, New Zealand exports to
Asia in 1998 were down by 364 million U.S. dollars compared with
1997, despite an improvement in the second half of 1998. However
this was more than compensated by an increase in the value of New
Zealand exports to the United States alone, up 382 million U.S.
dollars or 31.3 percent. Other significant increases included
Belgium (up 59.9 percent), Italy (up 35.5 percent) and Mexico (up
30.6 percent).
</P>
<P>
On a product basis, the major commodities that increased their
exports last year included milk powder, butter and cheese, fruit
and nuts, casein and caseinates, paper and paperboard, wood pulp,
aluminum and mechanical machinery.
</P>
<P>
Exports for some commodities dropped in 1998 for wood and wood
articles, raw hides, skin and leather and mineral fuels.

<HEADLINE> New Curriculum for New Zealand Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, February 11 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Education
Minister Nick Smith Thursday launched a new curriculum for health
and physical education in the country's 2,700 primary and
secondary schools.
</P>
<P>
In a media release, Smith said, "Health is about lifestyle. Too
many New Zealanders prematurely die from smoking, obesity, drug
abuse and suicide. The new curriculum will make a real difference
by equipping young New Zealanders with the knowledge and skills
to lead healthier lives."
</P>
<P>
The health and physical education curriculum will be compulsory
for all students in years 1-10 from the beginning of 2001, but its
 implementation will begin this year.
</P>
<P>
The curriculum sets out the skills and knowledge required on
issues about food and nutrition, mental health, sexuality
education, physical activity, sport education, outdoor education,
body care and personal safety.
</P>
<P>
"This initiative done well will help save the lives of
thousands of New Zealanders and improve the quality of life for
thousands more," Minister Smith said.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian PM Warns of Evils of Unipolar World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 11 (Xinhua) - Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad has warned developing countries of the evils of a
unipolar world.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir gave the warming at the 9th summit of the G-15 of 17
developing countries in Jamaica while speaking at the opening
ceremony on behalf of the Asian members of the nine-year-old
grouping Wednesday, the Malaysian national news agency Bernama
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Bernama said Mahathir told the delegates that they are seeing
the "worst aspects" of the "new capitalism" today,
</P>
<P>
"Today, capitalism finds little need to compete for acceptance,
unlike the Cold War era when capitalism modified itself in order
to be more acceptable. As a result, the worst aspects of the
system had been bared. Anything done in the name of capitalism
must be accepted on pain of being labeled a heretic," Mahathir
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that in East Asia, they (Asian nations) had experienced
the new capitalism in the free flow of capital across their
borders which they had welcomed in order to boost their growth.
</P>
<P>
"We still do but now we realize the damage to our economies
when that capital is suddenly withdrawn. "From being miracle
economies we have now become impoverished nations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Their people are starving, rioting and looting, their
governments have been overthrown and their political system is so
undermined that they cannot govern effectively, Mahathir said,
adding they had to accept foreign direction of their internal
affairs.
</P>
<P>
He said whether it was planned or not their impoverishment has
exposed them to the dangers of losing their independence.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the 17 members of the G-15 were banded to enhance
whatever little strength they have and to use it to enable them to
survive, Mahathir said that in all these, they are not succeeding
too well.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, he added, the rich and powerful nations are
consolidating, forming powerful cohesive politico-economic
alliances.
</P>
<P>
"They meet, they plan and they execute strategies impacting on
the world. Clearly if we want to safeguard our future we have to
be aware of the forces around us, to consult with each other more
often and to have a common stand on most issues," Mahathir said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said as a member of the G-15, he felt a need to shout
his warnings although he knows he will be ridiculed "but that is a
small price to pay."
</P>
<P>
The world may not see a clash of civilizations but the
disparities between the weak and the strong are such that might
continue to be regarded as right, Mahathir said.
</P>
<P>
G-15 consists of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Peru,
Venezuela, Jamaica, Algeria, Egypt, Kenya, Nigeria, Senegal,
Zimbabwe, India, Indonesia, Malaysia and Sri Lanka.

<HEADLINE> S. Asian Countries Meet in Nepal on Election Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Chief election commissioners
and election commissioners from Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan
and Sri Lanka began here Thursday discussions on comparative
electoral process in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
In his welcome speech at the two-day regional workshop,
Chairman of the Nepal South Asia Center Devendra Raj Panday asked
the participants to contribute to preparing a comprehensive issue
profile on electoral reform in a comparative regional perspective
and coming up with a body of suggestions and recommendations
specifying policies and strategies for the resolution of issues
identified.
</P>
<P>
The workshop will focus on such aspects of the electoral
process as autonomy, integrity, independence and accountability of
the electoral machinery, voter participation, the legal framework,
effective code of conduct, election expenses and other campaign
norms, the Nepal South Asia Center said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
"Basically, the workshop will cover issues that have a bearing
on the conduct of free and fair elections with broadest
participation of the electorate so that their verdict fully
reflect the popular will," the center said.
</P>
<P>
It said that the principal objective of the workshop is to
promote sound electoral process and representational governance in
South Asia.
</P>
<P>
Scholars from the five countries will present papers on the
experience of their respective countries in this regard.
</P>
<P>
The workshop is a follow-up to the workshop on the same theme
held in Colombo, Sri Lanka, in September 1995.
</P>
<P>
It is organized jointly by the Nepal South Asia Center and the
Colombo-based International Center for Ethnic Studies.
</P>
<P>
The workshop comes at a time when Sri Lanka and Nepal are
scheduled to hold fresh polls respectively on April 1 and May 3.
</P>
<P>
A two-day meeting will follow on the role of the election
commission in the consolidation of democracy, necessary
infrastructure for a free and impartial election and fair election
system.

<HEADLINE> Global Growth to Weaken Through 1999: Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Australian Treasury officials
Thursday forecast a continued weakening of the international
economy through 1999 with the country's key trading partner Japan
to remain in recession and growth expected to slow in Europe and
the United States.
</P>
<P>
The officials told a Senate committee that Australia's current
account deficit forecast for 1998-99 of 32.2 billion Australian
dollars (20.2 billion U.S. dollars), or 5.5 percent of its gross
domestic product (GDP), was partly based on continued
international weakening.
</P>
<P>
They said federal Treasury expected continued weakness with
Australia's major trading partners, including South Korea and
Japan, although the weakness would diminish.
</P>
<P>
They added there were positive signs from Thailand and South
Korea, while growth would continue in China but at a slower pace.
</P>
<P>
The outlook for Europe and the United States was less clear.
</P>
<P>
"In those areas there is still some downside risk," officials
said.
</P>
<P>
But they said the performance of the U.S. economy continued to
surprise analysts.
</P>
<P>
"We see an outlook there which is less positive than the past
12 months," they said.
</P>
<P>
On a country by country basis, officials said they expected
Thailand to return to positive growth in 1999, with its gross
domestic product to expand by about one percentage point.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia would remain in deep recession, with growth running
at about negative three percent through 1999.
</P>
<P>
They said Japan would remain in recession.
</P>
<P>
"Our expectation is that it would be a rather small negative
growth of about a quarter of a percentage point".
</P>
<P>
China's economy would continue to grow at around 7.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Treasury said the international consensus forecast for South
Korea was negative growth of one percent, although forecasts
ranged from minus one to positive one.
</P>
<P>
They said in the U.S., economic growth would ease to about 2.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
"We are ourselves forecasting growth in 1999 for the United
States of about two and a quarter percent, so that does involve
some and a fairly substantial reduction in growth, more in line
with trend GDP growth in the United States," they said.
</P>
<P>
Growth in the 11 European Monetary Union nations would come in
about 2.5 percent, they said.
</P>
<P>
Britain would record growth of between 0.5 percent and one
percent.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Taliban Restricts Osama's Activities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban militia
has banned Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden from accepting visitors
or having outside contact.
</P>
<P>
However, the militia on Wednesday once again ruled out the
possibility of his extradition, saying such a demand was
illogical, according reports reaching here Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted a statement issued by Taliban's supreme
leader Mulla Omar as saying that "Osama bin Laden no longer has
any facilities with him to communicate with any one."
</P>
<P>
An observer group has been set up to keep vigil on Osama's
activities, the reports said, the Taliban would be compelled to
review its policy on the stay of the Saudi millionaire in
Afghanistan if he did not comply with the Militia's decision.
</P>
<P>
Osama bin Laden, who is now living in the war-shattering
country, has been accused by the United States of masterminding
the bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania last August,
which killed more than 200 people.
</P>
<P>
The United States has asked the Taliban to expel Osama from
Afghanistan or hand him over to the United States, but the militia
refused, saying the Saudi dissident is a guest of the Afghan
nation.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, visiting British Minister of State for
Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs Derek Fetchett held discussions
with Taliban officials, asking the militia to check Osama's
activities on the Afghan soil.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban said that the British proposal of curtailing
Osama's activities was more rational and logical than the U.S.
demand, the reports said.

<HEADLINE> Drug Facility Destroyed by Polish Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

WARSAW, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Polish police on Wednesday
destroyed a drug production facility and arrested two men, police
announced.
</P>
<P>
The arrest came after several weeks of surveillance. A
production facility and materials for producing Amphetamines were
discovered by the search.
</P>
<P>
Police said the two detained men could face up to five years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
Poland is a major producer of Amphetamines, with about one-
tenth of the Amphetamines in western Europe coming from the
country, said Interpol.
</P>
<P>
Polish police began efforts to track down drug production
facilities in 1992. In the past seven years, only 30 production
bases have been destroyed.

<HEADLINE> Canada Announces Support for Agri-food Products to Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Canadian International Trade
Minister Sergio Marchi Wednesday announced the establishment of a
revolving short-term insurance facility to provide up to 60
million Canadian dollars (39.6 Million U.S. dollars) in exports of
Canadian agri-food products to Russia over three years.
</P>
<P>
"This facility will allow Canadian exporters, traditionally
engaged in selling to the Russian market, to maintain their
commercial relationship with Russian buyers during this period of
economic difficulty," said Marchi, "Canada remains committed to
Russia and to its efforts to create a more stable and transparent
business environment."
</P>
<P>
The facility, established under the Export Development
Corporation (EDC) Canada Account, provides coverage to Canadian
financial institutions to support the export of Canadian agri-food
products to Russia.
</P>
<P>
The Canada Account is used to support export transactions that
are in the national interest and cannot be supported by the
Corporate Account for reasons such as size or country-risk
exposure. The terms and conditions of this facility are on a
commercial basis.
</P>
<P>
"Over the long-term, Russia is an important market for Canadian
agri-food exports, and this insurance facility is designed to
ensure that Canadian exporters maintain a presence in the market,"
said the Canadian minister.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made during the visit to Ottawa of Russian
Deputy Prime Minister Gennady Kulik.
</P>
<P>
Canadian agri-food export sales to Russia in 1997 were over 125
million Canadian dollars (82.5 million U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Comply With Panama Treaty: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The United States
reiterated its commitment to the 1977 Torrijos-Carter Treaty that
obliges it to withdraw all troops from Panama and to transfer
control of the Panama Canal to the Panamanian government by the
end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Colonel David J. Henter, a senior officer of the U.S. Southern
Command, made this statement at a press conference here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
By December 31, 1999, the U.S. will remove all military
personnel and their dependents from Panama's territory and hand
over control of the canal to Panamanian authorities on time, said
Henter, adding that the U.S. pullout began in 1979 and now the
number of the military staff has decreased from 10,200 to less
than 4,000.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has already transferred 12,000 hectares of lands and 2,
200 of all 5,800 military buildings to Panama. The remainder will
be returned to Panama within the year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Washington also promised to make every effort to clean up
unexploded shells from three U.S. Army firing ranges in the Panama
Canal Zone.
</P>
<P>
In 1977, U.S. President Jimmy Carter and his Panamanian
counterpart Omar Torrijos signed an accord foreseeing that the U.S.
must remove its troops from Panama and hand over the canal,
military bases and land to the Panamanian government by noon on
Dec. 31, 1999.

<HEADLINE> More Refugees Flock to EU Countries in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) was hit
hard by waves of refugees in 1998 due to the Balkan crisis,
particularly the long-standing conflict in Kosovo, with the number
of refugees flocking to the area rising 19 percent to 299,000 from
last year, a U.N. report said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report, issued here by the Office of the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees, said 13 of the 15 EU member countries
accepted more refugees in 1998 than the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The 21-month conflict in the mainly-Albanian Yugoslav province
of Kosovo was listed as a main cause for the sharp rise in the
number of refugees.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, there were 100,000 refugees swarming to the EU
countries from the Yugoslav Federation, double the figure in 1997.
Most of them were from the embattled Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Germany was the worst hit among the EU members, with 33 percent
of the refugees flocking to the largest West European country in
1998. It was followed by Britain and the Netherlands, which
accepted 19 percent and 15 percent of the refugees respectively.

<HEADLINE> Knicks Star Forward Sprewell Injured with Stress Fracture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The Knicks forward Latrell
Sprewell will miss the next three to six weeks with a stress
fracture in his right heel, the team said today.
</P>
<P>
Sprewll started the Knicks' first two games this season as
small forward as New York played one of the smallest starting
lineups in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
He scored 24 points in a season-opening loss to the Orlando
Magic but was a miserable 2-of-12 from the field for five points
in Sunday's 83-79 loss to Miami.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, I'm disappointed," Sprewell said, "I had every
intention of playing, but the injury was more than I thought. I
will do everything I can to remain in the best shape possible
while my heel improves so I can get back on the court with my
teammates as soon as possible."
</P>
<P>
Sprewell averaged 14.5 points and 6.0 rebounds through the
season's first two contest.
</P>
<P>
A three-time All-Star with a history of trouble with teammates,
coaches and management, Sprewell was suspended without pay for the
final 68 games of the 1997-98 season for twice attacking Warriors
coach P.J. Carlesimo during a practice December 1. 1997.
</P>
<P>
When the lockout was lifted on January 21, Warriors shipped
Sprewell to the Knicks for guard John Starks and forwards Chris
Mills and Terry Cummings.

Eggleton said: "We are pleased to have this opportunity to
consult with Mr. Solana about the situation in Kosovo."

<HEADLINE> Bucks Sign Ray Allen to Six-Year Extension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Ray Allen has signed a six-
year, $71 million contract extension with the Milwaukee Bucks
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
With the maximum set at $9 million for third-year players and
annual raises of 12.5 percent under the new collective bargaining
agreement, Allen negotiated his own deal with Bucks owner Herb
Kohl and saved the 4 percent agent's commission fee, which would
have amounted to $2.84 million over the course of the contract.
</P>
<P>
Allen, who was eligible for free agency on July 1, was advised
during his negotiations by Mark Christie.
</P>
<P>
The contract makes Allen the highest-paid in Bucks history,
eclipsing the $68 million deal signed by forward Glenn Robinson in
1994.
</P>
<P>
Allen played in all 164 games over his first two seasons,
starting all but one. Last season, he averaged a career-high 19.5
points, 4.9 rebounds and 4.3 assists in 40 minutes per game.
</P>
<P>
The 23-year-old Allen has led the Bucks to a 2-0 start this
year. He scored 25 points in a season-opening win at Charlotte
last Saturday.

<P>
LISBON, February 10 (Xinhua) -- A new drug aimed at more
accurately diagnosing Parkinson's Disease has been jointly
developed by researchers from Portugal and France and is expected
to enter the market soon, reported the Portuguese news agency
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The drug, known as Iodolisuride, can more readily enter the
brain and provide more information for a precise diagnosis, said
the Portuguese expert in charge of the project.
</P>
<P>
Iodolisuride has no reported side effects, and it may also
assist in curing some diseases related to neurasthenia, he added.
</P>
<P>
Parkinson's disease is a chronic disease found in the elderly,
which results in muscular tremors, rigidity and general weakness.
</P>
<P>
There are at least 10,000 Parkinson's disease patients in

<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Albanian Prime Minister Pandeli
Majko suggested that all Albanians in the Balkan region are
entitled to organize themselves for collective defense.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference Tuesday, Majko said the peace
talks being held in Rambouillet, near Paris, is only the first
step in solving the Kosovo problem, not a final formula.
</P>
<P>
He said withdrawal of Serbian troops from Kosovo province
should top any recipe for the issue.
</P>
<P>
If the talks fail to bring about peace, or there continue to be
killings in Kosovo, all Albanians living in Albania, Macedonia,
Kosovo and Herzegovina, as well as other Balkan regions, can get
organized to conduct collective defense, the prime minister
suggested.
</P>
<P>
Urging the United States to be involved in Kosovo not only
diplomatically, but also militarily, he pledged that Albania will
provide all necessary assistance if NATO or parties at the
Rambouillet talks decide to send troops to the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
Serbian and ethnic Albanian representatives began talks for
Kosovo peace at Rambouillet Saturday sponsored by the six-nation
Contact Group.

WARSAW, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Finance ministers of five
Eastern European nations Wednesday called on the European Union (
EU) members to stop subsidizing exports, Polish news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Finance ministers of Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovenia
and Estonia made the call during a regular meeting here on their
national economies and EU membership.
</P>
<P>
Polish Finance Minister Leszek Balcerowicz said the subsidies
had caused many troubles and set "very bad precedents."
</P>
<P>
He urged the EU nations to set good precedents and consider the
results of their subsidy policies.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the subsidized exports had made his country's
economic situation more complicated and forced Polish products to
compete with those of European countries.
</P>
<P>
Polish television reported that some EU nations offered 15 to
30 percent subsidies to their exporting products, especially
agricultural products.
</P>
<P>

BEIJING, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The China Export and Import
Bank (Eximbank) today signed a framework agreement with China
National Machinery and Equipment Import and Export Corp. (China
Machinery) on a seller's credit line of five billion Renminbi yuan
(600 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Eximbank said that, as one of the state's
policy-oriented financial institutions, Eximbank has so far
provided China Machinery with 2.1 billion yuan in export seller's
credit to support its export of machinery, electronics products
and equipment.
</P>
<P>
China Machinery is one of the nation's largest exporters of
machinery and electronics products. The credit line signed today
will mainly be used to support the company's export of large,
complete sets of equipment and other machinery and electronics
products.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that this kind of financing not only improves
export enterprises' competitiveness in overseas markets, but also
helps standardize mutual cooperation and simplify ratification
procedures, which will be conducive to promoting the export of
machinery and electronics products.
</P>
<P>
He said that this year Eximbank will fully use export credits,
export credit insurance and other financial tools to offer key
support for the export of ships, machinery and electronics

Deputy Foreign Ministry Spokesman Kitti Wasinondh was quoted
Thursday by the Bangkok Post as saying that Belgian Foreign
Minister Erik Deerycke made the disclosure to Thai Foreign
Minister Surin Pitsuwan during a meeting in Brussels on February
9.
</P>
<P>
But the EU had not yet agreed on the year that will be used as
the benchmark, he said.
</P>
<P>
The EU has removed Thailand from its Generalized System of
Preferences on the basis of economic figures gathered before the
crisis hit the country in mid-1997.
</P>
<P>
Surin told the Belgian minister that the country's
agricultural sector had been badly affected by the move and urged
him to help lobby for the EU to make the review this year, Kitti
said.
</P>
<P>
Thai shrimps, fresh vegetables and cut flowers are among the
hardest hit by the loss of GSP privileges since January 1.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian minister's disclosure followed a pledge by
Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker in mid-January to
help lobby the EU for a review of its decision.

<HEADLINE> Sweden to Maintain Non-Military Alliance Policy: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Swedish Foreign Minister
Anna Lindh said Wednesday that her country will continue to pursue
its current neutral foreign policies of non-military alliance.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the parliament on the government's foreign
policies, Lindh said there will be no change in the policy of
keeping the country out of any military alliance in order to
maintain its neutrality when a war erupts in a neighboring region.
</P>
<P>
The policy has helped ease tension and enhance security in the
region, she said.
</P>
<P>
But Lindh stressed that the implementation of such a policy
does not mean that the country is aloof from conflict. Instead,
she said, Sweden will "actively cooperate in promoting peace and
preventing conflicts in Europe and the world."
</P>
<P>
Promoting the enlargement of the European Union (EU),
particularly the admission of its Baltic neighbors to the EU, will
be "a top priority" of the country's foreign policies, Lindh said.
</P>
<P>
She said the birth of the euro is a "historic step" taken by
Europe, and the success of the European economic and currency
alliance is "of great significance" for Sweden. But the minister
said the eventual participation in the European economic and
currency alliance by Sweden has yet to be decided by the Swedish
in a referendum.
</P>
<P>
Enhancing cooperation between North Europe and the Baltic
region is another priority for Sweden, Lindh said, adding that the
government will allocate an extra one billion kronor (127 million
U.S. dollars) in the next five years to promote economic
cooperation between the two regions.
</P>
<P>
In a parliamentary debate following Lindh's speech, the largest
opposition Moderate Coalition Party criticized the neutral policy.
</P>
<P>
Goeran Lennmarker, the party's spokesman, said that it is "
unreasonable" for the government to maintain the policy of
military non-alliance years after the dismantling of the Berlin
Wall and the entry of the EU by Sweden, because it is impossible
for the country to keep out of a war should one break out in a
neighboring region.
</P>
<P>
Sweden should participate in maintaining security between
European and Atlantic countries, he said.

</P>
<P>
At present, the SPC holds five to eight press conferences each
year. Reporters may still cover court stories on their own, Gong

</P>
<P>
Chinese courts at all levels will gradually establish a
spokesperson system, announced Xiao Yang, SPC president, at a

</P>
<P>
China began to pay more attention to judicial justice issues in
autumn of 1997. Since then, more courts have opened their trials
to the public and news people are free to cover most trials.
</P>
<P>
At least 11 higher people's courts and 58 intermediate people's
courts have begun live telecasts of trials to increase their
openness and transparency, according to Xiao, the paper says.

<P>
However, a shortfall is expected in the supply of vegetable oil,
the forecast say.
</P>
<P>
"The country's 1998 grain harvest reached 490 million tons. As
the country continues to attach great importance to agriculture
and to a sufficient State reserve, there is surely no problem in
grain supply this year," Guo Shouzhong, director of the market
forecast department of the Business Information Center, was quoted
by China Daily as saying.
</P>
<P>
The output of vegetable oil, estimated at 7.5 million tons
last year, will fall short of meeting the expected demand of 9.5
million tons this year, according to SAIT.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Shares Global Effort in Conserving Waterbirds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar is fulfilling its
obligations towards a global effort for the conservation of
waterbirds by providing legal protection to many important species
of waterbird and establishing wetland sanctuaries in various parts
of the country.
</P>
<P>
In Myanmar, there are some 80 resident species and about 100
migratory species of waterbird, according to the latest official
statistics.
</P>
<P>
Of these, many species are protected under the Protection of
Wildlife and Wild Plants and Conservation of Natural Areas Law of
1994.
</P>
<P>
Four wetland sanctuaries have also been established in Myanmar.
These are the Wethtikan, the Inle Lake, the Moyingyi and the
Hlawga in Magway, Shan, Bago and Yangon divisions and states. The
prior three are primarily for the conservation of waterbirds.
</P>
<P>
Since many wetland sites in Myanmar are important habitats for
resident waterbirds and "stop-over" for migratory waterbirds,
survey are being conducted by the Nature and Wildlife Conservation
Division of the Forest Department to establish more sanctuaries in
suitable wetland areas.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar is a signatory to the Convention on Biological
Diversity and Convention on international Trade in Endangered
Species of Wild Fauna and Flora.

<P>
BELGRADE, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Faruk Hadzibegic, coach of
French first division Sochaux, is going to be Bosnia's new soccer
coach, according to Bosnian radio reports.
</P>
<P>
Hadzibegic's predecessor is Dzemaludin Musovic, who quitted
after a disappointing Euro 2000 qualifying match and last month's
1-2 defeat by Malta in a friendly.
</P>
<P>
Before coaching Sochaux, Hadzibegic was a successful player at
Sarajevo and Spain's Sevilla as well as Sochaux. He also led the
former Yugoslavia team to the 1990 World Cup quarter-finals as
captain.
</P>
<P>
But Hadzibegic's new job is tougher than ever, that is, to make
the Balkan country qualify for European 2000 championship finals
in the Netherlands and Belgium.
</P>
<P>
Bosnia stands fourth in qualifying group nine, with one win,
one draw and two defeats. Their next group match is against
Scotland on March 27.

<HEADLINE> Animal Quarantine Workers Urged to Ensure Meat Quality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 11 (Xinhua) -- China's Ministry of
Agriculture is calling on the country's 100,000 veterinarians and
animal quarantine workers to ensure the quality and hygiene of the
meat during the Spring Festival falling on February 16 this year.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Minister Qi Jingfa said the ministry has a tough job to
prevent the spread of animal epidemics, partly because of the
adverse effects of last summer's floods, and the unseasonably high
temperatures this winter.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that Qi's remarks come at a time when food quality
and safety become uppermost in people's mind after some 221 people
were poisoned and one killed by tainted lard in China's Jiangxi
Province last month.
</P>
<P>
China's per capita meat consumption reached 41.9 kilograms in
1997, Jia Youlin, director of the ministry's animal husbandry and
health department, said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Animal products, meat in particular, is an indispensable part
of people's daily diet, and improving the quality and hygiene of
meat is important in ensuring social stability," today's China
Daily quoted Qi as saying.
</P>
<P>
Qi urged animal quarantine workers to inspect every animal put
up for sale and every batch of animal products.
</P>
<P>
"Quarantine inspection activities should be done in animal-
rearing establishments and slaughterhouses," he said.
</P>
<P>
His ministry will collaborate with the National People's
Congress and the State Administration for Industry and Commerce
this spring to carry out a nationwide inspection on the
enforcement of the animal quarantine law.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, quarantine workers should inform people how to
distinguish quality meat from fake and shoddy products, Qi said.

<HEADLINE> Clubs Claims Compensation for Releasing Players </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Europe's top soccer clubs agreed
unanimously that they should be compensated for releasing players
on international duty, an official with Bayern Munich club said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Bayern Munich vice-president Karl-Heinz Rummenigge said that
the officials of the top 14 clubs in Europe, known as G14, met in
Madrid on Tuesday and they will discuss the issue at their meeting
with Blatter in Zurich on March 27.
</P>
<P>
While the clubs aren't opposed to the idea of stagging the
World Cup every two years, Rummenigge said they want a better
coordinated international calendar.
</P>
<P>
"You can't have European championships in July, Asian
championships in November, Africans in January and South America
in September," the official said.
</P>
<P>
Rummenigge said the best way would be for national federations
to take over the players' salary for the time when they are on
national team duty.
</P>
<P>
Though the German federation now pays Bundesliga clubs 6,000
marks (3,500 U.S.dollars) for each player called up to the
national team, the clubs have been demanding much higher fees.

<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) will step up political dialogue with Ukraine
this year, while seeking closer cooperation on science and
technology, a senior NATO official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Donalid Makkonel, head of NATO's International Secretariat who
is on a three-day official visit here, was speaking to the press
after meeting Ukraine Foreign Minister Boris Tarasyuk.
</P>
<P>
He said his visit, part of the implementation of NATO's charter
of special partnership with Ukraine, aims to discuss with Ukraine
leaders ways to further improve and expand cooperation between the
two sides.
</P>
<P>
He said NATO has drawn up its 1999 work plan for cooperation
with Ukraine, focusing on information exchange, eco-environment
protection as well as science and technology.
</P>
<P>
Makkonel said NATO established an information center in Kiev
and is going to send two contact military officers to the country
for cooperation within the Partnership for Peace framework.
</P>
<P>
He noted that NATO sets high store by its relations with
Ukraine, offering frequent invitations to Ukraine legislators,
scientists and journalists for visits to NATO headquarters in
Brussels and for talks on wide-ranging topics.
</P>
<P>
Asked for comments on the Russian Upper Chamber's postponement
in reviewing the Ukraine-Russia friendship pact, the NATO official
said this is an issue between the two countries themselves.
</P>
<P>
He said that in principle, NATO supports friendly relations
with all neighboring countries and hopes to see friendly ties
between Ukraine and Russia.

<P>
The debts were refinanced over 30 years at interest rates of 6-
7.5 percent. However, the governors want to reduce the portion of
their revenues that are dedicated to interest payments from 12-13

<P>
BUDAPEST, February 11 (Xinhua) -- About 80 percent of Hungary
has been crippled by heavy snowfalls this winter, resulting in
numerous traffic delays in many major cities and areas including
Budapest.
</P>
<P>
A recent snowfall, which lasted for about 30 hours, has
resulted in an accumulation of 30 centimeters and blocked two
major highways.
</P>
<P>
Several flights from Stuttgart, Brussels and Stockholm were
diverted to Vienna Tuesday due to snow at Budapest's Ferihegy
Airport. By Wednesday the situation had returned to normal,
Hungarian authorities said.
</P>
<P>
103 snow plows and 700 street cleaners attempted to clear away
a field of ice and snow in Budapest Tuesday morning. Still,
traffic was disrupted when trees lining streets collapsed beneath
the weight of accumulated snow.
</P>
<P>
Nine fires caused by broken electrical wires were reported on
Tuesday in the capital. No serious traffic accidents as a result
of the snow however have yet been reported. The municipal
government has advised people to use public transportation and
exercise caution while using private cars.
</P>
<P>
According to a forecast by the Hungarian Meteorological Bureau
Tuesday afternoon, more heavy snowfalls are expected in the next
24 hours with an accumulation of 20 centimeters possible.
</P>
<P>
The snowfalls, caused by a collision of cold air from the
Carpathian mountains and a warm air mass from the Mediterranean,
hit much of central Europe, with avalanches reported in
Switzerland and Austria. Over half the flights from Zurich Airport
were canceled.

MEXICO CITY, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The ninth summit of Latin
American, Asian and African developing countries, known as the
Group of 15, was inaugurated on Wednesday by Jamaican Prime
Minister Percival Patterson in Jamaica's port of Montego Bay.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here from Jamaica said that in his opening
speech, Patterson, who also heads the G-15, blasted the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Trade Organization
(WTO) for failing to put the recent world financial crises under
control.
</P>
<P>
"As a last recourse lender, the IMF has not complied with its
function. It is simply not granting resources in an appropriate
way," he said.
</P>
<P>
Patterson also said the WTO should urgently evaluate its work
and protect the interests of emerging economies.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting held earlier, the group's foreign ministers
approved a proposal by Mexico's Rosario Green that the G-15
strengthen ties with the group of the wealthiest nations (G-7) and
Russia and lobby for a more active role by the United Nations as a
mediator between the developing and industrialized world.
</P>
<P>
Green also said the G-15 should focus on priority issues such
as facing the international financial crisis which has mainly
affected emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
The G-15 is actually made up of 17 countries. They are Algeria,
Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Jamaica, Kenya,
Malaysia, Mexico, Nigeria, Peru, Senegal, Sri Lanka, Venezuela and

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 11 (Xinhua) -- China's industrial added value
grew by 17.9 percent to 151 billion yuan (18.2 billion U.S.
dollars) in January on an year-on-year basis, more than doubling
the annual figure of 8.8 percent for 1998, according to the
National Bureau of Statistics.
</P>
<P>
The steep rise in the growth rate stems from the government's
infrastructure construction program that began last year,
commented today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
It also indicates that China has at last dragged its industrial
sector out of the doldrums thanks to the government's pump-priming
measures, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Power generation, a key barometer for activity in the
industrial sector, grew by more than 10 percent in January,
representing a sharp contrast to the one-percent growth rate
reported at the beginning of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Heavy industries, which directly benefited from the
infrastructure improvement programs, expanded by 19.1 percent over
the same month last year, while light industries grew 16.6 percent
year on year.
</P>
<P>
The most eye-catching production expansion came from the cement
manufacturing sector, with output up by 37.2 percent as against
last January.
</P>
<P>
Production of building materials, major chemical products and
raw materials all had growth rates exceeding 10 percent.

<P>
BEIJING, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Of the 600 varieties of major
crops grown in China, about half are foreign strains.
</P>
<P>
According to Luo Xizhi of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural
Sciences, the country has always attached great importance to
introducing high-yield, disease-resistant, and quality foreign
varieties.
</P>
<P>
In the past three years, the Academy has introduced over 1,500
kinds of seeds for ten types of crops including rice, wheat, maize
and soybeans.
</P>
<P>
The foreign strains have enriched the variety and helped
improve the quality and output of Chinese crops, according to
experts. At present, over 80 percent of the wheat varieties in
China are hybrids.
</P>
<P>
Last year, China selected more than 20 kinds of cold- and
drought-resistant foreign wheat strains and grew them successfully
on a total of 333,333 hectares.

the second period, as World Player of the Year Zinedine Zidane
stamped his authority on proceedings with a sublime individual
display.
</P>
<P>
Wilkinson, eager to live up to his reputation as a safe pair of
hands following the sacking of Glenn Hoddle, will have been
disheartened by the manner in which his team faded away.
</P>
<P>
He said before the game that the result of this friendly would
be vital to his side's chances in their crucial Euro 2000
qualifier with Poland.
</P>
<P>
On the evidence of this dismal display the Poles will have
little to fear.
</P>
<P>
The defence, which was dominated by Arsenal veterans, was torn
to shreds on a number of occasions, the midfield was over-run in
embarrassing fashion and Alan Shearer, Michael Owen and later
substitute Andy Cole were left totally detached up front.
</P>
<P>
The English squad had a satisfactory start in the first half.
Tony Adams was presented with a glorious chance in only the second
minute, as David Beckham sent over a curling free-kick from the
right. But Adams, who found himself unmarked in the box, put his
header wide.
</P>
<P>
England continued to make the early running and French keeper
Fabien Barthez was forced into a sharp save after eight minutes,
turning away Owen's deflected shot with his legs following Shearer'
s knock-down.
</P>
<P>
Barthez produced another fine stop mid-way through the half,
this time to hold Beckham's fizzing 25-yard free-kick.
</P>
<P>
David Seaman pulled off a point-blank save after 29 minutes to
keep out Anelka's flick after Marcel Desailly had found him from a
corner.
</P>
<P>
England will regret the fact that their clearest chance of the
match fell to a defender, Martin Keown, who slashed a left-foot
shot over the bar after the ball ricocheted at his feet eight
yards out from Beckham's corner.
</P>
<P>
After their steady start, England faded towards half-time and
they began the second period in a similarly pedestrian vein, as
France indulged in possession football.
</P>
<P>
Zidane, who became more and more of an influence as the match
wore on, came close with a rasping 60th minute shot that flashed
just past substitute Nigel Martyn's left-hand post.
</P>
<P>
France thought they had scored in the 63rd minute after Zidane
had caught the England defence static with a superb first-time
chip. The pass found Anelka with only Martyn barring his way and
he duly beat the keeper with a ferocious drive -- but the ball
crashed against the underside of the bar before bouncing clear, TV
replays suggesting it had crossed the goal-line.
</P>
<P>
But the Arsenal man was not to be denied five minutes later.
Zidane again supplied a flick over the top of England's flat back
four and Anelka slotted the ball into the far corner, for France's
first ever goal at Wembley.
</P>
<P>
Lee Dixon's surprise international comeback ended with 20
minutes left, when he was stretchered off following a sickening
clash of heads with substitute Christophe Dugarry.
</P>
<P>
Anelka then grabbed his second -- with the influential Zidane
again to the fore. He linked well with Dugarry, who roasted
England on the left with a rampaging run and then laid the ball
into the middle, where Anelka slid in from close range to give the
luckless Martyn no chance.
</P>
<P>
Eight minutes from time Zidane could have made it 3-0, but
Martyn kept out his shot with his legs.
</P>
<P>
It mattered little, however, as France played out time and the
crowd booed England off the pitch.
</P>
<P>
Wilkinson's team hardly seemed to have touched the ball in the
second 45 minutes -- and the caretaker coach may already be
wandering what he has let himself in for.

<P>
ROME, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Hapless Italy had to accept the
fate of a goalless draw with Norway as they hit the woodwork twice
but failed to pierce a solid Norwegian defence in a friendly
international on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Roberto Baggio curled a freekick against the inside of the post
as early as the fourth minute only to see the ball bobbling across,
running to safety.
</P>
<P>
Midfielder Eusebio Di Francesco had the ball in the back of the
Norwegian net on 34 minutes but his effort was ruled offside.
</P>
<P>
Two minutes before the interval, Di Francesco's AS Roma
teammate Marco Delvecchio shrugged off a challenge in the penalty
area from Gunnar Halle and hooked a volley past Myhre but again it
bounced off the post and was cleared.
</P>
<P>
Norway forced their way into the match in the second half but
neither side created clear cut chances.

ADDIS ABABA -- Ethiopian Foreign Minister Seyoum Mesfin said
Wednesday that Ethiopia has the capacity to drive out the
aggressive Eritrean forces from the occupied territory.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here, Seyoum said Eritrea's full-
scale attack has left Ethiopia with only one option to exercise
its right of self-defense.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea has so far refused to respect the call of Africa for
the peaceful settlement of the crisis, he said. Ethiopia has
called on international community to impose economic and political
pressure on Eritrea to accept the peace plan of the Organization
of African Unity (OAU). (Ethiopia-FM-Fight Back)

"Heavy fighting is now going on for the town as the ECOMOG (

In its first major legislative action of the year, the House
passed the bill by a vote of 274-149, with 67 Democrats joining

WASHINGTON -- Two Republican senators declared Wednesday they

impeachment, the clearest sign yet as the Senate trial neared an
end that the charges would fall far short of conviction.

<P>
Senators James Jeffords of Vermont and Arlen Specter of
Pennsylvania were the first Republicans to announce opposition to
both articles -- perjury and obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
Jeffords said enough Republicans may join them to hold the
final roll calls on Thursday or Friday short of even a majority of
51 votes. Only a constitutional two-thirds -- 67 votes in the 100-
member Senate -- could convict and oust Clinton, the second
president in history to be put on trial. (US-Senate-Clinton-Trial)

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 10 (Xinhua) -- South Africa is likely to
submit its bid to replace Zimbabwe to host African Nations Cup
scheduled in January 10 next year, officials said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
South African Football Association chief executive officer
Raymond Hack said officials would meet next week to consider
putting the country's name forward as a replacement candidate.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe was stripped as the host of the 2000 event by the
Confederation of African Football(CAF) on Monday after they were
found not having made sufficient progress in building for the
tournament or developing an infra-structure for the televising of
the tournament.
</P>
<P>
Danny Jordaan, the chief executive officer of the South African
World Cup 2006 bid committee, also said South Africa will
certainly consider the bid "if it would help our World Cup bid".
</P>
<P>
CAF will make a decision on the replacement hosts on March 14,
when they meet in Conakry, Guinea.
</P>
<P>

WASHINGTON, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Phoenix Suns coach Danny
Ainge committed a costly kick-ball violation on Tuesday night in
the NBA competition.
</P>
<P>
Ainge was fined $3,000 today by the NBA for booting the
basketball into the stands after he was ejected in the fourth
quarter of a 112-95 loss to the Sacramento Kings.
</P>
<P>
The fine was announced by NBA senior vice president of
basketball operations Rod Thorn.
</P>
<P>
Ainge argued when Suns forward Tom Gugliotta was whistled for a
flagrant foul against Kings forward Chris Webber with 9:33 to play.
He was whistled for two quick technical fouls and was ejected, but
before departing kicked the ball into the stands.
</P>
<P>
"I was frustrated with the flagrant call. I thought Tom got
fouled on the other end," Ainge said after the game. "I know Tom
fouled Webber on this end but a flagrant foul, give me a break,
that was ridiculous. There's no way."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Concerned Over Russia's Missile Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Wednesday that it was concerned about the deterioration of
Russia's early warning defense against missile attack.
</P>
<P>
"We are concerned about the potential deterioration of Russia's
ballistic missile attack warning capabilities without referencing
any specific systems," State Department spokesman James Rubin told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post, in a report from Moscow on Wednesday, said
Russia cannot replenish the array of satellites it needs to
monitor U.S. missile silos and nuclear-armed submarines.
</P>
<P>
"For several hours every day Russian military commanders cannot
see any of the U.S. missile fields nor can they monitor the most
dangerous threat to their own forces -- U.S. Trident submarines
submerged in the world's oceans," the Post quoted Russian and
Western analysts as saying.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said the United States was following up an offer
President Bill Clinton made at the Moscow summit last September to
exchange information on missile launches and early warning
systems.
</P>
<P>
"We're pushing hard, and we need to have more discussion and
response from the Russians," he said.
</P>
<P>
The United States and the Soviet Union mounted early warning
systems during the Cold War to guard against a surprise missile
attack. This gave the two sides a chance to prepare for an attack
and to retaliate if missiles were on their way.
</P>
<P>
A defective system would make it harder to sort out information
and to decide what to do.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said Russia's political and military leaders have said
they believe there is a greatly reduced likelihood of a nuclear,
or a large-scale conventional, attack.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, we believe the idea that there are increased
risks of a serious miscalculation overstates the current Russian
launch posture, which is based on their assessment of whether
there is a real chance of a nuclear or conventional attack," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Albright Appoints Special Adviser on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright has appoint a special adviser on Kosovo to work
on the ongoing problem, the State Department said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman James Rubin said the adviser is Jim Dobbins, who has
been senior director for Inter-American affairs at the National
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
"She's asked him to come over to the department as her senior
adviser on Kosovo to work on the ongoing problem," Rubin told
reporters. His exact title and duties will be announced next week.
</P>
<P>
Dobbins, who has extensive experience of Europe, would
coordinate between agencies in implementation of any agreement,
which comes out of the talks now undergoing between Serbs and
Kosovo Albanians in France.
</P>
<P>
Rubin declined to give a status report on the talks at the
chateau of Rambouillet, but said it could be helpful that
Serbian President Milan Milutinovic was going to the talks.
</P>
<P>
"It does help to have senior figures there ... If the
political will is there, it would certainly ease any procedural
problems. The fact that Milutinovic has come is significant,
procedurally," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
Albright may also join the talks, before or after a Contact
Group ministerial meeting which might take place in Paris on
Sunday, a U.S. official said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Prosecutors Blame Public Opinion for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Resigned to losing their
case, U.S. House prosecutors said public opinion polls made a
stronger impression on senators than any evidence that President
Bill Clinton committed high crimes and misdemeanors.
</P>
<P>
Lead prosecutor Henry Hyde of Illinois said Wednesday he was
"baffled" by polls that showed Americans consistently opposed
Clinton's removal no matter what evidence the 13 Republican
prosecutors on the prosecution team presented.
</P>
<P>
"We did feel that if we could get the story out in a coherent
fashion the public might be informed and a change in the public's
mind would reach the senators," Hyde said in an interview
Wednesday as the Senate moved through its second day of closed
deliberations.
</P>
<P>
"It's essential, for impeachment to prevail, to have bipartisan
support. We never had it," the House Judiciary Committee chairman
added.
</P>
<P>
Another House Republican prosecutor Lindsey Graham agreed: "The
public opinion polls have been the hurdle for us. That is tough,
to remove a popular president."
</P>
<P>
In more than three weeks of arguments before 100 silent
senators, the prosecutors insisted that Clinton committed perjury
before a grand jury and obstructed justice in his efforts to cover
up his affair with Monica Lewinsky. And they argued strongly that
the offenses met the constitutional standards for conviction.
</P>
<P>
But in poll after poll, constituents of the senator-jurors
overwhelmingly opposed Clinton's removal. Surveys showed that
two-thirds of Americans took this stance as the trial wound down.
</P>
<P>
As the 67 votes needed for Clinton's removal moved further out
of reach, the president's approval rating hovered consistently
above 60 percent. Approval for the Republicans' handling of the
case never topped 40 percent.

<HEADLINE> New Process Makes Purer Wedding Rings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 10 (Xinhua) -- A new process for producing
wedding and engagement rings from powdered precious metals is set
to revolutionize the way in which rings are made, Britain's
Materials World journal has reported.
</P>
<P>
The process, developed by researchers at the French company
Engelhard-CLAL, will allow manufacturers to mass-produce rings
that are cheaper to make and contain a purer level of precious
metals.
</P>
<P>
By using powdered metals, produced by passing molten gold,
silver or platinum through a high powered jet, manufacturers will
be able reduce the amount of impurities found in the ring.
</P>
<P>
These impurities are picked up in conventionally produced rings
as they are punched from a sheet of metal and extensively rolled
into shape.
</P>
<P>
The new technique also reduces the amount of rolling and
shaping needed to produce the finished rings.
</P>
<P>
The new ring production process involves packing the powder
into a die and then pressing it to form a ring that has a
rectangular cross-section.
</P>
<P>
The ring is sintered in a specially designed 800 Celsius
furnace to give it strength and workability, then quenched in a
water tank and undergoes a small amount of rolling to produce the
final shape.

NEW YORK, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The Dow Jones industrial

The last minute rally lifted the Dow index to 9,177.31, up
44.28 at the close of trading after swinging narrowly between
positive and negative all the day. Tuesday, the index fell 158.08
points, or 1.70 percent to 9,133.03, below where it closed 1998.
</P>

The Nasdaq index ended 1.29 lower at 2,309.50. The index lost
94.13, or 3.9 percent, to 2,310.79 in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
Some traders and analysts became worried about Nasdaq's falling

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The International Finance
Corporation (IFC) announced on Wednesday the provision of 12
million U.S. dollars to finance two interrelated citrus projects
in Costa Rica and Nicaragua of Central America.
</P>
<P>
In Costa Rica, IFC is providing a loan of 5 million dollars and
investing 4 million dollars in quasi-equity in TicoFrut, the
country's largest industrial citrus juice producer and exporter.
</P>
<P>
The project will help TicoFrut expand the capacity of its
citrus processing plant in Aguas Zarcas by more than 50 percent
and reduce overall production costs.
</P>
<P>
In Nicaragua, IFC is supporting the creation of the first
commercial scale orange plantation company with loan of 2 million
dollars and 1 million dollars in equity in Frutales del San Juan,
S.A.
</P>
<P>
Through the project, Frutan -- a joint venture between TicoFrut
S.A. and Nicaraguan investors -- will develop orange groves over
2,000 hectares and increase production over the next few years.
The project will enable Frutan to apply farming and technical
expertise from the Costa Rican sponsor.
</P>
<P>
The projects will expand and diversify the traditional export
base of both countries, resulting in additional foreign earnings,
said Tei Mante, Director of IFC's Agribusiness Department.

body engaged in specially financing the private sector in

<HEADLINE> European Stock Markets Still End Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON February 10 (Xinhua) - Wall Street's falls on Tuesday
and weakness in the US high tech sector cast a pall over European
stock markets, despite some recovery Wednesday and a firmer
dollar.
</P>
<P>
In London, the FTSE 100 finished lower for the sixth straight
day, knocked off its balance by Wall Street's overnight decline.
</P>
<P>
But the index weathered an 82-point decline to claw its way
back up to close down 0.17 percent, or 9.7 points, at 5770.2.
</P>
<P>
A 4 percent slide on Tuesday in New York's technology-dominated
Nasdaq set the scene for some sharp early selling in London.
</P>
<P>
Concerns that future mergers between rampant US Internet firms
would now go through at less attractive premiums sparked the move.
</P>
<P>
The Footsie languished in the red for almost the entire session
as a result. "This is a very nervous market with plenty of sellers
out there," a trader in the City said.
</P>
<P>
German shares remain in the red on the back of Wall Street's
weak performance on Tuesday and growing fears of a strike in
Germany's largest union, representing electricity and metal
workers.
</P>
<P>
The Xetra Dax closed down 36.63 points at 4814.04. The market
is currently very dependent on what Wall Street is doing and
additional pressure is coming from the possibility of strikes in
the metal industry, analysts believe.
</P>
<P>
Paris investors took heart in Wall Street's tentative recovery
to pare some early losses. But the Cac 40 still ended down nearly
1 percent, at 3999.41 as traders continued to fear a possible US
interest rate hike.

<HEADLINE> Sterilization Could Spread CJD: UK Findings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The temperatures routinely used
to sterilize surgical instruments in British hospitals might
actually help spread CJD, the human form of madcow disease,
scientists in Scotland have found.
</P>
<P>
David Taylor of the Institute for Animal Health in Edinburgh
found that increasing the temperature of the autoclave actually
made it harder to destroy CJD prions, New Scientist magazine said
in a report Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In one experiment, the researchers heated infected tissue
samples to 134 Celsius for nine, 18 and 30 minutes. After the
process, the samples were not infectious. But when the experiment
was repeated at 138 Celsius, the tissue was still infectious.
</P>
<P>
The standard temperature range for autoclaving instruments in
the UK is 134 Celsius to 138 Celsius.
</P>
<P>
Taylor believed the slightly higher temperature "fixed" the
prion, the infectious agent that causes CJD, allowing chemical
links to form that made the molecules more stable.
</P>
<P>
In terms of surgical instruments, Taylor said that a strong
solution of sodium hydroxide for one hour followed by autoclaving
at 136 Celsius for one hour is fairly effective.
</P>
<P>
At the moment, the only completely safe way to deal with
contaminated items is to throw them away, he said.
</P>
<P>
Concerns about infected instruments were raised January in
Britain when it was discovered that CJD existed in more parts of
the human body than was previously thought.
</P>
<P>
The research showed that the infection is present in the lymph
tissues, not just in the central nervous system, and could be
spread through medical or surgical procedures.
</P>
<P>
That finding prompted calls for disposable instruments to be
used in surgical procedures involving tissue in the body's
lymphatic system.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Approves Bill Benefiting Businesses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives approved on Wednesday a bill that would make it
tougher for the federal government to impose new costs on
businesses and consumers.
</P>
<P>
In its first major legislative action of the year, the House
passed the bill by a vote of 274-149, with 67 Democrats joining
207 Republicans in support.
</P>
<P>
The "Mandates Information Act" requires congressional
committees and the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) to report on
how legislation affects consumers, workers and businesses.
</P>
<P>
It allows lawmakers to raise a parliamentary objection called a
point of order to any bill that the CBO has not studied or which
costs the private sector more than $100 million in a year.
</P>
<P>
A point of order prompts a 20-minute debate, and if sustained,
can effectively kill a bill.
</P>
<P>
The bill faces an uncertain future in the Senate and opposition
from the Clinton administration, which says it does not properly
balance the costs of legislation with intended benefits to the
public.
</P>
<P>
The House defeated, by 216-203, an amendment that would have
allowed members to raise similar objections to bills that could
weaken existing health, safety and environmental laws.
</P>
<P>
It also rejected, by 216-210, an amendment that would have made
it more difficult to raise points of order and stated that such
objections could not cut off debate on a bill.

<P>
WASHINGTON, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Two Republican senators
declared Wednesday they would vote to acquit President Bill
Clinton of both articles of impeachment, the clearest sign yet as
the Senate trial neared an end that the charges would fall far
short of conviction.
</P>
<P>
Senators James Jeffords of Vermont and Arlen Specter of
Pennsylvania were the first Republicans to announce opposition to
both articles -- perjury and obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who went on trial in the Senate on January 7, is
charged with perjury and obstruction of justice in the two
articles of impeachment in connection with his relationship with
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky. The two articles were
approved by the House along partisan lines on December 19 last
year.
</P>
<P>
Jeffords said enough Republicans may join them to hold the
final roll calls on Thursday or Friday short of even a majority of
51 votes. Only a constitutional two-thirds -- 67 votes in the
100-member Senate -- could convict and oust Clinton, the second
president in history to be put on trial.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Senator Slade Gorton, a Republican, has disclosed
that he will vote to convict Clinton for obstruction but to acquit
for perjury.
</P>
<P>
With solid support among the Senate's 45 Democrats, the
president has long been out of danger of conviction. Failure to
deliver a simple majority for either article in the Senate,
controlled by 55 Republicans, would be a stinging repudiation of
the case that the Republican House voted to take to trial and its
13 prosecutor-congressmen argued to the senators.

<P>
With Clinton's acquittal assured, Democrats continued their
campaign for a formal vote to censure the president after the
trial. But Republican opposition seemed to be stiffening, and
Specter said censure would violate the constitutional doctrine of
separation of powers.
</P>
<P>
Democratic leader Tom Daschle is hoping for at least a
procedural vote before lawmakers adjourn for a week-long vacation,
a roll call that would allow Democrats to go on record condemning
the president's behavior while acquitting him at his trial.
</P>
<P>
With Chief Justice William Rehnquist presiding, the Senate
spent a second day behind closed doors, senators taking turns
delivering their final statements. Majority Leader Trent Lott told
reporters at a midday break that 26 to 28 lawmakers had spoken at
that point in the closed-door deliberations. He said he hoped a
final vote was still possible by late Thursday, although he
indicated it could slip to Friday.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Defends Mexico's Effort in Combating Drug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. State Department
on Wednesday defended Mexico's commitment to combating drug
trafficking and the level of its cooperation with U.S. law
enforcement officials in response to a newspaper's criticism for
lack of success.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post said on Wednesday described the results of
Mexico's counter-drug effort as "dismal". It said that by almost
any measure, Mexico made no significant progress in reducing drug
trafficking, indicating the U.S.-Mexican cooperation in anti-drug
war had been a failure.
</P>
<P>
But State Department spokesman James Rubin said there was "a
difference between cooperation and success."
</P>
<P>
Rubin said it is hard to overestimate the challenge facing
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
"We all need to bear in maid that there is the sheer magnitude
of the drug trafficking problem that both Mexico and the United
States are confronting together," he said.
</P>
<P>
"While we're both devoting huge resources to combating the
problem, the traffickers have billions of dollars at their
disposal and are entirely unprincipled as they ply their elicit
trade," he added.
</P>
<P>
Rubin also praised the "courageous leadership" of Mexican
President Ernesto Zedillo, who he said was "strongly committed" to
countering what Mexicans see as their No. 1 security threat.
</P>
<P>
"And they are cooperating more closely with the United States
at virtually every level than ever before," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said there had been extensive behind-the-scenes
cooperation on multiple, ongoing Drug Enforcement Administration
cases. He said Mexico had agreed to transfer Mexican prisoners in
several cases to appear as witnesses in U.S. trials.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Mexican Interior Secretary Francisco Labastida held
talks on Wednesday with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright.
</P>
<P>
Counter-drug cooperation was high on the agenda during their
meeting. The meeting also laid the groundwork for a visit to
Mexico this weekend by President Bill Clinton.

<HEADLINE> S. Leonean Rebels Launch Attacks on Diamond Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The rebels in Sierra Leone
renewed attacks on the eastern diamond town of Kenema Wednesday
after President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah agreed on peace talks with the
rebels, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
"Heavy fighting is now going on for the town as the ECOMOG
(west African peace-keeping force) troops and the Kamajors
(traditional hunters' militia) are fighting back to hold the town
against the rebel invasion," an ECOMOG spokesman was quoted as
saying Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Independent sources in the Kenema area said 10 civilians were
killed in cross fire on Tuesday whereas the ECOMOG spokesman said
40 rebels had been killed.
</P>
<P>
The rebels in Sierra Leone captured the diamond capital of
Koidu last year before marching on the capital Freetown last
January.
</P>
<P>
Observers said the fall of Kenema would put much of the
country's diamond production in rebels' hands, a trump card ahead
of peace talks offered by Kabbah in a weekend broadcast speech to
the nation.
</P>
<P>
Kabbah's spokesman Septimus Kaikai called the attacks
unfortunate, saying, "this means that the rebels are not ready to
talk peace with the government."
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Head of State General Abdulsalami Abubakar has said he
would like to pull his troops out of Sierra Leone before he hands
over the power to a democratically elected government in May.
</P>
<P>
With the new developments, Kabbah had been pressed to negotiate
a new peace accord with the rebels, an alliance of the
Revolutionary United Front and soldiers who toppled Kabbah in May
1997.
</P>
<P>
Kaikai said Kabbah and a Nigerian envoy had discussed a venue
for the meeting between the government and the rebels, adding that
there is a possibility of Libya or Guinea as the Nigerian envoy
earlier visited Libya.

<HEADLINE> Trio of Ultrasound Beams Could Destroy Tumors: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 10 (Xinhua) -- A trio of ultrasound beams
could destroy tumors without endangering surrounding healthy
tissue, British scientists said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
By using high intensity focused ultrasound, the new system
would allow surgeons to reach brain lesions with minimal surgical
intervention, researchers from Imperial College, London, told the
New Scientist magazine.
</P>
<P>
The beams individually are not strong enough to damage tissue.
But enough energy is absorbed to destroy the cancerous cells at
the focal point where the three beams cross.
</P>
<P>
It can target diseased areas of tissue with an accuracy of 0.5
millimeters, New Scientist said.
</P>
<P>
The ultrasound destroys tumor cells by a process known as
ablation, which combines straightforward heating with a mechanical
stress effect called stasis.
</P>
<P>
A drawback of the HIFU technique is that some surgery is still
needed. However, this would not be necessary if it was used to
treat cancers as liver or prostate, the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
So far the new system has only been tried on gels with similar
absorption characteristics as human heads. The scientists are now
looking for funding to test it on human cadavers.

<HEADLINE> Drug Used in Organ Transplant May Increase Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 10 (Xinhua) -- A drug used after organ
transplants to suppress the immune system to prevent rejection may
promote tumor growth, U.S. scientists said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Cyclosporine, one of the most effective and commonly used
immunosuppressants, might increase cancer risk by increasing the
body's production of a protein, researchers from Cornell
University, New York, wrote in a letter to the scientific journal
Nature.
</P>
<P>
The protein, called transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta),
seems to alter the behavior of cancerous cells, the researchers
said.
</P>
<P>
Their studies showed that cyclosporine makes cells more likely
to divide, change shape and spread, and it makes them invasive.
</P>
<P>
They also found that in mice, cyclosporine enhanced tumur
growth in a way that could be reversed with an antibody that
blocked the action of TGF-beta, suggesting that the effect is
indeed TGF-beta dependent.

<HEADLINE> Two U.S. Republican Senators Not to Vote to Acquit Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Two U.S. Republican
Senators announced Wednesday they would reject the two articles of
impeachment against President Bill Clinton -- perjury and
obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
In the second day of the final debate in the Senate trial
against Clinton, Senators James Jeffords of Vermont and Arlen
Specter of Pennsylvania said they would not support allegations of
perjury and obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who went on trial in the Senate on January 7, is
charged with perjury and obstruction of justice in the two
articles of impeachment in connection with his relationship with
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky. The two articles were
approved by the House along partisan lines on December 19 last
year.
</P>
<P>
Specter, citing the laws of Scotland, said there could be
"three possible verdicts: guilty, not guilty, not proved."
</P>
<P>
"Given the option in this trial, I suspect many senators would
choose `not proved' instead of `not guilty,'" the Pennsylvania
Republican said in a statement that he planned to deliver on the
Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
Jeffords said Clinton had committed shameful acts but his
offenses "do not reach the high standard of impeachment."
</P>
<P>
The Senate is expected to vote on the two articles on February
11 or 12. A two-thirds vote is needed to convict Clinton and
remove him from office. No one believes there are enough votes in
the Senate to remove Clinton.

<HEADLINE> American Airlines Goes to Court to Seek End to Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 10 (Xinhua) -- American Airlines asked a
federal judge to order its pilots to stop calling in sick in a
dispute that forced the carrier to cancel 900 more flights
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
AMR Corporation, the airline's parent company, asked U.S.
District Judge Joe Kendall for a temporary restraining order and
asked that the pilots be held in contempt of court if they
continued to call in sick.
</P>
<P>
AMR attorney Dee Kelly also asked for damages, saying that the
airline is losing money every day of the "sickout." American
pilots are barred by federal law from striking over the issue.
</P>
<P>
"They're threatening to bring the airline to a complete halt,"
Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
After hearing the company's request, Kendall called a two-hour
break in the hearing and invited the two sides to talk during that
time.
</P>
<P>
The latest strife between American and its pilots -- which has
resulted in travel delays for more than 200,000 passengers -- has
now grounded about than 2,500 flights since last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Talks stalled last Friday over when pilots from the recently
acquired Reno Air would be upgraded to the pay scale received by
American's pilots. The next day, many pilots began calling in sick
and refusing to fly voluntary overtime.
</P>
<P>
The number of cancellations has escalated each day. On Tuesday,
more than 800, or 36 percent of its 2,250 daily flights, were
canceled, delaying 73,000 travelers. on Wednesday, it was
estimated that 40 percent of the flights, or roughly 900, would be
canceled.
</P>
<P>
American's 9,400 pilots, represented by the Allied Pilots
Association, said the airline's parent company, AMR Corporation,
should add Reno Air pilots to its roster more quickly, thereby
moving all employees up on its pay scale.
</P>
<P>
Across the nation, would-be passengers spent hours dozing on
terminal carts stuffed with luggage or slumped in their chairs.
From Miami to San Francisco, blinking blue letters on airport
monitors read "Canceled" beside a long list of destinations.

<HEADLINE> Canada Prohibits Water for Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Canada Wednesday announced a
strategy to prohibit the bulk removal of water -- including water
for export -- from Canadian watersheds.
</P>
<P>
The new strategy includes:
</P>
<P>
-- Amendments to the International Boundary Waters Treaty Act
to give the federal government regulatory power to prohibit bulk
removals from boundary waters, principally the Great Lakes;
</P>
<P>
-- A joint reference, with the United States, to the
International Joint Commission to study the effects of water
consumption, diversion and removal, including for export from
boundary waters;
</P>
<P>
-- A proposal to develop, in cooperation with the provinces and
territories, a Canada-wide accord on bulk water removals to
protect Canadian watersheds.
</P>
<P>
"A comprehensive, long-term approach can be developed that
protects our water resources," said Canadian Foreign Minister
Lloyd Axworthy in a release.
</P>
<P>
"Today's federal measures set in train an approach to ensure
the security of Canada's water over the long term," added the
foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
Canada will continue to work through international
institutions, such as the United Nations Commission on Sustainable
Development and the United Nations Environment Program, to promote
sustainable use of freshwater. The federal government will seek
opportunities to share Canadian expertise in water technology and
services, particularly with countries facing water challenges,
said the release.
</P>
<P>
Canada's watersheds contain about 9 percent of the world's
renewable water resources and 20 percent of the world's total
freshwater resources, including waters captured in glaciers and
the polar icecaps.

<HEADLINE> Ghana Loses 40 PC of Yam Yield </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 10 (Xinhua) -- About 40 percent of Ghana's
yam production is lost to diseases and pest, according to a
research carried out on the control of yam diseases.
</P>
<P>
It said diseases and pests constitute the second biggest
constraint facing yam production and marketing in Ghana, the
Ghana News Agency (GNA) reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed to reporters in Tamale, northern Ghana,
Wednesday by Dr Jeffery Peters, head of the yam disease research
team, after a workshop on the control of yam diseases.
</P>
<P>
The workshop, which was attended by agricultural researchers
and farmers, discussed the research findings on yam, which
included health of planting materials, assessment of disease
severity on yam foliage and survey of tubers to determine tuber
yields and health.
</P>
<P>
The research, carried out in the Northern, Upper West and Brong
Ahafo Regions, identified anthracnose (fungus), nematodes and
viruses as affecting yam yield. Peters noted that 10 percent of
farms sampled had anthracnose and 50 percent, nematodes and said
these reduce yield, as well as the marketability and palatability
of the produce.
</P>
<P>
He said yam yields can be increased by over 300 percent in the
country if farmers use seeds from plants that do not have high
level diseased condition.
</P>
<P>
Peters said the next phase of the project, when approved, will
examine the possibilities of establishing clean yam seed farms to
supply to farmers.
</P>
<P>
On storage, he said, the health of the yam field determines the
length of storage, adding that infected yam fields can be treated
using natural products, such as the powdered dry leaves of the
neem and teak.
</P>
<P>
Peters said research has revealed that an overhead storage
system is better than the traditional pit storage system, because
the former controls rodents and has a better aeration which
prevents the yam from getting rotten early.
