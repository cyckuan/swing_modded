<HEADLINE> Author Munro Wins Critics' Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Two years after the National Book Critics Circle  
widened its award to include non-U.S. authors, a second foreigner 
has captured the fiction prize. 
</P>
<P>
	Alice Munro, regarded by many as one of the world's greatest  
short story writers, won the 1998 fiction award Monday for her 
collection ``The Love of a Good Woman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had reason for many years to be grateful to you, the  
American critic,'' the Canadian writer said in a statement read by 
her editor, Ann Close. ``It is this attention of yours that has 
helped me to flourish for the past couple of decades, as an 
unapologetic writer of short fiction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Short story writers rarely get the sales or the acclaim of  
novelists, but Munro has long been admired as a master of narrative 
and psychology. She has often been compared to Anton Chekhov and 
among living short story writers perhaps only William Trevor is 
thought of so highly. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just adore her work,'' said short story writer Lorrie Moore,  
whose ``Birds of America'' was also nominated for the fiction 
prize. ``It's the subtle way she has of talking about the entirety 
of a life and the strange moments a life suddenly pivots upon. And 
as a person documenting and registering the lives of woman 
especially, she's just a genius.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To be eligible for the annual award, a book must be published in  
English for the first time in the United States. Last year's 
fiction winner was Penelope Fitzgerald a British author whose book 
``The Blue Flower'' is a historical novel set in 18th century 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	The three other fiction finalists this year were novelists:  
Michael Cunningham for ``The Hours,'' David Gates for ``Preston 
Falls'' and Lynne Tillman for ``No Lease on Life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the non-nominees were Tom Wolfe, whose ``A Man in Full''  
was the most talked about novel of last year, and Alice McDermott, 
winner of the National Book Award. 
</P>
<P>
	The other winners announced at the New York University Law  
School ceremony included Philip Gourevitch, who won the general 
nonfiction prize for ``We Wish to Inform You That Tomorrow We Will 
Be Killed With Our Families: Stories From Rwanda.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The winner for biography/autobiography was Sylvia Nasar for ``A  
Beautiful Mind,'' her biography of John Forbes Nash, Jr., a Nobel 
Prize-winning economist and a diagnosed schizophrenic. 
</P>
<P>
	Village Voice writer Gary Giddins won the criticism prize for  
``Visions of Jazz: The First Century.'' The poetry award went to 
Marie Ponsot for ``The Bird Catcher,'' her first book in 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Book Critics Circle, founded in 1974, is a  
not-for-profit organization of book editors and critics with some 
400 members nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	There are no cash prizes for the NBCC awards.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus in Cheese Export Battle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MENIKO, Cyprus (AP) -- Her sleeves rolled up, 63-year-old  
Augustina Nichola crouches over a vat full of fresh goat milk. With 
a slow flame burning underneath, she uses her bare hands to stir. 
</P>
<P>
	Slowly, the milk begins to solidify and Nichola starts removing  
slabs of a creamy substance that she wraps in white cloths and 
places under square marble tiles to squeeze out any liquid that 
remains. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the way to make traditional halloumi cheese, the Cypriot  
delicacy that has for centuries been a staple on this eastern 
Mediterranean island. 
</P>
<P>
	Cypriots say halloumi is unique to the island but, as they try  
to export it, they've wound up in an international trademark 
battle. Other cheese makers -- faraway Danes -- say Cyprus' halloumi 
is much like other Mediterranean cheeses and thus deserves no 
special cachet. 
</P>
<P>
	Halloumi has a salty tang and its rubbery texture gives it an  
unusual property: it can be grilled or fried without melting. If 
made of goat milk only, as tradition dictates, it can keep for up 
to a year without refrigeration. 
</P>
<P>
	In the village of Meniko outside Nicosia, Nichola has been  
making halloumi for 18 years at a small farm with a herd of 300 
goats. It's a family business like hundreds of similar operations 
across the island. 
</P>
<P>
	Combined, they meet half the domestic demand for halloumi. The  
remainder of the $10 million local market is supplied by big 
manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We make it the traditional way,'' Nichola proudly declares,  
saying mass-produced halloumi is too moist and goes bad unless 
refrigerated because it also contains sheep and cow milk. 
</P>
<P>
	The steady stream of buyers at the farm in the foothills of the  
Troodos mountains testifies to the quality of her cheese. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't supply supermarkets or even small grocery stores.  
People just come here from Meniko and surrounding villages to 
buy,'' says Anna Kambari, part of the family that owns the farm 
where Nichola works. 
</P>
<P>
	Halloumi is almost a national symbol for Cyprus' 700,000 people.  
It is found in virtually every home, thanks to its surprisingly 
varied use -- Cypriots eat it fresh with watermelon and figs, use it 
in sandwiches and omelets, eat it grilled or fried, and even grate 
it for pasta dishes. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite its versatility, the cheese remains little known in most  
of the world, but that's changing. 
</P>
<P>
	Halloumi is showing encouraging signs of turning into a growth  
export, with markets as far afield as the Persian Gulf, the United 
States, Brazil and West Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	Cypriot exporters most want to break into the mainstream market  
in the United States and western Europe, where ethnic Greek and 
Middle Eastern communities remain the main halloumi buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Cyprus exported 2,240 tons of halloumi, nearly half to  
Arab countries. Only 91 tons went to the United States, where 
authorities in 1990 awarded Cyprus halloumi an exclusive trademark. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have recently entered gourmet shops in selected U.S. cities  
in the hope that halloumi will be noticed and picked up by the big 
supermarket chains,'' said Mylonas Pittas. 
</P>
<P>
	His Pittas Dairy Industries has built a $20 million plant in  
hopes of expanding export sales. 
</P>
<P>
	But the way ahead for Cypriot halloumi depends in part on  
fending off assaults by rival producers in Turkey and Denmark. That 
means obtaining trademark recognition in Europe and preventing 
halloumi from becoming a generic name like, for example, Greece's 
feta cheese. 
</P>
<P>
	Pittas and Panicos Hadjicostas of the Christis dairy, another  
big concern, say cheese from Denmark and the Turkish-occupied north 
of Cyprus is competing with their halloumi in key markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Danish dairy producers have challenged the U.S. trademark  
awarded to Cyprus halloumi, and the case has dragged on for seven 
years, involving expert witnesses from Greece, Cyprus, Egypt and 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis Droushiotis, head of the Cyprus trade office in the  
United States, said in a telephone interview from New York that a 
verdict in the halloumi case is expected soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the meantime,'' he said, ``a seven-ton trial shipment of  
halloumi is on its way to Brazil, where a large Arab community 
makes it an extremely promising market.''

<HEADLINE> J. Peterman Founder Is Fired </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- In a little more than 24 hours, John  
Peterman went from about-to-be-unemployed to employed to fired. 
</P>
<P>
	Peterman said Sunday that he had been ousted from J. Peterman,  
the catalog retailer that he founded in 1987, within a day of the 
company's rescue from bankruptcy liquidation by last-second buyer 
Paul Harris Stores Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Peterman's revelation marked the end of a tumultuous week. It  
began with J. Peterman headed for near-certain liquidation and 
climaxed Friday with Paul Harris giving new life to the upscale 
retailer of nostalgic clothing and accessories by purchasing the 
company for $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``This whole thing has been such a roller coaster that,  
actually, this didn't surprise me,'' John Peterman said of his 
ouster in a telephone interview Sunday. ``We thought we had a 
miracle at the end, but I guess there are no miracles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peterman said Paul Harris chief financial officer Thomas McCain  
told him during a phone conversation Saturday that the 300-store 
chain, which sells casual clothing for women, would need two to 
three months to decide whether it wanted Peterman to remain. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, `I'm surprised. That's not what you said yesterday in  
doing the deal,''' Peterman recounted. ``He said maybe there was a 
misunderstanding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peterman said he later was told that he is not considered part  
of the new company's ``go-forward scheme.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain did not return a message left at his office seeking  
comment. Paul Harris scheduled a news conference for this morning 
to discuss the Peterman acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
	Peterman, a 57-year-old former marketing executive and minor  
league baseball player, started his company in 1987 by selling 
cowboy-style canvas duster coats in the back pages of The New 
Yorker and The Wall Street Journal. The company's influential 
catalog features poetic descriptions of the items for sale and 
artistic drawings of the merchandise, but it became most famous for 
being satirized on the television series ``Seinfeld.'' 
</P>
<P>
	J. Peterman filed for protection from its creditors in federal  
bankruptcy court in January, saying a slowdown in catalog sales and 
delays in a planned 70-store retail expansion had caused a cash 
crunch. 
</P>
<P>
	Peterman blamed the main backer of the retail expansion,  
Chicago-based Heller Financial, which he said got cold feet and 
tightened the company's credit, forcing it to seek protection under 
Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. 
</P>
<P>
	When Peterman was unable to find a buyer to keep the company  
going, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge William S. Howard ordered Friday's 
liquidation auction. There, Paul Harris came forward with its late 
offer to buy the company and keep it in business. 
</P>
<P>
	Peterman said he will stick with his plan from last week, when  
he thought J. Peterman was going to be liquidated. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to write the book and I'm going to start another  
business,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> `Analyze This' No. 1 at Box Office / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Robert De Niro's portrayal of a neurotic mob  
boss who turns to Billy Crystal for therapy beat the teen 
love-games flick ``Cruel Intentions'' to finish No. 1 at the 
weekend box office, estimates showed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Analyze This'' earned $17.7 million in its debut, far ahead of  
the ``Cruel Intentions'' opening of $13.2 million, according to 
figures released Sunday by Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The comedy was a victory of sorts for both De Niro and Crystal,  
outdoing their most recent openings by millions. De Niro's action 
thriller ``Ronin'' debuted with $12.7 million and Crystal's ``My 
Giant,'' opened with $3.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cruel Intentions,'' the latest film geared toward a teen  
audience, failed to beat the openings of other recent teen films 
such as ``She's All That'' and ``Varsity Blues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, ``Cruel Intentions'' did bring in more than the $11  
million it reportedly cost to make. It stars Sarah Michelle Gellar, 
Ryan Phillippe and Reese Witherspoon and sets the plot of the 
love-games story ``Les Liaisons Dangereuses'' against a Manhattan 
prep school. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Nicolas Cage's dark ``8mm,'' about a private  
investigator who infiltrates the porn subculture in search of a 
runaway girl, finished No. 3 with $7 million. Though it lost 51 
percent of its audience in its second week, studio officials 
remained optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is really all to the benefit of Nick Cage,'' said Ed  
Russell, Columbia's executive vice president of publicity. ``He has 
really driven the audience into a very intriguing film.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Other Sister,'' a love story about two mentally challenged  
people starring Juliette Lewis, was in fourth place with $5.6 
million. It lost just 15 percent of its audience in its second 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the face of competition like 'Analyze This' and the adult  
market, I think we did very well. I think it's about word of mouth. 
The public does it for you,'' said Chuck Viane, senior vice 
president of distribution for Buena Vista Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the box office was down 8.5 percent from last year,  
when the megahit ``Titanic'' was still packing theaters. 
</P>
<P>
	Here are estimated grosses at North American theaters for Friday  
through Sunday. Final figures were expected Monday: 
</P>
<P>
	1. ``Analyze This,'' $17.7 million.  
</P>
<P>
	2. ``Cruel Intentions,'' $13.2 million.  
</P>
<P>
	3. ``8mm,'' $7 million.  
</P>
<P>
	4. ``The Other Sister,'' $5.6 million.  
</P>
<P>
	5. ``Payback,'' $4.1 million.  
</P>
<P>
	6. ``October Sky,'' $3.7 million.  
</P>
<P>
	7. ``My Favorite Martian,'' $3.6 million.  
</P>
<P>
	8. (tie) ``Message in a Bottle,'' $3.4 million.  
</P>
<P>
	8. ``Shakespeare in Love,'' $3.4 million.  
</P>
<P>
	10. ``She's All That,'' $2.6 million.

<HEADLINE> White Couple Loses Black Foster Kid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A black former cocaine addict won her battle  
against a politically powerful white couple for custody of her 
3-year-old son Monday in a case that raised sensitive questions of 
race, influence and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Judith Brawka said child-welfare experts placed too little  
emphasis on black culture when they recommended that the black 
youngster remain with city Alderman Edward Burke and his wife, 
state Appellate Judge Anne Burke. 
</P>
<P>
	The Burkes -- one of Chicago's most politically powerful couples  
-- have cared for the boy since he was 8 days old and had wanted to 
adopt him. 
</P>
<P>
	Brawka also said the boy, known as Baby T, needs to be with his  
8-year-old brother, who is also being returned to their mother, 
37-year-old Tina Olison. 
</P>
<P>
	``His relationship with his brother is a sweet note in an  
otherwise discordant symphony,'' said Brawka, a suburban Kane 
County judge brought in to decide the case because of its heavy 
political overtones in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge ordered a 12-month transition period and warned Ms.  
Olison that the transfer of custody could be called off if it 
doesn't seem to be working out. 
</P>
<P>
	Burke is one of the longest-tenured alderman on the City Council  
and chairman of its powerful Finance Committee. His office did not 
return a call seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Only the state Department of Children and Family Services, which  
picked the Burkes as foster parents, can appeal. The agency has 30 
days to do so and has not yet made a decision, said agency 
spokeswoman Maudlyne Ihejirika. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Olison is a single mother who lost custody of her boys three  
years ago because of her cocaine use. Baby T had the drug in his 
system when he was born. She has said she now is drug-free and has 
found religion. 
</P>
<P>
	``When God is for you, he's greater than the weight of the world  
against you,'' she told reporters. She blamed the Burkes' influence 
for delaying the decision for two years. ``It was pure political 
clout,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge was critical of the Children and Family Services  
Department for delays in the case, which she said should have been 
resolved sooner. She also was critical of a departmental report 
that gave short shrift to the boy's racial background in deciding 
his fate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless the position of the department is that there is no such  
thing as African-American culture, this issue deserves more 
attention than to check a box that says not applicable,'' said 
Brawka, who is white. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple, who were not in court, had sought to have Ms. Olison  
declared unfit. But last November, the judge found Ms. Olison a fit 
mother. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge told Ms. Olison not to celebrate the decision and  
instead concentrate on being a good mother. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is not a prize that you have won,'' the judge said. ``He is  
not the spoils of war after a battle. He is a human being.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the hearing, though, Olison said, ``I do feel joyful -- you  
can't tell a person how to feel.'' She added: ``I just thank God 
for the chance to have a relationship with my child. This means 
more to me than anything.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Jets Bomb Iraqi Military Sites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- U.S. warplanes today bombed several Iraqi  
air defense sites in the northern, no-fly zone of Iraq, a U.S. 
military statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Air Force F-15s fired precision-guided bombs in  
self-defense at Iraqi anti-aircraft artillery sites around Saddam 
Lake near the northern Iraqi city of Mosul, the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	All coalition planes returned safely to the southern Turkish  
base, said 1st Lt. David Westover from Incirlik, where the U.S. and 
British planes are stationed. 
</P>
<P>
	The allied aircraft patrol the no-fly zones to prevent the Iraqi  
air force from operating over northern and southern Iraq. The zones 
were set up after the 1991 Gulf War to protect the Kurdish minority 
in the north and Shiite Muslim rebels in the south. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraq does not recognize the zones and regards the patrolling  
planes as intruders. Since mid-December it has been challenging the 
allied planes almost daily, provoking retaliatory strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	On Feb. 28 and March 1, the planes hit communication control  
centers of an oil pipeline, cutting the flow of oil through Turkey 
for a few days. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States said the sites were used for military  
purposes. Iraq denied that.

<HEADLINE>  Baseball Legend Joe DiMaggio Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Joe DiMaggio, the elegant Yankee Clipper whose 56-game hitting  
streak endures as one of baseball's greatest records, died today at 
his home in Hollywood, Fla. Joltin' Joe has left and gone away, as 
the song said, at age 84. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio, who underwent lung cancer surgery in October and  
battled complications for weeks afterward, died shortly after 
midnight, said Morris Engelberg, his longtime friend and attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	At his bedside were his brother, Dominick, a former major league  
outfielder; two grandchildren; Engelberg; and Joe Nacchio, his 
friend of 59 years. 
</P>
<P>
	A funeral will be held Thursday in his native Northern  
California, with burial to follow in the San Francisco area. 
</P>
<P>
	``DiMaggio, the consummate gentleman on and off the field,  
fought his illness as hard as he played the game of baseball and 
with the same dignity, style and grace with which he lived his 
life,'' said Engelberg, DiMaggio's next-door neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
	During his 99 days in the hospital, DiMaggio suffered several  
setbacks from lung infections and even fell into a coma briefly, 
but he astounded his doctors by repeatedly bouncing back. At one 
point, NBC reported in error that he had died. 
</P>
<P>
	When DiMaggio left the hospital Jan. 19, he was invited by New  
York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner to throw out the ceremonial 
first ball at the Yankees' home opener April 9. After DiMaggio came 
home from the hospital, a sign was placed on his bed saying ``April 
9 Yankee Stadium or Bust.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steinbrenner said today he visited a weak but alert DiMaggio  
five days ago to remind him of the invitation. 
</P>
<P>
	``He just smiled,'' Steinbrenner said.  
</P>
<P>
	Baseball commissioner Bud Selig said DiMaggio, as the son of an  
immigrant, ``represented the hopes and ideals of our great 
country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I never saw a player who was as graceful. There was an aura  
about him that was amazing. I idolized him. He'll always be my 
all-time favorite,'' Selig said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hall of Fame flag in Cooperstown, N.Y., was lowered to half  
staff and a wreath was placed around DiMaggio's plaque. U.S. flags 
at Yankee Stadium, including one at Monument Park in left field 
where another plaque honors DiMaggio, were at half staff as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Red Sox slugger Ted Williams said there was no one he  
``admired, respected and envied more'' than DiMaggio. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Yankees' center fielder roamed the basepaths for 13  
years through 1951, missing three seasons to serve in World War II. 
During that time he played for 10 pennant winners and nine World 
Series champions, batted .325 and hit 361 home runs. 
</P>
<P>
	But more than anything it was The Streak, during the magical  
summer of '41, that riveted a country fresh from the Depression and 
elevated him from baseball star to national celebrity. 
</P>

Marilyn Monroe, a storybook marriage that failed all too quickly 
and left him brokenhearted. For years after she died in 1962, 
DiMaggio sent roses to her grave but refused to talk about her. 
</P>
<P>

in literature and song, including Paul Simon's lament to lost

<P>
	Indeed, but his legend stands -- shoulder-to-shoulder with the  
likes of Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig and very few others who could 
measure up to them on the sports scene this century. 
</P>
<P>
	He won three American League Most Valuable Player awards,  
appeared in 11 All-Star games and entered the Hall of Fame in 1955. 
For half a century, he was introduced as ``the greatest living 
player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet DiMaggio's exceptional numbers don't account fully for his  
almost legendary place on the American cultural landscape, the 
reason why Simon sang about him and Ernest Hemingway wrote about 
him. There was something about the courtly bearing of this son of 
Italian immigrants that made him special. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like to take the great DiMaggio fishing,'' the ancient  
Cuban fisherman says in Hemingway's ``The Old Man and the Sea.'' 
``They say his father was a fisherman. Maybe he was as poor as we 
are and would understand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A handsome man of quiet strength -- unpretentious, proud and  
intensely private -- DiMaggio embodied the kind of hero parents 
wanted their sons to emulate. He had class, on and off the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Though unusually shy, DiMaggio also could come across as your  
friendly neighbor, as he did in his later years, touting the 
virtues of a savings bank and ``Mr. Coffee'' on television to a 
generation that never saw him play. In more recent years, he 
devoted himself to his grandchildren and four great-grandchildren 
and to raising money for the Joe DiMaggio Children's Hospital in 
Hollywood, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio's only child was a son, Joe Jr., from his first  
marriage to Dorothy Arnold, an actress he met while working on a 
movie, ``Manhattan Merry-Go-Round,'' in 1937. Their marriage ended 
in divorce. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't seek the limelight, but lived his life slipping into  
and out of it, uncomfortable when it shined on him. The story goes 
that when Monroe squealed delightedly that she had been cheered by 
tens of thousands of troops in Korea, and told DiMaggio he couldn't 
imagine what that was like, he deadpanned, ``Oh, yes, I can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No ballplayer ever heard more cheers than DiMaggio did during  
The Streak. There was a song written about it, and crowds waited 
for him to come to town. In city after city, he kept The Streak 
alive, getting at least one hit in every game from May 15 until 
July 17 in Cleveland -- 56 games. No one has come close since. 
</P>
<P>
	During an appearance in 1991, commemorating the 50th anniversary  
of The Streak, DiMaggio expressed surprise it was still a record. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of great ballplayers,'' he said. ``One day,  
someone's going to come along and break it. But I've been saying 
that for 50 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pete Rose fell 12 games short of tying DiMaggio during his best  
challenge in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	During The Streak, DiMaggio batted .408 with 91 hits in 223  
at-bats, 15 homers and 55 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	It took a pair of remarkable fielding plays by third baseman Ken  
Keltner in the 57th game to stop DiMaggio. He then immediately 
began another streak of 16 games -- meaning he batted safely in 72 
of 73 games. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no demonstration of disappointment that day in  
Cleveland's Municipal Stadium when Keltner robbed him of two hits. 
That typified the stoic DiMaggio, who rarely displayed emotion. 
</P>
<P>
	A rare departure from the DiMaggio cool was captured on what is  
probably the most famous film clip of his career. It was one of the 
greatest plays in World Series history -- a game-saving catch by 
Brooklyn's Al Gionfriddo in 1947 -- and a broadcast classic by Red 
Barber. 
</P>
<P>
	``Back, back, back, back, back, and he makes a one-handed catch  
against the bullpen. Oh-ho, doctor!'' Barber said. 
</P>
<P>
	The camera caught DiMaggio kicking the dirt in an ever-so-gentle  
display of frustration as he neared second base. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio arrived in New York in May 1936, at age 21. He  
introduced himself to Yankees fans with two singles and a triple in 
his first game, and never slowed until retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	Before DiMaggio, baseball's biggest stars were men like Ty Cobb  
and Babe Ruth. Although his accomplishments rivaled theirs in many 
ways, DiMaggio's style was in sharp contrast. 
</P>
<P>
	Cobb and Ruth were colorful, larger-than-life characters, one a  
belligerent, short-tempered man who played the game with a 
vengeance, the other a gregarious, party-going slugger who set the 
standard for all home-run hitters. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio was quiet and reserved with a gift for making  
everything look easy, whether it was an over-the-shoulder catch of 
a 400-foot drive or a home run to the deepest part of 
then-cavernous Yankee Stadium. He also had a strong, accurate arm 
rarely challenged by base runners. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was out there to play and give it all I had,'' he said in  
1991. ``I looked at it like `I'm doing my best.' If I got the hit, 
fine. I always felt good that I had given my best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only twice did DiMaggio bat less than .300. He accumulated 3,948  
total bases and drove in 1,537 runs. He finished his career with 
2,214 hits. 
</P>
<P>
	He was the MVP in 1939, 1941 and 1947. He was the AL batting  
champion in 1939 with a .381 average and in 1940 at .352. He led 
the league in RBIs in 1941 with 125 and in 1948 with 155. He had 
the most homers in the league in 1937 with 46 and in 1948 with 39. 
</P>
<P>
	There were other records, and undoubtedly there would have been  
even more had he not volunteered for Army service during World War 
II. Though bothered by stomach ulcers part of the time, he spent 2 1/2 
years in the Army's physical training program for air cadets. 
</P>
<P>
	Paying tribute to DiMaggio and Williams in a 1991 White House  
salute, President Bush said their military service ``deprived them 
of even greater statistics, but also enhanced their greatness in 
the eyes of Americans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio battled a string of injuries during his career, and  
seven times missed opening day. He underwent three operations 
within two years for bone spurs in his heels and bone chips in his 
arm. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1949, an inflamed heel kept him sidelined for 65 games. When  
he returned to the lineup, his home run helped the Yankees beat 
Boston 5-4, and he went on to bat .500 in their three-game series. 
It was as if he'd never been gone. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio decided to call it quits at age 37. It was not a sudden  
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``The old timing was beginning to leave me, and my reflexes were  
beginning to slow up,'' he explained. 
</P>
<P>
	By the end of his last season, he said, ``it had become a chore  
for me to play. 
</P>
<P>
	``I found it difficult getting out of bed in the morning,  
especially after a night game,'' he said. ``I was full of aches and 
pains.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees won the World Series in his final year, and he  
finished with a flourish. He hit a home run in the fourth game, and 
had six hits in 11 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio was born on Nov. 25, 1914, in Martinez, Calif. His  
father operated a fishing boat in San Francisco and expected his 
sons to follow in his footsteps. But Joe and brothers Vince and Dom 
spent most of their time playing baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	The elder DiMaggio called it ``a bum's game,'' but he lived to  
see all three of his boys become professional players. Dom, the 
youngest, played with the Boston Red Sox. Vince, the eldest, was 
with five National League teams. 
</P>
<P>
	New York actually took a chance by signing Joe. He had been a  
star with the San Francisco Seals of the Pacific Coast League, and 
once had a 61-game hitting streak. But a knee injury scared off all 
but the Yankees. They signed him for $25,000 -- one of the greatest 
bargains in baseball history. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio earned $7,500 in his first year, but got $100,000 in  
each of his final three seasons, making him the highest-paid player 
of his time. He made more than that in recent years just for 
signing his name at baseball memorabilia shows. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees retired his No. 5 in 1952.  
</P>
<P>
	Long after retiring as a player, DiMaggio served briefly as a  
vice president and coach for the Oakland A's, and as a member of 
the board of directors of the Baltimore Orioles. When he was not 
traveling, DiMaggio lived alone in his home on exclusive Harbour 
Island, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides his brother, Dom, survivors include his son, Joe Jr.;  
two grandchildren, Paula and Cathy; and four great-grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
	In lieu of flowers, the family asked that donations be made to  
the Joe DiMaggio Children's Hospital and to the Hospice Care of 
Broward County, Fort Lauderdale, Fla.

<HEADLINE> Church Addresses Gay Elder Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) -- A gay elder whose election to the  
governing board of a Presbyterian church was challenged received 
hugs and handshakes after a church court upheld his position. 
</P>
<P>
	Wayne Osborne, 38, enjoyed warm support as he made his way down  
the center aisle of the First Presbyterian Church before the start 
of services Sunday. He said he was gratified by Saturday's 
decision, but still concerned about other gay church members who 
may face resistance. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are still people under the weight of this,'' Osborne  
said. ``I think many gays and lesbians will find hope from this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two members of the congregation had challenged Osborne's  
election, saying his sexual orientation violates a new amendment to 
the Presbyterian Church constitution that bans practicing 
homosexuals from holding church office. 
</P>
<P>
	The Southern New England Presbytery's permanent judicial  
commission rejected the challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	``While Osborne has acknowledged his homosexual orientation,  
this disclosure falls far short of the self-acknowledgment of an 
unrepentant homosexual practice established by Amendment B as a bar 
to church office,'' the commission said. 
</P>
<P>
	The church does not regard being gay as a sin, but does maintain  
that homosexual practice is a sin. 
</P>
<P>
	Church leaders acknowledged the issue has been a divisive one  
for the congregation. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an issue, as far as the whole Presbyterian Church is  
concerned, that's not going to go away anytime soon,'' said the 
Rev. Blair Moffett, co-pastor. 
</P>
<P>
	William Prey, an advisor to the two complainants, said they are  
considering an appeal.

<HEADLINE> Y2K Nuclear Stand-Down Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Year 2000 computer crisis gives the United  
States and other nuclear powers a rare chance to get together and 
take their nuclear weapons off alert, a lawmaker said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	A nuclear stand-down is the only sure way to avoid a mishap on  
Jan. 1, 2000, when computers not upgraded to read the new 
millennium date could malfunction, Rep. Ed Markey, D-Mass., said at 
a Capitol Hill symposium on nuclear aspects of the so-called Y2K 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Kraig of the British American Security Information  
Council agreed that no matter what precautions are taken, 
``computer errors are by their very nature idiosyncratic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The real cure,'' he said, ``is to take the weapons off  
alert.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Experts at the symposium concurred with Pentagon assessments  
that, even in Russia, which is well behind the United States in 
correcting Y2K problems, it is highly unlikely that computer 
glitches will result in spontaneous missile launches or explosions 
in missile silos. 
</P>
<P>
	But Bruce Blair of the Brookings Institution said the Russian  
early-warning system, backed by thousands of missiles on 
hair-trigger alert, is especially susceptible to the computer bug. 
That, coupled with breakdowns in the cooling systems of 72 or 73 
deactivated Russian submarines, Blair said, raises ``the 
possibility of multiple Chernobyls.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blair said the Russian government is not ready to embrace the  
idea of a nuclear stand-down but has said it would discuss it with 
other nuclear powers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon as well is not receptive. But Pentagon spokesman  
Bryan Whitman said the military is looking at ways to prevent any 
unauthorized launch connected with Y2K problems. 
</P>
<P>
	A group of Russians is coming to Washington this month to  
discuss U.S. proposals, including one that would have Russian 
scientists set up at a special facility in Colorado during December 
and January to monitor U.S. nuclear weaponry into the new 
millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Defense Secretary John Hamre told a Senate hearing last  
month that ``our nuclear command and control system has been 
thoroughly tested and has performed superbly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A report this month by Congress's General Accounting Office,  
while faulting the Pentagon for being slow in fixing some of its 
computer systems, praised tests carried out by the North American 
Aerospace Defense Command. ``Year 2000 date rollovers worked 
properly, and NORAD officials were able to recover and continue the 
mission when testing problems occurred,'' the GAO said. 
</P>
<P>
	Speakers at the symposium urged the Nuclear Regulatory  
Commission to adopt a more assertive approach to assuring that 
nuclear power plants in this country are safe and that adequate 
backup systems will be in place. 
</P>
<P>
	David Lochbaum of the Union of Concerned Scientists alleged that  
the NRC has audited only 12 of 103 operating nuclear plants to 
assure their preparedness. The agency ``needs to change from being 
a spectator to being a regulator,'' Lochbaum said. 
</P>
<P>
	The NRC's executive director for operations, William Travers,  
testified in Congress last month that the commission is confident 
that all plants will be Y2K ready by October. Should noncompliance 
be spotted, he said, the NRC is ready to act and even shut down 
plants if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	NRC officials said inspectors will check on Y2K fixes at all the  
plants this spring.

<HEADLINE>  Baseball Legend Joe DiMaggio Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Joe DiMaggio, the elegant Yankee Clipper whose 56-game hitting  
streak endures as one of baseball's greatest records, died today at 
his home in Hollywood, Fla. Joltin' Joe has left and gone away, as 
the song said, at age 84. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio, who underwent lung cancer surgery in October and  
battled complications for weeks afterward, died shortly after 
midnight, said Morris Engelberg, his longtime friend and attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	At his bedside were his brother, Dominick, a former major league  
outfielder; two grandchildren; Engelberg; and Joe Nacchio, his 
friend of 59 years. 
</P>
<P>
	A funeral will be held Thursday in his native Northern  
California, with burial to follow in the San Francisco area. 
</P>
<P>
	``DiMaggio, the consummate gentleman on and off the field,  
fought his illness as hard as he played the game of baseball and 
with the same dignity, style and grace with which he lived his 
life,'' said Engelberg, DiMaggio's next-door neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
	During his 99 days in the hospital, DiMaggio suffered several  
setbacks from lung infections and even fell into a coma briefly, 
but he astounded his doctors by repeatedly bouncing back. At one 
point, NBC reported in error that he had died. 
</P>
<P>
	When DiMaggio left the hospital Jan. 19, he was invited by New  
York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner to throw out the ceremonial 
first ball at the Yankees' home opener April 9. After DiMaggio came 
home from the hospital, a sign was placed on his bed saying ``April 
9 Yankee Stadium or Bust.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steinbrenner said today he visited a weak but alert DiMaggio  
five days ago to remind him of the invitation. 
</P>
<P>
	``He just smiled,'' Steinbrenner said.  
</P>
<P>
	Baseball commissioner Bud Selig said DiMaggio, as the son of an  
immigrant, ``represented the hopes and ideals of our great 
country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I never saw a player who was as graceful. There was an aura  
about him that was amazing. I idolized him. He'll always be my 
all-time favorite,'' Selig said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hall of Fame flag in Cooperstown, N.Y., was lowered to half  
staff and a wreath was placed around DiMaggio's plaque. U.S. flags 
at Yankee Stadium, including one at Monument Park in left field 
where another plaque honors DiMaggio, were at half staff as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Red Sox slugger Ted Williams said there was no one he  
``admired, respected and envied more'' than DiMaggio. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Yankees' center fielder roamed the basepaths for 13  
years through 1951, missing three seasons to serve in World War II. 
During that time he played for 10 pennant winners and nine World 
Series champions, batted .325 and hit 361 home runs. 
</P>
<P>
	But more than anything it was The Streak, during the magical  
summer of '41, that riveted a country fresh from the Depression and 
elevated him from baseball star to national celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
	He ascended even higher in popular culture in 1954 when he wed  
Marilyn Monroe, a storybook marriage that failed all too quickly 
and left him brokenhearted. For years after she died in 1962, 
DiMaggio sent roses to her grave but refused to talk about her. 
</P>
<P>
	His swanky swing and classy countenance inspired wistful lines  
in literature and song, including Paul Simon's lament to lost 
heroes in ``Mrs. Robinson'' from the movie ``The Graduate'': 
</P>

	``Where have you gone Joe DiMaggio?

the league in RBIs in 1941 with 125 and in 1948 with 155. He had 
the most homers in the league in 1937 with 46 and in 1948 with 39. 
</P>
<P>
	There were other records, and undoubtedly there would have been  
even more had he not volunteered for Army service during World War 
II. Though bothered by stomach ulcers part of the time, he spent 2 1/2 
years in the Army's physical training program for air cadets. 
</P>
<P>
	Paying tribute to DiMaggio and Williams in a 1991 White House  
salute, President Bush said their military service ``deprived them 
of even greater statistics, but also enhanced their greatness in 
the eyes of Americans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio battled a string of injuries during his career, and  
seven times missed opening day. He underwent three operations 
within two years for bone spurs in his heels and bone chips in his 
arm. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1949, an inflamed heel kept him sidelined for 65 games. When  
he returned to the lineup, his home run helped the Yankees beat 
Boston 5-4, and he went on to bat .500 in their three-game series. 
It was as if he'd never been gone. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio decided to call it quits at age 37. It was not a sudden  
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``The old timing was beginning to leave me, and my reflexes were  
beginning to slow up,'' he explained. 
</P>
<P>
	By the end of his last season, he said, ``it had become a chore  
for me to play. 
</P>
<P>
	``I found it difficult getting out of bed in the morning,  
especially after a night game,'' he said. ``I was full of aches and 
pains.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees won the World Series in his final year, and he  
finished with a flourish. He hit a home run in the fourth game, and 
had six hits in 11 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio was born on Nov. 25, 1914, in Martinez, Calif. His  
father operated a fishing boat in San Francisco and expected his 
sons to follow in his footsteps. But Joe and brothers Vince and Dom 
spent most of their time playing baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	The elder DiMaggio called it ``a bum's game,'' but he lived to  
see all three of his boys become professional players. Dom, the 
youngest, played with the Boston Red Sox. Vince, the eldest, was 
with five National League teams. 
</P>
<P>
	New York actually took a chance by signing Joe. He had been a  
star with the San Francisco Seals of the Pacific Coast League, and 
once had a 61-game hitting streak. But a knee injury scared off all 
but the Yankees. They signed him for $25,000 -- one of the greatest 
bargains in baseball history. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio earned $7,500 in his first year, but got $100,000 in  
each of his final three seasons, making him the highest-paid player 
of his time. He made more than that in recent years just for 
signing his name at baseball memorabilia shows. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees retired his No. 5 in 1952.  
</P>
<P>
	Long after retiring as a player, DiMaggio served briefly as a  
vice president and coach for the Oakland A's, and as a member of 
the board of directors of the Baltimore Orioles. When he was not 
traveling, DiMaggio lived alone in his home on exclusive Harbour 
Island, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides his brother, Dom, survivors include his son, Joe Jr.;  
two grandchildren, Paula and Cathy; and four great-grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
	In lieu of flowers, the family asked that donations be made to  
the Joe DiMaggio Children's Hospital and to the Hospice Care of 
Broward County, Fort Lauderdale, Fla.

<HEADLINE>  Mount St. Mary's Faces Spartan Task </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EMMITSBURG, Md. (AP) -- Mount Saint Mary's doesn't have the size,  
speed and talent of most teams in the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	When it comes to coaching, however, the Mountaineers have the  
winningest guy in the business. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Phelan, who has won 800 games and owns a .644 career winning  
percentage, will make his second appearance in the tournament 
Friday when he leads 15th-seeded Mount St. Mary's (15-14) against 
second-ranked Michigan State in the Midwest regional. 
</P>
<P>
	Phelan has recorded at least 20 wins in 19 of his 45 seasons at  
the Mount and trails only retired legends Dean Smith (879), Adolph 
Rupp (876) and Clarence ``Big House'' Gaines (828) on the career 
victory list. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Phelan's gaudy numbers hardly begin to tell the story of a  
devoted coach who has run a spotless program and helped shape the 
lives of hundreds of young men. 
</P>
<P>
	Fred Carter was playing basketball on the playgrounds of  
Philadelphia in the mid-1960s when Phelan got the 20-year-old high 
school dropout to check out the Mount's cozy campus in the hills of 
western Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter became the first black to enroll in the school, starred  
for four seasons and went on to both play and coach in the NBA. He 
remains close friends with Phelan to this day. 
</P>
<P>
	``He transcends just being a coach. You talk about a father  
image -- my Dad died when I was 16 and coach Phelan was there for 
me. He's always been there for me,'' Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
	These days, Phelan has another project: center Melvin Whitaker,  
who enrolled after spending two years in jail for slashing a 
University of Virginia football player with a box cutter on a 
recruiting visit there. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitaker, like Carter, had all but abandoned hope of a college  
career when Phelan came along and offered him a shot at redemption. 
</P>
<P>
	``How wonderful, coach Phelan's willingness to help people,''  
Carter said, his voice cracking with emotion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Melvin, like Fred, is a guy working on a second chance,''  
Phelan said. ``He really appreciates the opportunity. I think he 
likes not being at a prominent place like Raleigh or Durham.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Same with Phelan, who long ago laid to the rest the notion of  
coaching at a bigger school. Phelan interviewed at the Mount in 
1954, immediately took the job and has since spurned subsequent 
offers from more prominent institutions. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been wonderful to be out of the limelight. Out here in  
the country I can do as I please,'' he said. ``I was a city-slicker 
the first 24 years of my life -- it was great growing up in south 
Philly -- but now I live in a totally different world and I couldn't 
be happier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phelan, 69, skillfully avoids talk about retirement, so it seems  
as if his trademark bow-tie will remain a part of Mount games for 
at least another year or two. 
</P>
<P>
	``If my wife had her way I'd be doing it until I was 85, just so  
I'd be out of her way at home,'' he joked. 
</P>
<P>
	``How long can he stay? As long as he feels like it,'' said Jack  
Sullivan, Class of '57 and the school's career scoring leader. ``As 
long as he feels as if he can contribute and give something to the 
kids, he'll be out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The game has changed dramatically since Phelan began drawing up  
plays on the blackboard in the 1950s. So have the athletes. Yet 
Phelan has managed to cope with it all, tweaking his playbook 
through the years while maintaining a solid rapport with players 
young enough to be his grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been able to withstand the test of time,'' Carter said.  
``For a guy to coach four decades, almost four generations, it just 
shows how well he's been able to make the adjustment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Phelan's first year, he transformed a 15-11 team into a 23-4  
powerhouse. The rest, as they say, is history. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got off to a good start, and it started a long love affair  
between me and this place,'' he said. ``It's still going on, too.''

<HEADLINE> One Devil of a Game for Florida A&AMP;M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- With his team about to clinch its first  
trip to the NCAA tournament, Florida A&AMP;M coach Mickey Clayton had 
something else on his mind -- getting his brother to put down a 
sign. 
</P>
<P>
	There he was -- Craig Clayton, standing in a crowd of Rattlers  
fans at the Mid-Eastern Conference tournament, waving a sign for a 
national television audience that read, ``We Want Duke.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The coach's jaw almost hit the floor.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's been in a mental asylum most of his life,'' Clayton  
joked. ``He had just been released for the game, and he went right 
back at midnight. I said, 'What's wrong with you, boy? We want to 
go and advance, but we don't want Duke.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Alas, Duke is what Florida A&AMP;M got.  
</P>
<P>
	Meet the Rattlers (12-18), your 1999 NCAA tournament Cinderella  
story. 
</P>
<P>
	They started 1-13, including losses in their first 10 games.  
Four players were sidelined with injuries, leaving the team with 
only nine. Clayton nearly missed his flight to the MEAC tournament 
in Richmond, Va., because he was in a car accident on his way to 
the airport. 
</P>
<P>
	But somehow, the Rattlers knocked off the conference's top three  
teams, edging first-place South Carolina State in Saturday's 
tournament final. 
</P>
<P>
	Next up is a first-round date Friday with the Blue Devils in  
Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Some say Duke is the best team ever to appear in the tournament.  
Some say Florida A&AMP;M is the worst. At least one oddsmaker had the 
spread at 47 points Monday, one of the highest ever. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's talk about David and Goliath, and the only thing we  
can do is carry big rocks,'' Clayton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've heard it'll be the largest margin of victory ever in an  
NCAA tournament game. That puts a lot of pressure on Duke,'' 
Clayton said. ``If the game is even allowed to be close, people 
will wonder what happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With most of the students out of town for spring break, word  
spread slowly about the Rattlers. Few fans greeted the team at the 
airport upon its return from Richmond. 
</P>
<P>
	But when the tournament brackets appeared in Monday newspapers,  
Clayton's office became inundated with calls. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have a secretary, so when they call, the next voice  
they hear is mine,'' said a tired-looking Clayton, adding he hasn't 
slept since Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The team held its first NCAA practice Monday, and some of the  
players wondered whether the Blue Devils were doing the same. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do you think Duke has got game tape on us?'' wondered  
sophomore point guard Morris Scott, who ranks sixth in the NCAA 
with 90 steals. 
</P>
<P>
	Monroe Pippins, the outstanding player of the MEAC tournament,  
said he has always followed coach Mike Krzyzewski and the Blue 
Devils. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love Duke,'' Pippins said. ``I've been a Duke fan since I  
was 5 years old. I have a lot of respect for coach K., but he 
probably doesn't know who the hell I am.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gaither Gymnasium, where the Rattlers play, isn't any larger  
than a typical high school gym. Some of the dusty wooden bleachers 
are beginning to split, and before practice, an assistant coach 
sweeps the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	The players had to practice without water bottles Monday because  
someone had broken the door to the equipment locker. 
</P>
<P>
	Clayton calls his nine active players the ``Noble Nine.'' Since  
the team's equipment manager also sustained a recent injury, the 
Rattlers don't even have enough for a full scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
	Sports has never been the top priority for this historically  
black school, which is perhaps most famous for its ``Marching 100'' 
band. The coach said the college graduated more blacks students 
than any other school last year, and eight of the nine basketball 
players are members of the honor roll. 
</P>
<P>
	Clayton sees the athletic success as a bonus.  
</P>
<P>
	``Your athletic department is basically your PR department for  
you institution,'' said Clayton, a third-generation alumnus who 
played for the Rattlers in the 1970s and coached the women's team 
before taking over the men's program in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The players aren't under any illusions. They know not a single  
No. 1 seed has ever lost to a No. 16 seed in the first round. They 
know Duke is one of the deepest teams around, and Florida A&AMP;M has 
only nine players. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Rattlers are playing to win -- even though their coach  
says he would be just as satisfied with a full-effort loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anything's possible,'' Scott said. ``We're all athletes. We  
wake up, put on our clothes, eat. They're not cyber-athletes or 
something like that.''

<HEADLINE> N.Y. Fans Remember DiMaggio Fondly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- This was Joe DiMaggio's city and his fans -- even  
those who never saw him play -- knew his place in a town where 
baseball has meant so much. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a legend,'' said Mike DiPalma, a banker from Manhattan,  
making his way through Rockefeller Center. ``It's not every day 
someone like him comes along. It isn't easy to replace a legend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio died Monday at 84, and on a cold morning word of his  
death spread across the city where he became synonymous with the 
New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, one of New York's most visible Yankee  
fans, called DiMaggio the ``greatest baseball player who 
represented the very best of American sports.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He was the personification of Yankee pride,'' Giuliani said.  
``He led his team to greatness. He set records, which may never be 
broken. And he was always a man of dignity and class. He was also a 
good friend to New York City.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former Mayor Ed Koch said that although he was never much of a  
baseball fan, DiMaggio was a man worthy of admiration. 
</P>
<P>
	``He represented the best in America,'' Koch said. ``It was his  
character, his generosity, his sensitivity. He was someone who set 
a standard every father would want his children to follow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the Grand Central Terminal, fans remembered DiMaggio not just  
as one of baseball's greatest, but as a symbol of a more innocent 
time in sports. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was what baseball was all about before we got to that  
high-priced stuff,'' said George Ladino, a former Bostonian who now 
lives in London and makes his living from mutual funds. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's one of the greatest players of all time,'' said Doug  
Connor of Irvington, who works in the financial industry. ``It's 
the passing of a person from a time when baseball was the way it 
should be, when there was a higher ethical and moral standard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio died at home of complications from lung surgery. During  
his hospital stay he rallied several times from near death. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very sad, but maybe it's good for him because he was  
really sick.'' said Marty Gray, a Brooklyn resident. 
</P>
<P>
	A man buying tickets at Yankee Stadium said there was no one  
like Joe D. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was the greatest of all time,'' said the man, identifying  
himself only as Richard from Yonkers. ``I saw him play in his last 
year (1951). I thought he was the greatest then and he's still the 
greatest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the tributes to DiMaggio on Monday was a new life-size  
statue of DiMaggio, complete with wooden bat, that went on display 
at ``Mickey Mantle's'' restaurant in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	American flags were at half-staff all around Yankee Stadium; and  
a ``Farewell to Joe DiMaggio ... Joltin ' Joe -- 1914-1999'' message 
flashed on an electronic billboard advertising Yankee games on the 
Major Deegan Expressway in the Bronx. 
</P>
<P>
	A proposal to rename Manhattan's West Side Highway the ``Joe  
DiMaggio Highway'' was introduced in the state Legislature last 
month and has picked up support in both the state Senate and 
Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
	Author Joe Dorinson, who wrote ``Jackie Robinson: Races, Sports  
and the American Dream,'' said DiMaggio ``truly epitomized the 
`Hemingway Hero.' He confronted adversity with grace under 
pressure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added: ``In an era when Mussolini was the dominant political  
image, Joe DiMaggio offered the positive counter image in terms of 
Italian heritage. He lifted Italian-Americans to mainstream status. 
Indeed, the reason why so many Italian-Americans from Brooklyn, 
including Giuliani, became Yankee fans was because of Joe 
DiMaggio.''

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Rally at Open / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain futures and soybeans were higher in early  
trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat opened higher with followthrough support from Friday's  
strong close and feelings among market participants that recent 
price downturns were overdone, analysts said. Wheat was also 
supported by talk of dry weather in U.S. growing areas and news 
that Pakistan is in the market for either U.S., Austrailian or 
Canadian wheat. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean futures received support from mild export business and a  
rallying soy oil market. Gains were expected to be limited, 
however, on news of beneficial weekend rains in Argentina and ahead 
of Thursday's U.S. Agriculture Department crop production report, 
which analysts expect will show increased South American output. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures followed wheat and soybeans higher. Grains were  
also supported by an upcoming snow storm that is expected to limit 
movement of grains in the central United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for May delivery was up 2 3/4 cents at $2.70 1/2 a bushel; May  
corn was 1 3/4 cents higher at $2.17 3/4; May oats were up 1/2 cent at 
$1.06 a bushel; May soybeans were up 5 cents to $4.69 1/2 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Live cattle and feeder cattle were higher in early trading on  
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange today, while lean hogs and prok 
bellies were also on the plus side. 
</P>
<P>
	April live cattle was up 0.60 cent to 68.37 cents a pound; March  
feeder cattle rose 0.37 cent to 72.82 cents a pound; April lean 
hogs were up .18 cent to 43 cents a pound; March pork bellies fell 
.73 cents to 50.80 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> More Fighting in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Mortar and small-arms fire broke out  
in Kosovo along the Macedonian border today, and Yugoslavia's 
president shrugged off the threat of NATO airstrikes to restate his 
opposition to foreign troops policing a peace deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Special U.S. envoy Christopher Hill also was encountering  
resistance in trying to persuade Kosovo Liberation Army commanders 
to accept a U.S.-backed peace plan, and U.S. peace broker Richard 
Holbrooke was reported en route to Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	A senior Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity,  
said rebel commanders still had problems accepting the plan, which 
negotiators hope will bring peace to Kosovo after a year of 
fighting with Serbs that has killed at least 2,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	The diplomat said stumbling blocks included rebel misgivings  
about Russian participation in a NATO-led peacekeeping force and 
the requirement that the guerrillas surrender weapons to the 
peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
	The KLA said the fighting started at dawn around Kacanik, near  
the province's border with Macedonia. Observers with the 
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe reported 
hearing mortar and small-arms fire from a distance. 
</P>
<P>
	One of their spokesmen, Alexander Benz, said detonations could  
be heard from four villages that are believed to be rebel 
strongholds. He said the Yugoslav army had prevented the monitors 
from reaching the villages. 
</P>
<P>
	Trying to push the sides toward agreement, German Foreign  
Minister Joschka Fischer arrived in Belgrade, Yugoslavia's capital, 
for talks with Yugoslav officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S.-sponsored proposal offers autonomy but not full  
independence for Kosovo Albanians, which outnumber the Serbs 9-to-1 
in the secessionist-minded province. 
</P>
<P>
	Before meeting Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, Fischer  
said the plan is ``the last chance'' for peace in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	Fischer said Milosevic told him that Holbrooke would be in  
Belgrade by Tuesday. The American troubleshooter is expected to 
deliver a firm message to Milosevic that NATO will strike in case 
he doesn't accept the Kosovo peace plan in full, including the 
deployment of NATO troops to police the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	But, Fischer said, ``We encountered an opinion (in Belgrade)  
that a political agreement is possible without military 
implementation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a fatal mistake'' by Milosevic, he added.  
</P>
<P>
	Milosevic has adamantly rejected foreign troop deployment,  
saying Yugoslavia would consider that an act of aggression. 
Holbrooke's reported arrival indicates Milosevic still stands firm 
in his defiance. 
</P>
<P>
	The two were key players in forging the Bosnia peace deal in  
1995 and an October cease-fire agreement in Kosovo that averted 
imminent NATO airstrikes against Serbian targets. 
</P>
<P>
	Contrary to Clinton administration expectations, the rebels did  
not sign the deal on Sunday, when KLA leaders met with 
representatives of William Walker, the U.S. chief of international 
monitors in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The refusal of the ethnic Albanians to accept the plan was a  
major setback for the United States during last month's talks in 
Rambouillet, France. It also undercut U.S. efforts to threaten 
Milosevic with airstrikes if he did not accept the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Moderate Kosovo Albanian politicians have said they would sign  
if the rebels are on board. But the rebels have long been wary of 
the deal, because it requires them to disarm and falls short of 
full independence. 
</P>
<P>
	The accord has also been hindered by Albanian demands for a  
referendum on independence after three years, which Western powers 
oppose. 
</P>
<P>
	A second round of Kosovo talks in France are expected to begin  
March 15.

<HEADLINE> FTC, Intel Reach Proposed Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Intel Corp. and the Federal Trade Commission  
said today they have agreed to a proposed settlement over 
government charges that the nation's largest computer chipmaker 
illegally bullied three other companies into handing over secret 
information about their products. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel and the FTC announced the settlement on the eve of the  
company's antitrust hearing before an administrative law judge in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The company and the FTC jointly filed a motion to withdraw the  
government charges that were filed June 8, said FTC spokeswoman 
Michelle Muth. She could not discuss details of the settlement, 
which must be approved by commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
	That approval is expected within two weeks. It would be highly  
unusual for commissioners to reject a recommended settlement from 
the agency's own Bureau of Competition. They could approve the 
settlement during a formal meeting or they could circulate it for 
signatures. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel also declined to talk about the settlement's contents.  
</P>
<P>
	The FTC's statement described ``remaining issues under  
investigation,'' a veiled reference to what's widely believed to be 
a much broader antitrust probe of Intel's business behavior in the 
nation's technology industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``We continue to cooperate with them on that as they continue to  
request documents,'' Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy said, adding that 
the pending settlement agreement was related only to the June 8 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency said its lawyers were ``committed to working  
expeditiously to resolve those concerns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a much broader case the FTC can bring and may bring in  
the future,'' said Steve Newborn, a Washington lawyer who 
represents some of Intel's competitors and has argued for a broader 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Newborn said he wasn't surprised to see the settlement proposed,  
citing the Justice Department's ongoing antitrust case against 
Microsoft Corp., which has faced embarrassing disclosures in the 
courtroom from its internal e-mails and from testimony by some of 
its own executives. 
</P>
<P>
	``They saw what's happened to Microsoft and they didn't want to  
go through that,'' Newborn said. ``I've never thought Intel was 
stupid enough to go to trial in this case. On a simple cost-benefit 
analysis, there was no reason for Intel to be fighting this 
fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the news, Intel stock jumped 3.5 percent, rising $4 to  
$118.62 1/2 a share this morning on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel and the FTC signed the settlement proposal Sunday  
afternoon after telephone negotiations led by Peter Detkin, the 
company's assistant general counsel. 
</P>
<P>
	``The opposition's case has become more and more apparent to the  
other side,'' Mulloy said. ``A few weeks ago, it became apparent 
there was an opening there for discussion, things started falling 
into place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Intel, the world's largest manufacturer of microprocessors, had  
already acknowledged it did most of what the FTC alleged, but the 
company claimed that those actions were not illegal and that its 
business practices had not ``chilled'' innovation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We view this compromise agreement as a 'win-win' for both  
parties and we are satisfied that the agreement gives us value for 
our intellectual property rights. This is acceptable to both 
parties and was the result of constructive dialogue between Intel 
and the FTC,'' said Craig Barrett, president and chief executive 
officer of Intel. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC had alleged that Intel illegally withheld from three  
companies advanced technical information about its upcoming 
microprocessors to ``extort'' valuable technology that the 
companies had developed independently. 
</P>
<P>
	It called the company's actions ``a raw exercise of monopoly  
power to muscle competitors into signing over intellectual property 
rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Intel contended it is legal for the company to decide what  
secrets to disclose to its customers about its upcoming products. 
The company makes processors for more than 80 percent of the 
world's computers and recently introduced its fastest chip ever, 
the Pentium III. 
</P>
<P>
	The three companies allegedly bullied by Intel were Digital  
Equipment Corp., Intergraph Corp. and Compaq Computer Corp., which 
now owns Digital. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for Intergraph, Aggie Frizzell, said the company's  
executives were meeting today with FTC lawyers to discuss the 
proposed settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the legal issues in Intel's case were narrow, the FTC  
faced problems winning the case. 
</P>
<P>
	It filed its lawsuit during a period of unprecedented  
competition facing Intel from rival chipmakers, such as from 
Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and National Semiconductor Corp.

<HEADLINE> Ireland, Britain Sign Treaties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) -- The British and Irish governments,  
determined to drive forward the Belfast peace accord, signed four 
treaties Monday that foresee an era of unprecedented cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
	``An old quarrel between Britain and Ireland is being put to  
rest,'' said Seamus Mallon, a moderate Catholic politician who is 
helping spearhead the efforts to form a Protestant-Catholic 
government for Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sinn Fein party leader Gerry Adams warned that ``we are in  
crisis big-time,'' noting that Wednesday's intended deadline to 
form the government will be missed because of Protestant demands 
for Irish Republican Army disarmament. 
</P>
<P>
	After the treaty-signing ceremony in Dublin Castle -- the seat of  
British power in Ireland until the south won independence in 1922 -- 
Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam conceded that the new target 
date for forming a Northern Ireland administration would be Good 
Friday, April 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``This gives the parties the time and space to find a way  
forward,'' Mowlam said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mallon and David Trimble -- head of Northern Ireland's major  
Protestant party, the Ulster Unionists -- already have been 
appointed to the top two posts that would oversee the 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
	But Trimble, the government's would-be leader, is insisting that  
Sinn Fein cannot assume the two posts it is entitled to until the 
outlawed IRA starts to turn over its weaponry to an independent 
commission. 
</P>
<P>
	The peace accord committed Sinn Fein members to use ``whatever  
influence they may have'' to secure the complete disarmament of the 
IRA by May 2000, but did not specify when the process should begin. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's Anglo-Irish treaty signings underscored the reality  
that, while the British and Irish government are mostly meeting 
their commitments under the peace accord, Northern Ireland's 
politicians have failed to deliver on many of theirs. 
</P>
<P>
	The treaties envision four tiers of new institutions that would  
bring together lawmakers from across Britain and Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the treaties bind together the two parts of Ireland,  
which the north's Catholic leaders hope will encourage the gradual 
absorption of Northern Ireland -- founded in 1920 as a 
Protestant-majority state -- into the Irish Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	One lays down the rules for twice-yearly summits of senior  
politicians from Dublin and Belfast, while the other sets up six 
cross-border committees to pursue common policy-making throughout 
Ireland on practical matters such as waterways and business 
promotion. 
</P>
<P>
	The other two emphasize the growing bonds between Britain and  
Ireland and, unlike the all-Ireland treaties, can't be directly 
blocked by the stalemate in Belfast. 
</P>
<P>
	One establishes a council that would bring together legislators  
from throughout the United Kingdom and the Irish Republic, although 
the body would have no powers. The other calls for the British and 
Irish governments to strengthen their commitment to close 
cooperation through regular summits.

<HEADLINE> Orioles To Play in Cuba March 28 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	For the first time in 40 years, major league baseball will  
return to Cuba when the Baltimore Orioles play the Cuban national 
team on March 28 in Havana. 
</P>
<P>
	After two months of negotiations among the State Department,  
Cuban government, commissioner's office, the Orioles and the 
players' association, the sides finally reached an agreement 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this produces the kind of human results that we're all  
hoping it does, this could be something really big,'' baseball 
commissioner Bud Selig said. ``I'm very proud of the role we will 
play in doing something constructive that transcends baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cuban team will play a return exhibition game at Camden  
Yards. The second game will be played either just before Baltimore 
starts the regular season April 5 or on an off day during the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope that they do come,'' Stanley Hynds, a 25-year-old  
barber, shouted amid the clanging steel drums, trumpet blares and 
impassioned screams Sunday at Havana's Latinoamericano Stadium. 
``It will be a pleasure for us to see them and to see them lose 
right here in this stadium!'' 
</P>
<P>
	The games were planned after the Clinton administration decided  
in January to ease the four-decade-old U.S. trade embargo against 
Cuba. Major league baseball teams used to visit Cuba regularly, but 
the last were the Cincinnati Reds and Los Angeles Dodgers, who 
played exhibition games there in March 1959, about 2 1/2 months after 
Fidel Castro's revolution ousted dictator Fulgencio Batista on New 
Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
	Selig, who plans to attend the game in Havana, said the major  
leagues might schedule additional events in Cuba if this one is 
successful. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are other clubs that want to do this, too,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Several Cubans have defected in recent years and play for major  
league teams, notably Florida pitcher Livan Hernandez, the 1997 
World Series MVP; his half-brother Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez, 
who starred for the New York Yankees in last year's postseason; and 
Tampa Bay pitcher Rolando Arrojo. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're very good players,'' Orioles outfielder B.J. Surhoff  
said. ``If you look around the majors, there are a number of very 
good players with Cuban backgrounds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Castro, Cuba's president and a former baseball player himself,  
has referred to defectors as ``traitors,'' and Cuban officials have 
accused U.S. teams of trying to bribe Cuban players into abandoning 
their country. U.S. agents have helped Cuban players defect when 
they were on tour outside their homeland. 
</P>
<P>
	While salaries in Cuba average $10 a month, Livan Hernandez got  
a four-year contract from the Marlins worth $4,495,000, and Orlando 
got a $6.6 million, four-year deal from the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuban refugees and several congressmen have criticized baseball  
and the Orioles for dealing with Castro and oppose the games. About 
70 people protested Sunday at the Orioles' exhibition game against 
the Florida Marlins in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	``Going to Cuba under the current conditions there is a sign of  
insensitivity and lack of respect for human rights there,'' said 
Huber Matos, a Cuban native who spent 20 years in prison on the 
island for opposing Castro's government. ``It's like taking part in 
the abuses that are going on there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Selig said he understands ``people have all kinds of different  
human and political views.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very sensitive to that. I understand the feelings,'' he  
said in Tampa, Fla. ``We'll take care of the baseball politics and 
let the governments take care of the other issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Proceeds from the two games -- a sticking point in the  
negotiations -- will be used mainly to support baseball and other 
sports activities in the two countries, major league baseball said. 
The Clinton administration did not want profits to go to Castro's 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	Because it's only an exhibition game, Orioles players won't put  
too much emphasis on it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got things I need to get done on the field,'' first  
baseman Will Clark said. ``If I'm one of the guys who has to go 
down there, I'm going to treat it just like another ball game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the deal, two American League umpires and two Cuban  
umpires will work the game, and the Cuban team agreed to use wood 
bats instead of the metal bats it usually hits with, according a 
source familiar with the deal who spoke on the condition he not be 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles and the commissioner's office will pay for the  
improvements at Latinamericano Stadium, such as padding the 
outfield fence, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
	A delegation from major league baseball, the players'  
association and the Orioles probably will go to Havana this week to 
work out logistics and attempt to settle when the game in Baltimore 
will be played.

<HEADLINE> World Indoors a Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MAEBASHI, Japan (AP) -- Double golds in the men's and women's  
distance events. World records in the relays. A couple of big 
upsets. The year's best marks in a dozen events. 
</P>
<P>
	It's official -- the World Indoor Athletics Championships were a  
success, even though they didn't play so well in the stands, which 
were virtually empty until the final day. 
</P>
<P>
	``These World Championships in Maebashi have been the greatest  
ever, both in terms of technical results and competitive 
performance,'' said Primo Nebiolo, head of the IAAF, track and 
field's world governing body. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, the lack of anything near a full house was so glaring  
it brought an exclamation of surprise from Ethiopia's Haile 
Gebrselassie, who pulled off an unprecedented double gold 
performance in the 3,000- and 1,500-meter races. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't expect it to be like this,'' he said after winning  
the 3,000 on the meet's opening day Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gebrselassie added the 1,500 title on the closing day Sunday  
before a larger but still far-from-capacity crowd at the 
20,000-seat Green Dome in this central Japan city. 
</P>
<P>
	Not until the final day did the crowd reach even half of total  
capacity. 
</P>
<P>
	But the lack of interest wasn't due to a lack of excellence.  
</P>
<P>
	The women's distance double went to Romania's Gabriela Szabo.  
She and Gebrselassie are only the second and third athletes to win 
two individual gold medals in the same meet at the championships, 
first held in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 800, fans were provided with a pair of stunning upsets.  
</P>
<P>
	Wilson Kipketer, the Danish world record-holder, was upset by  
South Africa's Johan Botha. Three-time champion Maria Mutola of 
Mozambique was overtaken in the homestretch by Ludmila Formanova of 
the Czech Republic. Formanova's time of 1 minute, 56.90 seconds was 
a meet record and the second-fastest ever run indoors. 
</P>
<P>
	And in the sprints, the second-fastest time ever in the 200 was  
clocked by Frankie Fredericks of Namibia, 20.10 seconds. It was the 
first indoor championship for Fredericks, who had won nine Olympic 
or World Championship medals previously, eight of them silver. 
</P>
<P>
	All told, the United States was the only nation with a  
double-digit performance in medals. Americans won 19. But the gold 
race was a four-way tie among the United States, Romania, Germany 
and Britain with had three apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	Both world records came in the final events of the  
championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Milt Campbell, the silver medalist in the 400, anchored the U.S.  
1,600-meter relay to a world record of 3:02.83, smashing the mark 
of 3:03.05 by Germany at the 1991 championships. Andre Morris, 
Dameon Johnson and Deon Minor ran the other legs for the Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's women's 1,600-meter team, consisting of Tatyana  
Chebykina, Svetlana Goncharenko, Olga Kotlyarova and Natalya 
Nazarova, was timed in 3:24.25, breaking the world mark of 3:26.84 
the Russians set at the 1997 championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Maurice Greene, the world record-holder in the men's 60, came  
back from a poor first-round heat on the final day to add the 
indoor title to his 100-meter outdoor crown. He won in 6.42, a 
championship record, leading a 1-2 U.S. sweep, ahead of Tim Harden. 
</P>
<P>
	America's women had a harder time in the sprints.  
</P>
<P>
	Greece's Ekaterini Thanou capped a brilliant series of sprinting  
by winning the women's 60 in 6.96, the world's fastest this year. 
Americans finished 2-3, with 1993 and 1997 champion Gail Devers the 
runner-up at 7.02 and Inger Miller third at 7.06. 
</P>
<P>
	In the field events, Cuba provided the stars.  
</P>
<P>
	Javier Sotomayor, the world indoor and outdoor record-holder in  
the men's high jump, won his fourth indoor title, clearing 7 feet, 
8 3/4 inches, best in the world this year. 
</P>
<P>
	And in the most dramatic individual event of the championships,  
Cuba's Ivan Pedroso won the men's long jump on the final attempt, 
soaring 28-3 1/2, the second longest ever indoors. The title was 
Pedroso's fourth straight at the championships.

<HEADLINE> Judge Warns Tommy Lee on Alcohol </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MALIBU, Calif. (AP) -- There is no evidence that Tommy Lee  
violated probation by drinking alcohol, a judge said Monday as he 
gave the Motley Crue drummer a stern warning. 
</P>
<P>
	Municipal Judge Lawrence Mira warned another mistake could send  
Lee to prison for three years. The judge said he could find no 
evidence to substantiate allegations that Lee drank alcohol at a 
Miami club with his bandmates, as reported by the New York Post. 
</P>
<P>
	Mira stressed that Lee was not to even enter a place where  
alcohol is sold during his three-year probation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I understand that,'' Lee said.  
</P>
<P>
	``That's probably going to hamper your social life,'' the judge  
said, ``but it's a lot better than what would come from a prison 
commitment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lee pleaded no contest last April to kicking estranged wife  
Pamela Anderson Lee several times during a fight while she held 
their toddler son, Dylan. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to requiring Lee to stay away from alcohol and  
drugs, the judge ordered him to stay at least 100 yards away from 
his estranged wife, attend anger management classes and undergo 
random drug tests.

<HEADLINE> Dow Falls; Nasdaq Jumps / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrials retreated Monday from  
last week's record high as investors took some profits, but the 
broader market indexes shot higher on renewed strength in 
technology shares. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow lost 8.47 points to close at 9,727.61. The blue-chip  
index opened higher, then retreated as much as 61.75 before 
regaining some of the loss in the final hour of trading. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just giving back some of the gains of last Thursday and  
Friday,'' said John Shaughnessy, chief investment strategist at 
Advest Inc. ``But the backdrop of this market continues to be very, 
very solid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index added 7.26 to reach a record  
1,282.73, beating its previous closing high of 1,279.69 set on Jan. 
29. The Nasdaq composite climbed 60.51 to 2,397.62, but is still 
nearly 113 points below its all-time closing high of 2,510.09 made 
on Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks rallied after a weak performance last week.  
Computer-chip maker Intel reached a preliminary agreement to settle 
Federal Trade Commission charges that it had illegally threatened 
to withhold critical information about its Pentium chip unless 
three other companies handed over secret information about their 
products. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel shares climbed 5 to 119 5/8, sparking a broad rally in  
Nasdaq-traded computer stocks. Dell Computer, for example, advanced 
2 3/8 to 45 3/8 in leading volume in Nasdaq trading. On the New York 
Stock Exchange, Dow component IBM rose 1/2 to 178 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
	But in general on the Big Board, two days of spectacular  
back-to-back gains in the Dow couldn't hold. The Dow added a total 
of 460 points on Thursday and Friday, closing the week at a record 
9,736.08. 
</P>
<P>
	Rising bond prices helped push up stocks Friday and were higher  
again Monday. The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond was up 15.63 
cents per $1,000 in value late Monday. Its yield, which moves in 
the opposite direction to price, was 5.59 percent, down from 5.60 
percent on Friday. But that wasn't enough to help blue-chip stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil stocks rose as oil prices continued to climb on signs that  
worldwide oil production will decline. Crude oil for April delivery 
settled at $13.63 a barrel, up 33 cents. Exxon added 1 1/4 to 70 
15/16. 
</P>
<P>
	The stock market was also helped by some takeover news.  
Belgian-Dutch financial services group Fortis agreed to pay $2.8 
billion, or $55 a share, for American Bankers Insurance Group Inc. 
a Miami-based insurer. ABI's shares rose 5 5/8 to 52. 
</P>
<P>
	Allied Waste Industries Inc. said it would pay $7.3 billion, or  
$45 a share, for larger rival Browning-Ferris Industries Inc. 
Browning Ferris shares climbed 4 1/8 to 38 7/8, while Allied Waste's 
shares added 1 15/16 to 16 15/16. 
</P>
<P>
	On the New York Stock Exchange, declining issues outnumbered  
advancers by a 6-to-5 margin. Consolidated Big Board volume was 
moderately heavy at 879.77 million shares, below Friday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index rose 0.96 to 604.10, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 4.77 to 712.18. The Russell 
2000 index of smaller companies rose 2.05 to 400.06. 
</P>
<P>
	In overseas stock markets, the Nikkei 225 index in Tokyo eased  
0.77 percent. In Europe, the DAX index in Frankfurt fell 1 percent, 
the CAC in Paris eased 0.32 percent, but the FT-SE 100 index in 
London inched 0.05 percent higher.

<HEADLINE> Duke No. 1 Seed in East </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Sure, they've already got the best coach in the land. And the  
best defense. And the best big man, a shrewd point guard, a couple 
of lights-out shooters and so many McDonald's high school 
All-Americans that a rival coach calls them ``the all-time burger 
team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And now Duke has a short commute, too.  
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, the NCAA selection committe shipped the Blue Devils  
to the East, which begins next week in Charlotte, N.C., a 90-minute 
bus ride from their campus in Durham, and concludes the week after 
that with the regionals at the Meadowlands in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	Know anything about the recent history of college basketball,  
and this route is practically a guarantee coach Mike Krzyzewski &AMP; 
Co. will be on hand at St. Petersburg, Fla., when the championship 
hardware is being handed out. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1986, coach K has taken Duke to seven Final Fours,  
including all four times the Blue Devils stopped off at the 
Meadowlands. Yet that wasn't what Krzyzewski meant when he went on 
television after the committee finished its handiwork and said, 
``It's all about the journey.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because in this instance, he wasn't measuring the trip by miles,  
but by expectations. Yours, his and everybody else's. 
</P>
<P>
	Let Duke get tripped up somewhere along the way to what would be  
Krzyzewski's third national championship and he knows that's what 
the rest of us will remember. Not the 32-1 record, the 27 straight 
wins, the perfect ACC season and the conference championship -- 
nearly all of them in walkovers. 
</P>
<P>
	But that's where his coaching genius comes in. By making sure  
the Blue Devils revel in every accomplishment instead of run from 
the pressure they bring, he's made the Blue Devils even hungrier to 
see what lies ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	That doesn't mean they'll get there.  
</P>
<P>
	Duke's first test should come in a projected second-round  
matchup against the College of Charleston. Coach John Kresse has 
the little school from South Carolina on a 25-win run of its own, 
including a win over North Carolina, and he's already wearing a 
smile that should send chills down Krzyzewski's back. 
</P>
<P>
	He popped up on another one of the post-selection shows Sunday  
and, while swearing he wasn't looking past first-round opponent 
Tulsa, Kresse clearly had done some of his homework already. He 
quickly reeled off every thing a team would need to beat Duke, the 
last of which, Kresse said through a widening grin, was ``a couple 
of Hail Marys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He won't be close enough at the end of their matchup, but  
Cincinnati could. The only team to beat Duke this season wants the 
chance to try again. The Bearcats' Melvin Levett did it with a dunk 
last November in the Great Alaska Shootout, and he felt a jolt of 
electricity run through the room when the pairings were announced. 
</P>
<P>
	``The guys started smiling a little bit around the room when we  
saw that potential match,'' he said. ``Of course you want to go out 
and prove to everybody that the first time was for real. If the day 
ever came that we do meet, we'll be ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But not ready enough.  
</P>
<P>
	Duke will advance to the Final Four, and whoever comes out of  
the Midwest to meet them won't be fresh enough to keep them out of 
the championship game. Kentucky will be spent getting past Kansas 
and Utah. Michigan State will be worn out by Arizona. The last man 
standing, which will be Kentucky, falls to Duke. 
</P>
<P>
	The South will be less tiring. Maryland will cruise through the  
lower half of the bracket, but run out of steam by the time the 
Terps face Ohio State in the regional. In the West, Connecticut's 
only test will come at the end, when the Huskies face a Stanford 
team they beat by 11 points without their best scorer, Richard 
Hamilton. In this semifinal, the Huskies won't need much from 
Hamilton, either, to set up a Connecticut-Duke final. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Jim Calhoun has been to the Sweet 16 six times, but never  
once to a Final Four. He, too, is a good coach, with the best point 
guard in the country in Khalid El-Amin, a big-time scorer in 
Hamilton, a good big man in Jake Voskuhl, and something to prove. 
</P>
<P>
	And it that doesn't prove enough, there's always the chance that  
the Duke bus will take a wrong turn somewhere on its way to the 
final. It could happen. After all, soon after Duke won the second 
of back-to-back titles in 1992, Brother Ray Page, who taught at St. 
Anthony's High School, revealed that Bobby Hurley, a student of his 
and the point guard on Duke's championship teams, had a terrible 
sense of direction: 
</P>
<P>
	``He once asked me if Beirut was named after that famous  
baseball player who all those home runs.''

<HEADLINE>  DiMaggio Remembered As Shy, Modest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARTINEZ, Calif. (AP) -- A bouquet of daffodils and carnations  
sat beside the ``Joltin' Joe'' on the waterfront Monday, along with 
a note expressing this fishing town's sadness at losing its most 
famous son. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dear Joe, from dear, loyal and loving fans,'' said the note,  
its ink beginning to smear in a cold rain. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe DiMaggio, who died Monday at 84, was born in Martinez in  
1914. Though he moved away as a small child, he often returned to 
fish with his cousins and later donated the 22-foot speedboat to 
the town. 
</P>
<P>
	He had received the boat on Joe DiMaggio Day on Oct. 1, 1949, in  
front of 69,551 fans at Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Harriete Langemeier was one of many Martinez residents who  
visited the ``Joltin' Joe'' on Monday to remember DiMaggio. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tantamount to the country losing the president,''  
Langemeier said. ``He was a hometown hero.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Residents sometimes saw the lanky, white-haired gentleman  
wheeling his shopping cart gently through Longs Drugs, stopping to 
chat with his granddaughter, who worked there. His eyes would focus 
on the floor, avoiding the astonished stares of strangers. 
</P>
<P>
	Or DiMaggio would slip over to Amato's restaurant for a meal.  
He'd sit in the back room, shielded from gawkers and autograph 
hunters. 
</P>
<P>
	He avoided crowds, skipping funerals and showing up unexpectedly  
at the mortuary to pay his last respects. 
</P>
<P>
	``His head was always down, he wouldn't look around. No eye  
contact,'' said Ernie Lasell, who owned a hardware store and used 
to sell DiMaggio his fishing licenses. ``He was just a naturally 
shy guy, very modest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marie Amato Goodman, whose family ran the restaurant that sits  
about 80 yards from dusty two-lane Joe DiMaggio Drive, said he was 
a humble man who ``had the limelight but didn't capture it and go 
with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When he came into the restaurant, my mother grabbed Joe and  
took him in the back,'' said Goodman, a third cousin of DiMaggio. 
``He was very private, unobtrusive in all situations. I think Joe 
never forgot who he was and where he came from, and the loyalties 
that come with family and friends in a small town.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most Americans born before World War II remember DiMaggio as the  
dashing ``Yankee Clipper,'' the man who had a 56-game hitting 
streak and married Marilyn Monroe. Baby boomers think of DiMaggio 
as the guy hawking Mr. Coffee on TV. 
</P>
<P>
	But neighbors and relatives in Martinez knew DiMaggio as the  
quiet son of a Sicilian fisherman. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio was born in Martinez, a middle-class town about 30  
minutes east of San Francisco, on Nov. 25, 1914. On his birth 
certificate, the midwife that delivered DiMaggio listed ``Fishman'' 
as the occupation of his father, Giuseppe DiMaggio. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe DiMaggio was born in a small wood house on Berrellessa  
Street, along the Martinez waterfront. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuseppe and Rosalia Mercurio DiMaggio moved their family to the  
North Beach section of San Francisco when Joe was 1. The area also 
was an Italian enclave in those days. Now it is largely Asian. 
</P>
<P>
	Dante Benedetti played baseball with the DiMaggio boys. The kids  
used to play on a grassy lot next to a creamery when the horses 
were out pulling milkcarts. They used dried horse manure, covered 
with a sack, for bases. 
</P>
<P>
	``You never slid head first into those,'' Benedetti said.  
</P>
<P>
	Benedetti, who owned the New Pisa restaurant in that  
neighborhood, remembers young Joe DiMaggio sitting by himself at 
North Beach Playground, rolling Bull Durham cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because he was such a good player, he was the only one the  
director let smoke during the games,'' Benedetti said. ``He was a 
shortstop. He used to overthrow first base, he had such a strong 
arm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There's a fable that DiMaggio avoided following in his father's  
footsteps only because he got seasick. Benedetti laughs at such 
nonsense, pointing out the $25,000 bonus offered by the Yankees was 
reason enough to stay on land. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know you'd get seasick if somebody offered you $500 a  
month,'' he said. ``After Joe signed, all the fishermen down there 
started to buy their kids gloves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two brothers, Dom and Vince, joined Joe in the major leagues.  
But Giuseppe DiMaggio never really understood. He sent his son a 
letter during his first spring training with the Yankees, in 1936. 
</P>
<P>
	``Come home, Joe,'' the letter said. ``The fish are running.  
Give up this game of baseball. It is for loafers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Benedetti remembers DiMaggio being painfully shy throughout his  
playing days. After his hitting streak in 1941, the residents of 
North Beach threw a testimonial dinner for DiMaggio. When called to 
the microphone, he froze and couldn't speak. 
</P>
<P>
	``He walked by himself. He was a loner,'' Benedetti said. ``You  
couldn't get a word out of him. He talked through his bat and his 
ability to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Benedetti, along with the rest of the neighborhood, attended  
DiMaggio's wedding to actress Dorothy Arnold in 1939 at Sts. Peter 
and Paul Church, whose twin steeples tower over North Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	Gloria Alioto also remembers that wedding vividly, though she  
did not attend. She got married the same day at the same church, 
and her wedding was delayed two hours because of the fanfare 
surrounding DiMaggio's marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio tried to avoid attention during his visits to Martinez,  
though that was sometimes next to impossible. 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Lopas remembers pressing his face to the window in awe as  
newlyweds DiMaggio and Marilyn Monroe strolled from a limousine 
into a neighbor's house in Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
	``Joe just slipped into town and he slipped out,'' Lopas said.  
``The city wanted to claim him, but he didn't claim it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When town leaders proposed building a Joe DiMaggio Museum, the  
former ballplayer didn't offer help or promise any memorabilia, and 
the idea died. 
</P>
<P>
	Mostly, though, mention of DiMaggio brings back memories of a  
classy guy who shunned the spotlight that his talent attracted. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a prime example of what athletes should be like. He's a  
great tribute to baseball and sports in general,'' said Fred 
Scolari, who grew up near the DiMaggio family in North Beach and 
went on to an NBA career from 1946-55. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just the way he commanded respect because I think he gave  
you respect. He sat in a corner and had his Coca-Colas. He didn't 
seek out anybody.''

<HEADLINE> New Battle Brews Over Gun Lawsuits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- As cities sue firearms makers over  
gun-related violence and death, another legal war is breaking out 
over whether state legislatures can block the suits after they are 
filed. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia state lawmakers have passed a law to stop a suit by the  
city of Atlanta and the Louisiana legislature will consider one 
later this month trying to overturn a suit by New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago, Miami, and Bridgeport, Conn. have also filed suits  
against the gun industry, all accusing it of failing to provide 
adequate safety devices on guns. Gun opponents got encouragement 
last month when a jury in New York returned a $4 million verdict in 
a suit by the victim of an accidental gunshot wound. That plaintiff 
said industry negligence in marketing and distribution allowed 
weapons to flow into states with strict anti-gun laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Legal experts say this new struggle between pro-gun legislatures  
and anti-gun cities will probably also be fought out in court, with 
the outcome varying from state to state. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can say that, from this day, you cannot file a lawsuit,''  
said David Logan, a professor at the Wake Forest University law 
school. ``The question is about suits in the pipeline.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New Orleans attorney Dan Abel is among the lawyers suing the gun  
makers. He argues that liability laws define the obligations people 
have to each other and can't be changed after an obligation has 
been breached. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can change them for the future, but you can't change them  
for the past,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	To bolster his contention, Abel pointed to a case in which New  
Orleans residents won $3.4 billion in damages due to a railroad 
tank car fire in the late 1980s. That 1997 verdict held up despite 
the fact that, after the accident, the legislature in the early 
1990s placed severe restrictions on such damage awards, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other side is The National Rifle Association, which  
vehemently opposes the suits against the gun industry. Patrick 
O'Malley, deputy director of the NRA's lobbying arm, said state 
legislatures charter cities and so have the power to define their 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
	In Georgia, the legislature passed a law reserving the right to  
sue gun makers to the state, stripping Atlanta of its ability to 
sue. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Abel contends that legislatures have no right to put  
the interests of any group over the citizens of a city. 
</P>
<P>
	``Traditionally, you can't just pick out a favorite group of  
individuals or parties like the gun industry and say our liability 
laws apply to everyone else, but not to you,'' Abel said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Logan, the law professor, said that's not so. ``They do it  
all the time,'' he said. ``They can say hog farms get treated this 
way and chicken farms get treated this way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	State Rep. Steve Scalise, a Republican sponsor of the Louisiana  
legislation, said his bill uses a different legal theory than 
Georgia's. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of focusing on the powers of cities, it expands on an  
existing state law that limits liability. It bars lawsuits against 
gun makers and sellers if the buyer of the gun use it in a way 
``inconsistent with the purpose for which it was intended,'' in 
other words, using it to commit a crime. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also exempts from suits the sellers and makers of  
weapons without safety devices, thus giving manufacturers immunity 
from damages stemming from accidental shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	Lester Brickman, a professor at the Cardozo Law School of  
Yeshiva in New York, said cities suing gun makers would be on 
firmer legal ground if they managed to get a jury verdict before 
the state law banning the suit is passed. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they had a jury verdict, that would be a property right,  
and they could not undo it,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Benigni, Paltrow Win SAG Awards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The directors have honored the directors, the  
actors the actors and the writers the writers. Now the Oscar 
picture is as clear as it's going to get. 
</P>
<P>
	``Saving Private Ryan'' appears to have the inside track on  
winning best picture at the Academy Awards on March 21, in light of 
Saturday night's Directors Guild of America award to its director, 
Steven Spielberg. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwyneth Paltrow of ``Shakespeare in Love'' is the favorite for  
best actress, after her award Sunday night at the Screen Actors 
Guild ceremony. A surprise SAG award to Roberto Benigni for ``Life 
is Beautiful'' gave a huge boost to his chances, previously seen as 
remote, for an acting Oscar. 
</P>
<P>
	The prospects for supporting acting Oscars for Kathy Bates for  
``Primary Colors'' and Robert Duvall for ``A Civil Action'' are 
also looking brighter after their Screen Actors Guild victories. 
</P>
<P>
	And the screenwriters of ``Shakespeare In Love'' and ``Out of  
Sight,'' honored last month by their peers, are the front-runners 
for the original and adapted screenplay Oscars. 
</P>
<P>
	Spielberg's Directors Guild win was his third. He also was  
honored for ``The Color Purple'' (1985) and ``Schindler's List'' 
(1993). 
</P>
<P>
	Only four times has the Directors Guild winner not repeated at  
the Academy Awards. The winner of the directing Oscar also usually 
sees his film take a best picture award. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Screen Actors Guild awards are still young -- in  
their fifth year -- they are becoming a strong predicator of Oscar 
winners because of a significant overlap of the membership of the 
actors' union and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
	Benigni, the Italian director-actor-writer who created the  
comic-tragic story of a father trying to shield his son from the 
horrors of Holocaust, lifted SAG presenter Helen Hunt and spun her 
around, then said in broken English he was so happy that ``every 
organ of my body is moving in a very bad way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Benigni's award was the biggest surprise and suggested the best  
actor Oscar later this month is a toss-up. He beat such strong 
nominees as Joseph Fiennes (``Shakespeare in Love''), Tom Hanks 
(``Saving Private Ryan''), Ian McKellen (``Gods and Monsters'') and 
Nick Nolte (``Affliction.'') 
</P>
<P>
	Paltrow, awarded for her role as the heiress who falls in love  
with a young William Shakespeare in ``Shakespeare in Love,'' paid 
tribute to her mother, Blythe Danner, as ``the most brilliant, 
beautiful, profound actress I know.'' Paltrow also won a Golden 
Globe and is now a favorite for an Academy Award. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is just such an honor to be recognized by my peers.  
You'll never know quite what this means to me,'' said Paltrow, 
nominated along with Cate Blanchett in ``Elizabeth,'' Jane Horrocks 
in ``Little Voice,'' Meryl Streep in ``One True Thing'' and Emily 
Watson in ``Hilary and Jackie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Shakespeare in Love'' also won the ensemble acting prize for a  
film. 
</P>
<P>
	In other film categories, Bates, the politically savvy campaign  
troubleshooter in ``Primary Colors,'' and Duvall, the tough, 
baseball-loving corporate attorney in ``A Civil Action,'' won 
awards. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just thrilled, absolutely thrilled,'' supporting-actress  
winner Bates said backstage. 
</P>
<P>
	The other supporting actress nominees were Brenda Blethyn for  
``Little Voice,'' Judi Dench for ``Shakespeare in Love,'' Rachel 
Griffiths for ``Hilary and Jackie'' and Lynn Redgrave for ``Gods 
and Monsters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duvall won for supporting actor, beating David Kelly for  
``Waking Ned Devine,'' Geoffrey Rush for ``Shakespeare in Love'' 
and Billy Bob Thornton for ``A Simple Plan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, four of those receiving SAG awards went on to pick up  
Oscars: Jack Nicholson, Helen Hunt, Robin Williams and Kim 
Basinger. Only Gloria Stuart, who shared the supporting actress SAG 
award with Basinger, didn't get an Academy Award.

<HEADLINE> 'Big F' in Road's Name Protested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEDGESVILLE, W.Va. (AP) -- For reasons he thinks are  
embarrassingly obvious, Paul Oliver doesn't want to have to tell 
people he lives on ``Big F Park Road.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Right now he lives along a gravel lane called Beaver Ridge Road.  
Berkeley County wants to change it to Big F Park Road for its new 
911 system. 
</P>
<P>
	Fearing a drop in his property values, Oliver is suing to block  
the name change, which takes effect April 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I saw it was going to be `Big F Park,' I thought right  
away people would take Big F to mean the f-word,'' Oliver says. 
``Ninety-five percent of the people I mention it to just look at me 
and laugh. It can easily be taken -- and often is -- to mean the 
f-word.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Big F Park was suggested by one of Oliver's neighbors as a  
tribute to the late Ocla Fitzwater, who once owned the property 
where the rural development now sits. 
</P>
<P>
	Exactly why the road would be ``Big F'' and not just ``F'' is  
unclear. County officials won't say who suggested the name, and 
apparently he or she is the only person who knows. 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Kackley, the county 911 director, won't comment on whether  
she sees anything offensive in ``Big F Park. She says the change is 
part of an effort to avoid duplicative names and help police, fire 
and rescue crews find a home faster and save lives. 
</P>
<P>
	By renaming 450 streets, the county will avoid duplicating the  
first word of a name, or the first syllable. ``Sunny,'' ``sunrise'' 
and ``sunset,'' for example, are all too close to each other. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had about 33 roads starting with `green,' 30 beginning with  
`cedar,' 28 beginning with `apple,''' Ms. Kackley says. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the names were chosen by a 911 committee; others were  
nominated by residents themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's so late in the game, if we have to go back and change  
streets it will take forever,'' says Berkeley County Commission 
president Wayne Dunham. ``Someone had to take the initiative to 
provide better emergency services. The bottom line is we are doing 
this to save lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oliver's neighbor Margie Moulton says her daughters, ages 11, 13  
and 15, laugh at the name and want it changed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Big F? They're old enough to know what that is,'' she says.  
``I'm not changing my driver's license or anything to Big F Park 
Road. I'm not going to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Depending on a person's sensibilities, some of the other new  
names could be just as offensive. Serious people might might object 
to Daffy Duck Lane. The friendly might take exception to Goa Way. 
The strong could get fighting mad over Wimpy's Lane. 
</P>
<P>
	And like Big F, Trojan's Lane, Peewee Lane or Butts Mill could  
have sexual connotations. 
</P>
<P>
	Oliver, 41, a retired Air Force officer and part-time investment  
adviser, suggested three alternatives to Big F Park but was told 
they were taken. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Moulton suggested other names, too, but was told it was too  
late. She says she received notice of the name change in 
mid-January, but the letter said the deadline to appeal was Dec. 
31. 
</P>
<P>
	The court date for Oliver's lawsuit is March 24.

<HEADLINE> Senators Soaring in NHL Homestretch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	No kidding, the Ottawa Senators look like the real deal. So do  
the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
	Both are playing some of the best hockey in the league as the  
NHL heads into its final quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a hot team, I'll tell you,'' Toronto goaltender Curtis  
Joseph said after Saturday night's 3-1 loss to the Senators. ``They 
play a very patient game and have a lot of speed. They're mobile 
and consistent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senators were expected to do well this season after last  
spring's first-round playoff upset of the New Jersey Devils, the 
top team in the Eastern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	But no one expected them to be the top team in the East at this  
point, and second only to Dallas in the league. Their 36-18-8 
record is already two victories better than their one-season high 
set last season in the sixth year of their existence. 
</P>
<P>
	And they still have 20 games to go.  
</P>
<P>
	Saturday night, the Senators used the same formula as they have  
in a recent 21-5-5 stretch: solid forechecking and solid 
goaltending. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had three 2-on-1s in a short period and I don't think we  
got a shot away on any of them,'' Maple Leafs coach Pat Quinn said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ottawa goaltender Ron Tugnutt lowered his league-leading  
goals-against average to 1.64 by stopping 25 shots against the 
NHL's top offensive team. Tugnutt has lost just twice since Dec. 
26, going 11-2-4 since then. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senators extended their lead to five points over the Maple  
Leafs in the Northeast Division. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ducks have been no less surprising.  
</P>
<P>
	At 30-25-9, they are five games over .500 for the first time in  
their six-year history. Their recent 13-3-0 streak moved them three 
points behind Phoenix for the fourth playoff spot in the West, 
which would give them home-ice advantage in the first round of the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The chemistry on this team is really good,'' said Anaheim  
forward Teemu Selanne. ``We have a really good time together. We 
want to work hard and reach some goals, which we set for ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think our coaching staff has done a great job. They really  
try to push us to reach the next level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mighty Ducks continued their surge with a 3-1 victory over  
defending Stanley Cup champion Detroit on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've definitely got more depth (than previous seasons) and  
they're getting a lot of effective play out of other guys (than 
Paul Kariya and Selanne), so it makes a huge difference for them,'' 
said Detroit captain Steve Yzerman. 
</P>
<P>
	The remainder of the playoff contenders in the West: St. Louis,  
Edmonton, Calgary and San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
	In the East, there are five teams vying for the eighth and final  
spot: Boston, New York Rangers, Florida, Montreal, and Washington, 
separated by merely five points. The Rangers beat Boston 3-1 Sunday 
to move into ninth place, two points behind the Bruins.

<HEADLINE> Steinbrenner Praises DiMaggio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Text of statement by New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner  
on the death of Joe DiMaggio: 
</P>
<P>
	Like many fans across America, and indeed around the world, the  
Yankees are deeply saddened by the passing of Joe DiMaggio, one of 
our own and one of the greatest of all time. It was the class and 
dignity with which he led his life that made him part of all of us. 
I will forever treasure the close friendship we shared over the 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Five days ago, on March 2, I visited with Joe at his home in  
Hollywood, Fla. He was weak but spirited and alert. Together with 
his granddaughter Paula, and Morris Engelberg, we reminisced about 
the wonderful years he had in baseball. I told him, ``Joe, you have 
a date with the Yankees on opening day. We are counting on you to 
throw out the first ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He just smiled.

<HEADLINE> Baseball Economic Study Group Meets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- With a former Senate Majority Leader and former  
chairman of the Federal Reserve on hand, baseball's newest economic 
study committee began work Monday by discussing the sport's fiscal 
disparity. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's too early in the process to have any idea what direction  
the group is going to go in,'' said Colorado Rockies owner Jerry 
McMorris, a vice chairman of the ``blue ribbon task force.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some owners, particularly those in small markets, are calling  
for owners to again press for a salary cap, a proposal that led to 
a 32-day spring training lockout in 1990 and a 232-day strike in 
1994-95 -- which caused the first cancellation of the World Series 
in 90 years. 
</P>
<P>
	More than a dozen team officials attended Monday's meeting at  
the commissioner's office. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a lot of ideas and thoughts to go through,''  
commissioner Bud Selig said. 
</P>
<P>
	After the 1990 lockout, owners and players jointly appointed an  
economic study committee, which recommended increased revenue 
sharing among the teams but no cap. This time, owners set up the 
group on their own. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Volcker, chairman of the Federal Reserve from August  
1979-August 1987 and an owners' pick for the last study committee, 
is on the panel along with former Sen. George Mitchell, mentioned 
five years ago as a possible candidate for commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
	The other two outside members are Yale president Richard Levin,  
an economics professor who came up with baseball's original salary 
cap proposal during collective bargaining following the 1989 
season, and television commentator George Will, an author of two 
baseball books and a board member of the Baltimore Orioles and the 
San Diego Padres. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the eight postseason teams all were among the 12  
highest payrolls and the teams with the 12 lowest payrolls all 
finished with losing records. This year, the New York Yankees, 
Baltimore Orioles and Los Angeles Dodgers will start the season 
with payrolls approaching $90 million, while others such as 
Montreal will open between $10 million and $15 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball's current collective bargaining agreement probably will  
expire after the 2001 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure there's all levels of people out there who have all  
different levels of concern,'' McMorris said. ``All we talked about 
today was the levels of disparity.''

<HEADLINE> New Susan McDougal Trial Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Still defiant after 18 months behind  
bars for refusing to answer questions about President Clinton, 
Whitewater figure Susan McDougal went on trial Monday on contempt 
and obstruction charges that could send her back to prison. 
</P>
<P>
	As lawyers and a federal judge questioned potential jurors,  
prosecutors centered on whether any felt animosity toward Kenneth 
Starr. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're hoping the jury will try the case on legal issues, not  
extraneous matters,'' deputy prosecutor W. Hickman Ewing said 
outside court. ``We'll be vigilant to have the case tried on what's 
relevant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eight prospective jurors were dismissed Monday, including one  
who said she couldn't be fair to the defendant. ``If I was in Mrs. 
McDougal's shoes, I would not want me on the jury,'' the woman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Three women said they could not be fair to Starr, saying he  
should not have expanded his investigation into what came to be 
referred to in jury selection as ``that Washington stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In front of the courthouse where she and two co-defendants were  
convicted of fraud in 1996, Mrs. McDougal said she was fearful 
entering what is expected to be a monthlong trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it will be an all-out fight and I think it has become  
a personal vendetta,'' she said. ``It's become more than 
political.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Ewing said the only issue was whether Mrs. McDougal refused  
a judge's direct order to testify to the Whitewater grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal, 44, is charged with two counts of criminal  
contempt and one count of obstruction of justice. If convicted, she 
could serve a sentence determined by U.S. District Judge George 
Howard Jr. and could face a maximum fine of $750,000. 
</P>
<P>
	In September 1996 and April 1998, Mrs. McDougal refused to talk  
to grand jurors investigating Arkansas business deals involving 
President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton. Mrs. McDougal has 
said she refused to answer questions because she believes the 
special prosecutor would twist her words to suit his purposes and 
possibly charge her with perjury if he doesn't get the testimony he 
wants. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard said last week that he would consider allowing evidence  
of ``prosecutorial misconduct or outrageous government conduct,'' 
specifically whether Starr wanted Mrs. McDougal to lie about the 
Clintons. 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing said the government can prove that Mrs. McDougal had  
relevant information about the Clintons. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal, her ex-husband James McDougal and the Clintons  
were business partners in the failed real estate development known 
as Whitewater. McDougal died in prison a year ago Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors were trying to find out whether the president knew  
about a $300,000 government-backed loan made to Mrs. McDougal in 
1986. Prosecutors say the money was misused. The president has said 
he knew nothing about the loan. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, prosecutors asked Mrs. McDougal before the grand jury  
whether the president answered truthfully at her trial, when she 
was convicted along with her ex-husband and with then-Gov. Jim Guy 
Tucker. 
</P>
<P>
	Last fall, a jury acquitted Mrs. McDougal of charges that she  
embezzled $50,000 from conductor Zubin Mehta's wife when Mrs. 
McDougal was her bookkeeper and personal assistant. 
</P>
<P>
	Two jurors from that trial flew to Little Rock from California,  
at the defense team's expense, to provide moral support for Mrs. 
McDougal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're here because we watched the system fail in Los  
Angeles,'' said one juror, Jill Ford. ``We believe there's 
collusion between the independent counsel and the prosecution 
there.''

<HEADLINE> Court Considers Reno Probe of Starr </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Neither prosecutor Kenneth Starr nor the  
Justice Department encouraged a federal court Monday to decide 
whether Attorney General Janet Reno can investigate the way Starr 
conducted the Monica Lewinsky investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	In court papers, the independent counsel said he was refraining  
from addressing the underlying issue -- whether the attorney general 
``acted improperly'' in moving toward an investigation of his 
office. Instead, Starr argued that the conservative group that 
sought the involvement of a panel of three appeals court judges has 
no right to ask the judges to intercede. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department argued that the law authorizes it to  
probe Starr's work, and said the panel of judges, who appointed 
Starr, doesn't have jurisdiction to decide the question. 
</P>
<P>
	The judges directed Reno and Starr to submit written arguments  
after receiving a request from Landmark Legal Foundation of 
Herndon, Va., which wanted the court to block the Justice 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr and the Justice Department have been involved in a dispute  
over who should investigate the prosecutor's handling of the 
Lewinsky investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the issues to be investigated are contacts Starr and his  
prosecutors had with lawyers for Paula Jones in her sexual 
harassment lawsuit against President Clinton. Also under scrutiny 
would be prosecutors' conduct at a Jan. 16, 1998, confrontation 
with Ms. Lewinsky, when they discussed a possible immunity deal for 
her without her lawyer present. Justice Department guidelines 
require the lawyer's presence. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr said Landmark Legal Foundation ``has no personal stake in  
the alleged dispute'' and ``no injury to Landmark is ... traceable 
to the attorney general's alleged actions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In its court papers, the Justice Department stated that the  
panel of judges ``lacks authority'' to stop the attorney general 
from investigating Starr and the private group's application for a 
writ of prohibition against Reno should be dismissed. The 
department further argued that it seems clear the law authorizes 
Reno to police Starr's conduct because the law explicitly gives her 
power to fire him. 
</P>
<P>
	The legal foundation maintains only Congress can investigate  
Starr. 
</P>
<P>
	The group filed a request with the judges Feb. 11 citing the  
Ethics in Government Act, which says ``the appropriate committees 
of the Congress shall have oversight jurisdiction with respect to 
the official conduct of any independent counsel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nothing grants the judges ``authority to prohibit the attorney  
general from inquiring into whether 'good cause' exists to remove'' 
Starr, the Justice Department said in court papers filed by 
Solicitor General Seth Waxman. 
</P>
<P>
	The department stated that the only legal provision cited by the  
private group referring to the judges' authority relates to another 
subject entirely -- the scope of the prosecutor's jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
	Landmark President Mark Levin said the group's standing to bring  
the matter before the court was irrelevant because ``this is a case 
where the special division'' of judges ``exercises its own 
supervisory powers to ensure the integrity of the investigative 
process.''

<HEADLINE> US, EU Face Off on Banana Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- An irate European Union appealed today to members  
of the World Trade Organization to denounce U.S. sanctions in the 
trans-Atlantic banana trade row, but found many countries telling 
both trade giants to stop tying up the world agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington insists it has the right to take the step on  
sanctions due to EU reluctance to change import policies that 
American banana sellers say squeeze them out of the European 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	But many trade diplomats complain that the dispute is blocking  
the WTO from doing anything else. Some have expressed fears that 
the maneuvering by the WTO's two most powerful members threatens to 
wreck the world's rules-based trading system. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were a lot of countries which said we need to get this  
dispute settled,'' said WTO spokesman Keith Rockwell during a break 
in a closed-door gathering of the entire WTO membership this 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Rockwell quoted Canadian Ambassador John Weekes as saying the  
world was ``mesmerized'' by the dispute even though EU-US trade 
amounts to only 5 percent of the global market. The WTO should be 
focusing on the other 95 percent, Weekes added. 
</P>
<P>
	Roderick Abbott, head of the EU trade delegation in Geneva,  
claimed to have broad support against U.S. actions. ``There is a 
very wide feeling that they have done the wrong thing,'' Abbott 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the request of the EU, the WTO summoned all its 134 member  
countries to the meeting of the general council, its top 
decision-making body, to discuss U.S. sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States accuses the 15-member European Union of  
failing to carry out WTO rulings against its selective banana 
import policy, which the United States claims favors producers in 
former European colonies at the expense of U.S.-owned producers 
with huge plantations in Central and South America. 
</P>
<P>
	It has asked the WTO to approve Washington's proposal of 100  
percent tariffs on $520 million worth of European goods, which aim 
to equal the lost sales claimed by U.S.-owned banana companies. 
</P>
<P>
	After the WTO last week delayed approving the U.S. tariffs, the  
Clinton administration notified U.S. importers that they must start 
setting aside funds to cover the tariffs pending a WTO decision. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. requirement means that Washington is in effect  
implementing the sanctions without first getting WTO approval, said 
Abbott. 
</P>
<P>
	The tariffs would apply to a wide range of European products  
chosen by the Clinton administration to penalize particularly those 
EU countries that supported the banana policies, including 
handbags, coffee makers and cashmere sweaters. 
</P>
<P>
	Denmark and the Netherlands are excluded, but all other  
countries are affected. Britain, one of the hardest-hit, has been 
particularly outspoken in its protest.

<HEADLINE> FTC, Intel Reach Proposed Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Intel Corp., the world's largest maker of  
computer chips, appears to have dodged one bullet from federal 
antitrust enforcers, but a larger battle looms. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel and the Federal Trade Commission announced a proposed  
settlement of some of the agency's allegations Monday, on the eve 
of a hearing before an administrative law judge. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither side would comment on details of the settlement, but  
Intel's president and chief executive officer, Craig Barrett, 
called the agreement a ``win-win'' situation. ``We are satisfied 
that the agreement gives us value for our intellectual property 
rights,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	FTC's attorneys ``got the relief that they wanted,'' said agency  
spokeswoman Victoria Streitfeld. At the same time, however, the 
agency said in a statement that ``there are remaining issues under 
investigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Antitrust experts said the reference was to a much broader  
inquiry into Intel's practices. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a piece of a larger investigation where the FTC was  
looking into whether Intel used its market position to achieve 
dominance in related areas,'' said Kevin Arquit, a New York 
antitrust lawyer and former director of the FTC's Bureau of 
Competition. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, a settlement means the FTC will get what it wanted -- an  
order prohibiting Intel from withholding information from customers 
because of patent squabbles. The full commission must approve the 
settlement before it becomes official. It is expected to vote 
within two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is one of those unusual situations where both sides can  
declare that they won,'' Arquit said. ``For Intel, the stakes were 
enormous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That is because ``the last thing they need is for a government  
agency to label them a monopolist'' at a time when the company also 
faces private antitrust lawsuits, Arquit said. 
</P>
<P>
	In its June 8 complaint, the FTC argued that Intel holds a  
monopoly in the market for microprocessors, the ``brains'' of 
computers. Intel is the world's largest maker of microprocessors, 
with $26.2 billion in sales last year. About 80 percent of the 
world's computers run on Intel chips. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC claims Intel used that monopoly power to withhold key  
technical information about future microchips from three companies 
to punish them for refusing to license key patents to Intel without 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
	The three companies were Digital Equipment Corp., Intergraph  
Corp. and Compaq Computer Corp., which now owns Digital. The 
patents were for microprocessors and related technologies made by 
the three firms. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel acknowledges it did most of what the FTC alleged. However,  
the company claimed those actions were not illegal and had not 
``chilled'' innovation. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Meadlock, Intergraph's chief executive officer, said he  
didn't know details of the settlement but hoped it would modify 
Intel's behavior toward competitors. He said the agreement holds no 
bearing on a separate, much broader lawsuit filed by Intergraph 
against Intel alleging antitrust violations and patent 
infringement. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think the concessions of the settlement indicates that at  
least the antitrust issues in our lawsuit had validity,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Doctors Say George Jones Recovering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Although George Jones is still in  
critical condition, doctors say the country singer has made a 
significant improvement and might be taken off his ventilator 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got to say that he's done remarkably well,'' said Dr.  
Virginia Eddy of Vanderbilt University Medical Center. ``That's not 
to say that he's not very fragile at this point, but he's made a 
lot of progress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 67-year-old Jones, regarded by some as the greatest singer  
in country music history, was driving home in his Lexus, and 
talking on his cell phone, when he crashed into a bridge at about 
1:30 p.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	It took emergency workers about two hours to free him from the  
car. His liver was cut deeply, and his right lung was punctured. 
</P>
<P>
	As long as his liver doesn't bleed, Jones has a good chance of  
recovery, the doctor said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The liver heals itself very well, and his injuries are of the  
type that I really would expect to heal just fine without any 
surgery,'' Eddy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones is conscious, but sedated. He has not spoken since the  
accident, said his wife, Nancy Jones. He is communicating by 
squeezing her hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the squeeze of the hand, I knew he was going to fight,''  
Mrs. Jones said. ``George is just a strong person. He has a strong 
will and a reason to live.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starting with his first hit ``Why Baby Why'' in 1955, Jones has  
charted more than 140 records, including classics like ``He Stopped 
Loving Her Today'' and ``A Good Year for the Roses.'' He was 
married to duet partner Tammy Wynette for six years, and the pair 
were known as ``The King and Queen of Country Music.'' Wynette died 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones has been cited as an influence by singers outside the  
country genre, including Elvis Costello and Ray Charles, both of 
whom have recorded with him.

<HEADLINE> Gore Outlines Traffic, Transit Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration today announced a  
program to reduce traffic congestion that would include giving 
employers tax incentives they can pass along to workers who use 
mass transit. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration also wants to establish a national ``N11''  
line, a second hotline like 911 that would not be used for 
life-threatening situations but to provide drivers with immediate 
transportation and traveler information, such as road conditions 
and bus schedules. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore unveiled the initiatives at a midday news  
conference attended by some 20 traffic reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	``When parents are on the car phone talking to their kids  
explaining why they can't get home for dinner or can't do bedtime 
stories, that really has an impact on the quality of life,'' Gore 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater, who participated in the  
announcement, also will lead four transportation summits across the 
country during the next year, according to one White House 
official. 
</P>
<P>
	The summits will be held in Atlanta, San Francisco and Detroit,  
as well as possibly Blue Springs, Mo., and will be co-hosted by the 
mayor in that community. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcements are part of the administration's $1 billion  
budget proposal to improve daily life in the United States. Gore 
has taken the lead on the agenda, which is aimed at developing 
``smart growth strategies'' for communities plagued by dirty air, 
traffic congestion and suburban sprawl. 
</P>
<P>
	When the vice president first spoke of the package in January,  
he said economic growth depends on creating more ``livable 
communities'' and preserving open spaces. The proposals are aimed 
at addressing a growing concern among many Americans that unbridled 
growth is contributing to a decline in quality of life. 
</P>
<P>
	It is a theme that Gore has addressed in past speeches and  
likely will make an important part of his bid for the 2000 
Democratic presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	In last November's elections, there were more than 200 local  
ballot measures -- most of them approved -- that involved concerns 
about lack of open space, congestion, the disappearance of farmland 
and unchecked development. 
</P>
<P>
	The tax incentives would implement provisions in last year's  
$203 billion national highway bill. They will expand an employer's 
ability to offer employees taxable and non-taxable transportation 
benefits, including parking, mass transit and vanpool benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea of inviting traffic reporters to the announcement,  
being made in the Old Executive Building next to the White House 
itself, is modeled after an October 1997 event in which President 
Clinton invited some 100 weather forecasters to the White House to 
discuss global warming. 
</P>
<P>
	In both cases, the administration hopes that if it can get its  
message across to people who speak directly with the public every 
day, the ideas will get constant reinforcement in the mass media.

<P>
	A potent storm system over the Plains continued to bring heavy  
snow, rain and high winds to a good part of the central United 
States on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	It was clear and chilly over much of the East, while light rain  
fell in the Pacific Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Strong to severe thunderstorms lined up from near Springfield,  
Mo., south and west to near San Antonio. Damaging winds and large 
hail were reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Snow fell from western sections of Illinois into Iowa and west  
into the Dakotas, Nebraska and Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	Schools were closed or opened late in western Wisconsin,  
southern Minnesota, eastern South Dakota, central and eastern 
Nebraska, and across Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	Visibility dropped to near-whiteout conditions in open areas as  
snow was propelled by 30 mph wind. Dozens of car accidents were 
reported. A woman in Minnesota was killed when her minivan collided 
with a snowplow. 
</P>
<P>
	In southeastern South Dakota, nearly half a foot of snow fell in  
the Sioux Falls area and city and county government offices were 
closed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The drifts are pretty hard and a foot and a half to two feet  
deep,'' said Mike Milstead, Minnehaha County sheriff. ``But for a 
passenger car, that's too much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Des Moines, Iowa picked up 9 inches of snow, and other areas of  
the state had just over a foot of snow. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody's been really moody lately, it's terrible,'' said  
Linda Hulen, owner of The Hot Spot Tanning Salon in Ottumwa, Iowa. 
``We should be used to this weather by now, but I don't think we 
ever will be. I like my spring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Airlines canceled flights in Chicago and Minneapolis and at  
other small regional airports. United Airlines canceled about 60

<HEADLINE> Scientist Fired in China Nuke Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Energy Department fired a computer  
scientist at one of its most prestigious weapons labs Monday in 
connection with an investigation about alleged disclosure of 
sensitive nuclear missile technology to China in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chinese-American scientist was dismissed for ``failing to  
properly safeguard classified material'' and having contact with 
people ``from a sensitive country,'' a department statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	DOE did not disclose his name, but The Associated Press learned  
he is Wen Ho Lee, a native of Taiwan. He had worked for years at 
the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, and continued to 
work there with a security clearance well after he became a suspect 
in an espionage investigation in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent months, DOE transferred the employee from a classified  
workplace to a less sensitive job, and more recently suspended his 
security clearance. The department ``had kept the worker employed 
so that the FBI could more efficiently investigate the case,'' the 
statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI was continuing its investigation into the alleged  
espionage. The scientist, while fired from his federal job as well 
as from a post at the University of California, has not been 
arrested or charged with a crime. 
</P>
<P>
	``The unnamed employee received notice of termination in a  
letter today,'' DOE said. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy Secretary Bill Richardson recommended the scientist be  
fired after he received a briefing on the FBI investigation, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The action came as Republicans in Congress stepped up their  
criticism of the administration's handling of the investigation, 
which began in 1996, and other security lapses at the federal 
weapons labs. Several GOP senators promised hearings on the subject 
in the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson promised to cooperate fully with a Senate committee  
looking into allegations that lax security allowed China to steal 
technology that improved its nuclear weapons capability. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will not tolerate the theft of our secrets,'' he said on  
CNN. 
</P>
<P>
	The reason for the scientists' dismissal were ``failing to  
properly inform the laboratory and DOE about contacts with people 
from a sensitive country; specific instances of failing to properly 
safeguard classified material; and, apparently, attempting to 
deceive (the) laboratory about security related issues,'' the 
Energy Department said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Alamos scientist has been at the center of an  
investigation that involves concerns by U.S. intelligence 
specialists that top-secret material was given to the Chinese in 
the mid-1980s that helped them develop ways to build miniaturized 
warheads nearly a decade later. 
</P>
<P>
	Such technology allows development of small warheads that can be  
launched from a single missile at multiple targets. By the 
mid-1990s, China had built and tested such warheads, according to 
U.S. intelligence officials. A secret 1988 Chinese document was 
uncovered in 1995 by U.S. intelligence which indicated the Chinese 
knew design information about the U.S. W-88 miniature warhead that 
had been developed at Los Alamos. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. investigators immediately suspected that the Chinese were  
helped by information provided from someone at one of the U.S. 
weapons labs. By early 1996, investigators focused on five suspects 
and a short time later became convinced the Los Alamos computer 
specialist may have been involved, The New York Times reported 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson said the administration was still assessing security  
at all of its weapons labs. DOE instituted tougher security 
regulations at the facilities more than a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Edward Curran, the DOE's director of counterintelligence said in  
a statement Sunday that it was unclear how much the Chinese weapons 
programs may have been helped by unauthorized procurement of 
sensitive information. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Energy Department's national laboratories are the world's  
preeminent national security research facilities,'' Curran said. 
``They have long been, and remain, attractive to foreign 
intelligence services.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the security lapses prompted sharp criticism from  
Republicans as more details surfaced this past weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said he was not surprised the Chinese  
would target a weapons lab, but that ``what is ... incredibly 
disturbing is apparently the administration didn't take the charges 
seriously'' when they first surfaced. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., promised that his Select  
Committee on Intelligence would step up scrutiny of the ``lax 
security' at the Energy Department weapons labs.

<HEADLINE> William Wrigley Dead at 66 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- William Wrigley, the president and chief  
executive officer of the chewing gum company founded by his 
grandfather, died Monday of complications associated with 
pneumonia. He was 66. 
</P>
<P>
	Wrigley died at a Chicago hospital, said Christopher Perille, a  
spokesman for Wm. Wrigley Jr. Co. 
</P>
<P>
	A native of Chicago, Wrigley was listed as the 58th richest  
American last year in a survey by Forbes magazine, with an 
estimated wealth of $2.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Wrigley began working in 1956 for the company made famous by its  
chewing gum brands, including Juicy Fruit and Doublemint. He became 
director and vice president of the company in 1960 and succeeded 
his father as president in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Monday, the Chicago-based company had said that  
Wrigley's son, William Wrigley Jr., had been named acting president 
while his father was in the hospital recovering from pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
	The elder Wrigley had fractured his hip in mid-January and  
developed pneumonia while recuperating, according to a company 
statement. After a short hospital stay for the hip injury, Wrigley 
went home, but he recently returned to the hospital and was being 
treated in the intensive care unit when he died. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to his role in the family business, Wrigley served  
as director of several corporations. His business affiliations 
included Madison, N.J.-based American Home Products Corp. and White 
Plains, N.Y.-based Texaco Inc. He was director and chairman of the 
board at Santa Catalina Island Co. in California and served on the 
board of the Grocery Manufacturers of America. 
</P>
<P>
	He was a benefactor and life member of the Santa Catalina Island  
Conservancy and served on the board of trustees of the University 
of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
	The family also has deep ties to Chicago as former owners of the  
Chicago Cubs. The Cubs still play in Wrigley Field. 
</P>
<P>
	Most recently, Wrigley lived in Lake Geneva, Wisc. Funeral  
arrangements are pending.

<HEADLINE>  DiMaggio Remembered As Shy, Modest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARTINEZ, Calif. (AP) -- The lanky white-haired gentleman wheeled  
his shopping cart gently through Longs Drugs, stopping to chat with 
his granddaughter. His eyes focused on the floor, avoiding the 
astonished stares of strangers. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, Joe DiMaggio would slip over to Amato's restaurant for a  
meal. He'd sit in the back room, shielded from gawkers and 
autograph hunters. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio often visited Martinez, the town of his birth, for long  
afternoons of fishing with cousins and quiet evenings with 
grandkids. He avoided crowds, skipping funerals and showing up 
unexpectedly at the mortuary to pay his last respects. 
</P>
<P>
	``His head was always down, he wouldn't look around. No eye  
contact,'' said Ernie Lasell, who owned a hardware store and used 
to sell DiMaggio his fishing licenses. ``He was just a naturally 
shy guy, very modest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marie Amato Goodman, whose family ran the restaurant that sits  
about 80 yards from dusty two-lane Joe DiMaggio Drive, said he was 
a humble man who ``had the limelight but didn't capture it and go 
with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When he came into the restaurant, my mother grabbed Joe and  
took him in the back,'' said Goodman, a third cousin of DiMaggio. 
``He was very private, unobtrusive in all situations. I think Joe 
never forgot who he was and where he came from, and the loyalties 
that come with family and friends in a small town.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most Americans born before World War II remember DiMaggio as the  
dashing ``Yankee Clipper,'' the man who had a 56-game hitting 
streak and married Marilyn Monroe. Baby boomers think of DiMaggio 
as the guy hawking Mr. Coffee on TV. 
</P>
<P>
	But neighbors and relatives in Martinez knew DiMaggio as the  
quiet son of a Sicilian fisherman. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio was born in Martinez, a middle-class town about 30  
minutes east of San Francisco, on Nov. 25, 1914. On his birth 
certificate, the midwife that delivered DiMaggio listed ``Fishman'' 
as the occupation of his father, Giuseppe DiMaggio. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe DiMaggio was born in a small wood house on Berrellessa  
Street, along the Martinez waterfront. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuseppe and Rosalia Mercurio DiMaggio moved their family to the  
North Beach section of San Francisco when Joe was 1. The area also 
was an Italian enclave in those days. Now it is largely Asian. 
</P>
<P>
	Dante Benedetti played baseball with the DiMaggio boys. The kids  
used to play on a grassy lot next to a creamery when the horses 
were out pulling milkcarts. They used dried horse manure, covered 
with a sack, for bases. 
</P>
<P>
	``You never slid head first into those,'' Benedetti said.  
</P>
<P>
	Benedetti, who owned the New Pisa restaurant in that  
neighborhood, remembers young Joe DiMaggio sitting by himself at 
North Beach Playground, rolling Bull Durham cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because he was such a good player, he was the only one the  
director let smoke during the games,'' Benedetti said. ``He was a 
shortstop. He used to overthrow first base, he had such a strong 
arm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There's a fable that DiMaggio avoided following in his father's  
footsteps only because he got seasick. Benedetti laughs at such 
nonsense, pointing out the $25,000 bonus offered by the New York 
Yankees was reason enough to stay on land. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know you'd get seasick if somebody offered you $500 a  
month,'' he said. ``After Joe signed, all the fishermen down there 
started to buy their kids gloves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two brothers, Dom and Vince, joined Joe in the major leagues.  
But Giuseppe DiMaggio never really understood. He sent his son a 
letter during his first spring training with the Yankees, in 1936. 
</P>
<P>
	``Come home, Joe,'' the letter said. ``The fish are running.  
Give up this game of baseball. It is for loafers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Benedetti remembers DiMaggio being painfully shy throughout his  
playing days. After his hitting streak in 1941, the residents of 
North Beach threw a testimonial dinner for DiMaggio. When called to 
the microphone, he froze and couldn't speak. 
</P>
<P>
	``He walked by himself. He was a loner,'' Benedetti said. ``You  
couldn't get a word out of him. He talked through his bat and his 
ability to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Benedetti, along with the rest of the neighborhood, attended  
DiMaggio's wedding to actress Dorothy Arnold in 1939 at Sts. Peter 
and Paul Church, whose twin steeples tower over North Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	Gloria Alioto also remembers that wedding vividly, though she  
did not attend. She got married the same day at the same church, 
and her wedding was delayed two hours because of the fanfare 
surrounding DiMaggio's marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	Along the waterfront in Martinez, the ``Joltin' Joe'' is berthed  
quietly. DiMaggio was given the 22-foot speedboat on Joe DiMaggio 
Day, a celebration attended by 69,551 fans at Yankee Stadium on 
Oct. 1, 1949. He donated it to the city. 
</P>
<P>
	When town leaders proposed building a Joe DiMaggio Museum,  
though, the former ballplayer didn't offer help or promise any 
memorabilia, and the idea died. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio tried to avoid attention during his visits to Martinez,  
though that was sometimes next to impossible. 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Lopas remembers pressing his face to the window in awe as  
newlyweds DiMaggio and Marilyn Monroe strolled from a limousine 
into a neighbor's house in Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
	``Joe just slipped into town and he slipped out,'' Lopas said.  
``The city wanted to claim him, but he didn't claim it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mostly, mention of DiMaggio brings back memories of a classy guy

<HEADLINE>  DiMaggio Remembered As Shy, Modest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARTINEZ, Calif. (AP) -- The lanky white-haired gentleman wheeled  
his shopping cart gently through Longs Drugs, stopping to chat with 
his granddaughter. His eyes focused on the floor, avoiding the 
astonished stares of strangers. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, Joe DiMaggio would slip over to Amato's restaurant for a  
meal. He'd sit in the back room, shielded from gawkers and 
autograph hunters. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio often visited Martinez, the town of his birth, for long  
afternoons of fishing with cousins and quiet evenings with 
grandkids. He avoided crowds, skipping funerals and showing up 
unexpectedly at the mortuary to pay his last respects. 
</P>
<P>
	``His head was always down, he wouldn't look around. No eye  
contact,'' said Ernie Lasell, who owned a hardware store and used 
to sell DiMaggio his fishing licenses. ``He was just a naturally 
shy guy, very modest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marie Amato Goodman, whose family ran the restaurant that sits  
about 80 yards from dusty two-lane Joe DiMaggio Drive, said he was 
a humble man who ``had the limelight but didn't capture it and go 
with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When he came into the restaurant, my mother grabbed Joe and  
took him in the back,'' said Goodman, a third cousin of DiMaggio. 
``He was very private, unobtrusive in all situations. I think Joe 
never forgot who he was and where he came from, and the loyalties 
that come with family and friends in a small town.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most Americans born before World War II remember DiMaggio as the  
dashing ``Yankee Clipper,'' the man who had a 56-game hitting 
streak and married Marilyn Monroe. Baby boomers think of DiMaggio 
as the guy hawking Mr. Coffee on TV. 
</P>
<P>
	But neighbors and relatives in Martinez knew DiMaggio as the  
quiet son of a Sicilian fisherman. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio was born in Martinez, a middle-class town about 30  
minutes east of San Francisco, on Nov. 25, 1914. On his birth 
certificate, the midwife that delivered DiMaggio listed ``Fishman'' 
as the occupation of his father, Giuseppe DiMaggio. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe DiMaggio was born in a small wood house on Berrellessa  
Street, along the Martinez waterfront. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuseppe and Rosalia Mercurio DiMaggio moved their family to the  
North Beach section of San Francisco when Joe was 1. The area also 
was an Italian enclave in those days. Now it is largely Asian. 
</P>
<P>
	Dante Benedetti played baseball with the DiMaggio boys. The kids  
used to play on a grassy lot next to a creamery when the horses 
were out pulling milkcarts. They used dried horse manure, covered 
with a sack, for bases. 
</P>
<P>
	``You never slid head first into those,'' Benedetti said.  
</P>
<P>
	Benedetti, who owned the New Pisa restaurant in that  
neighborhood, remembers young Joe DiMaggio sitting by himself at 
North Beach Playground, rolling Bull Durham cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because he was such a good player, he was the only one the  
director let smoke during the games,'' Benedetti said. ``He was a 
shortstop. He used to overthrow first base, he had such a strong 
arm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There's a fable that DiMaggio avoided following in his father's  
footsteps only because he got seasick. Benedetti laughs at such 
nonsense, pointing out the $25,000 bonus offered by the New York 
Yankees was reason enough to stay on land. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know you'd get seasick if somebody offered you $500 a  
month,'' he said. ``After Joe signed, all the fishermen down there 
started to buy their kids gloves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two brothers, Dom and Vince, joined Joe in the major leagues.  
But Giuseppe DiMaggio never really understood. He sent his son a 
letter during his first spring training with the Yankees, in 1936. 
</P>
<P>
	``Come home, Joe,'' the letter said. ``The fish are running.  
Give up this game of baseball. It is for loafers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Benedetti remembers DiMaggio being painfully shy throughout his  
playing days. After his hitting streak in 1941, the residents of 
North Beach threw a testimonial dinner for DiMaggio. When called to 
the microphone, he froze and couldn't speak. 
</P>
<P>
	``He walked by himself. He was a loner,'' Benedetti said. ``You  
couldn't get a word out of him. He talked through his bat and his 
ability to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Benedetti, along with the rest of the neighborhood, attended  
DiMaggio's wedding to actress Dorothy Arnold in 1939 at Sts. Peter 
and Paul Church, whose twin steeples tower over North Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	Gloria Alioto also remembers that wedding vividly, though she  
did not attend. She got married the same day at the same church, 
and her wedding was delayed two hours because of the fanfare 
surrounding DiMaggio's marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	Along the waterfront in Martinez, the ``Joltin' Joe'' is berthed  
quietly. DiMaggio was given the 22-foot speedboat on Joe DiMaggio 
Day, a celebration attended by 69,551 fans at Yankee Stadium on 
Oct. 1, 1949. He donated it to the city. 
</P>
<P>
	When town leaders proposed building a Joe DiMaggio Museum,  
though, the former ballplayer didn't offer help or promise any 
memorabilia, and the idea died. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio tried to avoid attention during his visits to Martinez,  
though that was sometimes next to impossible. 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Lopas remembers pressing his face to the window in awe as  
newlyweds DiMaggio and Marilyn Monroe strolled from a limousine 
into a neighbor's house in Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
	``Joe just slipped into town and he slipped out,'' Lopas said.  
``The city wanted to claim him, but he didn't claim it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mostly, mention of DiMaggio brings back memories of a classy guy  
who shunned the spotlight that his talent attracted. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a prime example of what athletes should be like. He's a  
great tribute to baseball and sports in general,'' said Fred 
Scolari, who grew up near the DiMaggio family in North Beach and 
went on to an NBA career from 1946-55. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just the way he commanded respect because I think he gave  
you respect. He sat in a corner and had his Coca-Colas. He didn't 
seek out anybody.''

<HEADLINE>  McGwire Hits Second HR in Two Days </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JUPITER, Fla. (AP) -- Just like last year, Mark McGwire is off to  
a fast start. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire, who homered in each of the St. Louis Cardinals' first  
four games of the regular season last year, hit his second in three 
at-bats this spring during the St. Louis Cardinals' 2-1 loss to the 
Houston Astros on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	To say he's not impressed by his first few exhibition games is  
an understatement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how it's supposed to go,'' McGwire said. ``See  
the ball and hit it; that's about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire is 2-for-4 and has reached base four times in six plate  
appearances, including a walk and a hit by pitch. He hit his first 
homer Sunday off Montreal Expos rookie Ted Lilly, then connected 
off Jose Lima, who gave up Sammy Sosa's 66th and final home run 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	After playing three innings Monday, McGwire didn't know if he's  
had a better spring start. And he didn't care. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't rate that,'' he said. ``Hey guys -- this is spring  
training.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire's fourth-inning drive on an 0-2 pitch from Lima wasn't  
one of his usual majestic, towering clouts. Still, the only 
suspense was whether it would stay fair. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mark McGwire hit a home run, but what's new?'' Lima said. ``He  
hits one every day, doesn't he?'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire, still in the spotlight after his record 70 homers last  
year, was terse when talking about himself but opened up a little 
when he talked about the death of Joe DiMaggio. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, it's a big loss,'' he said. ``He was one of the  
best in the game. I wish I got to know him; I never got to meet 
him. It's a big loss for the game and for life in general.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lima gave up one home run to McGwire last season, No. 32 on June  
17 at Houston. Lima's scheduled start Sunday was postponed due to 
shoulder soreness and he worked only one inning in his first spring 
appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt great,'' Lima said. ``I think I'm 100 percent. I don't  
feel any more pain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the 34 homers surrendered by Lima last year were three by  
Sosa, including two in one game. 
</P>
<P>
	Shane Reynolds, making his second spring start, allowed one hit  
in three scoreless innings for Houston. Cardinals starter Kent 
Bottenfield gave up four hits in two scoreless innings. 
</P>
<P>
	A throwing error by pitcher Manny Aybar helped the Astros tie it  
in the fifth as Pedro Lopez got the RBI on a fielder's choice. A 
sacrifice fly by Ken Caminiti made it 2-1 in the sixth and Doug 
Henry, the sixth Houston pitcher, worked the ninth for his first 
spring save. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Chad Hutchinson, the Cardinals' second-round pick last  
season, had five strikeouts and didn't allow a hit in a 
three-inning stint in a ``B'' game against the Montreal Expos. The 
Cardinals had planned on starting Hutchinson at Class A, but now 
he'll more likely begin at Class AA with another phenom, Rick 
Ankiel. ... Center fielder Ray Lankford, recovering from offseason 
arthroscopic knee surgery, may make his spring debut Thursday as a 
designated hitter against the Royals in Haines City.

<HEADLINE>  Will Anyone Pick Against Duke? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Analysis    	
</P>
<P>
	The question was first heard in early February. Is Duke going to  
lose a game in the Atlantic Coast Conference this season? 
</P>
<P>
	When the Blue Devils capped a first-ever 16-0 league season with  
a 20-point win at North Carolina last weekend, the question 
changed. Can anybody beat these guys? 
</P>
<P>
	After this weekend's ACC tournament, which the Blue Devils  
ripped through with three wins by an average of 25 points, the 
question was altered again. Can anybody stay close to these guys? 
</P>
<P>
	Welcome to the 1999 NCAA tournament, the 64-team competition  
with the subtitle: ``Is second place really so bad?'' 
</P>
<P>
	What makes the Blue Devils such a heavy favorite is a 32-1  
record, a 27-game wining streak, only three wins by less than 
double figures and 13 by 30 or more. Then there are all-conference 
players like Trajan Langdon, Elton Brand and William Avery. 
</P>
<P>
	Don't forget Mike Krzyzewski, the coach who has led Duke to  
seven Final Fours and two national championships. There's even a 
tinge of revenge as the Blue Devils had one of their most 
devastating losses ever last year to Kentucky in the regional final 
at St. Petersburg, Fla., the site of this year's Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	How can anybody pick against Duke?  
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Devils will cruise to the East Regionals at the  
Meadowlands, their favorite Final Four launching pad, with wins 
over Florida A&AMP;M and College of Charleston, and will be joined 
there by Wisconsin, Cincinnati and Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati, the only team to beat the Blue Devils this season,  
just won't have the last-second heroics it did in that Nov. 28 game 
in the Great Alaska Shootout. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Devils will play the Midwest Regional champion in the  
national semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Look for Kentucky to be that team as the defending national  
champion makes a Dukelike fourth straight Final Four appearance. 
The Wildcats will stave off some scares, however, as sixth-seeded 
Kansas, with its lowest seeding since 1988, makes some noise in the 
second round and Utah, the team Kentucky beat for the title last 
season, provides a regional semifinal thriller. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wildcats will make their trip to St. Petersburg after a  
regional final win over North Carolina Charlotte, the team that 
will grab the nation's attention with solid play and kiss-blowing 
3-point shooter Diego Guevara. 
</P>
<P>
	The South Regional will have the best of the second-round story  
lines when George Washington meets its former coach, Mike Jarvis, 
and St. John's. The second round will also have the first of the 
No. 1 seeds leaving when Syracuse stuns Auburn. 
</P>
<P>
	Syracuse will run out of luck against Ohio State in the regional  
semifinals and the Buckeyes' game against Maryland in the final 
will also be a former Boston College coaches reunion. 
</P>
<P>
	Maryland's Gary Williams will get his first Final Four  
appearance, carried there with a sensational tournament from guard 
Steve Francis. 
</P>
<P>
	The Terrapins' opponent in the national semifinals will be  
Connecticut, another team led by a coach, Jim Calhoun, making his 
Final Four debut. 
</P>
<P>
	The Huskies will have some fun running their way past Missouri  
in the second round and Arkansas in the third. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanford and North Carolina will get back within a game of  
returning to the Final Four for a second straight year. The Tar 
Heels will get second-year coach Bill Guthridge back there but the 
rematch of last year's regional final with Connecticut won't turn 
out as well. 
</P>
<P>
	The Final Four will have Duke getting revenge on Kentucky for  
last year's game and Connecticut prevailing in what should be an 
entertaining game that doesn't need a shot clock. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be Duke and Connecticut, the only teams to hold the No.  
1 ranking this season, playing for the whole thing. Then it's time 
to pick your question: Can anybody beat these guys? Can anybody 
stay close to these guys?

<HEADLINE> Turner Joins Push To Pay U.N. Dues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Ted Turner's foundation has allocated $12  
million over the next two years to try to persuade the United 
States to pay its U.N. dues, officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The foundation established to distribute Turner's $1 billion  
gift to the United Nations is joining a campaign that has so far 
been unsuccessful in lobbying Congress to pay the $1.3 billion -- 
despite polls that show most Americans support the world body and 
want its bills paid. 
</P>
<P>
	The Turner cash infusion, coupled with efforts by a new  
coalition of payment-advocacy groups, will go toward local public 
education and information campaigns across the country and lobbying 
efforts in Washington, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the Republican-controlled Congress approved  
legislation that would have paid off a chunk of the U.S. arrears, 
but President Clinton vetoed it because of what he said were 
unrelated abortion restrictions tacked onto the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	A Republican-sponsored amendment would have barred using U.S.  
funds to support international family planning organizations that 
seek changes in abortion policies. 
</P>
<P>
	Turner, founder of CNN and a vice chairman of Time Warner Inc.,  
has made clear his support for family planning, suggesting recently 
in a speech to an abortion rights group a ``one-child'' policy to 
help control the world's population. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign launched Monday represents a convergence of goals  
for Turner. His United Nations Foundation, established in 1997, has 
focused on population and generating support among Americans for 
the vital work the United Nations does. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers said Monday a major effort over the next year will be  
to remove the abortion amendment from legislation to pay the United 
States' U.N. debt, or at least reach a compromise over its language 
that would be acceptable to the president. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States narrowly avoided losing its vote in the  
General Assembly last year because it hadn't paid up; that threat 
looms later this year as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really shameful,'' said John C. Whitehead, the former  
chairman of the United Nations Association of the USA, a group that 
advocates payment. ``Other nations around the world that should be 
our partners are beginning to resent our aloofness, our inattention 
to things of concern.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Failure to pay will only hurt the United States in pursuing its  
foreign policy goals, warned David Birenbaum, chairman of the 
bipartisan Emergency Coalition for U.S. Payment of U.N. Arrears. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's impossible to lead when you're not playing the game  
according to the rules,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S.: Iraq Patrols Limit Aggression </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MUSCAT, Oman (AP) -- The policy underpinning the costly and  
dangerous mission of patrolling the skies over northern and 
southern Iraq has shifted since the end of the Persian Gulf War. 
U.S. officials acknowledge that the deny-flight effort has only 
partially succeeded at its original mission. 
</P>
<P>
	Now they describe the policy as primarily designed to constrict  
Iraq's military against possible aggression toward neighboring 
countries. Equally important, the flights constantly remind Iraq of 
its restricted status as a nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost forgotten is the original purpose of the deny-flight  
missions: protecting ethnic populations in northern and southern 
Iraq from air attack by Saddam Hussein's forces. Now, according to 
a report by President Clinton to Congress, Saddam has merely 
shifted those attacks to the ground, burning villages and 
assassinating or executing opponents -- all of it taking place under 
the wings of U.S. warplanes. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen, touring the Persian Gulf region  
this week in support of the air campaign over Iraq, says that 
Iraq's almost daily challenges to U.S. warplanes over northern and 
southern Iraq must be met with force. In private meetings this 
weekend in Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and Oman, he has encountered 
little if any criticism of that policy. 
</P>
<P>
	What has gone largely undiscussed is the reasoning behind the  
deny-flight effort, and its ultimate goal. 
</P>
<P>
	That missing element came into clear focus during Cohen's trip  
when President Clinton sent a report to Congress detailing human 
rights abuses being carried out in northern and southern Iraq. 
According to the White House report, Iraqi authorities have 
conducted wholesale burning of villages, summary executions and 
political assassinations of ethnic Kurds in the north and Shia 
``Marsh Arabs'' in the south. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking Sunday to reporters traveling with him, Cohen said the  
first mission of the U.S. warplanes over Iraq is ``to protect the 
region from Saddam making any kind of an aggressive assault upon 
them.'' Second is to protect ethnic Kurds and Shiites in Iraq. On 
that score, he said, the results are mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't prevent Saddam from carrying out assassinations or  
the kind of brutal repression that he has been carrying out,'' 
Cohen said. ``We have been successful in using fixed-wing 
helicopter attacks, and so to that extent, it's been successful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the Persian Gulf War ended in 1991, U.S. negotiators failed  
to anticipate that Iraq would use helicopters in suppressing 
emerging opposition in the north and south. The helicopters became 
a key weapon in Iraq's ruthless counterinsurgency campaign. By 
1992, the deny-flight mission was up and running and Iraqi military 
air activity in the two zones largely ceased. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years later, in the face of threatening Iraqi troop  
movements aimed at Kuwait, the United States established a ``no 
drive'' zone, barring major military maneuvers in southern Iraq. In 
1996, the southern deny-flight zone was enlarged northward toward 
Baghdad. Today, some 60 percent of Iraqi territory is off limits to 
Iraq's air forces. 
</P>
<P>
	From then on, U.S. warplanes patrolled less to search for Iraqi  
aircraft than to watch for signs of troop movements, photograph 
future worthy targets, and do all the things that would go into an 
air campaign except actually dropping bombs. Now, amid aggressive 
Iraqi fighter and antiaircraft missile tactics, the bombs are 
falling. 
</P>
<P>
	These attacks, according to Cohen, are designed to protect the  
integrity of the deny-flight mission and the lives of American 
pilots. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen is in a delicate position in his diplomatic rounds on the  
broader point behind the U.S. air patrols over Iraq. Arab states 
friendly toward the United States appear willing to accept the 
deny-flight mission -- and the inevitability of U.S. retaliation 
against Iraq when the planes are challenged. What they oppose is 
any overt U.S. policy of overthrowing Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has said repeatedly it wants a change in  
government in Baghdad and will work with credible opposition groups 
to help bring that about. But to the extent there is any open 
opposition in Iraq, it resides in the northern and southern zones. 
</P>
<P>
	Are U.S. warplanes providing an umbrella beneath which  
opposition to Saddam can grow? A senior Pentagon official, speaking 
on condition of anonymity, emphatically says no. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not about opposition groups at all,'' the official said.

<HEADLINE> J. Peterman Future Still in Flux </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- John Peterman says he's been ousted from the  
upscale catalog retailer that bears his name, but his new boss said 
today she has yet to decide what his future at the company will be. 
</P>
<P>
	J. Peterman, the company satirized on television by  
``Seinfeld,'' was rescued from bankruptcy liquidation late Friday 
by Paul Harris Stores Inc. of Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Harris chairwoman and chief executive Charlotte G. Fischer  
said today that she has not decided whether to keep Peterman, who 
had founded the Lexington, Ky.-based retailer of nostalgic clothing 
and accessories in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are just beginning to evaluate employees of J. Peterman,  
including Mr. Peterman,'' Fischer said at a news conference today. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Harris executives planned to hold meetings today to wrap up  
details of its $10 million acquisition of J. Peterman, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Peterman said Sunday that he had been ousted from J. Peterman.  
He said that Paul Harris chief financial officer Thomas McCain told 
him during a phone conversation Saturday that the 300-store chain, 
which sells casual clothing for women, would need two to three 
months to decide whether it wanted Peterman to remain. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, `I'm surprised. That's not what you said yesterday in  
doing the deal,''' Peterman recounted. ``He said maybe there was a 
misunderstanding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peterman said he later was told that he is not considered part  
of the new company's ``go-forward scheme.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The controversy marked the end of a tumultuous week. It began  
with J. Peterman headed for near-certain liquidation and climaxed 
Friday with Paul Harris giving new life to the upscale retailer by 
purchasing the company for $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Peterman, a 57-year-old former marketing executive and minor  
league baseball player, started his company in 1987 by selling 
cowboy-style canvas duster coats in the back pages of The New 
Yorker and The Wall Street Journal. The company's influential 
catalog features poetic descriptions of the items for sale and 
artistic drawings of the merchandise, but it became most famous for 
being satirized on the television series ``Seinfeld.'' 
</P>
<P>
	J. Peterman filed for protection from its creditors in federal  
bankruptcy court in January, saying a slowdown in catalog sales and 
delays in a planned 70-store retail expansion had caused a cash 
crunch. 
</P>
<P>
	Peterman blamed the main backer of the retail expansion,  
Chicago-based Heller Financial, which he said got cold feet and 
tightened the company's credit, forcing it to seek protection under 
Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. 
</P>
<P>
	When Peterman was unable to find a buyer to keep the company  
going, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge William S. Howard ordered Friday's 
liquidation auction. There, Paul Harris came forward with its late 
offer to buy the company and keep it in business. 
</P>
<P>
	Peterman said he will stick with his plan from last week, when  
he thought J. Peterman was going to be liquidated. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to write the book and I'm going to start another  
business,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>  McGwire Hits Second HR in Two Days </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JUPITER, Fla. (AP) -- Just like last year, Mark McGwire is off to  
a fast start. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire, who homered in each of the St. Louis Cardinals' first  
four games of the regular season last year, hit his second in three 
at-bats this spring during the St. Louis Cardinals' 2-1 loss to the 
Houston Astros on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	To say he's not impressed by his first few exhibition games is  
an understatement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how it's supposed to go,'' McGwire said. ``See  
the ball and hit it; that's about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire is 2-for-4 and has reached base four times in six plate  
appearances, including a walk and a hit by pitch. He hit his first 
homer Sunday off Montreal Expos rookie Ted Lilly, then connected 
off Jose Lima, who gave up Sammy Sosa's 66th and final home run 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	After playing three innings Monday, McGwire didn't know if he's  
had a better spring start. And he didn't care. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't rate that,'' he said. ``Hey guys -- this is spring  
training.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire's fourth-inning drive on an 0-2 pitch from Lima wasn't  
one of his usual majestic, towering clouts. Still, the only 
suspense was whether it would stay fair. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mark McGwire hit a home run, but what's new?'' Lima said. ``He  
hits one every day, doesn't he?'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire, still in the spotlight after his record 70 homers last  
year, was terse when talking about himself but opened up a little 
when he talked about the death of Joe DiMaggio. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, it's a big loss,'' he said. ``He was one of the  
best in the game. I wish I got to know him; I never got to meet 
him. It's a big loss for the game and for life in general.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lima gave up one home run to McGwire last season, No. 32 on June  
17 at Houston. Lima's scheduled start Sunday was postponed due to 
shoulder soreness and he worked only one inning in his first spring 
appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt great,'' Lima said. ``I think I'm 100 percent. I don't  
feel any more pain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the 34 homers surrendered by Lima last year were three by  
Sosa, including two in one game. 
</P>
<P>
	Shane Reynolds, making his second spring start, allowed one hit  
in three scoreless innings for Houston. Cardinals starter Kent 
Bottenfield gave up four hits in two scoreless innings. 
</P>
<P>
	A throwing error by pitcher Manny Aybar helped the Astros tie it  
in the fifth as Pedro Lopez got the RBI on a fielder's choice. A 
sacrifice fly by Ken Caminiti made it 2-1 in the sixth and Doug 
Henry, the sixth Houston pitcher, worked the ninth for his first 
spring save. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Chad Hutchinson, the Cardinals' second-round pick last  
season, had five strikeouts and didn't allow a hit in a 
three-inning stint in a ``B'' game against the Montreal Expos. The 
Cardinals had planned on starting Hutchinson at Class A, but now 
he'll more likely begin at Class AA with another phenom, Rick 
Ankiel. ... Center fielder Ray Lankford, recovering from offseason 
arthroscopic knee surgery, may make his spring debut Thursday as a 
designated hitter against the Royals in Haines City.

<HEADLINE> McDougal: Whitewater Got Ugly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Susan McDougal today implored Arkansans  
to follow her trial on contempt and obstruction of justice charges, 
saying it would expose the ugly nature of the Whitewater 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it will be an all-out fight and I think it has become  
a personal vendetta,'' Mrs. McDougal said. ``It's become more than 
political. I'm scared this morning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal made her comments as she arrived at the federal  
courthouse for jury selection in a trial that could send her back 
to prison. She has insisted she has no information on business 
dealings involving President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Five potential jurors were dismissed this morning, including one  
who said she couldn't be a fair juror. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I was in Mrs. McDougal's shoes, I would not want me on the  
jury,'' the woman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal already has served 18 months on a civil contempt  
citation, and the new trial stems from a three-count indictment 
alleging criminal contempt and obstruction of justice for refusing 
to answer Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's questions about the 
president and first lady. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Whitewater prosecutor W. Hickman Ewing Jr. said Mrs.  
McDougal's trial is simply about her failure to follow a judge's 
direct order. 
</P>
<P>
	Grand jurors were investigating whether Mrs. McDougal, 44, had  
improper financial dealings with the Clintons when the president 
was governor of Arkansas. McDougal and the Clintons were business 
partners in the failed real estate development known as Whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal has said she refused to answer questions because  
she believes Starr would twist her words to suit his purposes and 
may charge her with perjury if he doesn't get the testimony he 
wants. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge George Howard Jr. said last week that he  
would consider allowing evidence of ``prosecutorial misconduct or 
outrageous government conduct,'' specifically whether Starr wanted 
Mrs. McDougal to lie about the Clintons. 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing was unfazed.  
</P>
<P>
	``We know in any high profile case, it is a normal thing where  
the prosecutor is attacked,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors will introduce evidence that Mrs. McDougal had  
relevant information on the Clintons, Ewing said. According to the 
indictment, prosecutors want to know: 
</P>
<P>
	--Whether Clinton was aware of a $300,000 loan to Mrs. McDougal  
from David Hale, who pleaded guilty to mail fraud and conspiracy. 
Hale said Clinton pressured him to make such a loan in 1986. The 
government claims Mrs. McDougal used the money for purposes other 
than what it was intended for. 
</P>
<P>
	--Whether Clinton knew about Lorance Heights, an 800-acre tract  
south of Little Rock that the Clintons' and the McDougals' 
Whitewater Development Corp. purchased in 1986. Prosecutors say the 
company used money from the $300,000 loan to secure the land. The 
Clintons have said James McDougal, Mrs. McDougal's former husband, 
never told them about Lorance Heights or the loan. 
</P>
<P>
	--Whether Clinton testified truthfully during the 1996 trial of  
Mrs. McDougal, her late husband and then-Gov. Jim Guy Tucker. 
</P>
<P>
	--Why the words ``Payoff Clinton'' were written in the notation  
section of a $5,081.82 check drawn on a McDougal account and 
payable to Madison Guaranty, which the McDougals owned.

<HEADLINE> Rehnquist Praises Harry Blackmun </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist today noted  
``with sadness'' the death last week of retired Justice Harry A. 
Blackmun and expressed the court's sympathy to his family. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking from the bench during the court's brief morning  
session, the chief justice said Blackmun ``was a worthy successor 
to the predecessors in the seat which he occupied -- Joseph Story, 
Oliver Wendell Holmes, Benjamin Cardozo and Felix Frankfurter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He will be missed by his friends throughout the judiciary and  
the country,'' Rehnquist said. 
</P>
<P>
	The chief justice said Blackmun's opinion in the Roe vs. Wade  
ruling that legalized abortion nationwide ``may have obscured many 
other important decisions he authored.'' Blackmun wrote more than 
350 majority decisions for the court. 
</P>
<P>
	Blackmun served for 24 years on the nation's highest court and  
retired in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	His body was to lie in repose in the court building's Great Hall  
this afternoon. A memorial service was scheduled for Tuesday in 
Washington D.C.

weekend box office, estimates showed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Analyze This'' earned $17.7 million in its debut, far ahead of  
the ``Cruel Intentions'' opening of $13.2 million, according to 
figures released Sunday by Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The comedy was a victory of sorts for both De Niro and Crystal,  
outdoing their most recent openings by millions. De Niro's action 
thriller ``Ronin'' debuted with $12.7 million and Crystal's ``My 
Giant,'' opened with $3.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cruel Intentions,'' the latest film geared toward a teen  
audience, failed to beat the openings of other recent teen films 
such as ``She's All That'' and ``Varsity Blues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, ``Cruel Intentions'' did bring in more than the $11  
million it reportedly cost to make. It stars Sarah Michelle Gellar, 
Ryan Phillippe and Reese Witherspoon and sets the plot of the 
love-games story ``Les Liaisons Dangereuses'' against a Manhattan 
prep school. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Nicolas Cage's dark ``8mm,'' about a private  
investigator who infiltrates the porn subculture in search of a 
runaway girl, finished No. 3 with $7 million. Though it lost 51 
percent of its audience in its second week, studio officials 
remained optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is really all to the benefit of Nick Cage,'' said Ed  
Russell, Columbia's executive vice president of publicity. ``He has 
really driven the audience into a very intriguing film.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Other Sister,'' a love story about two mentally challenged  
people starring Juliette Lewis, was in fourth place with $5.6 
million. It lost just 15 percent of its audience in its second 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the face of competition like 'Analyze This' and the adult  
market, I think we did very well. I think it's about word of mouth. 
The public does it for you,'' said Chuck Viane, senior vice 
president of distribution for Buena Vista Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the box office was down 8.5 percent from last year,  
when the megahit ``Titanic'' was still packing theaters. 
</P>
<P>
	Here are estimated grosses at North American theaters for Friday  
through Sunday. Final figures were expected Monday: 
</P>
<P>
	1. ``Analyze This,'' $17.7 million.  
</P>
<P>
	2. ``Cruel Intentions,'' $13.2 million.  
</P>
<P>
	3. ``8mm,'' $7 million.  
</P>
<P>
	4. ``The Other Sister,'' $5.6 million.  
</P>
<P>
	5. ``Payback,'' $4.1 million.  
</P>
<P>
	6. ``October Sky,'' $3.7 million.  
</P>
<P>
	7. ``My Favorite Martian,'' $3.6 million.  
</P>
<P>
	8. (tie) ``Message in a Bottle,'' $3.4 million.  
</P>
<P>
	8. ``Shakespeare in Love,'' $3.4 million.  
</P>
<P>
	10. ``She's All That,'' $2.6 million.

<HEADLINE> Toronto Seeks 1996 Games Bid Audit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Mayor Mel Lastman has ordered an audit to  
determine whether a Canadian Olympic official was in conflict of 
interest when she received consulting fees while serving as an 
officer on Toronto's failed bid for the 1996 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Lastman also said he will make public all documents pertaining  
to the bid for the Summer Games, and the contracts awarded to Carol 
Anne Letheren, providing they still exist. 
</P>
<P>
	During the late 1980s, Letheren was vice president of  
communications and marketing for the Toronto bid committee, and a 
volunteer member of the Canadian Olympic Association. 
</P>
<P>
	She currently is secretary general and chief executive officer  
of the COA, and sits on the board of directors of the Toronto 2008 
Olympic Bid Corp., the private company vying for the rights to host 
the 2008 Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Letheren also is one of Canada's two voting delegates to the  
International Olympic Committee. The other is IOC vice president 
Dick Pound of Montreal, who is investigating allegations that IOC 
members received cash and gifts in exchange for their support for 
cities seeking to host the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Lastman previously said he would conduct an audit of the 1996  
Olympic bid, then announced there would be no audit. 
</P>
<P>
	But Lastman said Sunday an audit must be conducted after a story  
in the Toronto Star reported firms in which Letheren was a partner 
had a ``questionable consulting arrangement'' with the Toronto 
Ontario Olympic Committee, including a three-year deal at $8,000 
per month.

<HEADLINE> DiMaggio Was the Embodiment of Cool </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	To the generation behind his, the one that never had the chance  
to see him play in person, Joe D. was the embodiment of cool. 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph Paul DiMaggio would never have described himself that  
way, of course. 
</P>
<P>
	Cool sounded too jazzy, not considered enough. It smacks of a  
snap judgment, something DiMaggio spent a lifetime avoiding. And so 
it was fitting somehow that even his passing Monday at age 84 -- in 
his own bed, finally, surrounded by family some two months after 
everyone else had given up hope -- seemed like a measured decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Nothing drove that point home better than something pro golfer  
Ken Venturi recalled about the first time the two of them met. 
``I'll never forget this,'' Venturi said. ``He said if you're good, 
you can always get in. It's knowing when to get out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And now that he is gone, DiMaggio probably would prefer to be  
remembered with words as weighty as his accomplishments. Words like 
elegant, dignified, graceful. Because he was all of those things, 
to be sure, and more. 
</P>
<P>
	But to those who caught their first glimpse of him in a grainy  
newsreel, gliding across center field in Yankee Stadium, or walking 
into some New York place with Marilyn Monroe on his arm, that's how 
he always looked: composed, collected, dispassionate. 
</P>
<P>
	Cool.  
</P>
<P>
	There was something to admire about the way he did everything.  
For 13 seasons, DiMaggio was the best player on the best team in 
the best town in baseball and didn't seem the least bit smug about 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	For a short time, barely nine months in 1954, he even had the  
best dame. He wasn't smug about that, either. And even after he 
lost Monroe, DiMaggio behaved more like a faithful husband than a 
bitter, divorced one. He looked after her as much as he could, and 
for years after she died in August 1962 he made sure there were 
roses at her grave. 
</P>
<P>
	He was Gary Cooper-in-High Noon cool. He was not afraid of a  
fight, but not afraid to walk away from one, either. DiMaggio spent 
what likely would have been the best three seasons of his career 
serving in the military during World War II, but he never used it 
as an excuse for anything. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio was certainly a product of his times, but he was more  
than that, too. He was a perfect fit in a succession of athletes 
whose feats touched a uniquely American nerve, whose careers set 
end-to-end track this nation's rise from an emerging power to a 
consuming one. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio wasn't a happy accident the way Babe Ruth, his  
predecessor was, a Jazz Age symbol whose grand home runs and even 
grander appetite put baseball on the map. And yet he wasn't bred 
for the national pastime the way Mickey Mantle, his successor, was, 
the product of a father who worked in a coal mine by day and worked 
his son on a diamond each night. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, DiMaggio was shy and slender, the son of an Italian  
immigrant who operated a fishing boat in San Francisco and thought 
baseball was ``a bum's game.'' But that was before Joe became a 
folk hero, and before two more DiMaggio boys, Vince and Dom, found 
more money chasing baseballs over far-flung lawns than pulling the 
catch of the day out of the bay. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, like everybody else who followed Joe D., the old man  
became an admirer, too. DiMaggio announced his arrival in New York 
in May 1936 with two singles and a triple, when baseball was fast 
becoming America's new religion. Five years later, he turned it 
into an obsession. 
</P>
<P>
	In the summer of 1941, DiMaggio got a hit in 56 straight games.  
When it ended -- thanks to two great defensive stops by a Cleveland 
infielder named Ken Keltner -- he simply started another streak. 
</P>
<P>
	And when he finally left, worn out at age 37, DiMaggio did that  
with grace, too. He showed up at Yankee Stadium a handful of times, 
taped a few commercials and spent much of his energy raising money 
for the Joe DiMaggio Children's Hospital in Hollywood, Fla. Besides 
putting his name over the door, the only thing DiMaggio extracted 
for his years of service was a promise that no child would ever be 
turned away. 
</P>
<P>
	All day Monday the television networks showed those grainy film  
clips again and again and it made you realize there was something 
irresistible about watching him play. There was DiMaggio batting 
and fielding and running like baseball was a game set to Sinatra's 
music -- smart, fluid and full of verve. 
</P>
<P>
	And cooler than just about anything you could ever imagine.  
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Purdue Leads Final Women's Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Purdue led the final Associated Press women's basketball poll of  
the season on Monday, joined in the top four by the other No. 1 
seeds in the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee, seeking its fourth straight national championship,  
held the No. 2 spot, Louisiana Tech was third and Connecticut 
fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	At the bottom, No. 25 Toledo broke into the poll for the first  
time this season and just the third time overall. 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue (28-1), the top seed in the Midwest Regional, received 39  
of 42 first-place votes and 1,047 points from a national media 
panel to finish at No. 1 for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boilermakers defeated both Tennessee and Louisiana Tech this  
season and take a 26-game winning streak into NCAA play. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee (28-2), seeded No. 1 in the East, had two first-place  
votes and 1,009 points, while Louisiana Tech (26-2) had 967 points 
and the remaining first-place vote. Tech is the top seed in the 
West, and Connecticut (27-4) is No. 1 in the Mideast. 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut jumped two spots in the poll after winning the Big  
East Conference tournament. Old Dominion remained at No. 5, and was 
followed by Texas Tech, Colorado State, Notre Dame and Rutgers. 
Clemson and Duke were tied for 10th. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Tech, which beat Iowa State in the Big 12 tournament  
final, climbed three places. Colorado State dropped from fourth to 
seventh after losing to Southern Methodist in the Western Athletic 
Conference final. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia moved up two places to 12th, and Virginia Tech was 13th.  
Then it was North Carolina, UCLA, Oregon and UC Santa Barbara, 
followed by Penn State, Iowa State and Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	LSU, Alabama, Tulane, Florida International and Toledo held the  
final five spots. 
</P>
<P>
	Toledo (25-5), the Mid-American Conference tournament champion,  
was given a No. 6 seed in the NCAA tournament and made the Top 25 
for the first time since the 1993-94 season. The Rockets were 
ranked for two weeks in February of that season. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of Toledo's losses were to Notre Dame, Rutgers and Boston  
College, all of whom made the NCAA field. 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas, which lost to Iowa State in the Big 12 semifinals,  
dropped out. The Jayhawks (22-9) had been 25th. 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue became the 11th different team to finish No. 1 since The  
AP poll started in the 1976-77 season. The Boilermakers were No. 1 
for one week early in the season, then returned on Feb. 22 and 
stayed there the final three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen teams were ranked every week of the season. They were  
Purdue, Tennessee, Louisiana Tech, Connecticut, Notre Dame, Duke, 
Old Dominion, Rutgers, Georgia, UCLA, Texas Tech, North Carolina, 
Virginia, Iowa State and Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
	Teams from the preseason poll that didn't make the final Top 25  
were Kansas, Florida, George Washington, Arkansas, North Carolina 
State, Vanderbilt, Stanford, Illinois and Arizona. Kansas was the 
highest-ranked of those teams at No. 11. 
</P>
<P>
	Toledo became the 41st school to appear in the poll this season.  
The most in any season was 45 in 1991-92.

<HEADLINE> Newspaper Ad Spending Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Spending on newspaper advertisements rose 6.3  
percent to $43.9 billion last year from 1997, in line with previous 
expectations, according the Newspaper Association of America. 
</P>
<P>
	The trade group reported Monday that national advertising  
recorded the fastest growth, rising 7.7 percent to $5.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Retail advertising represented the largest portion of the total  
spending, rising 5.7 percent to $20.3 billion. Classified 
advertising rose 6.6 percent to $17.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The total increase in ad spending was slightly higher than the  
NAA's earlier projections for a 6 percent gain for 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``This growth continues to reflect the ongoing strength in local  
markets across the country,'' said John Sturm, the NAA's chief 
executive and president. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourth-quarter ad spending rose 4.9 percent to $12.7 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	The NAA, based in Vienna, Va., is a nonprofit organization  
representing the newspaper industry and more than 1,700 newspapers 
in the U.S. and Canada. Most NAA members are daily newspapers.

<HEADLINE> Does Quality Pay Off? / Commentary  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                        *AP Business Analyst    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Promoting a meeting it will hold this week, The  
Conference Board asks rhetorically, ``Does quality pay off?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Well, of course it does. Otherwise companies could not succeed  
year after year, decade after decade, as literally thousands have, 
and American productivity could never have grown as strongly as it 
has. 
</P>
<P>
	Over time, customers catch on to what's worthwhile and what  
fails to meet their expectations about price, service and 
reliability. And whenever their quality expectations aren't met 
they look elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Until the 1950s and 1960s, for example, American carmakers  
essentially had the domestic market, the largest of any single 
country and some continents, all to themselves. Then look what 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
	As domestic carmakers got complacent, Japanese and German  
producers, were selling cars in the United States on the basis of 
quality. They made huge inroads. 
</P>
<P>
	In response, U.S. carmakers woke up, instituted new methods,  
spent billions of dollars on modernized production facilities and 
raised standards of design, workmanship and service. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, you cannot compare the vehicle of today with that of 30  
years ago. It is not quite, but nearly so, like comparing the horse 
to the Model T. Today's car is nearly that far ahead of the car of 
30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, there are notable gaps in consumer willingness to put up  
with deficiencies in quality. To name a few: transportation, 
stocks, health insurance, Internet service providers, and TV and 
Internet advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	Hang around any airport almost day, talk to a few people and  
you'll hear an earful about canceled flights, late departures and 
arrivals, missed connections, lack of leg room, meager meals and a 
lot more. 
</P>
<P>
	In stocks, it sometimes is a matter of wonder how so many  
thousands of mutual funds have been created over the past 20 years 
when so many of them, far more than half, fail to match the popular 
averages. 
</P>
<P>
	Awesome too is that a company such as Amazon.com rose more than  
900 percent last year without ever having earned a nickel. This, 
while almost every broker has a list of quality companies selling 
at big discounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Health insurance is an industry in transition, and as a result  
is the recipient of repeated complaints and confusion. 
</P>
<P>
	Very late-night TV ads, as well as Internet ads and offerings in  
the lower end of the cable spectrum, may offer amazing bargains -- 
until items are received. And the same might be said of some 
gardening and mail order catalogs. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet access providers are often barraged with criticisms for  
poor service -- notably, failure to obtain access and long waits for 
service -- but America Online is one of the nation's fastest growing 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Anybody can add to the list. What about billing errors on your  
credit card, or phone bill? And is the quality of service on those 
``money cheerfully refunded'' guarantees as good as promised? 
</P>
<P>
	It raises the question: Can clever, convincing marketing  
overcome consumer dissatisfaction? No doubt it can, for a while. 
But not forever. Buyers eventually realize what's promise and 
what's fulfillment. 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit can tell you all about that.

<HEADLINE>  Baseball Stars Honor Joe DiMaggio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	In midcentury, when baseball stood above all American sports,  
Joe DiMaggio symbolized what fans loved about the game. Fifty years 
later, he had lost little of his star quality. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was to people all over the world what a baseball player was  
supposed to be like,'' former Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda said of 
DiMaggio, who died Monday at age 84. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you said to God, `Create someone who was what a baseball  
player should be,' God would have created Joe DiMaggio. ... And he 
did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added Tim McCarver, who spent two decades as a catcher and is  
now one of baseball's preeminent broadcasters: ``The very mention 
of his name personifies class, dignity, elegance and 
professionalism, both on and off the field.' 
</P>
<P>
	To those who knew him and to those who only admired him from  
afar, DiMaggio was the quintessential American hero. 
</P>
<P>
	``This son of Italian immigrants gave every American something  
to believe in,'' President Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He became the very symbol of American grace, power and skill.  
... I have no doubt that when future generations look back at the 
best of America in the 20th century, they will think of the Yankee 
Clipper and all that he achieved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mark McGwire, himself a larger than life figure after hitting 70  
home runs last season, said he was saddened by DiMaggio's death. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was one of the best in the game,'' said McGwire, who never  
got a chance to meet DiMaggio. ``It's a big loss for the game and 
for life in general.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio was a precursor of the modern athlete. In 1948, he  
signed the first $100,000 contract, and the paper and pen from that 
deal went on display Monday at the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, 
N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	And like Michael Jordan a half-century later, he was the most  
credible commercial spokesman in sports. 
</P>
<P>
	Long after he retired, he was instantly recognizable in ads for  
``Mr. Coffee.'' Even today, when those who saw him play are in 
their late 1950s or beyond, a bank that retained its services has a 
sign with a ``5'' in pinstripes at Grand Central Terminal in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	Few have to ask what that means.  
</P>
<P>
	He was the reason many Italian-Americans in New York rooted for  
the Yankees, just as blacks rooted for the Brooklyn Dodgers because 
they made Jackie Robinson the first black in the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this century, there have been three baseball players who  
transcended their sport to become part of American legend,'' Vice 
President Al Gore said. ``Where Babe Ruth was known for his power 
and Jackie Robinson was known for his courage, Joe DiMaggio was 
known for dignity and grace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That was evident to DiMaggio's fellow players.  
</P>
<P>
	``In 1951, while I was still in high school, I went to New York  
to play in the Hearst All-Star game,'' recalled Al Kaline, who went 
on to join DiMaggio in the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	``They took us through the locker room and Joe was sitting in  
front of his locker. I stopped and shook his hand. It was like 
meeting a god.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ted Williams, who played in the Boston outfield next to  
DiMaggio's brother, Dom, was the contemporary most often likened to 
the Yankee Clipper. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no one Ted Williams admired, respected and envied  
more than Joe DiMaggio,'' Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
	While DiMaggio seemed standoffish with strangers, he was  
charming to those who got to know him, even if they weren't 
baseball fans, like the wife of Davey Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	``My wife and I were at a table with Yogi Berra and Joe. Then  
the next week we had Ted Williams at our table,'' said Davey 
Johnson, now manager of the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
	``She got Joe's and Ted's autograph and didn't even know what  
she had. She knew Joe from his coffee commercials and thought Ted 
was a great fisherman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To his contemporaries, he was, of course, a great player. But he  
was more than that. 
</P>
<P>
	``I idolized him for what he represented, which was class,  
dignity and character. He was a winner, a champion and a true 
icon,'' said Lasorda, who was a teen-ager when DiMaggio was in his 
prime. 
</P>
<P>
	That was true even to some current players.  
</P>
<P>
	``I got the opportunity to talk with him and just sit there and  
see what he was all about -- it's something I will never forget,'' 
said Toronto's David Wells, who grew up a Yankee fan and met 
DiMaggio during his two seasons with the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anybody who has grown up a fan of baseball, especially a  
Yankee fan, and you get to sit there and talk with one of their 
legends just gives you goose bumps. A lot of people had a difficult 
time getting autographs from him, but when I walked in there he 
said 'Sure, Dave what do you want signed?' Like, wow, that's 
awesome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then Wells was asked how he would have pitched to DiMaggio if he  
had faced him in his prime? 
</P>
<P>
	``High and tight,'' Wells replied.

supposed to be like,'' former Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda said of 
DiMaggio, who died Monday at age 84. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you said to God, `Create someone who was what a baseball  
player should be,' God would have created Joe DiMaggio. ... And he 
did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added Tim McCarver, who spent two decades as a catcher and is  
now one of baseball's preeminent broadcasters: ``The very mention 
of his name personifies class, dignity, elegance and 
professionalism, both on and off the field.' 
</P>
<P>
	To those who knew him and to those who only admired him from  
afar, DiMaggio was the quintessential American hero. 
</P>
<P>
	``This son of Italian immigrants gave every American something  
to believe in,'' President Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He became the very symbol of American grace, power and skill.  
... I have no doubt that when future generations look back at the 
best of America in the 20th century, they will think of the Yankee 
Clipper and all that he achieved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mark McGwire, himself a larger than life figure after hitting 70  
home runs last season, said he was saddened by DiMaggio's death. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was one of the best in the game,'' said McGwire, who never  
got a chance to meet DiMaggio. ``It's a big loss for the game and 
for life in general.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio was a precursor of the modern athlete. In 1948, he  
signed the first $100,000 contract, and the paper and pen from that 
deal went on display Monday at the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, 
N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	And like Michael Jordan a half-century later, he was the most  
credible commercial spokesman in sports. 
</P>
<P>
	Long after he retired, he was instantly recognizable in ads for  
``Mr. Coffee.'' Even today, when those who saw him play are in 
their late 1950s or beyond, a bank that retained its services has a 
sign with a ``5'' in pinstripes at Grand Central Terminal in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	Few have to ask what that means.  
</P>
<P>
	He was the reason many Italian-Americans in New York rooted for  
the Yankees, just as blacks rooted for the Brooklyn Dodgers because 
they made Jackie Robinson the first black in the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this century, there have been three baseball players who  
transcended their sport to become part of American legend,'' Vice 
President Al Gore said. ``Where Babe Ruth was known for his power 
and Jackie Robinson was known for his courage, Joe DiMaggio was 
known for dignity and grace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That was evident to DiMaggio's fellow players.  
</P>
<P>
	``In 1951, while I was still in high school, I went to New York  
to play in the Hearst All-Star game,'' recalled Al Kaline, who went 
on to join DiMaggio in the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	``They took us through the locker room and Joe was sitting in  
front of his locker. I stopped and shook his hand. It was like 
meeting a god.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ted Williams, who played in the Boston outfield next to  
DiMaggio's brother, Dom, was the contemporary most often likened to 
the Yankee Clipper. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no one Ted Williams admired, respected and envied  
more than Joe DiMaggio,'' Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
	While DiMaggio seemed standoffish with strangers, he was  
charming to those who got to know him, even if they weren't 
baseball fans, like the wife of Davey Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	``My wife and I were at a table with Yogi Berra and Joe. Then  
the next week we had Ted Williams at our table,'' said Davey 
Johnson, now manager of the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
	``She got Joe's and Ted's autograph and didn't even know what  
she had. She knew Joe from his coffee commercials and thought Ted 
was a great fisherman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To his contemporaries, he was, of course, a great player. But he  
was more than that. 
</P>
<P>
	``I idolized him for what he represented, which was class,  
dignity and character. He was a winner, a champion and a true 
icon,'' said Lasorda, who was a teen-ager when DiMaggio was in his 
prime. 
</P>
<P>
	That was true even to some current players.  
</P>
<P>
	``I got the opportunity to talk with him and just sit there and  
see what he was all about -- it's something I will never forget,'' 
said Toronto's David Wells, who grew up a Yankee fan and met 
DiMaggio during his two seasons with the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anybody who has grown up a fan of baseball, especially a  
Yankee fan, and you get to sit there and talk with one of their 
legends just gives you goose bumps. A lot of people had a difficult 
time getting autographs from him, but when I walked in there he 
said 'Sure, Dave what do you want signed?' Like, wow, that's 
awesome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then Wells was asked how he would have pitched to DiMaggio if he  
had faced him in his prime? 
</P>
<P>
	``High and tight,'' Wells replied.

<HEADLINE> FTC, Intel Reach Proposed Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Trade Commission lawyers and Intel  
have reached a proposed settlement over government charges that the 
microchip giant illegally used bullying tactics to quell 
competition, an FTC spokeswoman said today. 
</P>
<P>
	FTC staff members and Intel ``jointly filed a motion with the  
commission's secretary, withdrawing from adjudication the FTC's 
case against Intel,'' spokeswoman Michelle Muth said. She said she 
could not discuss details of the settlement -- which must now be 
considered for approval by the commission -- or even if the 
settlement would end all ongoing government litigation with the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel, which reported $26.2 billion in sales last year, had  
already acknowledged it did most of what the FTC alleged, but the 
company claimed it had not acted illegally and that its business 
practices had not ``chilled'' innovation in the lucrative microchip 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``We view this compromise agreement as a 'win-win' for both  
parties and we are satisfied that the agreement gives us value for 
our intellectual property rights. This is acceptable to both 
parties and was the result of constructive dialog between Intel and 
the FTC,'' said Craig Barrett, president and chief executive 
officer of Intel. 
</P>
<P>
	The government had accused Intel of illegally using its industry  
influence to withhold key technical information about future 
microchips from three companies ``to muscle competitors into 
signing over intellectual property rights.''

<HEADLINE> FDIC Chief Yields on New Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The head of the FDIC said Monday her agency is  
ready to withdraw proposed anti-money laundering rules to track 
bank customers' transactions, which had provoked a public outcry 
over privacy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The public has spoken very loudly and clearly,'' Donna Tanoue,  
chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., said in a 
telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she will urge her colleagues on the agency's  
four-member board to agree to drop the proposed regulations, called 
``Know Your Customer'' rules. The board's next meeting is on March 
23. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Tanoue spoke as the 90-day public comment period for the  
proposal closed. On Friday, the Senate joined the torrent of 
criticism and sent a message to federal bank regulators to withdraw 
the rules. 
</P>
<P>
	By an 88-0 vote, the Senate expressed support for a measure  
directing the regulators to drop the proposed rules. Senate 
Democrats blocked a vote on actual adoption of the measure, 
sponsored by Sens. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, and Wayne Allard, R-Colo., 
so it lacks the force of law. 
</P>
<P>
	In the House, the Banking Committee on Thursday adopted an  
amendment to a big financial services bill that would kill the 
proposed banking rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Tanoue previously had said she was reconsidering the  
proposed rules, which were denounced in a flood of angry e-mail 
starting in December. The FDIC had received more than 170,000 
e-mail messages and letters as of Friday; by Monday, the final day 
of the comment period, that had jumped to some 225,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed regulations would require banks to verify their  
customers' identities, know where their money comes from and 
determine their normal pattern of transactions. The current 
requirements for banks to report any ``suspicious'' transactions to 
law enforcement authorities would be expanded. 
</P>
<P>
	Privacy advocates, conservative groups, ordinary people and the  
nation's bankers have complained that the rules would transform 
every bank teller into a spy for Big Brother. They maintain the 
rules are unconstitutional and would violate the Fourth Amendment 
prohibition against unreasonable search and seizure. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Ms. Tanoue, the FDIC board includes U.S.  
Comptroller of the Currency John D. Hawke Jr., who oversees 
nationally chartered banks. He also believes the bank rules should 
be scrapped, as he told a House subcommittee hearing last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Another board member is Ellen Seidman, director of the Office of  
Thrift Supervision, who has not yet taken a public position on the 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
	The thrift agency, part of the Treasury Department, wanted to  
wait until after the comment period was over before it decided on a 
position, spokesman William Fulwider said Monday. ``We will look at 
it with a sense of balance and sensitivity,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The fourth director is FDIC Vice Chairman Andrew Hove, who  
likely will agree with Ms. Tanoue. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Reserve, which also is involved in proposing the  
bank rules, has not taken a public position on them. 
</P>
<P>
	The rules are designed to combat money laundering techniques  
used by drug traffickers and other criminals to hide illegal 
profits. Money laundering is a major concern of law enforcement 
officials; it reached an estimated $30 billion in this country last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Laundering includes the use of wire transfers and bank drafts as  
well as ``smurfing,'' the practice of breaking down transactions 
into smaller amounts that do not have to be reported under the Bank 
Secrecy Act.

<HEADLINE> Pirates' Guillen To Appeal Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SARASOTA, Fla. (AP) -- Jose Guillen's request for a U.S. visa was  
denied, the Pittsburgh Pirates said Monday, further delaying the 
right fielder's arrival at spring training. 
</P>
<P>
	Guillen, who remained in the Dominican Republic, has missed the  
first 13 days of workouts as U.S. officials question the validity 
of his marriage last fall. The team media guide lists him as being 
single, so federal officials are wondering about the validity of 
the marriage license he gave them. 
</P>
<P>
	Guillen's immigration lawyer, Christina Perez, has filed an  
appeal with the State Department, but the Pirates do not know how 
long that will take. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's only so much the Pirates can do in this matter,''  
assistant general manager John Sirignano said. ``We will offer any 
assistance we can to help get a decision, but it's really out of 
our hands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pirates manager Gene Lamont says Guillen must get to spring  
training soon to have a realistic chance of playing on opening day, 
scheduled for April 5. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to get Jose started at some point,'' Lamont said.  
``The biggest thing will be if he shows up to camp in good shape 
once he gets his problems resolved. He's supposedly been working 
out in the Dominican. Even if he comes here in shape, it's going to 
take at least two weeks of games to get him ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Guillen, 22, has been the Pirates' starting right fielder for  
two seasons after making the jump from Class A to the major leagues 
during 1997. He hit .267 last year with 14 homers and 84 RBIs in 
153 games.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Ron Howard believes television stars will bring  
added authenticity to his upcoming movie ``EdTV.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``So many of the TV people have been in the media glare recently  
and know what it's like to go from anonymity to full exposure in a 
short period of time,'' Howard told TV Guide for its March 13 
edition. 
</P>

	In addition to Matthew McConaughey, who plays a man who suddenly  
becomes famous, the movie features Jenna Elfman, Woody Harrelson, 
Ellen DeGeneres, Martin Landau and Rob Reiner.

<P>
	``Most people link celebrity with a kind of recognition that  
leads to happiness. And in some instances it can lead to some 
wonderfully happy moments,'' Howard said. ``But I don't believe

<HEADLINE> Cuban Exiles Protest Baseball Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Major League Baseball's  
announcement to return to Cuba for the first time in 40 years drew 
protest and criticism from Cuban exiles voicing opposition to any 
interaction between the United States and the communist nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuban exiles staging a demonstration at a Baltimore Orioles  
exhibition game Sunday said the team's plan to play the Cuban 
National team in Havana on March 28 symbolizes America's growing 
support for Cuban President Fidel Castro and his government. 
</P>
<P>
	``Going to Cuba under the current conditions there is a sign of  
insensitivity and lack of respect for human rights there,'' said 
Huber Matos, a Cuban native who spent 20 years in prison on the 
island for opposing the Castro government. ``It's like taking part 
in the abuses that are going on there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Matos joined more than 70 exiles waving Cuban flags and holding  
protest signs outside the gates of Fort Lauderdale Stadium before 
an exhibition game with the Florida Marlins. They continued their 
protest from the stands inside the ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to be able to let Oriole players know Cuba's  
reality,'' said Sylvia Iriondo, head of Mothers and Women Against 
Repression in Cuba. ``This is a time to support the Cuban people. 
They don't realize there is a wave a violence aimed at the 
opposition and certain journalists there. This is not a time to 
play ball with Castro.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The protest came on the day the Orioles announced that they  
finalized an agreement to play on the island after two months of 
negotiations between the State Department, Cuban government, 
commissioner's office, the Orioles and the players' association. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles are hoping to host the Cuban national team in a  
return exhibition game at Camden Yards in Baltimore on April 4. 
</P>
<P>
	``The intention of the Baltimore Orioles is not politics,'' said  
John Maroon, spokesman for the team. ``We want to bring two people 
together that have a common passion for baseball. The love of 
baseball there is as strong as it is here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most Cubans living in exile in Miami have long opposed Castro's  
communist government. Many arrived in South Florida after he took 
power some 40 years ago and hope to return once Castro is gone. 
</P>
<P>
	The protesters said they oppose a game played on the island  
while the Castro government continues to jail political opponents. 
They cited the case of four opposition leaders on the island who 
went on trial last week on charges of sedition amid a new crackdown 
on political dissidents. 
</P>
<P>
	The government accused the four dissidents of promoting U.S.  
policies toward Cuba and trying to harm the economy by discouraging 
foreign investment. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Cuba there is a brutal dictatorship that stomps on the  
rights of people,'' Matos said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the words of the protesters were lost on some baseball fans  
at the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we should keep sports out of the political arena,''  
said Kevin Stutzman of Fort Lauderdale. ``I understand what they 
are saying, but I think they are going about it the wrong way. They 
make people angry instead of sympathetic.''

<HEADLINE> Crude Gains on Cuts Talks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Crude oil futures rose Monday on the New York Mercantile  
Exchange, reaching a four-month high amid news that two major 
oil-producing countries are seeking further production cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, grains and soybeans rose sharply, while copper  
plummeted. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude oil rocketed higher after officials from Saudi Arabia and  
Iran said they would work together to win production cuts at the 
March 23 meeting in Vienna of the Organization of Petroleum 
Exporting Countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude prices have fallen about 35 percent in the last 18 months  
as producers fail to make the necessary cutbacks in the face of 
economic troubles around the globe that has sharply curtailed 
demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Saudi Arabia, the world's largest producer, and Iran depend  
largely on revenues from oil exports to fulfill domestic budgetary 
needs. Both countries now are running huge deficits, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
	The gains were tempered Monday, however, on reports Venezuela,  
another large producer that ships most of its oil to the United 
States, currently has no plans to further reduce its output. 
</P>
<P>
	Light, sweet crude for April delivery rose 33 cents to $13.63 a  
barrel; April heating oil rose 1.03 cents to 35.78 cents a gallon; 
April unleaded gasoline rose 1.21 cents to 42.61 cents a gallon; 
April natural gas rose .6 cent to $1.859 for each 1,000 cubic feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Grain futures moved higher on the Chicago Board of Trade as  
market participants covered their positions in advance of 
Thursday's government crop supply and production updates. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Agriculture Department was expected to provide further  
insight into national spring planting intentions and the current 
state of inventories. 
</P>
<P>
	Grains also were supported as heavy snow fell across the  
Midwest, limiting movement of grains to U.S. terminals. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat also received a boost from talk of dry weather in U.S.  
growing areas and news that Pakistan is in the market for either 
U.S., Australian or Canadian wheat. Soybean futures were sharply 
higher, receiving support from mild export business and a rallying 
soy oil market. 
</P>
<P>
	May wheat rose 2 1/4 cents at $2.70 a bushel; May corn rose 4 3/4  
cents to $2.20 3/4 a bushel; May soybeans rose 6 1/2 cents to $4.71 a 
bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Copper futures retreated on the New York Mercantile Exchange  
amid news of declining demand in Japan, where housing starts, 
construction orders and vehicle sales all were off. Japan is Asia's 
biggest user of the metal. 
</P>
<P>
	The price drops was held in check by word of the biggest decline  
in London Metal Exchange copper stockpiles since mid-June, with 
much of that coming from a purchase of 5,000 tons of the metal out 
of Singapore warehouses. 
</P>
<P>
	Copper prices have been on a downward trend since June 1997,  
when the price hovered around $1.22 a pound. 
</P>
<P>
	May copper was down .75 cent at 62.65 cents per pound.  
</P>
<P>
	Gold futures hit an eight-week high before settling somewhat  
lower on the New York Mercantile Exchange amid talk that higher 
energy prices could lead to inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold closed up $3.20 at $292.70 an ounce.

<HEADLINE> L.A. To Get More Buses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Metropolitan Transportation Authority  
must add 277 buses to its routes by the end of the year to comply 
with a court-ordered decree, a federal mediator ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	The decree was set in 1996 after the MTA settled a civil rights  
suit filed by the Bus Riders Union and the National Association for 
the Advancement of Colored People's Legal Defense and Educational 
Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	But federal Special Master Donald Bliss found Monday that the  
agency had not complied with a requirement to buy more buses and 
improve its fleet. 
</P>
<P>
	By 1997, the MTA was supposed to have no more than 15 passengers  
standing for an average of more than 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The message is clear,'' said Rita Burgos, a member of the  
union, which negotiates on behalf of 350,000 daily bus riders. 
``It's now time to comply and do what they should have been doing 
all along. This is a victory for the disabled, the elderly and 
low-income workers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his 57-page ruling, Bliss ordered an additional 532 buses be  
bought by 2004. The agency already has ordered 2,095 buses through 
2004. 
</P>
<P>
	``My initial reaction is that his ruling is excessive,'' said  
MTA chief Julian Burke. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the outlay for buses will exceed $100 million while  
causing MTA's annual operating costs will jump by more than $50 
million.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Airline Exec Shugrue Dead at 58 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Martin R. Shugrue Jr., an airline executive who  
nearly rescued doomed Eastern Airlines and Pan Am during a lifetime 
in the industry, has died. He was 58. 
</P>
<P>
	Shugrue, who had worked with airline consulting firm Aviation  
Management Services in the last year, died Sunday at his home in 
Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	The Providence, R.I., native joined Pan American World Airways  
in 1968 after serving as a Navy pilot. A year later he went into 
management, fast ascending within in the New York-based carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	By 1983 he was elected vice chairman of Pan Am's board, but he  
left five years later to become president of Houston-based 
Continental Airlines. After serving as trustee-in-bankruptcy of 
Eastern Airlines, nearly rescuing it in the early 1990s, Shugrue 
started the new Pan Am in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the new version of Pan Am went the way of the old one,  
failing in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Shugrue is survived by his wife Marianne, a former Pan Am flight  
attendant, and his four children, two by Mrs. Shugrue and two by 
his late first wife. He also is survived by his father, Martin R. 
Shugrue, of Providence, three sisters and two brothers.

<HEADLINE>  Paris Show Features Young Designers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Young designers carried the opening day Sunday of  
Paris fall-winter 1999-2000 ready-to-wear collections, steeped in 
mohair and enthusiasm and pleasant surprises. 
</P>
<P>
	The first day of showings is often a slow starter, but the air  
crackled with expectation at the Louvre Carrousel theaters, where 
the hefty price tag for space was chopped from $17,500 to $7,000 so 
youth could have its day. 
</P>
<P>
	Nothing looked startling or even futuristic, though there was  
much to please in these younger collections. 
</P>
<P>
	Ralph Kemp, 33, made a hit with his tribal details from Alaska,  
Central or South America, plus a map of the Americas on the runway. 
</P>
<P>
	He used natural fabrics that went from jersey to leather to  
terry cloth, with plenty of mohair, to create looks that were both 
wild and sophisticated. 
</P>
<P>
	His black, white and gray mohair trouser outfits were good city  
gear. Leather was used to pay tribute to North American Indians, 
with gold-painted knees under hitched-up miniskirts. 
</P>
<P>
	His huge fake monkey-fur coats in red or white roused the crowd.  
</P>
<P>
	Kemp, all French despite the Anglo-Saxon-sounding name, studied  
design in Paris and worked with Chantal Thomass, Marithe and 
Francois Girbaud and Kenzo. He now has two Paris boutiques and one 
in Lyon. 
</P>
<P>
	``I especially admired the beaded jewelry and accessories,''  
said artistic designer Jean-Charles de Castelbajac, in the 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
	Christian Le Drezen's show for the millennium was positively  
medieval, shown among puffs of smoke from a steam machine. The 
32-year-old Breton spent years working as a chef. But he gave up 
the sauces for the fabrics in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	After a start in New York with Roth Import, a bridal wear  
boutique, Le Drezen worked with Kenzo and Dior before creating 
jewelry, costumes and launching his own ready-to-wear line in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	His remarkable clothes were long, yet appealingly wearable. The  
long openwork-weave coat in gray mohair with embroidery over wide 
cotton trousers with a fisherman's apron had echoes of his roots in 
France's sea-faring region of Brittany. 
</P>
<P>
	Long, strapless dresses with attractive knit tops, fabulous  
blue-gray ribbed sweaters with big cowl collars paired with checked 
long skirts and trousers had the clearly modern-medieval line. 
</P>
<P>
	Beautiful silk wrap dresses and tunics -- often over figured net  
or tulle skirts -- and terrific mohair coats or crochet dresses 
completed Le Drezen's fashion picture. 
</P>
<P>
	The audience liked it, and Le Drezen's grandmother, Marie Louise  
Boussard, was delighted to kiss her grandson for the cameras. 
</P>
<P>
	Mohair is big with the young designing set, and Stella Cadente  
used plenty of it. She did mohair tunics, fitted jackets and 
fringes for long skirts, dresses and coats. 
</P>
<P>
	Cadente's background is all French, from design school at  
Academie Bercot to stints at Corinne Cobson and Claude Montana. 
</P>
<P>
	Pleated long skirts with mohair short sweaters, slinky mohair  
dresses, and open wide mohair jackets over bare navels and 
low-slung skirts were her forte. 
</P>
<P>
	The dressier clothes for this urban jungle look included  
high-waisted empire line gray or white dresses with sparkly details 
-- demure but sexy. 
</P>
<P>
	Rooster feathers made a few funny bibs and added detail to  
minicoats. 
</P>
<P>
	And off-white Capucin monk-like garments with their hoods and  
crystal beads plunged any thoughts of the millennium back toward 
the medieval line of thinking. 
</P>
<P>
	But where Cadente stumbled was her use of nudity-for-effect.  
Briefs and bared bosoms to show off winter warm jackets in marabout 
or mohair look, these days, like gratuitous attention-grabbing. 
</P>
<P>
	As the week goes on, new stars may shine at several big-name  
houses. Fashion watchers looked forward to Yves Saint Laurent's 
Rive Gauche ready-to-wear Monday, designed for the first time by 
Alber Elbaz instead of the master himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Gilles Dufour, formerly Karl Lagerfeld's assistant at Chanel, is  
showing the Balmain collection. Ronald van der Kemp is showing for 
the first time at Guy Laroche, and the Nina Ricci collection is 
signed by Nathalie Gervais.

<HEADLINE> McDougal Defiant in Face of Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- In the face of contempt and obstruction  
of justice charges that could send her back to prison, Whitewater 
figure Susan McDougal insists she has no information on President 
Clinton and the first lady's business dealings in Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal already has served 18 months on a civil contempt  
citation, and she goes on trial today for refusing to answer 
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's questions about the Clintons. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted, she could be sent back to prison and fined up to  
$750,000. But her lawyer says Mrs. McDougal won't be broken. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would say that Susan's resolve is as strong as it's always  
been,'' said Mark Geragos. ``She understands the consequences.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The charges against Mrs. McDougal, 44, relate to the Whitewater  
probe. 
</P>
<P>
	Grand jurors were investigating whether Mrs. McDougal had  
improper financial dealings with the Clintons when the president 
was governor of Arkansas. McDougal and the Clintons were business 
partners in the failed real estate development known as Whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal has said she refused to answer questions because  
she believes Starr would twist her words to suit his purposes and 
may charge her with perjury if he doesn't get the testimony he 
wants. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge George Howard Jr. said last week that he  
would consider allowing evidence of ``prosecutorial misconduct or 
outrageous government conduct,'' specifically whether Starr wanted 
Mrs. McDougal to lie about the Clintons. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Independent Counsel Hickman Ewing Jr. was unfazed.  
</P>
<P>
	``We know in any high profile case, it is a normal thing where  
the prosecutor is attacked,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors will introduce evidence that Mrs. McDougal had  
relevant information on the Clintons, Ewing said. According to the 
indictment, prosecutors want to know: 
</P>
<P>
	--Whether Clinton was aware of a $300,000 loan to Mrs. McDougal  
from David Hale, who pleaded guilty to mail fraud and conspiracy. 
Hale said Clinton pressured him to make such a loan in 1986. The 
government claims Mrs. McDougal used the money for purposes other 
than what it was intended for. 
</P>
<P>
	--Whether Clinton knew about Lorance Heights, an 800-acre tract  
south of Little Rock that the Clintons' and the McDougals' 
Whitewater Development Corp. purchased in 1986. Prosecutors say the 
company used money from the $300,000 loan to secure the land. The 
Clintons have said James McDougal, Mrs. McDougal's former husband, 
never told them about Lorance Heights or the loan. 
</P>
<P>
	--Whether Clinton testified truthfully during the 1996 trial of  
Mrs. McDougal, her late husband and then-Gov. Jim Guy Tucker. 
</P>
<P>
	--Why the words ``Payoff Clinton'' were written in the notation  
section of a $5,081.82 check drawn on a McDougal account and 
payable to Madison Guaranty, which the McDougals owned. 
</P>
<P>
	Jury selection in Mrs. McDougal's contempt trial was expected to  
continue through most of the week.

	Joe DiMaggio Dies  
</P>
<P>
	HOLLYWOOD, Fla. (AP) -- Baseball legend Joe DiMaggio is being  
remembered as the epitome of class and grace in the sport. The New 
York Yankees Hall of Famer died today at his home. He was 84. 
DiMaggio underwent lung cancer surgery in October. He then suffered 
several setbacks from lung infections and even fell into a coma 
briefly. His 56-game hitting streak in 1941 endures as one of the 
most remarkable records in sports. Flags at Yankee Stadium and the 
Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y., were lowered to half staff. 
President Clinton called DiMaggio ``the very symbol of American 
grace, power and skill.'' A funeral will be held Thursday in his 
native Northern California. 

</P>
<P>
	Clinton Arrives in Central America  
</P>
<P>
	MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) -- President Clinton began a pilgrimage  
today to the sites of Hurricane Mitch's worst horrors, offering 
Central Americans hope for their reconstruction. Clinton began his 
four-day, four nation mission just as 15,000 Guatemalans and 
Salvadorans who were in the United States illegally become eligible 
for deportation. He has turned down pleas for an extension of the 
halt in deportations that was instituted after last fall's 
devastating storm. The stay in deportations expires today. 
Salvadoran President Armando Calderon Sol said to have the 
immigrants return now ``would cause us tragic problems of 
stability.'' Clinton will next travel to San Salvador.

	Sweepstakes Hearing Held  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Senate subcommittee is considering cracking  
down on mail marketing sweepstakes that say things like ``You may 
be a winner!'' Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, says the sweeps are 
deceptive and prey on senior citizens, often using misleading 
language, trusted spokesmen and government look-a-like mailings. 
She has sponsored legislation that would impose the first national 
regulation of sweepstakes mailings and levy hefty fines for 
deceptive practices. Lawmakers single out what they call the big 
four, American Family Publishers, Publishers Clearing House, 
Readers Digest and Time.

	McDougal Defiant in Face of Trial  
</P>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Whitewater figure Susan McDougal went  
back to court today to face charges of contempt and obstruction of 
justice that could send her back to prison. She is on trial for 
refusing to answer Independent Counsel Ken Starr's questions about 
the Clintons. McDougal insists she has no information on their 
dealings in the failed Arkansas real estate development known as 
Whitewater. But prosecutors say they will introduce evidence that 
McDougal had relevant information on the Clintons. McDougal already

	More Fighting in Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Mortar and small-arms fire broke out  
in Kosovo along the Macedonian border today, and Yugoslavia's 
president shrugged off the threat of NATO airstrikes to restate his 
opposition to foreign troops policing a peace deal. A U.S. envoy 
also was encountering resistance in trying to persuade Kosovo 
Liberation Army commanders to accept a U.S.-backed peace plan. One 
diplomat said rebel commanders still had problems accepting the 
plan, with stumbling blocks including rebel misgivings about 
Russian participation in a NATO-led peacekeeping force and the 
requirement that the guerrillas surrender weapons to the 
peacekeepers.

	Colombia To Probe American's Deaths

	SAN VICENTE DEL CAGUAN, Colombia (AP) -- A senior commander of  
Colombia's top rebel group says it will investigate whether its 
guerrillas killed three Americans last week and will punish anyone 
found responsible. However, Raul Reyes, a member of the seven-man 
ruling junta of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, said 
that up to now he saw no signs of any rebel role. The three 
Americans were kidnapped Feb. 25 while on a mission to help an 
Indian group, the U'wa, organize schools on its reservation on the 
Colombian side.

<HEADLINE> Dow Falls; Nasdaq Jumps / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nasdaq composite index closed sharply  
higher, after Intel sparked a rally in technology shares. But the 
Dow Jones industrials lagged the broader market, closing lower 
after making spectacular gains last week. 
</P>
<P>
	According to preliminary calculations, the Dow Jones industrial  
average fell 8.47 to 9,727.61. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 7.26 to 1,282.73, and the  
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index was up 60.51 at 2,397.62. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 6-to-5 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, with 1,368 up, 1,638 down and 561 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE volume totaled 705 million shares as of 4 p.m., vs. 828  
million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index rose 0.90 to 604.10, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 4.77 to 712.18. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 2.05 to 400.06.  
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks rallied after a weak performance last week,  
after Nasdaq component Intel announced it had agreed to settle 
Federal Trade Commission charges that the chip maker had illegally 
bullied three other companies into handing over secret information 
about their products. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel shares climbed 5 to 118 5/8. Another computer stock, Dell  
Computer, was up 2 3/8 at 45 3/8 in leading volume in Nasdaq trading. On 
the New York Stock Exchange, Dow component IBM was up 5/8 at 179. 
</P>
<P>
	But in general on Big Board, two days of spectacular  
back-to-back gains in the Dow couldn't hold. The Dow gained a total 
of 460 points on Thursday and Friday. On Friday, it 268.68 to close 
at a record 9,736.08, helped by a strong advance in the bond 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds were still up today, with the 30-year Treasury up 1/8 point  
and yielding 5.58 percent, down from its 5.60-percent close on 
Friday. But it wasn't enough to help blue-chip stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just giving back some of the gains of last Thursday and  
Friday,'' said John Shaughnessy, chief investment strategist at 
Advest Inc. ``But the backdrop of this market continues to be very, 
very solid. Inflation is still contained, money supply growth very, 
very adequate, and this is a liquidity-driven market that depends 
on investors continuing to put more money in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by about 4 to 3 on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume was moderately heavy and 
below Friday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The market was also helped by some takeover news. Belgian-Dutch  
financial services group Fortis agreed to pay $2.8 billion, or $55 
a share, for American Bankers Insurance Group Inc. a Miami-based 
insurer. ABI's shares were up 5 11/16 at 52 1/16. 
</P>
<P>
	In other merger news, Allied Waste Industries Inc. announced  
this morning a $7.3 billion, or $45 a share, cash bid for larger 
rival Browning-Ferris Industries Inc. Allied Waste's bid would be 
30 percent premium over Friday's closing stock price. Browning 
Ferris was up 4 5/16 at 39 1/16, while Allied Waste's shares were 
up 1 1/2 at 16 1/2.

<P>
	Comments from the fans and others on the death of Joe DiMaggio:

had a very special aura. He had a lot of dignity about him besides 
being an excellent ballplayer.'' -- Howard Fine, a plastics 
manufacturer from Mamaroneck, N.Y. 

</P>
<P>
	``He was what baseball was all about before we got to that  
high-priced stuff.'' -- George Ladino, a Boston native now living in 
London who was traveling through New York's Grand Central Terminal. 

</P>
<P>
	``It's the passing of a person from a time when baseball was the  
way it should be, when there was a higher ethical and moral 
standard.'' -- Doug Connor, a financial industry worker from 
Irvington, N.Y. 

</P>
<P>

Hero.' He confronted adversity with grace under pressure.'' -- Joe 
Dorinson, author of ``Jackie Robinson: Races, Sports and the 
American Dream,'' which had a section comparing Robinson and 
DiMaggio.

	``For several generations of baseball fans, Joe was the  
personification of grace, class and dignity on the baseball 
diamond. His persona extended beyond the playing field and touched 
all our hearts. In many respects, as an immigrant's son, he 
represented the hopes and ideals of our great country.'' -- Baseball 
commissioner Bud Selig. 

</P>
<P>
	``Like his many fans across America, and indeed, around the  
world, the Yankees are deeply saddened by the passing of Joe 
DiMaggio, one of our own and one of the greatest of all time. It 
was the class and dignity with which he led his life that made him 
part of all of us.'' -- Yankees owner George M. Steinbrenner. 

</P>
<P>
	``He was the kind of guy that exemplified what a major leaguer  
should be like, and act like, and play like. ... He played the game 
with so much intensity. He played the game with pride. He wore the 
Yankee uniform with dignity and character.'' -- former LA Dodgers 
manager Tommy Lasorda, interviewed on CNN.

	``Where have you gone Joe DiMaggio?

<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- David Cone never asked Joe DiMaggio for his  
autograph. He was too afraid, so he went out and bought a dozen 
from a collector. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't remember what the exact price was, but it was a lot,''  
the New York Yankees pitcher said Monday, recalling the purchase 
about a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``He really lived up to his billing. He was the greatest living  
player. He just had such a dignity and an elegance about him that 
nobody can match in today's game. Even the greatest players in 
today's game can't match that elegance that he had. He's one of a 
kind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio, who died Monday at his South Florida home, played for  
10 pennant winners and nine World Series champions with the 
Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans visiting the spring training complex placed flowers in  
front of a monument for him outside Legends Field, and the No. 5 
was stitched onto the left sleeve of each player's jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees ran a 90-second videotape of DiMaggio highlights  
before observing a moment of silence before the start of Monday 
night's game against the Philadelphia Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Joe DiMaggio is baseball. He's a national hero,'' said Sandra  
De Santis, a Highland Park, N.J. mother, whose 11-year-old son 
Gregory placed a bouquet is front of the plaque that reads: 
</P>
<P>
	``From 1936-51, Joe led the Yankees through their most  
dominating era. His excellence on the field propelled the Bombers 
to 10 World Series and his graceful stroke was one of baseball's 
greatest pleasures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By early afternoon, the Yankees posted a security guard to keep  
TV cameramen and early arriving fans off the grass in front of the 
monument, which is part of a tribute to all-time club greats. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, the club placed a huge spray of flowers and a painting of  
DiMaggio at the site. 
</P>
<P>
	``Very few people touched so many generations and so many lives.  
He had a tremendous impact on so many people. He was part of the 
fabric of America,'' general manager Brian Cashman said. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio's 56-game hitting streak in 1941 is considered one of  
the greatest records in sports, and current Yankees marveled about 
the mystique that set him apart from other Hall of Famers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I met him a few times,'' Cone said. ``He told me that he'd  
seen me pitch and sometimes I looked unhittable and sometimes I 
looked hittable. I didn't know how to take that. But just the fact 
he knew who I was was enough for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Catcher Joe Girardi talked about what a thrill it was to have  
his picture taken with DiMaggio when he threw out the first pitch 
during a playoff game in 1996. Darryl Strawberry predicted no one 
will ever hit safely in 56 straight game again, while Derek Jeter 
described DiMaggio as ``everything a ballplayer would want to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jeter, noting DiMaggio was an intensely private person, said  
most players were reluctant to approach him during his occasional 
trips to Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	That, however, didn't mean they didn't soak up as much of the  
Yankee Clipper as they could. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had more presence than anybody I ever met. When he was  
around, you knew it. Everybody lit up. The whole clubhouse would be 
abuzz when Joe D. walked in,'' Cone said. 
</P>
<P>
	Longtime baseball executive Arthur Richman, now a senior adviser  
to the Yankees, recalled DiMaggio as a friend and one of the 
fiercest competitors in the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I started watching him in 1936. I always said the greatest  
player I ever saw was Babe Ruth. But he was in a class by himself. 
He was the greatest home run hitter that ever lived and he was a 
great pitcher. How many guys would pitch and hit home runs?'' 
Richman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``When it came down to the greatest player, I think about (Stan)  
Musial, and (Willie) Mays and (Ted) Williams,'' he said. ``But 
DiMaggio was the one man, if my life depended on it, I'd want at 
the plate to get that base hit in the ninth inning. And he did so 
many times.''

<HEADLINE> US: New IMF Deal Could Save Brazil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said a new  
economic agreement between the International Monetary Fund and 
Brazil could preserve the financial stability of Latin America's 
largest economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin said Brazil also is working with commercial banks to  
re-establish credit lines, and the United States is prepared to 
lend a financial hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``Substantial participation by Brazil's private sector creditors  
is important to Brazil's economic program,'' Rubin said. ``In this 
context, we are prepared to join with the IMF and other countries 
to make available substantial additional financing from the 
international support program announced last year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil is expected to secure a second $9 billion installment on  
a $41.5 billion international rescue package assembled by the IMF 
last November. The collapse in January of the real, Brazil's 
currency, meant the package had to be re-negotiated. Tentative 
agreement on a new accord was reached Friday after almost nonstop 
negotiations with the IMF since mid-January. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin said Brazil's ``success in preserving stability and laying  
the foundation for growth is of critical importance to the United 
States, other regional economies and the international community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The head of the International Monetary Fund, Michel Camdessus,  
urged the IMF's executive board to approve Brazil's new 
inflation-control strategy, which would clear the way for the $9 
billion payment. 
</P>
<P>
	Camdessus did not say how long the approval process would take,  
but most forecasts have indicated Brazil would get the money by 
April. 
</P>
<P>
	World Bank President James Wolfensohn also praised the  
IMF-Brazil accord as ``a strong reaffirmation of Brazil's economic 
recovery program.'' The bank is contributing $4.5 billion to the 
rescue package, and $1 billion already has been paid. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso said the IMF deal  
``is an important step for Brazil to restore economic growth... 
jump start exports and strengthen our currency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the plan agreed with the IMF, Brazil's central bank has  
pledged to begin setting inflation targets and to bring down 
interest rates, currently at 45 percent, as pressure eases on 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The talks with the IMF began after the Brazilians abandoned  
their strategy of tying the value of the real to the dollar. Once 
the real's float began, the currency lost 41 percent of its value 
against the dollar, and import prices soared and raised the risk of 
runaway inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Camdessus said the ``key elements of the new program are a  
strengthened fiscal adjustment, and, in the light of the floating 
exchange rate, the adoption of a new nominal anchor for monetary 
policy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The combination of increasing tax revenues and a firm monetary  
policy are expected ``to contain the impact of the depreciation of 
the real on prices in the first half of 1999 and to facilitate a 
decline in the annualized monthly rate of inflation to single 
digits by the end of the year,'' Camdessus said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brazilians agreed to aim for a 7.5 percent annualized  
inflation rate by the end of this year.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Higher; Dow Up 6 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were firmer at 10 a.m. after a mixed  
opening, in an early indication that Friday's climb to all-time 
highs isn't over yet. 
</P>
<P>
	At 10 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 6.52 at 9,742.60. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the Dow added 268.68 to close at a record 9,736.08,  
helped by strong gains in the bond market that continued this 
morning. The 30-year Treasury bond was up 11/32 point. Its yield, 
which moves opposite the price, stood at 5.57 percent, down from 
5.60 percent late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were higher as well, with the Nasdaq  
composite up a strong 28.53 at 2,365.64, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 
500 index up 2.54 at 1,278.01. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the gains in the indexes, declining issues outnumbered  
advancers by 1,154 to 1,080 on the New York Stock Exchange, where 
volume came to 86.42 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
	The market was also helped by some takeover news. Belgian-Dutch  
financial services group Fortis agreed to pay $2.8 billion for 
American Bankers Insurance Group Inc. Fortis will pay $55 a share, 
or $2.6 billion in cash, for the Miami-based insurer, and assume 
about $200 million in debt. ABI's shares were up 5 7/16 at 51 
13/16. 
</P>
<P>
	In other merger news, Allied Waste Industries Inc. is expected  
to announce today a $7.3 billion cash bid, or $45 a share, for 
larger rival Browning-Ferris Industries Inc. Allied Waste's bid 
would be 30 percent premium over Friday's closing stock price. 
Browning Ferris was up 5 at 39 3/4, while Allied Waste's shares were 
up 2 1/4 at 17 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.77 percent. In  
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was down 0.63 percent, 
Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 0.33 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 
0.10 percent.

<HEADLINE>  Boulding Leads Iditarod </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RAINY PASS, Alaska (AP) -- Veteran musher Charlie Boulding led  
Monday's long climb into the Alaska Range on the second day of the 
Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race. 
</P>
<P>
	Boulding, who finished third in the 1998 Iditarod, arrived at  
the Rainy Pass checkpoint at 1:45 p.m. under sunny skies, light 
winds and temperatures hovering near zero. 
</P>
<P>
	A sizable crowd of eager race fans crowded around to watch the  
bushy-bearded musher lay out straw for his 16 dogs to rest on the 
frozen-over surface of Puntilla Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish someone else would get here,'' said Boulding, who lives  
near the Interior village of Manley. ``I don't like all of the 
attention.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As he boiled beef and sausage for his team, Boulding shook his  
head about the rough trail conditions encountered in the first 175 
miles of the 1,100-mile race from Anchorage to Nome. 
</P>
<P>
	``Terrible,'' he said. ``It's full of big holes, 6-foot-deep  
holes. You dive in and dive back out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Race officials had warned the Iditarod's 56 mushers beforehand  
that the front end of the trail -- up to Rainy Pass -- was in bad 
shape. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitch Seavey of Sterling was second into the checkpoint at 2:26  
p.m., followed three minutes later by 1995 champion Doug Swingley 
of Lincoln, Mont. Norwegian Harald Tunheim arrived at 3:25 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Swingley agreed the trail conditions were difficult, but ``I  
expected it to be worse, so it was kind of a pleasant surprise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As he stripped felt booties off the dogs' feet, he said he'll  
continue on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll stay here six hours and then head out,'' Swingley said.  
</P>
<P>
	After the Rainy Pass checkpoint, the trail climbs to the actual  
pass through North America's highest mountain range, and then it 
drops precipitously through the Dalzell Gorge into Interior Alaska. 
Swingley and other lead mushers will descend through the steep, 
treacherous gorge after nightfall. 
</P>
<P>
	Three-time champion Martin Buser of Big Lake held a narrow lead  
early Monday as front-runners headed into the Alaska Range. 
</P>
<P>
	Buser left the Finger Lake checkpoint at 8:58 a.m., but he  
pulled his team over alongside the trail to rest short of Rainy 
Pass. Several other mushers did the same thing along the 30-mile 
run from Finger Lake to Rainy Pass, which passes through rolling 
hills, dense spruce forests and over frozen rivers. 
</P>
<P>
	Three-time champion Jeff King of Denali Park was nearly a  
half-hour behind Buser out of Finger Lake, followed in short order 
by John Barron of Montana Creek, Linwood Fiedler of Willow, Ramey 
Smyth of Big Lake, Boulding and Sven Engholm of Norway. 
</P>
<P>
	By early afternoon, 44 mushers had passed through the Finger  
Lake checkpoint. The remaining seven competitors had reached the 
checkpoint at Skwentna, 100 miles into the race. 
</P>
<P>
	The mushers are competing for a share of the $450,000 purse. The  
winner will collect $54,000. Prize money is paid to the first 20 
finishers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Iditarod, named after an gold-mining ghost town,  
commemorates the effort of mushers in relaying diphtheria serum to 
Nome during a 1925 epidemic. The race began in 1973, and is run 
along historic trails traveled by gold prospectors.

<HEADLINE> Happy Teammate on 'Sports Night' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Hail this TV season's other Felicity!  
</P>
<P>
	Not the college girl with curls. Felicity all grown up. The  
thinking man's (and woman's) Felicity. The real-life Felicity, 
Felicity Huffman, who stars in ABC's ``Sports Night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This Felicity plays Dana Whitaker, producer of a nightly sports  
show on an ESPN-like cable network. There, in the crackling 
mid-Manhattan biosphere where the sportscast comes together and 
goes on the air, Dana and her colleagues radiate passion for their 
jobs, each other and the roguish turn of phrase. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sports Night,'' seen Tuesday at 9:30 p.m. EST on ABC, has been  
warmly greeted as the season's freshest new comedy. And speaking 
from the inside, Felicity Huffman adds her approval: ``I'm enjoying 
it every second. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm riding on Aaron's coattails. Great writer.'' That's Aaron  
Sorkin, writer of ``A Few Good Men'' and ``The American 
President.'' He created ``Sports Night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``And also we have Tommy Schlamme,'' Huffman adds. ``It's a  
really funny name, but I would take a bullet for this guy.'' 
Schlamme (rhymes with Tommy), with a number of films and ``ER'' to 
his credit, masterminded ``Sports Night's'' formula of kicky 
staging and ethereal camera work. ``What can't this director do?!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Huffman is blond and willowy, smart and a little goofy, and  
packs a Tommy-gun chuckle. She has won praise on the New York 
stage, especially in plays by David Mamet. A decade ago, she 
replaced Madonna on Broadway in Mamet's ``Speed-the-Plow'' and The 
New York Times saluted her ``skillful performance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More from Huffman's resume?  
</P>
<P>
	``Basically, I got fired off of the play 'Jake's Women,''' she  
reports. ``And then I did an ABC pilot with Ed Asner that was gonna 
be a big deal and was called `Thunder Alley,' and I got fired from 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	(Fired from ``Jake's Women,'' that notorious Neil Simon  
flop-aroo? Fired from ``Thunder Alley,'' which expired after a 
spasmodic 10 months on the air? How lucky can you get!) 
</P>
<P>
	But how did Huffman land ``Sports Night''?  
</P>
<P>
	``During last year's pilot season all my friends -- actors,  
writers, directors -- were saying, `You gotta read the Aaron Sorkin 
script.' So I started lobbying to do an audition. But then I went 
in and bricked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bricked? ``Screwed up the audition.  
</P>
<P>
	``I walked out, and I was like, `Uhhhhh, I just buh-lew it.' And  
there was Robert Guillaume. I went up to him and I went, `Ohhhh, 
Robert, I'm not gonna be in on this. I bricked.' And he went, 
'That's OK, baby.''' She is echoing his breezy style. ```I tell ya 
what: If I'm in it, YOU'RE in it.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Like the man said, now he is (the former ``Benson'' star plays  
the sportscast's fatherly executive producer) and so is she. 
</P>
<P>
	In Huffman's hands, Dana is a hard-charging pro who's good and  
knows it, even as she drolly second-guesses herself. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do you think she's scary?'' Huffman asks the reporter,  
inadvertently setting up the sort of rapid-fire volley ``Sports 
Night'' relishes. 
</P>
<P>
	``No, I don't.''  
</P>
<P>
	``Why don't you?''  
</P>
<P>
	``Should I?''  
</P>
<P>
	``No! I don't want you to!''  
</P>
<P>
	Rounding out the splendid ensemble are Joshua Malina (who plays  
research analyst Jeremy), Sabrina Lloyd (as Natalie, an associate 
producer and Jeremy's girlfriend), along with Josh Charles and 
Peter Krause (the mythical sportscast's co-anchors). 
</P>
<P>
	``We were instantly a team,'' Huffman says, ``thanks to Tommy  
and Aaron. From the first read-through, they created an esprit de 
corps.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Huffman loves being part of a family of actors. Although  
``Sports Night'' shoots in Los Angeles, she remains a member of the 
Manhattan-based Atlantic Theater Company repertory, where she met 
her husband, actor William H. Macy (``Fargo,'' ``ER''). 
</P>
<P>
	By then she already had a lot of experience with family. She  
grew up in Woody Creek, Colo., with six sisters and a brother. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was so great! I'm the youngest, so my sisters broke my  
mother in. By the time I came along, it was like, `What time will 
you be home? Oh, never mind.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Each Monday morning her new family comes together for the  
``Sports Night'' table read, ``and we're up on our feet by 3 
o'clock. We finish shooting Friday. It's fast. 
</P>
<P>
	``And then inevitably on Saturday morning you wake up and you  
go, `Oh, THAT'S how I should have played that scene.' It's cab 
acting instead of cab wit.'' Huffman laughs. 
</P>
<P>
	Huh?  
</P>
<P>
	``You don't know the phrase 'cab wit'? You're in the cab going  
home from somewhere and you think, 'THAT'S what I wish I'd said.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Which, of course, is something Dana Whitaker and her team would  
never suffer. Which is part of the magic of ``Sports Night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in television ...  
</P>
<P>
	`DATELINE NBC': Who was he? Why did he do it? What could have  
stopped him? Correspondent Dennis Murphy reports on Andrew Cunanan, 
who killed designer Gianni Versace, and interviews Maureen Orth, 
author of the new book, ``Vulgar Favors: Andrew Cunanan, Gianni 
Versace and the Largest Failed Manhunt in U.S. History.'' Cunanan 
gunned down Versace in Miami Beach in July 1997, during a 
cross-country killing spree that left four others dead. Nine days 
later, with police closing in, Cunanan committed suicide. Murphy's 
report is on tonight's edition of ``Dateline,'' airing at 10 p.m. 
EST. Stone Phillips and Jane Pauley are co-anchors.

<HEADLINE> Can Anyone Beat Duke? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- No. 1 Duke is so confident it's not even  
worried about overconfidence. 
</P>
<P>
	And that means the Blue Devils can enjoy the NCAA tournament,  
Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski said as he prepared his top-seeded team 
to play Florida A&AMP;M in an East Regional first-round game in 
Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've always said we're really good. It's not a matter of  
arrogance, it's a matter of us talking to ourselves,'' Krzyzewski 
said. ``As a result we've learned to enjoy it and anticipate other 
things. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anticipation is a lot better than fear. If you are anxious to  
play and a little bit nervous about that, that's better than being 
nervous about being afraid to lose. That's what we've tried to 
develop. Believe me, we'll be ready to play on Friday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Few will argue that. Playing hard has been a trademark of this  
Duke team, which has amassed a 32-1 record. The Blue Devils have 
won 27 straight, including eight of the last nine by 20 or more 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke is favored to win the NCAA title, and Krzyzewski is a major  
reason. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you are leading a group and you feel the group can do some  
great things then you have to talk to that group about doing those 
great things,'' said Krzyzewski, whose 43-12 NCAA tournament mark 
is the best among active coaches. ``They have to see you be excited 
about it, so we've tried to do that all year long, instead of 
saying, `I'm not sure if we can do this.''' 
</P>
<P>
	While Duke looks unbeatable at this point, Krzyzewski is smart  
enough to know otherwise. He points to his NCAA runner-up team of 
1985-86 that finished 37-3. Its first-round victory was by just 
seven points over lightly regarded Mississippi Valley State. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can be beaten by anybody. I truly believe that because if  
I'm the other guy coaching the other team I believe I'm going to 
beat Duke,'' he said. ``If you respect the other guy and his team, 
I don't see how you overlook anybody. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think sometimes in sports we condone overlooking. I don't  
think it's acceptable. I know when I go in for my hip operation I 
hope that's not a day (the doctor) overlooks me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Krzyzewski will undergo hip replacement surgery after the Final  
Four. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rattlers (12-18) lost their first 10 games this season. In  
contrast, Duke has lost a combined 14 games in the last three 
season playing in the rugged Atlantic Coast Conference. But Duke's 
players seem to be following Krzyzewski's lead of cautious 
optimism. 
</P>
<P>
	Junior forward Chris Carrawell was asked what could trip Duke  
up, if anything. 
</P>
<P>
	``Us not being ready to play,'' he shot back. ``If it was an NBA  
championship series -- four-of-seven games -- nobody in the country 
could beat us. But it's not, it's one game and you are out. We know 
that. If we don't come out and play good for a half that could be 
the half where we lose it. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we come out and play hard against Florida A&AMP;M that will  
prepare us for the next game. We'll probably win, but hey, it's all 
about improving each game. We are going to try to blitz them, 
that's my attitude -- let's go out there and send a message, send a 
statement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Star center Elton Brand shrugged when informed the Blue Devils  
were a whopping 45-point favorite over Florida A&AMP;M. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's just some respect that we earned playing against some  
of the better teams and beating them by 25 or 30,'' Brand said.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Falls, Japanese Stocks Sink / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar dropped against the yen today as U.S.  
banks and Japanese exporters sold the currency to take profits from 
last week's sharp rise, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 121.78 yen in late-afternoon trading, down  
1.16 yen from late Friday in Tokyo and below its New York level of 
122.80 yen late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average sank 114.95 points,  
or 0.77 percent, to close at 14,779.05 points. On Friday, the 
average jumped 710.55 points, or 5.0 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar rose against the yen last week after Japan's central  
bank pushed interest rates lower by flooding the short-term money 
market with funds. 
</P>
<P>
	The advance continued in early Asian trading today with the  
dollar climbing to as high as 123.18 yen, but investors began to 
sell when the rally appeared to have run out of steam, traders 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I returned from lunch and wondered what happened,'' said  
Hajime Sato, assistant general manager of the treasury department 
at Daiwa International Trust Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	``Apparently, after the dollar failed to touch 123.20 yen,  
players started profit taking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. currency was quoted as low as 121.50 yen in Tokyo.  
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 132.09 yen, down  
from 132.98 yen late Friday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo stocks plunged in late trading today, erasing a gain of  
more than 1 percent in the major index, on worries that the rise in 
the yen could erode profits for Japanese companies. 
</P>
<P>
	In the morning, the Nikkei rose to as high as 15,116.10 -- its  
first time above 15,000 since Dec. 10 -- following a 5 percent rally 
on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	But the average fell back on fears a stronger currency could rob  
Japan's giant exporters of earnings by making their products more 
expensive and less competitive overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	The decline accelerated as some companies sold shares which they  
hold in affiliated companies -- so-called ``cross-shareholdings'' -- 
to boost profits before the fiscal year ends this month. 
</P>
<P>
	``There still seems to be a lot of pressure from companies  
wanting to unwind cross-shareholdings above the 15,000 level,'' 
said Kunihiro Hatae, general manager at Tokyo Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section rose 1.03 points, or 0.09 percent, to 1,147.75 
points. The TOPIX closed up 41.61 points, or 3.76 percent, on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading on the main section of the Tokyo exchange was estimated  
at 649.37 million shares, slightly less than the 669.85 million 
shares traded on Friday. Declines outnumbered advances 658 to 538, 
while 120 issues were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese  
government bond rose to 1.630 percent from Friday's finish of 1.560 
percent, driving its price down to 101.36 yen from 101.94 yen.

<HEADLINE> Newspaper Ad Spending Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Spending on newspaper advertisements rose 6.3  
percent to $43.9 billion last year from 1997, in line with previous 
expectations, according the Newspaper Association of America. 
</P>
<P>
	The trade group reported Monday that national advertising  
recorded the fastest growth, rising 7.7 percent to $5.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Retail advertising represented the largest portion of the total  
spending, rising 5.7 percent to $20.3 billion. Classified 
advertising rose 6.6 percent to $17.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The total increase in ad spending was slightly higher than the  
NAA's earlier projections for a 6 percent gain for 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``This growth continues to reflect the ongoing strength in local  
markets across the country,'' said John Sturm, the NAA's chief 
executive and president. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourth-quarter ad spending rose 4.9 percent to $12.7 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	The NAA, based in Vienna, Va., is a nonprofit organization  
representing the newspaper industry and more than 1,700 newspapers 
in the U.S. and Canada. Most NAA members are daily newspapers.

<HEADLINE>  Baseball Great Joe DiMaggio Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOLLYWOOD, Fla. (AP) -- He was simply and forever the Yankee  
Clipper, amazing America with The Streak, captivating it with his 
class and inspiring wistful lines in literature and song. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe DiMaggio died at home Monday, surrounded by family and  
friends, following a five-month battle with lung cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	At age 84, Joltin' Joe has left and gone away.  
</P>
<P>
	But his legend lingers, shoulder-to-shoulder with the likes of  
Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig, his fellow Yankees. Very few others could 
measure up to them on the sports scene this century. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio underwent surgery in October, battling complications  
for weeks afterward and even falling into a coma briefly during his 
99-day hospitalization. But he also astounded his doctors by 
repeatedly bouncing back. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio left the hospital Jan. 19 to recuperate at home, where  
his bed was decorated with a sign that said, ``April 9. Yankee 
Stadium or Bust.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He died shortly after midnight, said Morris Engelberg, his  
longtime friend and attorney, one month and one day shy of making 
it back to the Bronx for the home opener. For years DiMaggio had 
smoked three packs a day, and at times he even sneaked behind the 
runway at Yankee Stadium during games to have a cigarette with 
Gehrig. 
</P>
<P>
	At DiMaggio's bedside when he died were brother Dominick, a  
former major league outfielder; two grandchildren; Engelberg; and 
Joe Nacchio, his friend of 59 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Tributes poured in from baseball's past and present.  
</P>
<P>
	Said Ted Williams, who shared the spotlight with DiMaggio in the  
'41 season by batting .406 for Boston, the last time anyone batted 
.400: ``There is no one Ted Williams admired, respected and envied 
more than Joe DiMaggio. Because of my close relationship with the 
DiMaggio family, I feel a very deep personal loss.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said former Dodgers manager Tom Lasorda: ``If you said to God,  
`Create someone who was what a baseball player should be,' God 
would have created Joe DiMaggio. And he did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner Bud Selig said he idolized DiMaggio: ``I never saw  
a player who was as graceful. There was an aura about him that was 
amazing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Hall of Fame flag in Cooperstown, N.Y., was lowered to  
half-staff and a wreath was placed around DiMaggio's plaque. U.S. 
flags at Yankee Stadium, including the one in left field's hallowed 
Monument Park, were also at half-staff. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio roamed center field and ran the basepaths for 13 years  
through 1951, playing for 10 pennant winners and nine World Series 
champions despite missing three years because of service in World 
War II. 
</P>
<P>
	He batted .325 lifetime, with 361 home runs. He won three AL  
Most Valuable Player awards, appeared in 11 All-Star games, and 
entered the Hall of Fame in 1955, his third year of eligibility. 
For half a century, he was introduced as ``the greatest living 
player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, the numbers don't account fully for his almost legendary  
place on the American cultural landscape, the reason Ernest 
Hemingway wrote about him and Simon and Garfunkel sang about him. 
There was something about the courtly bearing of this son of 
Italian immigrants that made him special. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like to take the great DiMaggio fishing,'' the ancient  
Cuban fisherman says in Hemingway's ``The Old Man and the Sea.'' 
``They say his father was a fisherman. Maybe he was as poor as we 
are and would understand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps it was the swanky swing and classy countenance that  
inspired Simon and Garfunkel's lament to lost heroes in the song 
``Mrs. Robinson'' from the movie ``The Graduate'': 
</P>
<P>
	``Where have you gone Joe DiMaggio?  
</P>
<P>
	``A nation turns its lonely eyes to you.  
</P>
<P>
	``What's that you say, Mrs. Robinson?  
</P>
<P>
	``Joltin' Joe has left and gone away.''  
</P>
<P>
	The summer of '41 was magical largely because of DiMaggio's  
56-game hitting streak, one of baseball's most enduring records. 
The streak riveted a country fresh from the Depression, with war 
just months away, and elevated DiMaggio from baseball star to 
national celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
	He ascended to the top rank of popular culture in 1954 when he  
wed Marilyn Monroe, a storybook marriage that lasted less than a 
year and left him brokenhearted. For years after she died in 1962, 
DiMaggio sent roses to her grave but refused to talk about her. 
</P>
<P>
	A handsome man of quiet strength -- unpretentious, proud and  
intensely private -- DiMaggio embodied the kind of hero parents 
wanted their sons to emulate. 
</P>
<P>
	Though unusually shy, DiMaggio also could come across as your  
friendly neighbor, as he did in his later years, touting the 
virtues of a savings bank and Mr. Coffee on television to a 
generation that never saw him play. In more recent years, he 
devoted himself to his grandchildren and four great-grandchildren 
and to raising money for the Joe DiMaggio Children's Hospital in 
Hollywood, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio's only child was a son, Joe Jr., from his first  
marriage to Dorothy Arnold, an actress he met while working on a 
movie, ``Manhattan Merry-Go-Round,'' in 1937. Their marriage ended 
in divorce. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't seek the limelight but lived his life slipping into  
and out of it, uncomfortable when it shone on him. The story goes 
that when Monroe squealed delightedly that she had been cheered by 
tens of thousands of troops in Korea and told DiMaggio he couldn't 
imagine what that was like, he deadpanned, ``Oh, yes, I can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And no ballplayer ever heard more cheers than DiMaggio did  
during the streak. There was a song written about it, and crowds 
waited for him to come to town. In city after city, he kept the 
streak alive, getting at least one hit in every game from May 15 
until July 17. No one has come close since. 
</P>
<P>
	During an appearance in 1991, commemorating the 50th anniversary  
of the streak, DiMaggio expressed surprise it was still a record. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of great ballplayers,'' he said. ``One day,  
someone's going to come along and break it. But I've been saying 
that for 50 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pete Rose fell 12 games short in 1978, the best challenge.  
</P>
<P>
	During the streak, DiMaggio batted .408 with 91 hits in 223  
at-bats, 15 homers and 55 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	It took a pair of remarkable fielding plays by third baseman Ken  
Keltner in the 57th game to stop DiMaggio. He then immediately 
began another streak of 16 games -- meaning he batted safely in 72 
of 73 games. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no demonstration of disappointment that day in  
Cleveland's League Park when Keltner robbed him of two hits. That 
typified the stoic DiMaggio. 
</P>
<P>
	A rare departure from the DiMaggio cool was captured on what is  
probably the most famous film clip of his career. It was one of the 
greatest plays in World Series history -- a game-saving catch by 
Brooklyn's Al Gionfriddo in 1947 -- and a broadcast classic by Red 
Barber. 
</P>
<P>
	``Back, back, back, back, back, and he makes a one-handed catch  
against the bullpen. Ohhh, doctor!'' Barber said. 
</P>
<P>
	The camera caught DiMaggio kicking the dirt in an ever-so-gentle  
display of frustration as he neared second base. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio was born on Nov. 25, 1914, in Martinez, Calif. His  
father operated a fishing boat in San Francisco, and expected his 
sons to follow in his footsteps. But Joe and his brothers, Vince 
and Dom, spent most of their time playing baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	The elder DiMaggio called it ``a bum's game,'' but he lived to  
see all three of his boys become professional players. Dom, the 
youngest, played with the Red Sox. Vince, the eldest, was with five 
National League teams. 
</P>
<P>
	New York actually took a chance by signing Joe. He had been a  
star with the San Francisco Seals of the Pacific Coast League and 
once had a 61-game hitting streak. But a knee injury scared off all 
but the Yankees. They bought him for $25,000 -- one of the greatest 
bargains in baseball history. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio arrived in New York in May 1936 at age 21. He  
introduced himself to Yankees fans with two singles and a triple in 
his first game, and never slowed until retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio earned $7,500 in his first year, but got $100,000 in  
each of his final three seasons, making him the highest-paid player 
of his time. He made more than that in recent years just for 
signing his name at baseball memorabilia shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Before DiMaggio, baseball's biggest stars were men like Ty Cobb  
and Babe Ruth. Although his accomplishments rivaled theirs in many 
ways, DiMaggio's style was in sharp contrast. 
</P>
<P>
	Cobb and Ruth were colorful, larger-than-life characters, one a  
belligerent, short-tempered man who played the game with a 
vengeance, the other a gregarious, party-going slugger who set the 
standard for all home-run hitters. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio was quiet and reserved with a gift for making  
everything look easy, whether it was an over-the-shoulder catch of 
a 400-foot drive or a home run to the deepest part of 
then-cavernous Yankee Stadium. He also had a strong, accurate arm 
rarely challenged by base runners. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was out there to play and give it all I had,'' he said in  
1991. ``I looked at it like, `I'm doing my best.' If I got the hit, 
fine. I always felt good that I had given my best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only twice did DiMaggio bat less than .300. He accumulated 3,948  
total bases and drove in 1,537 runs. He finished his career with 
2,214 hits. 
</P>
<P>
	He was the MVP in 1939, 1941 and 1947. He was the AL batting  
champion in 1939 with a .381 average and in 1940 at .352. He led 
the league in RBIs in 1941 with 125 and in 1948 with 155. He had 
the most homers in the league in 1937 with 46 and in 1948 with 39. 
</P>
<P>
	There were other records, and undoubtedly there would have been  
even more had he not volunteered for the Army during World War II. 
Though bothered by stomach ulcers for part of the time, he spent 2 1/2 
years in the Army's physical training program for air cadets. 
</P>
<P>
	Honoring DiMaggio and Williams in a 1991 White House salute,  
President Bush said their military service ``deprived them of even 
greater statistics, but also enhanced their greatness in the eyes 
of Americans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio battled a string of injuries during his career and  
seven times missed opening day. He underwent three operations 
within two years for bone spurs in his heels and bone chips in his 
arm. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1949, an inflamed heel sidelined him for 65 games. When he  
returned to the lineup, his home run helped the Yankees beat Boston 
5-4, and he went on to bat .500 in their three-game series. It was 
as if he'd never been gone. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio decided to call it quits at age 37. It was not a sudden  
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``The old timing was beginning to leave me, and my reflexes were  
beginning to slow up,'' he explained. 
</P>
<P>
	By the end of his last season, he said, ``It had become a chore  
for me to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I found it difficult getting out of bed in the morning,  
especially after a night game,'' he said. ``I was full of aches and 
pains.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees won the World Series in his final year, and he  
finished with a flourish. He hit a home run in the fourth game and 
had six hits in 11 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
	Long after retiring as a player, DiMaggio served briefly as a  
vice president and coach for the Oakland A's, and as a member of 
the board of directors of the Baltimore Orioles. When he was not 
traveling, DiMaggio lived alone in his home on exclusive Harbour 
Island, Fla.

<HEADLINE> Report: Reagan Building Vulnerable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government's massive new Ronald Reagan  
Building, with its large underground parking area and welcoming 
entrances, is vulnerable to terrorist attack, according to a report 
published today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington Post, citing a confidential consultant's study it  
obtained, said the General Services Administration, which serves as 
the federal government's landlord, has been repeatedly warned of 
the risk and the urgent need for tightened security since the 1995 
Oklahoma City bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the report said, the GSA believes that a strong  
security presence at the office building would discourage shoppers 
and tourists from visiting the building's retail shops, restaurants 
and other public spaces. 
</P>
<P>
	``Currently it appears that the need for revenue generation  
through tenant occupancy, convention space utilization and parking 
revenues outweighs the need for implementation of basic security 
measures,'' says the report, prepared by security experts at Sandia 
National Laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
	The Post said that strict security is at odds with the GSA's  
plan to turn the mixed-use Reagan building into a revenue-producing 
project. 
</P>
<P>
	GSA officials told the Post they have improved security since  
receiving the consultant's report.

<HEADLINE> Gardens Offer a Respite at Jail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Ugliness is everywhere on Rikers Island.  
</P>
<P>
	Loops of razor wire sit atop miles of fences, inmates in drab  
green jumpsuits walk through long, windowless corridors, and jets 
from nearby LaGuardia Airport roar overhead. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of wrecked, angry lives are locked behind the bars and  
metal detectors at Rikers, one of the nation's largest jail 
complexes. But beauty has found an unlikely home in this lonely 
landscape. 
</P>
<P>
	On a 1 1/2-acre patch of land behind the Rose M. Singer jail for  
women, yellow buds bloom in a small winter garden, thanks to an 
early thaw. And come summer, the air around one carefully tended 
flower bed will be thick with butterflies. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the Greenhouse Project, an island of calm in a sea of  
fear and frustration. Run and funded by the Horticultural Society 
of New York, the project gives inmates a refuge from pressures of 
prison life and a chance to replace some of the gray with a bit of 
green. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a connection with nature in a place where nature isn't  
supposed to exist,'' said James Jiler, who runs the project. 
``(Participants) get out of their cells ... they don't really feel 
like they're penned in with thousands of other bodies. There's a 
sense of freedom, even within the enclosure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The project began in 1986 as a gardening program for teen-age  
inmates at the prison, which sits in the East River and is 
reachable only via a 4,200-foot bridge from Queens. It was dropped 
in a city budget cut in 1993 but was revived by the Horticultural 
Society with private funds four years later, Jiler said. Since 
then, about 265 prisoners have participated. 
</P>
<P>
	As rain pounded down one recent afternoon, several inmates at  
the modest greenhouse tended to grape vines and prepared peat moss 
for seedlings. Others flipped carefully through gardening books to 
identify unfamiliar plants. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside, lavender, mint and lemon balm grow in a mini-herb  
garden. Brick walkways wind through shrubbery, and hand-laid stone 
borders protect roses and hydrangeas. 
</P>
<P>
	Inmates have planted one garden solely to attract birds and  
butterflies and are planning a Japanese-style meditation pond. 
</P>
<P>
	Only prisoners selected for good behavior and jailed for  
nonviolent crimes can join the Greenhouse Project, and roughly two 
dozen men and women are enrolled at any given time. They come and 
go often, since most Rikers inmates are serving sentences of less 
than a year or are awaiting trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Jiler tries to teach inmates discipline and organizational  
skills that will be useful in jobs on the outside, even if they 
don't blossom into horticulturists. 
</P>
<P>
	``It changed my life,'' said Elizabeth Lynch, 49, who was  
released from Rikers last summer after serving an eight-month 
sentence for selling drugs. ``It finally gave me something to focus 
on, that I wanted to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lynch, who spoke by phone from her Bronx home, worked  
sporadically as a secretary during a 30-year struggle with heroin 
addiction but now hopes to enroll in a professional horticulture 
training program at the New York Botanical Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	Several other Greenhouse participants have gone on to work with  
plants, Jiler said. Just as important, he said, is the ease inmates 
feel inside the greenhouse and the sense of purpose their work 
there gives them. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes you feel like you're more free,'' said inmate Edwin  
Ortiz, a 21-year-old from the Bronx. ``You can't be upset when you 
come in here. It's practically impossible. ... You can't help but 
to smile.''

<HEADLINE> FDIC Chief Yields on New Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The head of the FDIC said Monday her agency is  
ready to withdraw proposed anti-money laundering rules to track 
bank customers' transactions, which had provoked a public outcry 
over privacy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The public has spoken very loudly and clearly,'' Donna Tanoue,  
chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., said in a 
telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she will urge her colleagues on the agency's  
four-member board to agree to drop the proposed regulations, called 
``Know Your Customer'' rules. The board's next meeting is on March 
23. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Tanoue spoke as the 90-day public comment period for the  
proposal closed. On Friday, the Senate joined the torrent of 
criticism and sent a message to federal bank regulators to withdraw 
the rules. 
</P>
<P>
	By an 88-0 vote, the Senate expressed support for a measure  
directing the regulators to drop the proposed rules. Senate 
Democrats blocked a vote on actual adoption of the measure, 
sponsored by Sens. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, and Wayne Allard, R-Colo., 
so it lacks the force of law. 
</P>
<P>
	In the House, the Banking Committee on Thursday adopted an  
amendment to a big financial services bill that would kill the 
proposed banking rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Tanoue previously had said she was reconsidering the  
proposed rules, which were denounced in a flood of angry e-mail 
starting in December. The FDIC had received more than 170,000 
e-mail messages and letters as of Friday; by Monday, the final day 
of the comment period, that had jumped to some 225,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed regulations would require banks to verify their  
customers' identities, know where their money comes from and 
determine their normal pattern of transactions. The current 
requirements for banks to report any ``suspicious'' transactions to 
law enforcement authorities would be expanded. 
</P>
<P>
	Privacy advocates, conservative groups, ordinary people and the  
nation's bankers have complained that the rules would transform 
every bank teller into a spy for Big Brother. They maintain the 
rules are unconstitutional and would violate the Fourth Amendment 
prohibition against unreasonable search and seizure. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Ms. Tanoue, the FDIC board includes U.S.  
Comptroller of the Currency John D. Hawke Jr., who oversees 
nationally chartered banks. He also believes the bank rules should 
be scrapped, as he told a House subcommittee hearing last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Another board member is Ellen Seidman, director of the Office of  
Thrift Supervision, who has not yet taken a public position on the 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
	The thrift agency, part of the Treasury Department, wanted to  
wait until after the comment period was over before it decided on a 
position, spokesman William Fulwider said Monday. ``We will look at 
it with a sense of balance and sensitivity,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The fourth director is FDIC Vice Chairman Andrew Hove, who  
likely will agree with Ms. Tanoue. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Reserve, which also is involved in proposing the  
bank rules, has not taken a public position on them. 
</P>
<P>
	The rules are designed to combat money laundering techniques  
used by drug traffickers and other criminals to hide illegal 
profits. Money laundering is a major concern of law enforcement 
officials; it reached an estimated $30 billion in this country last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Laundering includes the use of wire transfers and bank drafts as  
well as ``smurfing,'' the practice of breaking down transactions 
into smaller amounts that do not have to be reported under the Bank 
Secrecy Act.

<HEADLINE>  Four Killed in Indonesian Fighting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- At least four people were killed and  
11 severely wounded in new clashes on the riot-torn eastern 
Indonesian island of Ambon today, officials and witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
	A mob of Christians attacked and burned a truck with 28 people  
aboard, killing two and wounding four others, in the town of Paso 
on the eastern side of the island, said Hasanussi, an official at a 
local mosque. 
</P>
<P>
	And in Air Salobar, a western neighborhood of Ambon city,  
Christian and Muslim gangs clashed. At least two people were killed 
and seven others were wounded, said witnesses, without specifying 
the religion of the victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight houses, a car and a motorcycle were burned, and two  
homemade bombs went off, said witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Police in Ambon, the capital of Maluku province, confirmed the  
violence but declined to give further details. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 180 people have been killed in fighting among rival  
Muslim and Christian mobs since religious violence erupted in 
January in Maluku province, known in Dutch colonial times as the 
Spice Islands. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia has grappled with various riots and political protests  
over the past months, fueled by economic crisis, dramatic political 
changes and ethnic and sectarian splits. 
</P>
<P>
	In the capital, Jakarta, police arrested some 200 protesters --  
mostly women and high-school students -- who were staging peaceful 
demonstrations to mark International Women's Day. Police said they 
were arrested because they had not notified authorities of the 
planned marches. 
</P>

the island.

of soldiers in Maluku province, 1,400 miles northeast of Jakarta. 
He declined to give further details.

<P>

the streets of Jakarta protesting alleged military involvement in 
the fighting.

greater democracy for Indonesia, which is preparing to hold its 
most open parliamentary election since 1955 on June 7.

<P>
	Rival religious gangs in Maluku have attacked each other with  
bows and arrows, swords and gasoline bombs. Troops have fired on 
crowds. 
</P>
<P>
	Tens of thousands of people have fled Maluku fearing the  
fighting will worsen. 
</P>
<P>
	About 90 percent of Indonesia's 210 million people are Muslim,  
making it the world's most populous Islamic state. Much of Ambon's 
population, however, is Christian.

<HEADLINE>  Baseball Great Joe DiMaggio Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOLLYWOOD, Fla. (AP) -- He was simply and forever the Yankee  
Clipper, amazing America with The Streak, captivating it with his 
class and inspiring wistful lines in literature and song. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe DiMaggio died at home Monday, surrounded by family and  
friends, following a five-month battle with lung cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	At age 84, Joltin' Joe has left and gone away.  
</P>
<P>
	But his legend lingers, shoulder-to-shoulder with the likes of  
Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig, his fellow Yankees. Very few others could 
measure up to them on the sports scene this century. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio underwent surgery in October, battling complications  
for weeks afterward and even falling into a coma briefly during his 
99-day hospitalization. But he also astounded his doctors by 
repeatedly bouncing back. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio left the hospital Jan. 19 to recuperate at home, where  
his bed was decorated with a sign that said, ``April 9. Yankee 
Stadium or Bust.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He died shortly after midnight, said Morris Engelberg, his  
longtime friend and attorney, one month and one day shy of making 
it back to the Bronx for the home opener. For years DiMaggio had 
smoked three packs a day, and at times he even sneaked behind the 
runway at Yankee Stadium during games to have a cigarette with 
Gehrig. 
</P>
<P>
	At DiMaggio's bedside when he died were brother Dominick, a  
former major league outfielder; two grandchildren; Engelberg; and 
Joe Nacchio, his friend of 59 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Tributes poured in from baseball's past and present.  
</P>
<P>
	Said Ted Williams, who shared the spotlight with DiMaggio in the  
'41 season by batting .406 for Boston, the last time anyone batted 
.400: ``There is no one Ted Williams admired, respected and envied 
more than Joe DiMaggio. Because of my close relationship with the 
DiMaggio family, I feel a very deep personal loss.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said former Dodgers manager Tom Lasorda: ``If you said to God,  
`Create someone who was what a baseball player should be,' God 
would have created Joe DiMaggio. And he did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner Bud Selig said he idolized DiMaggio: ``I never saw  
a player who was as graceful. There was an aura about him that was 
amazing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Hall of Fame flag in Cooperstown, N.Y., was lowered to  
half-staff and a wreath was placed around DiMaggio's plaque. U.S. 
flags at Yankee Stadium, including the one in left field's hallowed 
Monument Park, were also at half-staff. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio roamed center field and ran the basepaths for 13 years  
through 1951, playing for 10 pennant winners and nine World Series 
champions despite missing three years because of service in World 
War II. 
</P>
<P>
	He batted .325 lifetime, with 361 home runs. He won three AL  
Most Valuable Player awards, appeared in 11 All-Star games, and 
entered the Hall of Fame in 1955, his third year of eligibility. 
For half a century, he was introduced as ``the greatest living 
player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, the numbers don't account fully for his almost legendary  
place on the American cultural landscape, the reason Ernest 
Hemingway wrote about him and Simon and Garfunkel sang about him. 
There was something about the courtly bearing of this son of 
Italian immigrants that made him special. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like to take the great DiMaggio fishing,'' the ancient  
Cuban fisherman says in Hemingway's ``The Old Man and the Sea.'' 
``They say his father was a fisherman. Maybe he was as poor as we 
are and would understand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps it was the swanky swing and classy countenance that  
inspired Simon and Garfunkel's lament to lost heroes in the song 
``Mrs. Robinson'' from the movie ``The Graduate'': 
</P>
<P>
	``Where have you gone Joe DiMaggio?  
</P>
<P>
	``A nation turns its lonely eyes to you.  
</P>
<P>
	``What's that you say, Mrs. Robinson?  
</P>
<P>
	``Joltin' Joe has left and gone away.''  
</P>
<P>
	The summer of '41 was magical largely because of DiMaggio's  
56-game hitting streak, one of baseball's most enduring records. 
The streak riveted a country fresh from the Depression, with war 
just months away, and elevated DiMaggio from baseball star to 
national celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
	He ascended to the top rank of popular culture in 1954 when he  
wed Marilyn Monroe, a storybook marriage that lasted less than a 
year and left him brokenhearted. For years after she died in 1962, 
DiMaggio sent roses to her grave but refused to talk about her. 
</P>
<P>
	A handsome man of quiet strength -- unpretentious, proud and  
intensely private -- DiMaggio embodied the kind of hero parents 
wanted their sons to emulate. 
</P>
<P>
	Though unusually shy, DiMaggio also could come across as your  
friendly neighbor, as he did in his later years, touting the 
virtues of a savings bank and Mr. Coffee on television to a 
generation that never saw him play. In more recent years, he 
devoted himself to his grandchildren and four great-grandchildren 
and to raising money for the Joe DiMaggio Children's Hospital in 
Hollywood, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio's only child was a son, Joe Jr., from his first  
marriage to Dorothy Arnold, an actress he met while working on a 
movie, ``Manhattan Merry-Go-Round,'' in 1937. Their marriage ended 
in divorce. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't seek the limelight but lived his life slipping into  
and out of it, uncomfortable when it shone on him. The story goes 
that when Monroe squealed delightedly that she had been cheered by 
tens of thousands of troops in Korea and told DiMaggio he couldn't 
imagine what that was like, he deadpanned, ``Oh, yes, I can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And no ballplayer ever heard more cheers than DiMaggio did  
during the streak. There was a song written about it, and crowds 
waited for him to come to town. In city after city, he kept the 
streak alive, getting at least one hit in every game from May 15 
until July 17. No one has come close since. 
</P>
<P>
	During an appearance in 1991, commemorating the 50th anniversary  
of the streak, DiMaggio expressed surprise it was still a record. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of great ballplayers,'' he said. ``One day,  
someone's going to come along and break it. But I've been saying 
that for 50 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pete Rose fell 12 games short in 1978, the best challenge.  
</P>
<P>
	During the streak, DiMaggio batted .408 with 91 hits in 223  
at-bats, 15 homers and 55 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	It took a pair of remarkable fielding plays by third baseman Ken  
Keltner in the 57th game to stop DiMaggio. He then immediately 
began another streak of 16 games -- meaning he batted safely in 72 
of 73 games. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no demonstration of disappointment that day in  
Cleveland's League Park when Keltner robbed him of two hits. That 
typified the stoic DiMaggio. 
</P>
<P>
	A rare departure from the DiMaggio cool was captured on what is  
probably the most famous film clip of his career. It was one of the 
greatest plays in World Series history -- a game-saving catch by 
Brooklyn's Al Gionfriddo in 1947 -- and a broadcast classic by Red 
Barber. 
</P>
<P>
	``Back, back, back, back, back, and he makes a one-handed catch  
against the bullpen. Ohhh, doctor!'' Barber said. 
</P>
<P>
	The camera caught DiMaggio kicking the dirt in an ever-so-gentle  
display of frustration as he neared second base. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio was born on Nov. 25, 1914, in Martinez, Calif. His  
father operated a fishing boat in San Francisco, and expected his 
sons to follow in his footsteps. But Joe and his brothers, Vince 
and Dom, spent most of their time playing baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	The elder DiMaggio called it ``a bum's game,'' but he lived to  
see all three of his boys become professional players. Dom, the 
youngest, played with the Red Sox. Vince, the eldest, was with five 
National League teams. 
</P>
<P>
	New York actually took a chance by signing Joe. He had been a  
star with the San Francisco Seals of the Pacific Coast League and 
once had a 61-game hitting streak. But a knee injury scared off all 
but the Yankees. They bought him for $25,000 -- one of the greatest 
bargains in baseball history. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio arrived in New York in May 1936 at age 21. He  
introduced himself to Yankees fans with two singles and a triple in 
his first game, and never slowed until retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio earned $7,500 in his first year, but got $100,000 in  
each of his final three seasons, making him the highest-paid player 
of his time. He made more than that in recent years just for 
signing his name at baseball memorabilia shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Before DiMaggio, baseball's biggest stars were men like Ty Cobb  
and Babe Ruth. Although his accomplishments rivaled theirs in many 
ways, DiMaggio's style was in sharp contrast. 
</P>
<P>
	Cobb and Ruth were colorful, larger-than-life characters, one a  
belligerent, short-tempered man who played the game with a 
vengeance, the other a gregarious, party-going slugger who set the 
standard for all home-run hitters. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio was quiet and reserved with a gift for making  
everything look easy, whether it was an over-the-shoulder catch of 
a 400-foot drive or a home run to the deepest part of 
then-cavernous Yankee Stadium. He also had a strong, accurate arm 
rarely challenged by base runners. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was out there to play and give it all I had,'' he said in  
1991. ``I looked at it like, `I'm doing my best.' If I got the hit, 
fine. I always felt good that I had given my best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only twice did DiMaggio bat less than .300. He accumulated 3,948  
total bases and drove in 1,537 runs. He finished his career with 
2,214 hits. 
</P>
<P>
	He was the MVP in 1939, 1941 and 1947. He was the AL batting  
champion in 1939 with a .381 average and in 1940 at .352. He led 
the league in RBIs in 1941 with 125 and in 1948 with 155. He had 
the most homers in the league in 1937 with 46 and in 1948 with 39. 
</P>
<P>
	There were other records, and undoubtedly there would have been  
even more had he not volunteered for the Army during World War II. 
Though bothered by stomach ulcers for part of the time, he spent 2 1/2 
years in the Army's physical training program for air cadets. 
</P>
<P>
	Honoring DiMaggio and Williams in a 1991 White House salute,  
President Bush said their military service ``deprived them of even 
greater statistics, but also enhanced their greatness in the eyes 
of Americans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio battled a string of injuries during his career and  
seven times missed opening day. He underwent three operations 
within two years for bone spurs in his heels and bone chips in his 
arm. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1949, an inflamed heel sidelined him for 65 games. When he  
returned to the lineup, his home run helped the Yankees beat Boston 
5-4, and he went on to bat .500 in their three-game series. It was 
as if he'd never been gone. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio decided to call it quits at age 37. It was not a sudden  
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``The old timing was beginning to leave me, and my reflexes were  
beginning to slow up,'' he explained. 
</P>
<P>
	By the end of his last season, he said, ``It had become a chore  
for me to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I found it difficult getting out of bed in the morning,  
especially after a night game,'' he said. ``I was full of aches and 
pains.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees won the World Series in his final year, and he  
finished with a flourish. He hit a home run in the fourth game and 
had six hits in 11 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
	Long after retiring as a player, DiMaggio served briefly as a  
vice president and coach for the Oakland A's, and as a member of 
the board of directors of the Baltimore Orioles. When he was not 
traveling, DiMaggio lived alone in his home on exclusive Harbour 
Island, Fla.

<HEADLINE>  Four Killed in Indonesian Fighting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- At least four people were killed and  
11 severely wounded in new clashes on the riot-torn eastern 
Indonesian island of Ambon today, officials and witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
	A mob of Christians attacked and burned a truck with 28 people  
aboard, killing two and wounding four others, in the town of Paso 
on the eastern side of the island, said Hasanussi, an official at a 
local mosque. 
</P>
<P>
	And in Air Salobar, a western neighborhood of Ambon city,  
Christian and Muslim gangs clashed. At least two people were killed 
and seven others were wounded, said witnesses, without specifying 
the religion of the victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight houses, a car and a motorcycle were burned, and two  
homemade bombs went off, said witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Police in Ambon, the capital of Maluku province, confirmed the  
violence but declined to give further details. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 180 people have been killed in fighting among rival  
Muslim and Christian mobs since religious violence erupted in 
January in Maluku province, known in Dutch colonial times as the 
Spice Islands. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia has grappled with various riots and political protests  
over the past months, fueled by economic crisis, dramatic political 
changes and ethnic and sectarian splits. 
</P>
<P>
	In the capital, Jakarta, police arrested some 200 protesters --  
mostly women and high-school students -- who were staging peaceful 
demonstrations to mark International Women's Day. Police said they 
were arrested because they had not notified authorities of the 
planned marches. 
</P>
<P>
	And some 50 Muslims protested outside the Defense Ministry in  
Jakarta condemning the army's response to the rioting in Ambon.

<HEADLINE> IOC Weighs Secret Vote on Samaranch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- While the outcome is not in doubt, big questions  
remain over how the IOC will conduct a crucial confidence vote next 
week on president Juan Antonio Samaranch. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials of the International Olympic Committee are undecided  
whether to have a secret ballot or public acclamation on whether 
Samaranch should remain in office. 
</P>
<P>
	An endorsement of the 78-year-old Spaniard is assured. But with  
the world closely watching every move the IOC makes in the wake of 
its biggest corruption scandal, officials expect the committee will 
be criticized no matter what procedure is used. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC's executive board is expected to decide by midweek on  
what action to take against 19 members who remain under 
investigation in the Salt Lake bribery case, the head of the 
inquiry said. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC vice president Dick Pound said in New York that his  
investigation panel would hold a conference call Tuesday in hopes 
of bringing ``substantial closure'' to the review, then send its 
recommendations to the executive board in a second conference call 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Pounds said his commission had reached a decision on all cases  
but one. He refused to identify the member involved or say what 
actions the panel would recommend on any of the alleged offenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch, who has faced calls for his resignation from critics  
outside the IOC, announced in January that he would put his 
leadership to a vote of confidence at a special general assembly in 
Switzerland on March 17-18. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on numerous interviews over the past month, it's clear  
that Samaranch has overwhelming support among IOC members to 
continue in office. 
</P>
<P>
	The confidence motion, however, is not listed on the 10-point  
agenda for next week's meeting, where the assembly will vote on 
reform proposals and expulsion of members involved in the Salt Lake 
City bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC members told The Associated Press that the confidence  
question is still being debated among the general membership and 
the leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch has been canvassing the opinions of IOC members and is  
expected to settle on a formula later this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Executive board member Jacques Rogge said members are divided  
into those who favor a secret ballot and those who prefer a round 
of applause or show of hands. 
</P>
<P>
	``What counts is not the system,'' he said. ``What counts is  
whether (Samaranch) can have broad support, and I believe he 
will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rogge said neither of the proposed vote solutions would appease  
the IOC's critics. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the formula discussed by those seeking a public  
endorsement, Samaranch would give an opening statement to the 
assembly. The IOC's longest-serving member, Joao Havelange of 
Brazil, would then take the floor and ask the members to acclaim 
Samaranch by applause. 
</P>
<P>
	A secret ballot might be more democratic because it allows  
members to vote free of outside pressure. But it could also be seen 
as lacking accountability, especially at a time when the IOC is 
being urged to become more open. 
</P>
<P>
	A vote by acclamation could also be viewed as undemocratic, with  
members under pressure to side publicly with the majority in favor 
of Samaranch. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever we do, we will be criticized,'' Rogge said. ``If we  
have a secret ballot, people will say it should be public. If we 
have it public, people will say we should have had a secret 
ballot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rogge noted that when a government or prime minister asks for a  
confidence vote, a public ballot is held. 
</P>
<P>
	``To those who say it should be a secret ballot, I say that the  
impeachment vote of President Clinton, basically a vote of 
confidence, was a public vote,'' Rogge said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogge said he prefers a secret ballot. But he said the ultimate  
decision should not be made to appease others. 
</P>
<P>
	``The vote of confidence is not a sign to the outside world,''  
he said. ``It's for Samaranch to know if he has the support of his 
own members. I believe there will be overwhelming support.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the IOC does hold a secret ballot, a dozen or so members  
might vote against Samaranch, according to one delegate who spoke 
on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch, elected as IOC president in 1980, has not faced a  
contest since, re-elected three times by acclamation. In 1995, the 
IOC voted to raise its retirement age to 80 to allow Samaranch 
another term through 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the Salt Lake scandal broke late last year, the IOC  
counted 114 members. But fewer than 100 members will be eligible to 
vote at next week's session. 
</P>
<P>
	Four members have resigned and five others face expulsion and  
are ineligible to vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine new members, appointed at last year's Nagano Games, have  
not been invited to next week's extraordinary session. They are due 
to be sworn in officially at the next regular session, scheduled 
for June. 
</P>
<P>
	The 19 other members under investigation face expulsion, warning  
or exoneration.

	Joe DiMaggio Is Dead  
</P>
<P>
	HOLLYWOOD, Fla. (AP) -- Joe DiMaggio was remembered today by  
President Clinton as ``the very symbol of American grace, power and 
skill.'' The New York Yankees Hall of Famer died today at his home. 
He was 84. DiMaggio had lung cancer surgery last October. 
Thereafter, he suffered several lung infections and fell into a 
coma for a while. Flags at Yankee Stadium and the Hall of Fame in 
Cooperstown, N.Y., were lowered to half staff. His 56-game hitting 
streak in 1941 remains as one of greatest records in sports. A 
funeral will be held Thursday in his native northern California. 

</P>
<P>
	Clinton Visits Central America  
</P>
<P>
	MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) -- President Clinton has begun a tour of  
the Central American sites devastated by Hurricane Mitch, offering 
U.S. help with reconstruction. Clinton four-day, four nation 
mission started in Nicaragua and he will go to El Salvador next. He 
has turned down pleas for an extension of the halt in deportations 
of illegal immigrants that was instituted after last fall's storm. 
The stay in deportations expires today. Salvadoran President 
Armando Calderon Sol has said that to have the immigrants return 
now ``would cause us tragic problems of stability.'' 

</P>
<P>
	New Fighting in Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Mortar and small-arms fire broke out  
in Kosovo along the Macedonian border today, and Yugoslavia's 
president shrugged off the threat of NATO airstrikes to restate his 
opposition to foreign troops policing a peace deal. A U.S. envoy 
also was encountering resistance in trying to persuade Kosovo 
Liberation Army commanders to accept a U.S.-backed peace plan. One 
diplomat said rebel commanders still had problems accepting the 
plan, with stumbling blocks including rebel misgivings about 
Russian participation in a NATO-led peacekeeping force and the 
requirement that the guerrillas surrender weapons to the 
peacekeepers. 

</P>
<P>
	Colombia Probes American Deaths  
</P>
<P>
	SAN VICENTE DEL CAGUAN, Colombia (AP) -- Colombia's top rebel  
group will investigate whether its guerrillas killed three 
Americans last week and will punish anyone found responsible, 
according to a senior commander. However, Raul Reyes, a member of 
the seven-man ruling junta of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of

	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Whitewater figure Susan McDougal went  
back to court today to face charges of contempt and obstruction of 
justice that could send her back to prison. She is on trial for 
refusing to answer Independent Counsel Ken Starr's questions about 
President and Hillary Clinton. McDougal insists she has no 
information on their dealings in the failed Arkansas real estate 
development known as Whitewater. But prosecutors say they will 
introduce evidence that McDougal had relevant information on the 
Clintons. McDougal already has served 18 months on a civil contempt 
citation.

<HEADLINE> Schott Foe Carl A. Kroch Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Carl A. Kroch, who owned a small share of the  
Cincinnati Reds and earned the nickname ``Baron of Books'' as head 
of the Kroch's &AMP; Brentano's bookstore chain, has died. He was 84. 
</P>
<P>
	Kroch died Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
	Kroch owned one share of the Reds and was an outspoken opponent  
of controlling partner Marge Schott, who has agreed to sell control 
of the team. The Reds' limited partners met with Schott on Monday 
to discuss her proposed sale. 
</P>
<P>
	The limited partners have the right to match the $65 million  
offer and keep the Reds under local control. Kroch's death adds 
another uncertainty to the process, which is expected to take 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past decade, Kroch complained that Schott had failed to  
inform the limited partners about her decisions as the Reds' 
president. He and other limited partners sued and won access to 
team financial records in a settlement with Schott. 
</P>
<P>
	When Schott was suspended for inflammatory remarks in 1993,  
Kroch thought she should have been stripped of her ownership. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always thought major league baseball had no guts and now I'm  
convinced,'' Kroch said at the time. ``They didn't even slap her on 
the wrist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He declined comment recently on Schott's preliminary agreement  
to sell her controlling shares in the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Kroch's father, an Austrian immigrant named Adolph Kroch, set up  
his first shop in 1907 in Chicago as a German-language book store. 
After merging with the Brentano's bookstore in Chicago, the chain 
eventually grew to 19 stores in the Chicago area. 
</P>
<P>
	Kroch started several trends in bookselling, including opening  
outlets in suburban malls and returning unsold books to publishers 
for credit.

<HEADLINE> Author Munro Wins Critics' Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Alice Munro, regarded by many as one of the  
world's greatest short story writers, won this year's fiction prize 
from the National Book Critics Circle. She was cited Monday night 
for the collection ``The Love of a Good Woman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sorry I'm not able to be here .... being relatively  
isolated in the snowy mountains of British Columbia,'' the Canadian 
writer said in a statement read by her editor, Ann Close. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had reason for many years to be grateful to you, the  
American critic. ... It is this attention of yours that has helped 
me to flourish for the past couple of decades, as an unapologetic 
writer of short fiction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Short story writers rarely get the sales or the acclaim of  
novelists, but Munro has long been admired as a master of narrative 
and psychology. She has often been compared to Anton Chekhov and 
among living short story writers perhaps only William Trevor is 
thought of so highly. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just adore her work,'' said fellow nominee and short story  
writer Lorrie Moore, whom Munro praised in her remarks. ``It's the 
subtle way she has of talking about the entirety of a life and the 
strange moments a life suddenly pivots upon. And as a person 
documenting and registering the lives of woman especially, she's 
just a genius.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The three other fiction finalists were novelists: Michael  
Cunningham, David Gates and Lynne Tillman. Among the non-nominees 
were Tom Wolfe, whose ``A Man in Full'' was the most talked about 
novel of last year, and Alice McDermott, winner of the National 
Book Award. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the second year the NBCC has made non-U.S. citizens  
eligible for awards and the second year a foreigner has received 
the fiction prize. In 1998, the winner was British author Penelope 
Fitzgerald. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason to make this award eligible for non-Americans is to  
include writers like Alice Munro,'' Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Monday night, Philip Gourevitch won the general nonfiction  
prize for ``We Wish to Inform You That Tomorrow We Will Be Killed 
With Our Families: Stories From Rwanda.'' The winner for 
biography/autobiography was Sylvia Nasar for ``A Beautiful Mind,'' 
her biography of John Forbes Nash, Jr., a Nobel Prize-winning 
economist and a diagnosed schizophrenic. 
</P>
<P>
	Village Voice writer Gary Giddins won the criticism prize for  
``Visions of Jazz: The First Century.'' The poetry award went to 
Marie Ponsot for ``The Bird Catcher.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The National Book Critics Circle, founded in 1974, is a  
not-for-profit organization of book editors and critics with some 
400 members nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	There are no cash prizes for the NBCC awards.

<HEADLINE> US Responds To Caribbean Suspension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) --The State Department said Monday Caribbean  
countries will hurt only themselves if they go ahead with a 
decision to suspend drug cooperation with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Nations of the Caribbean Community agreed to take that step  
Sunday out of frustration with the U.S. position on banana exports 
from the region to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cooperating in the international fight against drug  
trafficking and abuse is manifestly in the interest of the members 
of Caricom,'' State Department spokesman James Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has said the special banana trade arrangements  
Caribbean countries maintain with Europe are a violation of World 
Trade Organization rules. The WTO has sided with the U.S. position. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin said marijuana has been cultivated in Caribbean states  
since long before the United States brought its case on bananas to 
the WTO. 
</P>
<P>
	Pressure against drug producers, however, has increased recently  
``with the growing recognition of the problems of marijuana use and 
the corrupting and corrosive effect of economic dependency on the 
illegal trade provoking cannabis growers to rationalize their 
illegal activity,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	As an example, he said, Saint Lucia relies heavily on banana  
exports, yet has ``an excellent, close, collaborative and 
cooperative anti-drug, anti-crime working relationship'' with the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Saint Lucia ``is working diligently to  
diversify its economy,'' Rubin added. He said there may be some who 
want to link drug cooperation and the banana trade but ``we don't 
think it's justified.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An agreement signed in Barbados by President Clinton in May 1997  
calls for cooperation by Caribbean nations in anti-drug trafficking 
measures and extradition of suspects. But regional leaders have 
increasingly complained that Washington has ignored its end of the 
bargain by failing to address economic issues important to the 
Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
	Caricom spokesman Leonard Robertson said the decision to suspend  
the agreement, often referred to as the Bridgetown accord, was seen 
by the Caribbean leaders as the strongest way to send a message to 
Washington.

<HEADLINE> Duke Finishes Season at No. 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Duke, Michigan State, Connecticut and Auburn, the top four seeds  
in the NCAA tournament, finished in that order today in the final 
AP college basketball poll of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the third No. 1 finish for the Blue Devils (32-1), who  
entered the NCAA tournament on top of the rankings in 1986 and 
1992, the latter the year they repeated as national champions. 
</P>
<P>
	The top seed in the East Regional and winners of 27 straight,  
the Blue Devils received 69 of 70 first-place votes and 1,749 
points from the nationwide media panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan State (29-4), the top seed in the Midwest, received the  
other No. 1 vote and 1,654 points, 19 more than Connecticut (28-2), 
the top seed in the West. 
</P>
<P>
	Auburn (27-3), the top seed in the South, was followed in the  
Top Ten by Maryland, Utah, Stanford, Kentucky, St. John's and 
Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati dropped four spots to lead the Second Ten and was  
followed by Arizona, North Carolina, Ohio State, UCLA, College of 
Charleston, Arkansas, Wisconsin, Indiana and Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	The last five ranked teams were Iowa, Kansas, Florida, North  
Carolina Charlotte and New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas, the Big 12 champions, moved back into the rankings after  
a three-week absence, while North Carolina Charlotte, the 
Conference USA champions, entered the Top 25 for the first time 
this season. The 49ers were ranked for three weeks last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota and Missouri, which both lost their opening conference  
tournament games last week, dropped out from 23rd and 24th, 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke and Connecticut were the only teams to hold the No. 1  
ranking this season. The Blue Devils were No. 1 in the preseason 
poll and first two weeks of the season. The Huskies were on top for 
the next 10 weeks, then Duke was there the last five polls of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Twelve teams were ranked every week this season, including North  
Carolina, which has the longest consecutive streak. The Tar Heels 
have been in every poll since the preseason voting in the 1990-91 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	The highest ranked team among the eight from the preseason poll  
that wasn't ranked at season's end was Temple, which was seventh. 
None of the other Atlantic 10 teams in the preseason poll -- Xavier, 
Rhode Island and Massachusetts -- were in the final Top 25. 
</P>
<P>
	The team not in the preseason poll that was ranked highest in  
the last poll was No. 10 Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Four teams -- California, Louisville, Texas and North Carolina  
Charlotte -- were one-week wonders. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty-three teams from 11 conferences were ranked during the  
season. The Big Ten led the way with seven, all of which made the 
NCAA tournament. The seven were all in the same poll for two weeks, 
tying the record for a conference. The Big East, Pac-10, 
Southeastern Conference and Big 12 each had five teams ranked 
during the season.

<HEADLINE> Amtrak To Unveil High-Speed Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Amtrak is betting much of its future -- and that  
of high-speed rail in the United States -- on the premise that its 
soon-to-be-unveiled 150 mph trains will be competitive with 
airplanes and automobiles in the Boston-New York-Washington 
Northeast Corridor. 
</P>
<P>
	The long-awaited new trains, whose secret name and other vital  
statistics were being released at a news conference today, will 
start running in October along tracks that Amtrak currently uses. 
</P>
<P>
	By electrifying the entire 470-mile route, straightening curves  
and using 20 new trains sets that incorporate tilt technology, 
Amtrak figures to chop as much as 90 minutes off its 4 1/2-hour 
Boston-to-New York service and up to a half-hour off its current 
three-hour Washington-to-New York service. 
</P>
<P>
	As added incentives, the fare will be about 30 percent less than  
the current $199 walk-up air shuttle rate, and Amtrak will expand 
some of its current amenities, which include more spacious 
business-class seats, power outlets for computers, a dining car and 
full lavatories. 
</P>
<P>
	Amtrak views the Northeast Corridor as a model for other  
high-speed rail proposals in the Great Lakes, along the Southeast 
and Gulf Coast and throughout California and the Pacific Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
	It also is hoping that America will finally follow Europe's lead  
toward a transportation system that offers an alternative to 
congested highways and crowded airport terminals. 
</P>
<P>
	The national railroad refused all comment before today's  
unveiling of the new $2 billion service. 
</P>
<P>
	``It provides a reasonable and perhaps better third option for  
travel in the area,'' said Anne Chettle, spokeswoman for the 
High-Speed Ground Transportation Association, a Washington rail 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
	``The train is already popular in the Northeast. In other areas  
of the country, they are committed to their cars or airplanes. This 
way trains will seem less pie-in-the-sky to them,'' Chettle said. 
</P>
<P>
	Amtrak has not turned a profit since it was founded in 1971. The  
General Accounting Office reported that the railroad lost an 
average of $47 per passenger in fiscal 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Congress said Amtrak must become self-sufficient by  
2002. It provided a $2.2 billion cash infusion and a steadily 
declining annual subsidy that ends in three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year the railroad topped $1 billion in revenues for the  
first time, propelled by the best ridership in a decade and its 
best on-time performance in 13 years. It views high-speed rail as 
the final piece of its more toward profitability. 
</P>
<P>
	Amtrak currently transports about 9 million people each year  
along the Northeast Corridor, some 7 million between New York and 
Washington and an additional 2 million between New York and Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	There will be a minimum time-savings with the upgraded service  
between Washington and New York because that route already is 
electrified. The Achilles heel of the Boston-to-New York service, 
however, has been the requirement that diesel trains switch to 
electric locomotives for air quality reasons before completing the 
trip into New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	That adds about a half-hour to the journey.  
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, Amtrak has spent millions improving the track  
and adding electrical service from New Haven to Boston. It has also 
spent $710 million on new train sets that are modeled after the 
French bullet train, the TGV. 
</P>
<P>
	While not as fast as the 185-mph TGV, the new Amtrak trains will  
glide around corners using technology that gently tilts the cars. 
That doesn't promote speed as much as it prevents centrifugal force 
from throwing the passengers into a car's walls. 
</P>
<P>
	The track electrification, a project started in 1906 but halted  
by world wars, the Depression and other national priorities, will 
allow seamless service along the entire route. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not simply a New England project, this is not the end  
of a project,'' said Jim RePass, president of the National 
Corridors Institute, a group that worked on the project. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the beginning of a new era in American transportation.''

<HEADLINE> China Executes 2 in Tax-Fraud Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SHANGHAI, China (AP) -- Two businessmen in southeastern China  
have been executed in a 640 million yuan ($77 million) tax-fraud 
case, official newspapers reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The tax fraud blamed on Hu Yinfeng and Lu Huaming was one of the  
biggest reported in China, which has publicized long prison terms 
and some death sentences in a crackdown on tax cheats. 
</P>
<P>
	Hu and Lu were put to death Sunday in Jinhua, a city in Zhejiang  
province, the Youth Daily said, citing an announcement by the 
Supreme People's Court in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
	Hu and Lu separately set up 10 dummy companies and issued fake  
value-added tax receipts for the goods that passed through them, 
newspapers said. They said Hu pocketed $10 million while Lu took in 
$3.1 million.

<HEADLINE> L.A. Clippers' Skid Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Los Angeles Clippers are perfect this  
season -- perfectly awful. 
</P>
<P>
	At 0-15, they are two losses from tying the NBA record for worst  
start. And next up are two games against the streaking Lakers, 7-0 
since rebounding terror Dennis Rodman joined the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``The main objective right now is get a win, no matter who we're  
playing,'' forward Lamond Murray said Monday after practice. 
</P>
<P>
	The Miami Heat set the record for worst start with 17 losses in  
their expansion season of 1988. The Clippers could surpass that 
mark on Wednesday and achieve two dubious others. 
</P>
<P>
	Still possible are records for most consecutive games lost in a  
season -- 23 by Vancouver in 1996 and Denver last season -- and most 
consecutive games lost -- 24 by Cleveland in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody's feeling the pressure, from the front office to the  
coaching staff to the players on the floor,'' Murray said. ``If you 
let down and just quit, it's going to be a long road.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Losing is nothing new to this team. The Clippers started the  
season 0-16 in 1994, when Murray was a rookie out of California. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was more disappointing for me because I just came fresh  
out of college, a winning atmosphere,'' he said. ``That was more 
difficult for me to deal with than it is now because I've been 
through it and I know that you must keep pushing on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Clippers have come close to winning, losing in double  
overtime to Vancouver on Feb. 16. They actually led at halftime on 
the road last week against Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	``If these games were 12 minutes as opposed to 48, we'd be at  
least 8-7,'' guard Darrick Martin said. ``In Houston, we played a 
good 24 minutes and they came out in the third quarter and blew us 
away. When we can find consistency, that's when we'll find more 
wins.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oh, the Clippers have been consistent all right. Consistently  
terrible. Chris Ford is still waiting for his first win since 
becoming coach after the NBA lockout ended in January. 
</P>
<P>
	``I need more self-sacrifice from those guys. They have to be  
more committed,'' he said. `We only have a 35-game schedule left.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Point guard Sherman Douglas, a 32-year-old veteran who signed  
with the team last month, doesn't blame Ford. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anytime we execute and do what he tells us to do, we're in the  
ballgame,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford has tried just about everything to stop the streak. He's  
juggled the lineup, trying nine different combinations; benched 
players; and given players substantial minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm searching to see who I can get help from,'' he said. ``I  
don't see the response from them that is needed for us to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Clippers expect a bit of good news Wednesday. Rookie center  
Michael Olowokandi, on the injured list with a sprained left ankle, 
could return then to play against the Lakers at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
	Finding someone who can help has Clippers vice president of  
basketball operations Elgin Baylor exploring possible deals in time 
for Thursday's trade deadline. Ford talked to team owner Donald 
Sterling and Baylor on Monday, suggesting some moves. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I came here, I thought we had some good, young talent,  
but I didn't think they had an identity and I didn't think that 
they really knew how to play together,'' Ford said. ``That's still 
holding true. 
</P>
<P>
	``Are we asking for things that can't be done? No, we're asking  
for things that should be done. Until our guys decide they're going 
to do those things, they're not going to get over the hump.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Clippers play the Lakers -- to whom they've already lost  
twice this season -- on Tuesday and Wednesday. The Clippers could 
set the record against Sacramento at home Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Portland comes to town on Saturday, then the Clippers go on the  
road against Seattle on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Getting used to losing scares veteran point guard Pooh  
Richardson. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you sit in the back of the bus long enough, you've got to  
be careful because you'll think you belong there,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Court Rejects McVeigh's Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Timothy McVeigh, sentenced to die for the 1995  
Oklahoma City bombing that killed 168 people and injured hundreds 
more, lost a Supreme Court appeal Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The court refused to hear McVeigh's arguments that his trial was  
tainted by jury misconduct and news reports that he confessed to 
the bombing, the worst such attack on U.S. soil. 
</P>
<P>
	His lawyer, Richard Burr, expressed disappointment, saying, ``We  
had hoped the Supreme Court would be able to rise above the 
terrible human consequences'' of the case in evaluating McVeigh's 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is so easy to say 'no' to Timothy McVeigh,'' Burr added.  
</P>
<P>
	McVeigh was convicted of first-degree murder, conspiracy and  
weapons-related charges in the April 19, 1995, bombing of the 
Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. The bombing could be heard miles 
away, and television screens soon were filled with stunning images 
of the shattered building and rescue workers looking for survivors. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal appeals court last fall upheld his convictions and  
death sentence in the deaths of eight federal law enforcement 
officers. Oklahoma prosecutors have said they plan to charge 
McVeigh with first-degree murder in state court for the deaths of 
the other 160 bombing victims. 
</P>
<P>
	McVeigh still can pursue a new round of appeals challenging the  
constitutionality of his federal prosecution. Under a 1996 federal 
law, inmates have up to a year to file such an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	His Supreme Court appeal said the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of  
Appeals ruling that upheld his conviction sent a message that ``the 
rules of law may be applied on a sliding scale when the crime is 
unspeakable and public outrage is great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The appeal said pretrial news reports of a purported confession  
by McVeigh to his lawyers created a serious threat to his 
fair-trial rights. Four jurors indicated in pretrial questioning 
that they had seen the reports. 
</P>
<P>
	``No such procedure should send Mr. McVeigh to his death,'' his  
appeal said. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department lawyers said the bombing ``caused  
extraordinary harm'' and that courts took ``extraordinary steps'' 
to ensure McVeigh a fair trial, including disqualifying the 
original judge and moving the trial to Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	Prospective jurors were examined thoroughly for signs of bias,  
and news reports never established that McVeigh actually confessed, 
prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	At McVeigh's trial in 1997, prosecutors said he and co-defendant  
Terry Nichols carried out the bombing in revenge for the April 19, 
1993, deaths of about 80 people in the siege at the Branch Davidian 
compound near Waco, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said McVeigh, now 30, chose the Oklahoma City  
building because he believed people responsible for the Waco siege 
worked there and because the building was an easy target. Nichols 
was convicted of conspiracy in a separate trial and sentenced to 
life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	McVeigh is being held under maximum security at a federal prison  
in Florence, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal death row and execution chamber have been built at a  
prison in Terre Haute, Ind. However, the facility has not been 
activated and the 19 other inmates currently under federal death 
sentences are being held in prisons around the country as they 
pursue court appeals. 
</P>
<P>
	McVeigh's jury-misconduct allegation concerned one juror's  
comment to others during the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	An alternate juror told a court official that jurors discussed  
which of them would decide the case and which would serve as 
alternates, and that one juror said: ``It wouldn't be very hard. I 
think we all know what the verdict should be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McVeigh's appeal said the trial judge should have questioned the  
juror or held a hearing on whether the juror was biased. 
</P>
<P>
	His lawyers also said prospective jurors should have been asked  
whether they had any opinions about what sentence should be imposed 
if he were convicted. Otherwise, the appeal said, ``We risk having 
an 'Oklahoma City bombing case' exception to the rule of law.''

<HEADLINE> Berra at a Loss for Words, For Once </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UPPER MONTCLAIR, N.J. (AP) -- It was hard for Yogi Berra to put a  
legacy into words. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh gosh,'' Berra said every time a reporter asked different  
versions of the same question: What made Joe DiMaggio, who died on 
Monday, the greatest player ever? 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh God,'' said Berra, normally never at a loss for a malaprop.  
</P>
<P>
	Then Berra, who played with DiMaggio from 1947 until DiMaggio  
retired in 1951, came up with the answer. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio was perfect.  
</P>
<P>
	``Never did anything wrong on the field. Never did,'' Berra said  
Monday, sitting next to a gray 1939 DiMaggio road jersey on display 
at Berra's baseball museum. 
</P>
<P>
	Berra said he never saw DiMaggio dive for a ball in the  
outfield. And when DiMaggio sprinted from first to second base, 
``You thought, `Where the hell is he going?' He got there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to admire a man like that,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Berra, who later joined DiMaggio in the Hall of Fame, said that  
as a young man, he watched DiMaggio play. When he came to the 
Yankees, DiMaggio was the man Berra and other younger players 
looked up to. 
</P>
<P>
	``I watched him, everything he did,'' Berra said.  
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio was the only player Berra remembers to come to Yankee  
Stadium for home games dressed in a suit. ``Blue shirt, white shirt 
and a beautiful tie,'' Berra said. ``He looked great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Berra saw DiMaggio carefully guard his privacy. Even decades  
after his marriage to Marilyn Monroe, Berra said, he never 
mentioned her. And no one else was allowed to mention her if they 
wanted to remain his friend. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he was a loner once the game was over, Berra said, he  
would play cards and eat dinner with them on the train to away 
games. ``He always had somebody waiting for him when he got off the 
train,'' Berra said. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio wouldn't talk much about the injuries that caused him  
to leave the game, Berra said, although DiMaggio wouldn't play if 
he thought he would hurt his team. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio's death leaves Berra as the likely replacement for  
DiMaggio on April 9, when DiMaggio was scheduled to throw out the 
first ball at the Yankees' home opener. Berra, who recently ended a 
14-year feud with Yankee owner George Steinbrenner, said if he does 
get invited to Yankee Stadium, he has only one wish: that Joe could 
be there, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``So I could catch the ball instead of throw it.''

<HEADLINE> Mediterranean Forces at Low Level </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NAPLES, Italy (AP) -- Stretched from Iraq to the Balkans, the  
U.S. military based in Europe has lost strength in key areas since 
the Gulf War and could have trouble in another conflict of that 
scale, leaders in the armed forces said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Depleted forces include the Navy's 6th Fleet, which in coming  
weeks stands to have only seven combat vessels on duty in the 
Mediterranean -- a never-before-seen low, Vice Adm. Daniel J. Murphy 
Jr. told Congress' visiting Subcommittee on Military Readiness. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've hit free-fall,'' Murphy testified at the 6th Fleet's  
base in the southern Italian city of Naples. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to maintain a superpower spread around the globe  
and it just doesn't work,'' he said. ``There simply isn't enough 
money to do what we're being asked to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Commanders of Navy, Army and Marine forces in Europe complained  
chiefly of dwindling ranks. Attracting and keeping good servicemen 
and women is getting tougher, given employment competition from a 
healthy economy at home and the strains of frequent deployments, 
from Iraq to Bosnia and stand-by for intervention in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Aging equipment and overworked people make for a far different  
military than the one that beat Iraqi President Saddam Hussein in 
the 1990-91 Gulf War, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Army, worldwide strength is down from a Gulf War figure  
of 535,000 to 480,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The global strength of the Navy was down from as many as 550  
vessels to no more than about 325, the Navy said, in large part 
because there were not enough people to run the ships. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with fewer ships, the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower recently  
started a 6-month deployment 464 people short of its 2,963 
authorized billets, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Enterprise battle group deploys to the Persian Gulf next  
week, leaving only two submarines and five other vessels to carry 
out the 6th Fleet's duties in the Mediterranean. 
</P>
<P>
	With few ships and planes, Tomahawk missiles will have to stand  
in, Murphy said. In another sign of the strain on the military's 
resources, however, even stocks of Tomahawks are running short, the 
Navy said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see such a serious problem that I don't even know where to  
begin,'' said visiting committee member Rep. Solomon P. Ortiz, a 
Democrat from Texas. ``Aren't we inviting disaster?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peacekeeping work in Bosnia and the other, frequent deployments  
have made for some valuable on-the-ground, in-the-air training, 
officers testified. Large-scale combat training has suffered, 
however. 
</P>
<P>
	``There haven't been the kind of high-intensity conflicts''  
since Desert Storm, said Brig. Gen. John T.D. Casey of the 7th Army 
Training Command in Germany. ``If we commit these forces that are 
not as well-trained, the casualties are going to be significant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Congress is considering pay raises for the armed forces. Better  
pay and better benefits and services would help with recruitment 
and retention, the generals said. 
</P>
<P>
	Updated equipment -- replacing airplanes and computers whose  
makes are years older than the men and women using them -- would 
also help, as would careful consideration of the lengths of the 
increasing deployments, they said.

<HEADLINE> Court Rejects McVeigh's Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Timothy McVeigh, sentenced to die for the 1995  
Oklahoma City bombing that killed 168 people and injured hundreds 
more, lost a Supreme Court appeal Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The court refused to hear McVeigh's arguments that his trial was  
tainted by jury misconduct and news reports that he confessed to 
the bombing, the worst such attack on U.S. soil. 
</P>
<P>
	His lawyer, Richard Burr, expressed disappointment, saying, ``We  
had hoped the Supreme Court would be able to rise above the 
terrible human consequences'' of the case in evaluating McVeigh's 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is so easy to say 'no' to Timothy McVeigh,'' Burr added.  
</P>
<P>
	McVeigh was convicted of first-degree murder, conspiracy and  
weapons-related charges in the April 19, 1995, bombing of the 
Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. The bombing could be heard miles 
away, and television screens soon were filled with stunning images 
of the shattered building and rescue workers looking for survivors. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal appeals court last fall upheld his convictions and  
death sentence in the deaths of eight federal law enforcement 
officers. Oklahoma prosecutors have said they plan to charge 
McVeigh with first-degree murder in state court for the deaths of 
the other 160 bombing victims. 
</P>
<P>
	McVeigh still can pursue a new round of appeals challenging the  
constitutionality of his federal prosecution. Under a 1996 federal 
law, inmates have up to a year to file such an appeal.

<HEADLINE> William Wrigley Dead at 66 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- William Wrigley, the third generation to head the  
Wrigley chewing gum company founded by his grandfather, died of 
complications associated by pneumonia. He was 66. 
</P>
<P>
	Wrigley died Monday at a Chicago hospital, said Christopher  
Perille, a spokesman for Wm. Wrigley Jr. Co. 
</P>
<P>
	A native of Chicago, Wrigley was listed as the 58th richest  
American last year in a survey by Forbes magazine, with an 
estimated wealth of $2.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Wrigley began working in 1956 for the company made famous by its  
chewing gum brands, including Juicy Fruit and Doublemint. He became 
director and vice president of the company in 1960 and succeeded 
his father as president in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Monday, the Chicago-based company had announced that  
Wrigley's son, William Wrigley Jr., had been named acting president 
while his father was in the hospital recovering from pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
	The elder Wrigley had fractured his hip in mid-January and  
developed pneumonia while recuperating, according to a company 
statement. After a short hospital stay for the hip injury, Wrigley 
went home, but he recently returned to the hospital and was being 
treated in the intensive care unit when he died. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to his role in the family business, Wrigley served  
as director of several corporations. His business affiliations 
included Madison, N.J.-based American Home Products Corp. and White 
Plains, N.Y.-based Texaco Inc. He was director and chairman of the 
board at Santa Catalina Island Co. in California and served on the 
board of the Grocery Manufacturers of America. 
</P>
<P>
	He was a benefactor and life member of the Santa Catalina Island  
Conservancy and served on the board of trustees of the University 
of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
	The family also has deep ties to Chicago as former owners of the  
Chicago Cubs. The Cubs still play in Wrigley Field. 
</P>
<P>
	Most recently, Wrigley lived in Lake Geneva, Wisc. Funeral  
arrangements are pending.

<HEADLINE> Hornets Coach Dave Cowens Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT MILL, S.C. (AP) -- What was already the most difficult  
season in the Charlotte Hornets' 11-year history has taken another 
downward turn, this time with the resignation of coach Dave Cowens. 
</P>
<P>
	Unable to improve his status as one of the NBA's lowest-paid  
coaches, Cowens walked into the office of general manager Bob Bass 
before the team's practice Sunday at its training center and quit. 
</P>
<P>
	Bass described the reasons as ``irreconcilable differences,''  
but refused to elaborate, and team owner George Shinn could not be 
located for comment. But Charlotte's players and assistant coaches, 
including Cowens' former Boston Celtics teammate and close friend 
Paul Silas, said the resignation stemmed from Cowens' frustration 
at Shinn's refusal to give him a raise. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess he just couldn't take it any more,'' Silas said after  
running what was described as a somber practice following Cowens' 
departure. ``It really, really hurt him, this whole situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Silas, the only one of Cowens' three assistants with previous  
NBA head coaching experience, was to be named today the Hornets' 
interim head coach. 
</P>
<P>
	He'll try to resuscitate a franchise struggling on and off the  
court. 
</P>
<P>
	Shinn has been accused of unwanted sexual conduct by three  
women, and fans are calling for him to either start paying top 
dollar to keep good talent or to sell the team. Injuries have 
sidelined Charlotte's top two players, and one of them, Glen Rice, 
reportedly is about to be traded to the Los Angeles Lakers. The 
team has struggled to a 4-11 record, and attendance has plummeted 
for a club that used to consistently be among the NBA's leader in 
sellout crowds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hate to see this once-proud franchise headed in the  
direction it's headed,'' said forward Chuck Person, a 12-year NBA 
veteran in his first season with the Hornets. ``I know that when I 
played in Indiana and even with San Antonio, when we came to 
Charlotte it was really a home court and the fans were really some 
of the best fans in the world just from being around Carolina 
basketball. And now to see how the fans respond when our product 
runs on the floor, it's definitely a different scenario.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Person and the rest of the Hornets who spoke to reporters after  
Sunday night's practice all voiced support for Cowens, voted one of 
the NBA's 50 greatest players, who found quick success in 
Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
	Cowens, the only coach to lead the Hornets to consecutive 50-win  
seasons (54-28 in 1996-97, 51-31 in 1997-98), signed a three-year, 
$1.89 million contract in May 1996. The contract called for him to 
get $575,000 his first year, $625,000 last year and $675,000 this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	When Cowens went to Shinn last season and said he felt he should  
receive the NBA average of about $1.3 million, the Hornets offered 
him a four-year, $5.2 million extension. But Shinn reportedly 
withdrew the offer in February 1998 because he didn't feel Cowens 
was being appreciative enough. 
</P>
<P>
	Cowens went public with complaints about his salary last month  
as the team struggled to get started during the lockout-shortened 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coach just decided he had to do what's best for him,'' forward  
J.R. Reid said. ``For whatever reasons, Shinn and Coach didn't get 
along and couldn't work out the contract.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Silas said he tried to talk Cowens out of resigning.  
</P>
<P>
	``I told him there's just two more months left in the season,  
but his mind was made up,'' Silas said. ``At this point in the 
season, it's just shocking. That's the only word I can use.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Silas, who joined Cowens on NBA championship teams in Boston in  
1974 and 1976, was with five other teams during his 16-year playing 
career. He coached the San Diego Clippers from 1980-83, compiling a 
78-168 mark. Silas was an assistant with New Jersey, New York and 
Phoenix before joining the Hornets in 1997. He interviewed last 
summer for head-coaching vacancies in Chicago, Sacramento and 
Seattle, but wasn't offered any of the jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a difficult position to be in,'' he said as he left  
the training center Sunday night, five hours after Cowens quit. 
``But if you're called upon, then I think you have to accept it for 
the good of the organization, for the good of the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Point guard B.J. Armstrong said the coaching change could give  
the team a fresh start. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we can rebound,'' Armstrong said. ``I think throughout  
all of this something positive will happen, because this is one 
less thing for us to be concerned about.''

<HEADLINE> Court Won't Block Oliver Stone Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court refused on Monday to quash a  
lawsuit that blames the movie ``Natural Born Killers'' for leading 
a couple to shoot a woman during a 1995 robbery. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, which now will move to a pretrial stage, accuses  
filmmaker Oliver Stone and others of intentionally inciting copycat 
crimes. They say the lawsuit threatens freedom of expression. 
</P>
<P>
	The court's action was not a ruling but merely a denial of  
review. Stone, Time Warner Entertainment Co., and others named in 
the lawsuit still can seek to have the case dismissed before it 
reaches a jury trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will continue to defend vigorously the constitutional  
rights of artists and directors to express their creative ideas 
without fear of liability,'' said John Schulman, general counsel 
for Time Warner, which produced the movie. ``We are confident the 
courts will ultimately uphold those rights in this case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 1994 movie stars Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis as a  
couple who go on a violent crime spree and kill dozens of people. 
</P>
<P>
	Stone, Time Warner and others involved in making the film were  
sued by relatives of Patsy Byers, who was shot during a March 8, 
1995, robbery of the Ponchatoula, La., convenience store where she 
worked. Byers was left a quadriplegic, and she later died of 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	The family's lawyer, Joe Simpson of Amite, La., said Monday that  
proving Stone and the others intended to incite violence will be 
difficult. He said he plans to focus on a quote attributed to Stone 
in a 1996 interview regarding the movie: ``The most pacifistic 
people in the world said they came out of this movie and wanted to 
kill somebody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit says Sarah Edmondson shot Byers while Benjamin  
Darrus waited outside the Louisiana store, and that the two were 
inspired to commit the crime by watching ``Natural Born Killers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Louisiana judge dismissed the lawsuit, noting that many courts  
have ruled that the Constitution's First Amendment bars such claims 
over copycat crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	But there have been exceptions. For example, the Supreme Court  
last April refused to free a publisher from a lawsuit over three 
1993 killings in Maryland by a hit man who followed a book's advice 
on how to commit murder for hire. 
</P>
<P>
	Relatives of the victims accused Paladin Press of Boulder,  
Colo., which published ``Hit Man: A Technical Manual for 
Independent Contractors,'' of inciting the crime. The justices 
rejected an appeal and left the lawsuit intact. That case is 
pending before a state trial judge. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1969 Supreme Court decision says speech that advocates  
breaking the law can be banned or punished only when it seeks to 
incite imminent lawless action and is likely to be successful. 
</P>
<P>
	A state appeals court reinstated the Louisiana lawsuit by Byers'  
relatives because of its allegation that the filmmakers actually 
intended to spur viewers to commit similar crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	The filmmakers' Supreme Court appeal had argued that allowing  
the lawsuit to go forward ``undermines First Amendment liberties 
... and invites litigation against artists everywhere whenever 
criminal or demented conduct mimics artistic expression.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The appeal was supported in a friend-of-the-court brief  
submitted by more than two dozen media groups including the Authors 
Guild, National Association of Broadcasters and Recording Industry 
Association of America. 
</P>
<P>
	Stone was on the Miami set of an upcoming movie Monday and was  
not immediately available for comment.

wreck of the New Carissa out to sea, there were no high-fives, no 
champagne bottles, no celebratory cigars. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, salvage crews were guardedly optimistic on Monday that  
the cargo ship's broken bow would weather the 248-mile trip to its 
watery grave and not wash ashore for a third time. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no sigh of relief until she's on the bottom,'' said  
Bill Milwee, salvage consultant to the ship's Japanese owners. 
</P>
<P>
	Waves and a favorable tide helped the 420-foot bow section break  
free from the surf Monday at 3:16 a.m. It was pulled off shore by 
the 7,200-horsepower tug Sea Victory, one of the most powerful on 
the West Coast. By nightfall, it was 52 miles out to sea. 
</P>
<P>
	It headed over the horizon in the morning sun -- with a rainbow  
over it -- and was to be sunk by a Navy destroyer in thousands of 
feet of water, probably Wednesday or Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Coast Guard Cmdr. Dawayne Penberthy said the trick will be to  
shoot enough holes in the bow to sink it without rupturing the fuel 
tanks, which still contain up to 130,000 gallons of heavy fuel oil. 
</P>
<P>
	Just in case, he said, a Coast Guard skimmer boat was following  
behind the wreck. 
</P>
<P>
	A Coast Guard cutter was supposed to do the shooting, but  
officials were able to bring in the USS David R. Ray from its home 
port in Bremerton, Wash. The destroyer will use its 5-inch guns to 
fire on the New Carissa. The goal is to hit the cargo hold, just 
below the water line and above the fuel tanks, so the ship will 
sink quickly and evenly. 
</P>
<P>
	The saga of the New Carissa began Feb. 4, when the 639-foot  
freighter with 400,000 gallons of fuel oil on board ran aground off 
Coos Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	About half of that was burned off by explosives experts. Hours  
after the Feb. 10 fire, the ship split in two, spilling a total of 
70,000 gallons. 
</P>
<P>
	Efforts to tow the bow out to sea last week failed when it broke  
away and washed ashore 80 miles north at this tiny town along the 
Central Oregon Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Milwee said that this time around, the weather shouldn't be a  
problem. Winds were expected to actually decrease and seas should 
run no more than 15 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no reason we should part a tow line in this  
weather,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the ship's 220-foot stern section still sits mired in  
the sand at Coos Bay. Salvage crews have yet to decide what to do 
with it.

<HEADLINE> IRS Entering Credit on Tax Forms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Thousands of people who mistakenly failed to  
take advantage of new child credits on their income tax returns are 
getting some help from the Internal Revenue Service. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS estimated Monday that so far, more than 30,000 taxpayers  
who appear to qualify for the $400-per-child credits failed to 
enter it on their tax forms this year. But Uncle Sam is taking care 
of the problem for them. 
</P>
<P>
	In some cases, this means a larger-than-expected income tax  
refund; in others, it means a smaller tax bill, IRS spokesman Don 
Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
	The credit is new for the 1998 tax year. Within certain income  
limits, a taxpayer can qualify for $400 credits for each dependent 
child, grandchild, stepchild, adopted child or foster child who is 
under age 17 and is a U.S. citizen or resident. 
</P>
<P>
	The child credit is largely responsible for a 15.5 percent  
increase in average refunds this year, from $1,497 to $1,729. 
Roberts said about a quarter of the 39 million tax returns filed 
thus far have claimed the credit. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS is finding that thousands of people checked a box on  
their 1040 forms -- column 4 of line 6c -- indicating that a 
dependent meets these qualifications, but they failed to enter the 
$400 or more on line 43 of the form. 
</P>
<P>
	By using Social Security records, the IRS can determine if one  
dependent qualifies and will automatically correct the mistake. The 
IRS for years has corrected tax return math errors and other 
mistakes, often to taxpayers' benefit. 
</P>
<P>
	If the service can't determine eligibility, taxpayers will get a  
letter from IRS explaining the discrepancy and requesting an 
amended return to take advantage of it. 
</P>
<P>
	For additional child credits, taxpayers should contact IRS about  
whether those dependents are eligible. 
</P>
<P>
	Some taxpayers cannot claim the credit because their incomes are  
too high. The credit is reduced by $50 for every $1,000 of a 
taxpayer's income that is above $75,000, or $110,000 for a married 
couple filing jointly. 
</P>
<P>
	Credits differ from deductions in that they reduce tax liability  
on a dollar-for-dollar basis, while a deduction reduces the amount 
of income that is subject to taxation.

<HEADLINE> Princeton-Georgetown Rematch in NIT </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Ten years later, Princeton will get another  
chance at Georgetown in the postseason. This time it will come in 
the NIT rather than the NCAAs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tigers nearly pulled the biggest upset in NCAA tournament  
history when, as a No. 16 seed, they lost to the top-seeded Hoyas 
50-49 in the first round of the 1989 event. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's NIT field also includes five schools from the  
Western Athletic Conference and four each from the Atlantic Coast 
Conference and Big East. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nice to still be practicing and playing,'' said Georgia  
Tech coach Bobby Cremins. ``We are not deserving of an NCAA bid. I 
saw a lot of very good teams that were deserving get NCAA bids. 
Getting into the NCAA is getting harder and harder, and that means 
the NIT field is a very good one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are eight 20-game winners in the 32-team NIT, including  
Fresno State (21-11), Mississippi State (20-12) and Xavier (21-10). 
</P>
<P>
	But not everyone was as accepting of the NIT invitation as  
Cremins. 
</P>
<P>
	``We really felt like we earned an opportunity for the NCAA  
tournament,'' said Mississippi State coach Rick Stansbury, whose 
Bulldogs will play at Colorado State (17-10) in the first round. 
``We won 20 games in one of the best conferences in America. ... I 
don't understand why we weren't selected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other intriguing first-round matchups are Jerry Tarkanian's  
Fresno State squad at California (17-11), a Chicago-area battle 
between Northwestern (15-13) and DePaul (17-12), and Providence 
(16-13) at North Carolina State (18-13). 
</P>
<P>
	``At some point we figured we'd end up playing,'' said  
Northwestern coach Kevin O'Neill. ``The NIT will do whatever it 
thinks is best for the tournament. We're just happy to be in the 
postseason and excited to be able to keep playing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first three rounds of the tournament will be played at  
campus sites. All first-round matches will be played on Wednesday. 
The second round will be held March 15-16, and the third round will 
take place March 17-19. 
</P>
<P>
	The semifinals and finals will be played at New York's Madison  
Square Garden on March 23 and 25. 
</P>
<P>
	The other first-round matchups are: Hofstra (22-9) at Rutgers  
(18-12); Georgia (15-14) at Clemson (16-14); Seton Hall (15-14) at 
Old Dominion (24-8); Butler (20-9) at Bradley (17-11); Xavier 
(21-10) at Toledo (19-7); Alabama (17-14) at Wake Forest (16-13); 
Pepperdine (19-12) at Colorado (17-14); Southern California (15-12) 
at Wyoming (17-9); UNLV (16-12) at Nebraska (19-12); Texas 
Christian (19-10) at Kansas State (20-12); and Georgia Tech (15-15) 
at Oregon (16-11). 
</P>
<P>
	``We're appreciative for the chance to play,'' Georgia coach Ron  
Jirsa said. ``I think the players are very excited about the chance 
to play again. Certainly, it's a challenge to go against an 
opponent that I consider to be extremely tough like Clemson. We 
should not shy away from any challenges.''

<HEADLINE> Y2K Nuclear Stand-Down Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States and other nuclear powers  
should take their missiles off alert to avoid dangerous 
confrontations in the event of computer failures on Jan. 1, 2000, a 
Democratic lawmaker says. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a perfect opportunity to use the Y2K issue to open the  
whole discussion'' of nuclear stand-down, Rep. Ed Markey, D-Mass., 
said Monday at a symposium on how the Year 2000 computer crisis 
might affect nuclear power plants and weapons systems. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon has not publicly discussed the idea of a  
stand-down, although some officials have raised concerns that 
taking weapons off alert status and then putting them back on might 
pose additional risks. In the military, a stand-down means to go 
off duty for a certain time. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the administration has proposed that Russian experts  
and American counterparts meet in Colorado at the end of the year 
to jointly monitor early warning systems and prevent 
computer-generated misperceptions of an attack. A Russian 
delegation is coming to Washington later this month to discuss this 
and other ideas on the Y2K problem. 
</P>
<P>
	But Michael Kraig of the British American Security Information  
Council said at the symposium that no matter what steps are taken, 
``computer errors are by their very nature idiosyncratic'' and 
``the real cure is to take the weapons off alert.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Russia is thought to be well behind the United States in fixing  
computers to make sure they don't confuse the date 2000 with the 
year 1900, and Bruce Blair of the Brookings Institution said the 
Russian early warning system, with its thousands of missiles on 
hair-trigger alert, is especially susceptible to the computer bug. 
</P>
<P>
	He added that breakdowns in power grids could degrade the  
Russians' ability to monitor events such as the theft of nuclear 
weapons and that shutdowns in the cooling systems in 72 or 73 
deactivated Russian submarines raise ``the possibility of multiple 
Chernobyls.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blair and others said there is little evidence even in Russia to  
justify fears that computer errors will lead to accidental launches 
or explosions in nuclear silos. Deputy Defense Secretary John Hamre 
told a Senate hearing last month that ``our nuclear command and 
control system has been thoroughly tested and has performed 
superbly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speakers at the symposium also urged the Nuclear Regulatory  
Commission to adopt a more hands-on approach to assuring that 
nuclear power plants in this country are safe and that adequate 
backup systems will be in place. 
</P>
<P>
	David Lochbaum of the Union of Concerned Scientists said the NRC  
has audited only 12 of 103 operating nuclear plants to ensure their 
preparedness and ``needs to change from being a spectator to being 
a regulator.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NRC's executive director for operations, William Travers,  
testified to Congress last month that the commission is confident 
that all plants will be Y2K ready by October, and, should 
noncompliance be spotted, the NRC is ready to take steps including 
shutting down plants. NRC officials said inspectors will check on 
Y2K fixes at all the plants this spring.

	Joe DiMaggio Dies  
</P>
<P>
	HOLLYWOOD, Fla. (AP) -- Baseball Hall of Famer Joe DiMaggio,  
whose 56-game hitting streak in 1941 captivated the nation, died 
today at age 84. The New York Yankees star underwent lung cancer 
surgery in October and battled a series of complications for weeks 
afterward. Baseball commissioner Bud Selig called DiMaggio ``the 
personification of grace, class and dignity on the baseball 
diamond.'' Yankees owner George Steinbrenner says he told DiMaggio 
he would see him on Opening Day at Yankee Stadium next month, where 
DiMaggio would throw out the first ball. DiMaggio just smiled.

	Film Director Stanley Kubrick Dies  
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Police say director Stanley Kubrick died of  
natural causes and there are no suspicious circumstances. Kubrick, 
who directed ``Dr. Strangelove,'' ``A Clockwork Orange,'' and 
``2001: A Space Odyssey,'' died yesterday at age 70. He had been at 
work on ``Eyes Wide Shut'' for two years. The film, his first since 
``Full Metal Jacket'' in 1987, is scheduled for a mid-year release.

	Doctor: George Jones Getting Better  
</P>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Doctors say country singer George Jones  
has made significant improvement from a traffic accident and may 
soon be able to breathe without a ventilator. They caution that the 
67-year-old music star is still in critical condition with a 
``life-threatening injury.'' Jones had a quiet night, two days 
after nearly dying when he smashed his sport-utility vehicle into a 
bridge near his home. He was talking on his cell phone at the time, 
and wasn't wearing a seat belt. His liver was cut deeply, and his 
right lung was punctured. Jones has charted more than 140 records, 
including classics like ``He Stopped Loving Her Today'' and ``A 
Good Year for the Roses.''

	Lewinsky Mobbed at Book Store  
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Monica Lewinsky temporarily abandoned a signing  
session today on the first stop of her British book tour because of 
a crush of media attention. The world's most famous intern appeared 
shaken and teary as hundreds of photographers shouted her name and 
took her picture at the London department store Harrods. The 
book-signing resumed after the media were herded out of the room. 
When she came back, Ms. Lewinsky got a round of applause from the 
hundreds of people lined up to have copies of her biography 
autographed. ``Monica's Story'' climbed to the top of some Internet 
best seller lists after its release last week, although British 
bookstores reported only moderate sales.

	Fighting Threatens Kosovo Deal

<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Fighting broke out today in Kosovo  
along the Macedonian border, hampering attempts by U.S. and 
European envoys to forge a peace deal between Serbs and ethnic 
Albanians. The rebel Kosovo Liberation Army said the fighting 
started at dawn around Kracanik, near the province's border with 
Macedonia, and foreign observers reported hearing mortar and 
small-arms fire in the area. Meanwhile, U.S. and German envoys were 
to meet today with Yugoslav officials. The U.S.-sponsored peace 
proposal offers autonomy but not full independence for Kosovo 
Albanians, which the rebels have been demanding during a bitter 
ethnic war over the past year.

<HEADLINE> Up Close, DiMaggio Was Personable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	``Please don't say I'm reclusive or a hermit,'' Joe DiMaggio  
said on his 80th birthday. ``I'm not. And it bothers me when people 
say that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those who were close to DiMaggio, who died Monday at 84, said  
the image of his being aloof stemmed from his shyness. 
</P>
<P>
	``Joe is a private person and very shy,'' attorney Morris  
Engelberg, DiMaggio's longtime friend and neighbor, said in an 
interview last month. ``Because of that a lot of people thought he 
was standoffish, cold, but when he got to know you, he warmed up to 
you. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was great with kids because they didn't know who he was,''  
Engelberg said. ``The kids in the hospital wing he raised money 
for, kids on planes. He'd wave and smile to them on the planes, and 
they would walk over to where he was sitting and talk to him. They 
had no idea who he was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The real DiMaggio, as Engelberg saw him, was the fawning  
grandfather and great-grandfather. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those two granddaughters and their children are the delights  
of Joe's life. He just adores them.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio considered himself special because he was part of the  
New York Yankees' mystique -- it meant you had to act like a Yankee. 
</P>
<P>
	Yogi Berra, in his rookie year, once failed to run full speed to  
first base after popping up. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're a Yankee now,'' DiMaggio told him. ``You give 100  
percent all the time. You run out every popup.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	When DiMaggio was selected to receive The Sports Legend Award  
from the American Sportscasters Association last year, he asked Lou 
Schwartz, the group's president, ``Why me? There are greater 
legends in sports than me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I had heard he might be tough to deal with, but he was so  
gracious, so humble, and a real gentleman,'' Schwartz said Monday 
in recalling the telephone call from DiMaggio. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio declined an appearance fee or even travel expenses,  
Schwartz said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He told me the honor of getting the award was worth more than  
money we could pay him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A limousine picked up DiMaggio and two friends at his Manhattan  
apartment to bring him to the Marriott Marquis hotel, where the 
black-tie dinner was held. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a rainy evening in March and John Piper, a banker from  
Washington, was wearing a tuxedo and holding an umbrella, trying to 
flag a cab when the limo stopped for a red light. The window rolled 
down and the man was startled to see DiMaggio, who asked him, ``You 
going to the dinner at the Marriott?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Piper, who had never met DiMaggio, indeed was going to the  
dinner. But he was so flustered at seeing the Hall of Famer that he 
declined to get in the limo. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	To most people of a certain age, especially in New York,  
DiMaggio was easily recognized, even though his hair had turned 
gray and he had become stooped with arthritis. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had just come from dinner on the West Side, near his  
apartment, and it was late at night. The street was dark and pretty 
empty,'' Engelberg recalled. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw two menacing looking guys heading toward us, and I said  
to Joe, ``Get ready to be robbed. These guys look bad.' 
</P>
<P>
	``As they got closer, the older one, he had gray hair, stopped  
in his tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	```My Lord, it's Joe DiMaggio!' he said,'' Engelberg recalled.  
``The man put out his hand and they shook hands. He told his 
friend, ``This is the greatest ballplayer who ever lived.' 
</P>
<P>
	``Joe got a kick out of that, and kidded me about being worried  
that we would be robbed.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio's fame was not confined to New York.  
</P>
<P>
	``He went to Chicago for an Italian-American dinner. He was  
proud of his heritage. Tommy LaSorda was there, Tony La Russa and 
lot of others and Joe got a standing ovation,'' Engelberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The next day he was invited to ring the bell opening trading  
on the Chicago Stock Exchange. What happened was that he actually 
stopped trading for 15 minutes. He created such excitement and got 
such a big welcome, it held up trading.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio considered himself a New Yorker, although he was born  
in San Francisco and lived for a long time in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	He said New York had the best restaurants.  
</P>
<P>
	``He liked pasta, New York's Chinese restaurants and the Jewish  
delicatessens,'' Engelberg said. ``He was a hotel guy for most of 
his life. He felt comfortable living in hotels and eating out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Engelberg took a guest last month to a kosher-style deli not far  
from his office in Hollywood, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're sitting in Mr. DiMaggio's seat,'' the waitress told the  
guest. 
</P>
<P>
	``He always sits in a booth in the back with his back to the  
door, so people won't recognize him,'' she said. ``He's very shy.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks Lower; Dow Down 46 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip stocks were lower but trimming their  
losses in late afternoon, while the Nasdaq composite index was 
sharply higher as the technology sector came surging back. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 46.21 at 9,689.87. The Dow got as low as 9,674.33, down 61.75, 
earlier in the session. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq composite, however, was up 55.23 at 2,392.34, while  
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 3.45 at 1,278.92. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks rallied after a weak performance last week, as  
Nasdaq component Intel announced it had agreed to settle Federal 
Trade Commission charges that the chip maker had illegally bullied 
three other companies into handing over secret information about 
their products. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel shares were up 4 1/8 at 118 3/4. Dell Computer was up 1 13/16 at  
44 13/16 in leading volume in Nasdaq trading. 
</P>
<P>
	But two days of spectacular back-to-back gains in the Dow  
couldn't hold. The Dow gained a total of 460 points on Thursday and 
Friday. On Friday, it 268.68 to close at a record 9,736.08, helped 
by strong gains in the bond market. Bonds were still up today, with 
the 30-year Treasury up 1/8 point and yielding 5.58 percent, down 
from its 5.60-percent close on Friday. But it wasn't enough to help 
blue-chip stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just giving back some of the gains of last Thursday and  
Friday,'' said John Shaughnessy, chief investment strategist at 
Advest Inc. ``But the backdrop of this market continues to be very, 
very solid. Inflation is still contained, money supply growth very, 
very adequate, and this is a liquidity-driven market that depends 
on investors continuing to put more money in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the gains in the indexes, declining issues outnumbered  
advancers by 4 to 3 on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume 
came to 555 million shares, down from Friday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The market was also helped by some takeover news. Belgian-Dutch  
financial services group Fortis agreed to pay $2.8 billion, or $55 
a share, for American Bankers Insurance Group Inc. a Miami-based 
insurer. ABI's shares were up 5 11/16 at 52 1/16. 
</P>
<P>
	In other merger news, Allied Waste Industries Inc. announced  
this morning a $7.3 billion, or $45 a share, cash bid for larger 
rival Browning-Ferris Industries Inc. Allied Waste's bid would be 
30 percent premium over Friday's closing stock price. Browning 
Ferris was up 4 5/16 at 39 1/16, while Allied Waste's shares were 
up 1 1/2 at 16 1/2.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Exiles Protest Baseball Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Major League Baseball's  
announcement to return to Cuba for the first time in 40 years drew 
protest and criticism from Cuban exiles voicing opposition to any 
interaction between the United States and the communist nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuban exiles staging a demonstration at a Baltimore Orioles  
exhibition game Sunday said the team's plan to play the Cuban 
National team in Havana on March 28 symbolizes America's growing 
support for Cuban President Fidel Castro and his government. 
</P>
<P>
	``Going to Cuba under the current conditions there is a sign of  
insensitivity and lack of respect for human rights there,'' said 
Huber Matos, a Cuban native who spent 20 years in prison on the 
island for opposing the Castro government. ``It's like taking part 
in the abuses that are going on there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Matos joined more than 70 exiles waving Cuban flags and holding  
protest signs outside the gates of Fort Lauderdale Stadium before 
an exhibition game with the Florida Marlins. They continued their 
protest from the stands inside the ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to be able to let Oriole players know Cuba's  
reality,'' said Sylvia Iriondo, head of Mothers and Women Against 
Repression in Cuba. ``This is a time to support the Cuban people. 
They don't realize there is a wave a violence aimed at the 
opposition and certain journalists there. This is not a time to 
play ball with Castro.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The protest came on the day the Orioles announced that they  
finalized an agreement to play on the island after two months of 
negotiations between the State Department, Cuban government, 
commissioner's office, the Orioles and the players' association. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles are hoping to host the Cuban national team in a  
return exhibition game at Camden Yards in Baltimore on April 4. 
</P>
<P>
	``The intention of the Baltimore Orioles is not politics,'' said  
John Maroon, spokesman for the team. ``We want to bring two people 
together that have a common passion for baseball. The love of 
baseball there is as strong as it is here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most Cubans living in exile in Miami have long opposed Castro's  
communist government. Many arrived in South Florida after he took 
power some 40 years ago and hope to return once Castro is gone. 
</P>
<P>
	The protesters said they oppose a game played on the island  
while the Castro government continues to jail political opponents. 
They cited the case of four opposition leaders on the island who 
went on trial last week on charges of sedition amid a new crackdown 
on political dissidents. 
</P>
<P>
	The government accused the four dissidents of promoting U.S.  
policies toward Cuba and trying to harm the economy by discouraging 
foreign investment. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Cuba there is a brutal dictatorship that stomps on the  
rights of people,'' Matos said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the words of the protesters were lost on some baseball fans  
at the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we should keep sports out of the political arena,''  
said Kevin Stutzman of Fort Lauderdale. ``I understand what they 
are saying, but I think they are going about it the wrong way. They 
make people angry instead of sympathetic.''

<HEADLINE> Indians Stopped DiMaggio Streak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- This is where the Streak stopped on July 17,  
1941. 
</P>
<P>
	When Indians shortstop Lou Boudreau fielded Joe DiMaggio's hard  
smash to start a double play in the eighth inning that day, the 
Yankee Clipper's remarkable 56-game hitting streak had come to an 
end. 
</P>
<P>
	However, DiMaggio's legacy as baseball's consummate gentleman  
was only beginning. 
</P>
<P>
	``When Boudreau made the play,'' Bob Feller remembered, ``Joe  
didn't show any emotion. He never did. He didn't kick first base or 
anything like that. He just ran into the dugout like he always 
did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Feller, like baseball fans everywhere, paused Monday to reflect  
upon DiMaggio, who died at 84. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was the best all-around player of my time,'' the Hall of  
Fame pitcher said. ``He was as good a hitter as there ever was. Of 
course, Ted (Williams) was better. But Joe could do it all. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a great clutch hitter and just a great person. We were  
good friends. We're all going to miss him, and no one is ever going 
to replace him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On July 16, 1941, DiMaggio's streak was at 55 games when the  
first-place New York Yankees arrived in town for a three-game 
series against the Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	In the opener at League Park, DiMaggio got three hits as the  
Yankees won 10-3 to open a six-game lead over Cleveland. Following 
the game, DiMaggio, ever the team player, played down the 
significance of his streak. 
</P>
<P>
	``Winning ballgames is more important than streaks,'' he told  
the Cleveland Press. ``And if I can draw a walk or contribute a 
sacrifice where they would help us most, I'm for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With DiMaggio's streak attracting record crowds in other cities,  
the series was switched to mammoth Municipal Stadium, and a crowd 
of 67,468 -- then the largest night crowd in baseball history -- came 
out for Game 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Facing left-handed starter Al Smith in the first inning,  
DiMaggio ripped a shot down the third-base line that Ken Keltner 
stopped while diving to his right. Keltner, who had nearly stopped 
the Streak at 18 games with a similar play, made a perfect throw to 
first to nip DiMaggio. 
</P>
<P>
	After walking in his next at-bat, DiMaggio hit another shot  
toward third, and again Keltner made a sensational play. 
</P>
<P>
	``Keltner made a couple of great plays,'' said Feller, who would  
beat the Yankees 2-1 the next day back at League Park. ``If not for 
those, and Brooks Robinson is the only other guy I've seen make 
them like that, who knows how far the streak would have gone?'' 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio got another chance to prolong his streak to 57 games in  
the eighth inning against reliever Jim Bagby. With the bases 
loaded, DiMaggio hit a hard shot that took a bad hop on Boudreau, 
who gloved it and started the double play. 
</P>
<P>
	Keltner's defense denied Indians fans a chance to see if Feller,  
who won 25 games in '41, could have stopped the great DiMaggio. 
</P>
<P>
	``He always hit me quite well,'' said Feller. ``But after the  
war, I started pitching him differently. I started pitching him 
inside. He liked the ball out over the plate. He was a sweep 
hitter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio's 0-for-3 was big news, but the Yankee Clipper was  
knocked off the Press' front page on July 18 by other world events. 
</P>
<P>
	``Report: Hitler SOS To Japs'' read the paper's headline.  
</P>
<P>
	Inside, DiMaggio credited Keltner ``a mighty fine third  
baseman'' for his defensive gems and summed up his streak 
succinctly. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything comes to an end sometime,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Fortis Buying American Bankers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Belgian-Dutch banking and insurance group Fortis AG  
is buying American Bankers Insurance Group for $2.4 billion, a move 
the companies said would increase earnings, expand markets and 
eventually increase the number of products sold. 
</P>
<P>
	American Bankers, a leader in selling specialty insurance, such  
as coverage for credit cards, bank loans and mobile homes, had been 
the target of a bidding war last year, but no deal was consummated. 
</P>
<P>
	Fortis, based in Brussels and one of the world's largest  
insurance companies, said Monday that it offered $55 a share for 
all 43 million shares of American Bankers' common stock. Fortis 
also would assume $194 million of debt. 
</P>
<P>
	American Bankers stock shot up 12 percent on the news, gaining  
$5.62 1/2 to $52 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, which is expected to close before October, would be  
the latest example of a European insurer buying a U.S. financial 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	Aegon NV of the Netherlands recently agreed to buy Transamerica  
Corp. for $9.7 billion in cash and stock after buying Providian 
Corp. for $2.6 billion in 1997. ING Group NV, another Dutch 
company, bought life insurer Equitable of Iowa Cos. for $2.2 
billion in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of its offer, Fortis promised to keep American Bankers  
operations in Miami where American Bankers employs about 1,700 of 
its 3,000 employees. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not anticipate layoffs will be necessary, but we will be  
combining operations,'' said Allen Freedman, chief executive of 
Fortis Inc., the U.S. holding company for Fortis. 
</P>
<P>
	The transaction was approved by the board of directors of both  
companies. It is subject to regulatory approval and must be 
approved by American Bankers' shareholders, who are expected to 
vote within 30 days of regulatory approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Fortis, already strong in the Netherlands, Belgium and  
Luxembourg, will benefit from American Bankers' presence in Latin 
America, including Argentina and Panama, Freedman said. 
</P>
<P>
	American International Group Inc. had agreed to acquire American  
Bankers in late 1997 for $47 a share. The deal was broken up by 
Cendant Corp. in early 1998, which agreed to pay $67 a share in 
cash and stock for American Bankers. 
</P>
<P>
	But Cendant's accounting scandal and swooning stock price then  
contributed to the collapse of the deal in mid-October. Cendant was 
forced to pay American Bankers a $400 million breakup fee.

<HEADLINE>  Yanks Wanted To Honor DiMaggio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Joe DiMaggio fell a month and a day short of another appearance  
at Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio, who died today, had tacked to his bed a sign that said  
``April 9,'' opening day at Yankee Stadium, where he was supposed 
to throw out the first ball. 
</P>
<P>
	``Five days ago, on March 2, I visited with Joe at his home in  
Hollywood, Fla. He was weak but spirited and alert,'' said George 
Steinbrenner, the New York Yankees' owner. ``I told him, 'Joe, you 
have a date with the Yankees on opening day. We are counting on you 
to throw out the first ball.' 
</P>
<P>
	``He just smiled.''  
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio made a lot of people smile, as was apparent by the  
tributes that began pouring in minutes after his death was 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
	He also transcended baseball, much like Michael Jordan in  
basketball a half-century later, and was a spokesman long after he 
retired for a variety of products, including Mr. Coffee. In New 
York's Grand Central Station, a bank he endorsed simply posted the 
pinstriped number ``5.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And he reached fans and non-fans as an American hero.  
</P>
<P>
	``Even though I was never one of those people who cared about  
baseball, I care a lot about Joe DiMaggio,'' said former New York 
Mayor Ed Koch, who grew up in the city during DiMaggio's heyday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He represented the best in America. It was his character, his  
generosity, his sensitivity. He was someone who set a standard 
every father would want his children to follow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	People in the sport agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``His persona extended beyond the playing field and touched all  
our hearts,'' baseball commissioner Bud Selig said. ``In many 
respects, as an immigrant's son, he represented the hopes and 
ideals of our great country. 
</P>
<P>
	``I idolized him from afar as a child growing up in Milwaukee.  
In later years, when I had the opportunity to become acquainted 
with him, my admiration grew. Being with him was an event, bringing 
on an air of excitement, anticipation and joy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tommy Lasorda, former Los Angeles Dodgers manager, suggested  
that DiMaggio's record 56-game hitting streak may stand for another 
100 years, unlike Babe Ruth and Roger Maris' home run records and 
Lou Gehrig's consecutive-game streak. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was always kind of shy,'' Lasorda said of DiMaggio. ``He  
felt uncomfortable with a lot of people, but yet he was always 
there as a tremendous representative of our game of baseball. He 
was an icon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Albany, a bill is before the New York legislature to rename  
the city's West Side Highway for DiMaggio. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm comforted, as are all New Yorkers, that we informed him  
before he died that the West Side Highway will be renamed the Joe 
DiMaggio Highway,'' said Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a longtime Yankees 
fan. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as baseball is played, Joe DiMaggio will exemplify the  
very best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Cooperstown, N.Y., the Hall of Fame flag was at half-staff  
and a wreath was placed on DiMaggio's plaque. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hall has also scheduled special DiMaggio video programming  
for March, put a tribute on its Web site and is planning an 
exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
	It will include the glove that outfielder Al Gionfriddo of the  
Brooklyn Dodgers used when he robbed DiMaggio of an extra base hit 
with a spectacular running catch in the 1947 World Series, and 
DiMaggio's contract for 1948, the first in sports to reach 
$100,000. Even the pen is there.

<HEADLINE> Giants Estes Makes His First Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) -- There's no rush for Shawn Estes.  
</P>
<P>
	The San Francisco Giants left-hander is taking it easy this  
spring, pitching in the fourth spot in the rotation. The mellow 
schedule is designed to keep Estes from peaking too early, which is 
what some suspect happened to him last spring. 
</P>
<P>
	The same rotation will continue into the regular season.  
</P>
<P>
	``The thinking is that we want to put me up against the fourth  
guy from other teams in the first month, get my confidence and 
maybe rack up a few wins early,'' Estes said. ``I'm a momentum 
pitcher. I work real well off of good starts and when I get my 
confidence, I'm a lot more effective.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Estes made his first start of the spring on Monday against the  
San Diego Padres. In his own words, he felt ``a little bit jerky, a 
little bit out of whack.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Estes allowed four hits in the first inning, including a a  
two-run home run by Tony Gwynn. In the second inning he settled 
down to finish his brief appearance with two runs on four hits with 
one walk. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of times in that first outing you have a little bit too  
much strength, and you kind of don't know where it's going yet,'' 
he said. ``I felt that I was kind of getting into a groove. Another 
couple of innings I might have had it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Giants manager Dusty Baker didn't fault Estes for giving up the  
homer. In fact, it didn't cost the Giants at all. With the game 
tied in the 10th inning Monday, minor leaguer Damon Minor hit a 
three-run homer to give San Francisco a 7-4 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``You give up a home run to Tony Gwynn -- that's no indication of  
anything,'' Baker said. ``That's Tony Gwynn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Estes was on a tear last spring, going 2-0 with a 1.06 ERA. Once  
the regular season began, however, Estes lost his first four 
decisions and ended up 7-12 with a 5.06 ERA. He had shoulder 
problems too, spending 44 games on the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a disappointing season for Estes, who had gone 19-5 with  
a 3.18 ERA in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	That's part of the reason the 26-year-old Estes is only going to  
go every fifth day this spring. In most cases, pitchers throw every 
fourth day during the exhibition season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's about being strong opening week rather than being strong  
and being on top of my game at the middle of spring training, or my 
first outing,'' he said. ``I look at this way, in '97 I had a 
terrible spring, I got hurt and was on the DL for the first week of 
the season. In '98 I had a great spring and a horrible year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To help combat his demons, Estes saw sports psychologist Ted  
Bashore a couple of times this spring. Baker knew Bashore from his 
playing days. 
</P>
<P>
	``More than anything it's a focus on every pitch; having a  
purpose behind every pitch; not getting rattled by errors, umpires, 
things out of my control; focusing on the next guy; being able to 
block out what happened in the past,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Estes clarified that those things have not necessarily been a  
problem for him. Instead, it's all a part of his development as a 
pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been something I've wanted to get better at. It's just an  
edge,'' he said. ``I look at it as an edge.''

<HEADLINE> IRS Entering Credit on Tax Forms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Thousands of people who mistakenly failed to  
take advantage of new child credits on their income tax returns are 
getting some help from the Internal Revenue Service. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS estimated Monday that so far, more than 30,000 taxpayers  
who appear to qualify for the $400-per-child credits failed to 
enter it on their tax forms this year. But Uncle Sam is taking care 
of the problem for them. 
</P>
<P>
	In some cases, this means a larger-than-expected income tax  
refund; in others, it means a smaller tax bill, IRS spokesman Don 
Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
	The credit is new for the 1998 tax year. Within certain income  
limits, a taxpayer can qualify for $400 credits for each dependent 
child, grandchild, stepchild, adopted child or foster child who is 
under age 17 and is a U.S. citizen or resident. 
</P>
<P>
	The child credit is largely responsible for a 15.5 percent  
increase in average refunds this year, from $1,497 to $1,729. 
Roberts said about a quarter of the 39 million tax returns filed 
thus far have claimed the credit. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS is finding that thousands of people checked a box on  
their 1040 forms -- column 4 of line 6c -- indicating that a 
dependent meets these qualifications, but they failed to enter the 
$400 or more on line 43 of the form. 
</P>
<P>
	By using Social Security records, the IRS can determine if one  
dependent qualifies and will automatically correct the mistake. The 
IRS for years has corrected tax return math errors and other 
mistakes, often to taxpayers' benefit. 
</P>
<P>
	If the service can't determine eligibility, taxpayers will get a  
letter from IRS explaining the discrepancy and requesting an 
amended return to take advantage of it. 
</P>
<P>
	For additional child credits, taxpayers should contact IRS about  
whether those dependents are eligible. 
</P>
<P>
	Some taxpayers cannot claim the credit because their incomes are  
too high. The credit is reduced by $50 for every $1,000 of a 
taxpayer's income that is above $75,000, or $110,000 for a married 
couple filing jointly. 
</P>
<P>
	Credits differ from deductions in that they reduce tax liability  
on a dollar-for-dollar basis, while a deduction reduces the amount 
of income that is subject to taxation.

<HEADLINE> Orioles To Play in Cuba March 28 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	For the first time in 40 years, major league baseball will  
return to Cuba when the Baltimore Orioles play the Cuban national 
team on March 28 in Havana. 
</P>
<P>
	After two months of negotiations among the State Department,  
Cuban government, commissioner's office, the Orioles and the 
players' association, the sides finally reached an agreement 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this produces the kind of human results that we're all  
hoping it does, this could be something really big,'' baseball 
commissioner Bud Selig said. ``I'm very proud of the role we will 
play in doing something constructive that transcends baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cuban team will play a return exhibition game at Camden  
Yards. The second game will be played either just before Baltimore 
starts the regular season April 5 or on an off day during the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope that they do come,'' Stanley Hynds, a 25-year-old  
barber, shouted amid the clanging steel drums, trumpet blares and 
impassioned screams Sunday at Havana's Latinoamericano Stadium. 
``It will be a pleasure for us to see them and to see them lose 
right here in this stadium!'' 
</P>
<P>
	The games were planned after the Clinton administration decided  
in January to ease the four-decade-old U.S. trade embargo against 
Cuba. Major league baseball teams used to visit Cuba regularly, but 
the last were the Cincinnati Reds and Los Angeles Dodgers, who 
played exhibition games there in March 1959, about 2 1/2 months after 
Fidel Castro's revolution ousted dictator Fulgencio Batista on New 
Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
	Selig, who plans to attend the game in Havana, said the major  
leagues might schedule additional events in Cuba if this one is 
successful. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are other clubs that want to do this, too,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Several Cubans have defected in recent years and play for major  
league teams, notably Florida pitcher Livan Hernandez, the 1997 
World Series MVP; his half-brother Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez, 
who starred for the New York Yankees in last year's postseason; and 
Tampa Bay pitcher Rolando Arrojo. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're very good players,'' Orioles outfielder B.J. Surhoff  
said. ``If you look around the majors, there are a number of very 
good players with Cuban backgrounds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Castro, Cuba's president and a former baseball player himself,  
has referred to defectors as ``traitors,'' and Cuban officials have 
accused U.S. teams of trying to bribe Cuban players into abandoning 
their country. U.S. agents have helped Cuban players defect when 
they were on tour outside their homeland. 
</P>
<P>
	While salaries in Cuba average $10 a month, Livan Hernandez got  
a four-year contract from the Marlins worth $4,495,000, and Orlando 
got a $6.6 million, four-year deal from the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuban refugees and several congressmen have criticized baseball  
and the Orioles for dealing with Castro and oppose the games. About 
70 people protested Sunday at the Orioles' exhibition game against 
the Florida Marlins in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	``Going to Cuba under the current conditions there is a sign of  
insensitivity and lack of respect for human rights there,'' said 
Huber Matos, a Cuban native who spent 20 years in prison on the 
island for opposing Castro's government. ``It's like taking part in 
the abuses that are going on there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Selig said he understands ``people have all kinds of different  
human and political views.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very sensitive to that. I understand the feelings,'' he  
said in Tampa, Fla. ``We'll take care of the baseball politics and 
let the governments take care of the other issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Proceeds from the two games -- a sticking point in the  
negotiations -- will be used mainly to support baseball and other 
sports activities in the two countries, major league baseball said. 
The Clinton administration did not want profits to go to Castro's 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	Because it's only an exhibition game, Orioles players won't put  
too much emphasis on it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got things I need to get done on the field,'' first  
baseman Will Clark said. ``If I'm one of the guys who has to go 
down there, I'm going to treat it just like another ball game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the deal, two American League umpires and two Cuban  
umpires will work the game, and the Cuban team agreed to use wood 
bats instead of the metal bats it usually hits with, according a 
source familiar with the deal who spoke on the condition he not be 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles and the commissioner's office will pay for the  
improvements at Latinamericano Stadium, such as padding the 
outfield fence, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
	A delegation from major league baseball, the players'  
association and the Orioles probably will go to Havana this week to 
work out logistics and attempt to settle when the game in Baltimore 
will be played.

<HEADLINE> Monday's Supreme Court Rulings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court took the following actions  
Monday: 
</P>
<P>
	--Let stand Timothy McVeigh's conviction and death sentence for  
the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing that killed 168 people and injured 
hundreds more, the worst such attack on U.S. soil. McVeigh argued 
his trial was tainted by jury misconduct and news reports that he 
confessed to his lawyers. He still can pursue a new round of 
appeals in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
	--Refused to free filmmaker Oliver Stone from a lawsuit that says  
his movie, ``Natural Born Killers,'' led a couple to shoot a woman 
during a robbery. The lawsuit accuses Stone and others of 
intentionally inciting copycat crimes. The filmmakers say the 
lawsuit threatens freedom of expression. 
</P>
<P>
	--Rejected the appeal of a Missouri high school teacher fired for  
letting her students use large amounts of profanity in class while 
performing self-written plays. School officials said she violated a 
policy requiring teachers to enforce a ban on students' use of 
profanity. 
</P>
<P>
	--Turned away Marlena Ramallo Cooke's appeal in her effort to  
avoid being deported over a 1986 guilty plea to a drug conspiracy 
charge. She is the widow of Jack Kent Cooke, who owned the 
Washington Redskins professional football team. 
</P>
<P>
	--Agreed to clarify the filing deadline for lawsuits that invoke  
a federal anti-racketeering law. The justices said they will study 
the case of a Texas man who says he was illegally held in a 
psychiatric hospital by profit-greedy doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	--Turned away a dispute between Santa Barbara, Calif., officials  
and anti-abortion activists over the city's restrictions on how 
close demonstrators can approach abortion clinics or their 
patients.

<HEADLINE>  Mount St. Mary's Faces Spartan Task </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EMMITSBURG, Md. (AP) -- Mount Saint Mary's doesn't have the size,  
speed and talent of most teams in the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	When it comes to coaching, however, the Mountaineers have the  
winningest guy in the business. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Phelan, who has won 800 games and owns a .644 career winning  
percentage, will make his second appearance in the tournament 
Friday when he leads 15th-seeded Mount St. Mary's (15-14) against 
second-ranked Michigan State in the Midwest regional. 
</P>
<P>
	Phelan has recorded at least 20 wins in 19 of his 45 seasons at  
the Mount and trails only retired legends Dean Smith (879), Adolph 
Rupp (876) and Clarence ``Big House'' Gaines (828) on the career 
victory list. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Phelan's gaudy numbers hardly begin to tell the story of a  
devoted coach who has run a spotless program and helped shape the 
lives of hundreds of young men. 
</P>
<P>
	Fred Carter was playing basketball on the playgrounds of  
Philadelphia in the mid-1960s when Phelan got the 20-year-old high 
school dropout to check out the Mount's cozy campus in the hills of 
western Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter became the first black to enroll in the school, starred  
for four seasons and went on to both play and coach in the NBA. He 
remains close friends with Phelan to this day. 
</P>
<P>
	``He transcends just being a coach. You talk about a father  
image -- my Dad died when I was 16 and coach Phelan was there for 
me. He's always been there for me,'' Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
	These days, Phelan has another project: center Melvin Whitaker,  
who enrolled after spending two years in jail for slashing a 
University of Virginia football player with a box cutter on a 
recruiting visit there. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitaker, like Carter, had all but abandoned hope of a college  
career when Phelan came along and offered him a shot at redemption. 
</P>
<P>
	``How wonderful, coach Phelan's willingness to help people,''  
Carter said, his voice cracking with emotion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Melvin, like Fred, is a guy working on a second chance,''  
Phelan said. ``He really appreciates the opportunity. I think he 
likes not being at a prominent place like Raleigh or Durham.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Same with Phelan, who long ago laid to the rest the notion of  
coaching at a bigger school. Phelan interviewed at the Mount in 
1954, immediately took the job and has since spurned subsequent 
offers from more prominent institutions. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been wonderful to be out of the limelight. Out here in  
the country I can do as I please,'' he said. ``I was a city-slicker 
the first 24 years of my life -- it was great growing up in south 
Philly -- but now I live in a totally different world and I couldn't 
be happier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phelan, 69, skillfully avoids talk about retirement, so it seems  
as if his trademark bow-tie will remain a part of Mount games for 
at least another year or two. 
</P>
<P>
	``If my wife had her way I'd be doing it until I was 85, just so  
I'd be out of her way at home,'' he joked. 
</P>
<P>
	``How long can he stay? As long as he feels like it,'' said Jack  
Sullivan, Class of '57 and the school's career scoring leader. ``As 
long as he feels as if he can contribute and give something to the 
kids, he'll be out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The game has changed dramatically since Phelan began drawing up  
plays on the blackboard in the 1950s. So have the athletes. Yet 
Phelan has managed to cope with it all, tweaking his playbook 
through the years while maintaining a solid rapport with players 
young enough to be his grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been able to withstand the test of time,'' Carter said.  
``For a guy to coach four decades, almost four generations, it just 
shows how well he's been able to make the adjustment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Phelan's first year, he transformed a 15-11 team into a 23-4  
powerhouse. The rest, as they say, is history. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got off to a good start, and it started a long love affair  
between me and this place,'' he said. ``It's still going on, too.''

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ``Analyze This,'' a film starring Robert De  
Niro as a neurotic gang boss who turns to Billy Crystal for 
therapy, beat up another new film, ``Cruel Intentions,'' to lead

	The standout among the rest of the Top 10 was ``Shakespeare in  
Love.'' Buoyed by its Oscar nomination for best picture and by

<HEADLINE> Vet Bill As High As Elephant's Eye </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW BEDFORD, Mass. (AP) -- When your prized 7,300-pound East  
Indian elephant develops an infection, you go to great lengths to 
cure it, including asking City Council for help. 
</P>
<P>
	And if you're City Council, you pay the bill.  
</P>
<P>
	When Ruth, an elephant at the Buttonwood Park Zoo, developed a  
corneal infection, the zoo paid $17,500 for a cure. 
</P>
<P>
	The hefty bill raised eyebrows Tuesday when put before the City  
Council. But zoo officials said the value of the 42-year-old 
pachyderm's right eye was priceless. 
</P>
<P>
	In November, zoo officials discovered the penny-sized white  
growth after Ruth poked herself in the eye with a piece of straw. 
Veterinarians suspect the straw carried a fungus. 
</P>
<P>
	Treatment, which included almost three months of round-the-clock  
care, ended up costing $1,400 for medication and supplies, $8,000 
for consulting fees and $8,100 for overtime pay. 
</P>
<P>
	The elephant was mostly cooperative when zoo employees made her  
lie down on her side 12 times a day so they could administer five 
different drops. 
</P>
<P>
	After the mayor asked the City Council to approve a transfer of  
funds to pay for the treatment, councilors wanted a few 
explanations. 
</P>
<P>
	``How much does an elephant cost?'' one councilor asked.  
</P>
<P>
	Director of Zoological Services David Raboy responded that Ruth  
is priceless. He added that there are very few elephants in North 
American zoos and that breeding has proven difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	``She cannot be replaced,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The council approved the payment 11-0.

<HEADLINE>  Yankees Remember Joe DiMaggio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- David Cone never asked Joe DiMaggio for his  
autograph. He was too afraid, so he went out and bought a dozen 
from a collector. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't remember what the exact price was, but it was a lot,''  
the New York Yankees pitcher said Monday, recalling the purchase 
about a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``He really lived up to his billing. He was the greatest living  
player. He just had such a dignity and an elegance about him that 
nobody can match in today's game. Even the greatest players in 
today's game can't match that elegance that he had. He's one of a 
kind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio, who died Monday at his South Florida home, played for  
10 pennant winners and nine World Series champions with the 
Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans visiting the spring training complex placed flowers in  
front of a monument for him outside Legends Field, and the No. 5 
was stitched onto the left sleeve of each player's jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees ran a 90-second videotape of DiMaggio highlights  
before observing a moment of silence before the start of Monday 
night's game against the Philadelphia Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Joe DiMaggio is baseball. He's a national hero,'' said Sandra  
De Santis, a Highland Park, N.J. mother, whose 11-year-old son 
Gregory placed a bouquet is front of the plaque that reads: 
</P>
<P>
	``From 1936-51, Joe led the Yankees through their most  
dominating era. His excellence on the field propelled the Bombers 
to 10 World Series and his graceful stroke was one of baseball's 
greatest pleasures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By early afternoon, the Yankees posted a security guard to keep  
TV cameramen and early arriving fans off the grass in front of the 
monument, which is part of a tribute to all-time club greats. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, the club placed a huge spray of flowers and a painting of  
DiMaggio at the site. 
</P>
<P>
	``Very few people touched so many generations and so many lives.  
He had a tremendous impact on so many people. He was part of the

<P>
	DiMaggio's 56-game hitting streak in 1941 is considered one of  
the greatest records in sports, and current Yankees marveled about 
the mystique that set him apart from other Hall of Famers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I met him a few times,'' Cone said. ``He told me that he'd  
seen me pitch and sometimes I looked unhittable and sometimes I 
looked hittable. I didn't know how to take that. But just the fact 
he knew who I was was enough for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Catcher Joe Girardi talked about what a thrill it was to have  
his picture taken with DiMaggio when he threw out the first pitch 
during a playoff game in 1996. Darryl Strawberry predicted no one 
will ever hit safely in 56 straight game again, while Derek Jeter 
described DiMaggio as ``everything a ballplayer would want to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jeter, noting DiMaggio was an intensely private person, said  
most players were reluctant to approach him during his occasional 
trips to Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	That, however, didn't mean they didn't soak up as much of the  
Yankee Clipper as they could. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had more presence than anybody I ever met. When he was  
around, you knew it. Everybody lit up. The whole clubhouse would be 
abuzz when Joe D. walked in,'' Cone said.

	Longtime baseball executive Arthur Richman, now a senior adviser  
to the Yankees, recalled DiMaggio as a friend and one of the 
fiercest competitors in the game.

<P>
	``I started watching him in 1936. I always said the greatest  
player I ever saw was Babe Ruth. But he was in a class by himself. 
He was the greatest home run hitter that ever lived and he was a 
great pitcher. How many guys would pitch and hit home runs?'' 
Richman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``When it came down to the greatest player, I think about (Stan)  
Musial, and (Willie) Mays and (Ted) Williams,'' he said. ``But 
DiMaggio was the one man, if my life depended on it, I'd want at 
the plate to get that base hit in the ninth inning. And he did so 
many times.''

<HEADLINE>  Yankees Remember Joe DiMaggio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- David Cone never asked Joe DiMaggio for his  
autograph. He was too afraid, so he went out and bought a dozen 
from a collector. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't remember what the exact price was, but it was a lot,''  
the New York Yankees pitcher said Monday, recalling the purchase 
about a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``He really lived up to his billing. He was the greatest living  
player. He just had such a dignity and an elegance about him that 
nobody can match in today's game. Even the greatest players in 
today's game can't match that elegance that he had. He's one of a 
kind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio, who died Monday at his South Florida home, played for  
10 pennant winners and nine World Series champions with the 
Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans visiting the spring training complex placed flowers in  
front of a monument for him outside Legends Field, and the No. 5 
was stitched onto the left sleeve of each player's jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees ran a 90-second videotape of DiMaggio highlights  
before observing a moment of silence before the start of Monday 
night's game against the Philadelphia Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Joe DiMaggio is baseball. He's a national hero,'' said Sandra  
De Santis, a Highland Park, N.J. mother, whose 11-year-old son 
Gregory placed a bouquet is front of the plaque that reads: 
</P>
<P>
	``From 1936-51, Joe led the Yankees through their most  
dominating era. His excellence on the field propelled the Bombers 
to 10 World Series and his graceful stroke was one of baseball's 
greatest pleasures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By early afternoon, the Yankees posted a security guard to keep  
TV cameramen and early arriving fans off the grass in front of the 
monument, which is part of a tribute to all-time club greats. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, the club placed a huge spray of flowers and a painting of  
DiMaggio at the site. 
</P>
<P>
	``Very few people touched so many generations and so many lives.  
He had a tremendous impact on so many people. He was part of the 
fabric of America,'' general manager Brian Cashman said.

<HEADLINE> Bush Says Campaign Is His Not Dads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- It won't be his father's presidential  
campaign, Texas Gov. George W. Bush says. 
</P>
<P>
	Unveiling his exploratory committee Sunday, Bush said potential  
Republican opponents should steer clear of the other George Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any rival who criticizes my father makes a huge mistake. He's  
not the candidate, I am,'' Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican governor quickly corrected himself -- ``OK, you  
got me. ... He's not the candidate, and should I choose to run I 
will be the candidate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Bush acknowledged it now is ``obvious'' that he is ``very  
interested in running for the presidency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I went from warming to the task to pretty hot,'' he said. ``I  
wouldn't have asked the people coming from around the country, 
who've agreed to help me raise money, if I wasn't seriously 
interested.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's announcement gives shape to a field of at least 10  
Republicans. Former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander officially 
enters the campaign Tuesday; former American Red Cross President 
Elizabeth Dole will take the same step as Bush, forming her 
exploratory committee Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Bush promises to remain in Texas until after the state  
Legislature adjourns on May 31, others in the GOP already are 
taking aim. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander said the strong showings by Bush and Mrs. Dole in  
polls could be fleeting. Bush and the wife of 1996 GOP nominee Bob 
Dole, benefit from name recognition, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pretty soon it will come on down back to earth,'' Alexander  
said Sunday on NBC's ``Meet The Press.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three prominent conservatives released a letter urging support  
for Steve Forbes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Republicans have suffered two major defeats in a row for the  
presidency by nominating moderate, establishment candidates,'' said 
the letter from L. Brent Bozell III, Richard Viguerie and Morton 
Blackwell. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's father lost in 1992; Mrs. Dole's husband in 1996.  
</P>
<P>
	``If the GOP does not nominate a candidate with a clear,  
concise, conservative message in opposition to the liberal agenda 
of Al Gore, why should the country elect a Republican?'' they 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, who has touted a philosophy of ``compassionate  
conservatism,'' so far has declined to respond to such criticism. 
``I'm going to try to work hard not to play the typical political 
game of tearing down your opponent,'' he said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's 10-member exploratory committee includes three women, one  
of them black, one Hispanic man and one black man. Former Secretary 
of State George Schultz, former GOP chairman Haley Barbour, Rep. 
J.C. Watts Jr. of Oklahoma and five other congressional Republicans 
give a Washington flavor to the group. 
</P>
<P>
	Some committee members sounded as though the exploring's already  
over. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we get through with all of the exploring, the answer has  
got to be `yes,''' said Schultz. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am confident this exploratory committee will find plenty of  
support for George Bush for president,'' Barbour added. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, 52, has so far raised no money. He will file papers with  
the Federal Election Committee today allowing him to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	Advisers have said he hopes to quickly collect about $25  
million. In his races for governor, Bush raised about $16 million 
in 1994 and $17.7 million in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush -- who thus far has campaigned largely from the Governor's  
Mansion in Austin, with supporters coming to him -- said he knows 
his strategy of staying in Texas for the next three months is 
unusual. But he's keeping a promise to Texas voters who re-elected 
him, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to tell my friends outside of Texas, especially in the  
early primary states, I won't be able to visit until this summer. I 
know I will be late, but if I go forward with a campaign, I will 
work hard to overcome my late start,'' he said.

	SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) -- Two young men on bicycles attacked  
the wife of the U.S. ambassador to Costa Rica and stole her 
jewelry, local news media reported Monday. Two suspects were 
arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Embassy wouldn't comment on the reports, and the  
authorities did not confirm them, but Ambassador Thomas Dodd and 
his wife, Mary, were shown on television and radio at a police 
station to give a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's is good shape,'' Dodd said.  
</P>
<P>
	According to the reports, Mrs. Dodd, 61, was attacked near her  
house in southern San Jose on Sunday afternoon. It was unclear 
whether she suffered any injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	The two young men took two pieces of gold jewelry worth $3,000,  
according to the reports. 
</P>
<P>
	A Costa Rican and a Nicaraguan were arrested and one of the  
pieces of jewelry was recovered, according to the reports.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- The son of a dissident army general said  
Monday that someone fired at members of his family while they were 
visiting their father at a military prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Marco Vinicio Gallardo said at a news conference that he was  
playing tennis at a Mexico City prison on visiting day Sunday when 
the shot was fired. His father, army Brig. Gen. Alejandro Gallardo, 
was refereeing the game. 
</P>
<P>
	No one was hurt.  
</P>
<P>
	The son said he and two brothers who were present have filed a  
complaint with the Attorney General's Office. They said the 
shooting was an attempted homicide. 
</P>
<P>
	He added that his family has been harassed by the military since  
April, when Gen. Gallardo was sentenced by a court-martial to 28 
years in prison -- 14 years for illegally amassing a fortune while 
in uniform, and 14 years on charges of corruption and destroying 
files, to run consecutively. 
</P>
<P>
	Gen. Gallardo and his sons claim he was imprisoned because he  
publicly denounced corruption, nepotism and human rights violations 
within military.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- The environmental organization Greenpeace  
said Monday that a Mexican government proposal to increase private 
participation in the power industry does not adequately address 
ecological issues. 
</P>
<P>
	The changes that President Ernesto Zedillo proposed to Congress  
on Feb. 3 ``do not take into account the great waste in electricity 
consumption and almost absolute dependence on fossil fuels,'' said 
Alejandro Calvillo, head of campaigns for Greenpeace in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mexican government is seeking to amend the constitution to  
allow greater private participation in the electricity sector to 
cope with an expected growth in demand over the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposals would let private companies take part in power  
distribution, which is currently limited to two state-owned 
utilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Calvillo called for greater promotion of co-generation projects  
-- which use excess energy from other sources -- while urging that 
more attention be paid to efficient energy use.

<HEADLINE> Half of Carjackings Successful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Almost half the nation's annual average of  
49,000 carjacking attempts fail, and the overwhelming majority of 
victims escape injury, the Justice Department says. 
</P>
<P>
	Each year an average of 48,787 carjackings are attempted, but  
only 24,520, or 50.3 percent succeed, the Bureau of Justice 
Statistics said Sunday, reporting on data for 1992 through 1996, 
the most recent available. 
</P>
<P>
	Eighty-four percent of victims suffered no injury at all.  
</P>
<P>
	Only four percent of the victims suffered serious injuries, like  
gunshot or knife wounds, broken bones, internal injuries or loss of 
consciousness. The remainder had minor injuries like bruises or 
chipped teeth. Some incidents had more than one victim. 
</P>
<P>
	The bureau's survey had no data on murders during carjackings  
because the figures are estimates based on interviews during 
1992-1996 with 430,000 U.S. residents over age 12. Only survivors 
could be interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
	Using FBI data based on police reports, the bureau said there  
were an average of 27 murders by strangers each year during 
1992-1996 involving automobile theft. ``These may have been 
carjackings,'' the bureau said. 
</P>
<P>
	Victims were injured in 23 percent of the completed carjackings  
but in only 10 percent of the unsuccessful carjackings. A weapon 
was used in 83 percent of all incidents. 
</P>
<P>
	The bureau defined carjacking as a theft in which a vehicle was  
taken or attempted to be taken by force or threat of it. It only 
counted carjackings by strangers, not by acquaintances or 
relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 22 percent of carjackings occurred at or near the victim's  
home, but 65 percent were within five miles. The bureau offered no 
explanation, but law enforcement and automobile club officials 
privately suggested that most cars spend most of their time within 
five miles of the owner's home. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty percent of the incidents occurred in an open area, such as  
on the street or near a bus, subway or train station or airport. 
Twenty percent were in parking lots or near stores, restaurants, 
gas stations and office buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	Carjackings were more successful in daylight hours, two of three  
times. At night, only half the attempts succeeded. 
</P>
<P>
	A firearm was used in 70 percent of the successful incidents,  
but only 20 percent of the unsuccessful ones. 
</P>
<P>
	No resistance was offered by 38 percent of the victims; the  
other 62 percent took some kind of action to defend themselves or 
their property. 
</P>
<P>
	Nineteen percent of victims attacked, chased or tried to catch  
the offender or threatened use of a weapon. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty-four percent of victims used non-confrontational defenses  
like running away, calling for help or trying to attract attention. 
</P>
<P>
	The remainder used unspecified defenses.  
</P>
<P>
	The bureau said there was not enough data to analyze the impact  
of various self-defenses on either the rate of victim injury or the 
success rate of the carjacking attempts. 
</P>
<P>
	The bureau found that all the completed carjackings were  
reported to the police, but only 57 percent of the attempted 
carjackings. 
</P>
<P>
	This was the bureau's second study of carjacking. A study five  
years ago found a somewhat lower annual average number of 
carjackings. Those totals, however, cannot be compared to the 
current figures because, in the interim, the questions used in the 
interviews were altered to probe the carjacking issue more fully, 
bureau spokesman Stu Smith said.

<HEADLINE> Yellow Springs Saves the Farm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YELLOW SPRINGS, Ohio (AP) -- A 1960s brand of counterculture  
still thrives in this southwestern Ohio village, where organic 
food, tie-dyed shirts and men in ponytails are part of the 
mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
	So when local residents found out a sprawling farm north of town  
was being auctioned off, possibly to developers, they rose to the 
occasion with rallies, fund-raisers and a 13-hour benefit. In the 
end, with the generosity of a pair of married lawyers, they 
gathered $3.27 million to buy all 930 acres. 
</P>
<P>
	``The great fear was that developers were going to come in and  
destroy the ambiance, the place and basically the life that people 
have here now,'' said Karen Gundersen, 33, pausing as she shopped 
at a gourmet food store. ``The whole town rallied around. It was 
really exciting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A village of 4,000 people 20 miles east of Dayton, Yellow  
Springs is home to Antioch College and saw hippies and war 
protesters walk its streets in the 1960s and '70s. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, shops selling pottery, art and health food line the main  
street, drawing tourists for a little '60s nostalgia. Incense burns 
inside the Second Chance Hemp Co. clothing store, where album 
covers of the Doors, Grand Funk Railroad, Led Zeppelin and other 
vintage rock groups hang on the walls. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're unique, and we want to keep it that way,'' said Maria  
Thornton-Bunkley, 30, as she tended to customers at the Organic 
Grocer. ``I get all misty just talking about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Residents saw a threat to their identity when they learned in  
January that Whitehall Farm just north of the village would be 
auctioned off to settle an estate. 
</P>
<P>
	The village immediately earmarked $400,000 from a special  
green-space fund to try to buy the farm. And then residents went 
into activist mode, organizing fund-raising events, rallies and 
even protests to try to scare away developers. 
</P>
<P>
	At Antioch College, 20-year-old Sarah Alden organized a 13-hour  
benefit concert. It featured 14 bands from as far away as Tennessee 
and raised nearly $7,000. Merchants also donated food, pottery, 
jewelry, T-shirts and other clothing for sales to raise money. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't understand how people can put these generic, pre-fab  
houses that mean nothing'' on farmland, Alden said. ``I don't want 
everything to look the same.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After three weeks of work, residents had raised about $600,000,  
sending the village to the Feb. 22 auction with nearly $1 million. 
An estimated 800 people crowded into a motel ballroom in nearby 
Springfield for the bidding. 
</P>
<P>
	Village Manager David Heckler popped open his notebook computer  
to track bids he and others made. Gloom set in when he got down to 
his group's last $497, and he began to look for help. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to identify the strongest horse, get on that horse  
and ride,'' said Heckler. 
</P>
<P>
	David and Sharen Neuhardt, attorneys who wanted a piece of the  
farm because they own adjoining property, agreed to buy the whole 
farm for conservation with a combination of their own and the 
town's money and a bank loan. 
</P>
<P>
	As the auction built to a frenzied pitch, the Yellow  
Springs-Neuhardt coalition found itself pitted against a group of 
25 other bidders. 
</P>
<P>
	With the two groups tied at $3.26 million, the anti-development  
coalition upped its bid to $3.275 million. When the other bidders 
couldn't answer, preservationists in the back of the room counted 
down from 10 and then erupted into cheers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think Yellow Springs is a very special community,'' said  
Mrs. Neuhardt. ``Someone needs to stand up and say what makes sense 
for the use of this land.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange for accepting $1 million from the village, the  
Neuhardts agreed to give their new property a legal status that 
will keep it from being developed by themselves or future owners. 
They plan to resell about 60 percent of the farm to farmers and 
lease some of the remaining property for farm and other 
non-development use. 
</P>
<P>
	Villagers celebrated with a parade and party.  
</P>
<P>
	``I would love to say that it's a blast from the past, but I  
don't think so,'' said Gundersen. ``I think it's moving toward the 
future.''

<HEADLINE>  SEC Makes Record NCAA Showing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Looking for a sure way to get into the NCAA women's basketball  
tournament? 
</P>
<P>
	Scheduling tough opponents certainly helps. So does winning a  
lot of games. But what really helps is playing in the Southeastern 
Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA selection committee loaded up its brackets with SEC  
teams Sunday, giving berths to defending national champion 
Tennessee and seven others from that league -- four of whom finished 
at .500 or below in the conference. 
</P>
<P>
	That's a record for one conference, and a deserved one at that,  
Georgia coach Andy Landers said. The SEC previously had as many as 
seven teams in the NCAA field. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly, we've lived for years with the idea that we play in  
the most competitive conference in the country,'' said Landers, 
whose team is seeded third in the Mideast Regional.''Eight teams is 
certainly a compliment to the players and coaches. Most years, we 
easily could have had one more team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other SEC teams chosen for the tournament were Auburn, Alabama,  
Florida, Kentucky, Louisiana State and Mississippi State. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee (28-2) was seeded No. 1 in the East. The second-ranked  
Lady Vols begin their quest for a fourth consecutive NCAA 
championship at home Saturday against Appalachian State (14-14), 
which qualified by winning the Southern Conference tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no surprises in the No. 1 seeds, with the other slots  
going to top-ranked Purdue (Midwest), third-ranked Louisiana Tech 
(West) and sixth-ranked Connecticut (Mideast). 
</P>
<P>
	The selection committee felt comfortable taking so many SEC  
teams because it was the No. 1-ranked league all season and all of 
those selected had strong power ratings, said Bernadette McGlade, 
who chairs the committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``The committee felt strongly that teams that got in from the  
top three or four conferences in the country were all teams that 
definitely were one of the best 64 in the country,'' McGlade said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That does not mean the SEC will forever get eight,'' she said.  
``I think it fluctuates by teams and conferences on an annual 
basis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two other SEC teams, Arkansas and Mississippi, were selected for  
the women's National Invitation Tournament, which was expanded from 
16 to 32 teams this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think most folks would tell you that one through those top  
eight or nine ... you go into the arena knowing you have to play 
strong basketball to win,'' Summitt said. ``When you weren't ready 
to play, you didn't come away with a win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlantic Coast Conference and Big 12 followed the SEC with  
five teams each in the NCAA field. The Big East, Big Ten, 
Conference USA and Pac-10 all had four. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee also rewarded lesser-known teams that tried to  
play competitive schedules outside their league. Maine, for 
instance, received an at-large bid out of the America East 
Conference, which usually gets only its tournament champion in the 
NCAA field. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing in our rules that says the America East can  
only have its automatic qualifier,'' McGlade said. ``They did make 
an effort to schedule. They had Tulane, Mississippi, Western 
Kentucky -- out of region games against teams that were projected to 
be tournament teams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lack of a challenging schedule left Cal Santa Barbara,  
ranked 17th and winner of 21 straight games, as a No. 10 seed in 
the West. Cal Santa Barbara plays in the Big West, the nation's 
17th-ranked conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``Scheduling out of conference becomes very important when teams  
can't rely on their conference ranking to get them in the 
tournament,'' said McGlade, who noted Santa Barbara didn't play 
anyone with an RPI in the top 25. ``I would recommend scheduling a 
handful of (strong) nonconference opponents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut claimed a No. 1 seed after bouncing back from a rash  
of injuries at midseason, when the Huskies lost three of six games. 
They've won 12 of 13 since, including an impressive three-game run 
through the Big East tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, a late-season injury to All-American Nykesha Sales  
kept Connecticut from becoming a No. 1 seed and the Huskies were 
dropped to a No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, a key injury cost Notre Dame, expected to be among  
the top 16 seeds before losing point guard Niele Ivey to a 
season-ending knee injury in the Big East tournament. The 
eighth-ranked Irish, with their best record ever at 25-4, became 
the No. 5 seed in the West. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't get it,'' said Notre Dame coach Muffet McGraw, whose  
team beat three of the tournament's No. 3 seeds this season. ``I 
think Niele is a great player, but I think with a week to practice 
we're going to be fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Final Four is in San Jose, Calif., and the national  
semifinals will match the Midwest against the West and the East vs. 
the Mideast. That creates the possibility of a Tennessee-Louisiana 
Tech rematch in the championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee beat Tech 93-75 in last year's title game in Kansas  
City, Mo., to complete a 39-0 season. And while the Lady Vols 
haven't been as dominant this season, Summitt says they're ready to 
go. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this team has been waiting for March,'' she said.  
``We're all excited that it's finally here.''

<HEADLINE>  SEC Makes Record NCAA Showing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Looking for a sure way to get into the NCAA women's basketball  
tournament? 
</P>
<P>
	Scheduling tough opponents certainly helps. So does winning a  
lot of games. But what really helps is playing in the Southeastern 
Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA selection committee loaded up its brackets with SEC  
teams Sunday, giving berths to defending national champion 
Tennessee and seven others from that league -- four of whom finished 
at .500 or below in the conference.

<HEADLINE> Volvo Shareholders OK Ford Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GOTEBORG, Sweden (AP) -- Ford Motor Co.'s $6.5 billion buyout of  
the car division of Volvo moved an important step forward Monday 
with the approval of Volvo shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote came following questions from shareholders seeking a  
hint of Volvo's future strategy, particularly what the company 
plans to do with its large cash hoard. 
</P>
<P>
	Volvo chief executive Leif Johansson said the company, which  
recently bought a 13 percent stake in rival Swedish truck- and 
bus-manufacturer Scania, would keep reviewing possible 
acquisitions, and consider buying back its own stock if Swedish law 
were changed to allow that. After the sale to Ford, Volvo's main 
businesses will be commercial trucks and engines. 
</P>
<P>
	``Volvo has strong positions in the world market today, but we  
cannot rest on that,'' he said. ``Without strong ... growth, 
further strengthened by acquisitions within certain areas, there is 
a risk that we will be overtaken.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Approval came swiftly.  
</P>
<P>
	``Ford is a good industrial owner. The price is fair,'' the  
managing director of the influential Swedish Small Shareholder's 
Association, Lars-Erik Forsgaardh, told the national news agency 
TT. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's vote was in contrast to the bitter rejection six years  
ago of a merger with another much bigger car company -- France's 
Renault -- due to fears that control of Volvo and its jobs would 
move out of the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford executives have stressed that Volvo's current management  
and factories will remain and Volvo cars will retain their 
reputation for quality and safety 
</P>
<P>
	Auto analyst Stephen Girsky of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter said  
the deal is advantageous for Volvo, which can use the purchasing 
power of the world's second-biggest automaker to reduce its 
production costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm excited about it,'' he commented from Geneva.  
</P>
<P>
	Girsky, who was preparing to attend the Geneva auto show preview  
this week, also said a long-anticipated investment by 
DaimlerChrysler AG in Nissan Motor Co. of Japan could come together 
soon. But Nissan's staggering debt makes that pairing more 
problematic. 
</P>
<P>
	``Investors are questioning the risk-reward,'' Girsky said.

<HEADLINE> Gas Prices Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMARILLO, Calif. (AP) -- Gas prices rose for the first time  
since September, though an industry analyst cautioned the increase 
may not signal a recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	The weighted average, including all grades and taxes, was  
$1.0028 per gallon Friday, up 0.48 cent from two weeks earlier, 
according to the Lundberg Survey of 10,000 gas stations nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this is a price recovery after about a year and a half of  
price cutting, then it is so far a frail one,'' analyst Trilby 
Lundberg said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	West Coast prices increased after the Feb. 23 explosion at a  
Tosco Corp. oil refinery in Martinez, Calif., which killed four 
people and sent gas buyers chasing for alternative supplies, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	She warned that the tightening of gas supplies might create glut  
conditions prior to the spring driving season. 
</P>
<P>
	Self-service prices were 94.16 cents for regular, $1.0517 for  
mid-grade and $1.1362 for premium. 
</P>
<P>
	Full-service prices were $1.4002 for regular, $1.4915 for  
mid-grade and $1.5662 for premium.

<HEADLINE> Gulf To Get Missile Intelligence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- The Pentagon is offering  
Persian Gulf states immediate access to intelligence on Iraqi and 
Iranian missile launches, Defense Secretary William Cohen said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Making the fourth stop in a six-nation tour of the Persian Gulf  
region, Cohen said the Pentagon is prepared to set up computer 
terminals in friendly Gulf states to provide real-time intelligence 
on missile launches. The information would be collected by U.S. spy 
satellites with infrared sensors that can detect the heat plume of 
a missile launch. 
</P>
<P>
	The satellites send the information to ground stations which  
instantly rely an alert to remote terminals. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would do this with all of the Gulf states to have a direct  
link between what our sensors are able to pick up and to 
communicate that to the Gulf,'' Cohen said after a 90-minute 
meeting with Sheik Zayed bin Sultan al-Nahayan, president of this 
oil-rich nation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think it's beneficial to all of the states and we're  
hopeful that each state will see it as being in its interest to 
have the information,'' Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials described the proposal as intelligence sharing on  
test launches, although they did not exclude the possibility that 
the equipment could be use to convey warnings of missile attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Iraq and Iran are developing missiles capable of striking  
their Gulf neighbors. Iran in particular is seen by U.S. 
intelligence as aggressively modernizing its missile force and 
seeking the ability to develop a medium-range missile capability. 
</P>
<P>
	As has been the case in all of Cohen's stops so far -- in  
Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and Oman -- UAE officials made no public 
statements to reporters after meeting with the U.S. defense chief. 
</P>
<P>
	And as is the case elsewhere, UAE officials are sensitive to  
criticism from Islamic sects of close ties to the United States. 
UAE officials said reporters traveling with Cohen would not be 
allowed to accompany the secretary to Al Dhafra Air Base, where the 
Air Force operates KC-10 refueling planes. The KC-10s are involved 
in sustaining U.S. warplanes covering the southern no-flight zone 
over Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Gulf states friendly to the United States, the UAE is  
probably least supportive of the U.S. hard line toward Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Arab Emirates is less concerned about Iraq than about  
its neighbor across the Strait of Hormuz, Iran. The two Muslim 
nations are involved in a bitter dispute over control of the 
Greater and Lesser Tunbs and Abu Musa, strategically crucial 
islands that lie athwart the western approach to the strait. 
</P>
<P>
	``We discussed the threat that Iran poses in terms of its  
foreign policy support for acts of terrorism and the acquisition of 
weapons of mass destruction,'' Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheik Zayed led a move by Gulf states to publicly criticize Iran  
for a recent massive naval exercise conducted in part to 
demonstrate control of the islands. 
</P>
<P>
	The UAE is also negotiating with the United States for an  
enormous military purchase that would include as many as 80 F-16 
warplanes and accompanying missiles and radar systems. 
</P>
<P>
	If the deal goes through the planes, built by Lockheed Martin  
Corp. in Fort Worth, Texas, would be delivered beginning in 2004 at 
the earliest, a senior defense official said.

<HEADLINE> MIT, Merrill Lynch Announce Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- MIT and Merrill Lynch announced Monday  
they will pursue a $20 million joint research venture in the hope 
of breaking new ground in financial engineering. 
</P>
<P>
	Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. is funding the $15 million research project,  
which will look at the intersection of financial engineering -- the 
computer analysis of financial information -- with computer 
sciences. 
</P>
<P>
	The firm will also give $5 million to help the Massachusetts  
Institute of Technology establish a new graduate minor in financial 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
	``I expect major advances in the way we characterize risk in the  
coming years, I expect major advances in the way we visualize 
financial data,'' said Don Lessard, deputy dean of the Sloan School 
of Management. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sustainable value is in constructing more appropriate  
portfolios for individuals, better financial structures for firms, 
in making the financial system more robust,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The project will involve the Sloan School, the School of  
Engineering, the School of Architecture and Planning and six 
laboratories at MIT. 
</P>
<P>
	``The initiative anticipates and addresses a growing need within  
the financial services industry for sophisticated graduates 
schooled in a broad, multidisciplinary curriculum and for focused 
research on key financial services issues,'' said Herbert M. 
Allison Jr., president and chief operating officer of Merrill 
Lynch.

<HEADLINE> Man Pleads to Money Laundering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A key player in the largest drug money  
laundering case in U.S. history pleaded guilty Monday to charges in 
one of three indictments stemming from Operation Casablanca. 
</P>
<P>
	Victor Manuel Alcala Navarro pleaded guilty 28 times through a  
Spanish interpreter, an admission prosecutors said would bring him 
no special treatment 
</P>
<P>
	``The most important thing is he is not cooperating with the  
government,'' defense attorney Victor Sherman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Alcala Navarro still faces two other federal indictments in  
Operation Casablanca, which snared officials of three of Mexico's 
largest banks in a sting by U.S. Customs agents. 
</P>
<P>
	Alcala Navarro, 36, admitted to introducing bankers to the U.S.  
agents he thought were operatives of the powerful Cali drug cartel. 
The indictment alleged that about $70 million was laundered through 
Mexican banks and sent to the United States under the direction of 
Alcala Navarro. 
</P>
<P>
	The 28 counts that Alcala Navarro admitted to were only a  
fraction of the 106 charges lodged against him in the indictment. 
The government agreed to drop the rest. 
</P>
<P>
	Each count carries a possible maximum sentence of 20 years in  
prison, although Sherman said he expects Alcala Navarro to draw a 
sentence of about 32 years. Charges in the other two indictments 
could result in terms of life imprisonment without possibility of 
parole. 
</P>
<P>
	Sentencing was scheduled for June 28.  
</P>
<P>
	The Casablanca case raised tensions between Mexico and the  
United States last spring when U.S. law enforcement agents arrested 
167 people including top Mexican bankers and executives. Mexico 
accused the United States of intruding on Mexican sovereignty by 
conducting its sting operation without its involvement. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of Mexico's most prominent banks -- Bancomer, Banca Serfin  
and Confia -- were charged in the case. The indicted banks have 
denied any wrongdoing, saying the illegal activity was committed by 
rogue employees.

<HEADLINE> FTC, Intel Reach Proposed Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Microchip giant Intel Corp. reached a  
tentative agreement with federal regulators to settle claims that 
it illegally bullied rivals to maintain its dominance in the 
high-tech industry. 
</P>
<P>
	But the announcement Monday, on the eve of an antitrust hearing  
expected to last three months, came with a reminder from the 
Federal Trade Commission: A larger antitrust battle still looms. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides refused to comment on details. FTC spokeswoman  
Victoria Streitfeld said officials ``set out to establish a 
principle'' and believe ``that in the proposed agreement, they 
achieved that goal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Intel's president and chief executive officer, Craig Barrett,  
called the agreement a ``win-win'' for both sides. ``We are 
satisfied that the agreement gives us value for our intellectual 
property rights,'' he said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal regulators wouldn't elaborate on the ``remaining issues  
under investigation'' mentioned in their announcement. But 
antitrust experts say it refers to a much broader inquiry into 
Intel's practices. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a piece of a larger investigation where the FTC was  
looking into whether Intel used its market position to achieve 
dominance in related areas,'' said Kevin Arquit, a New York 
antitrust lawyer and former director of the FTC's Bureau of 
Competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Specifically, he said, the agency could be examining whether  
Intel illegally tied certain technical features to its microchips, 
forcing companies that buy one Intel product to use the other 
``bundled'' with it. A similar issue is part of the Microsoft Corp. 
antitrust trial. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, a settlement means the FTC will get what it wanted -- an  
order prohibiting Intel from withholding information from customers 
because of patent squabbles. The full commission must approve the 
settlement before it becomes official, and is expected to vote 
within two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Newborn, an antitrust lawyer who represents some Intel  
competitors, said he wasn't surprised by the settlement. He pointed 
to the Justice Department's case against Microsoft, which has faced 
embarrassing courtroom disclosures from its internal e-mail and 
testimony by its own executives. 
</P>
<P>
	``They saw what's happened to Microsoft and they didn't want to  
go through that,'' Newborn said. ``On a simple cost-benefit 
analysis, there was no reason for Intel to be fighting this 
fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In its June 8 complaint, the FTC argued that Intel holds a  
monopoly in the market for microprocessors, the ``brains'' of 
computers. Intel is the world's largest maker of microprocessors, 
with $26.2 billion in sales last year. About 80 percent of the 
world's computers run on Intel chips. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC claims Intel used that monopoly power to withhold key  
technical information about future microchips from three companies 
to punish them for refusing to license key patents to Intel without 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
	The three companies were Digital Equipment Corp., Intergraph  
Corp. and Compaq Computer Corp., which now owns Digital. The 
patents were for microprocessors and related technologies made by 
the three firms. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel acknowledges it did most of what the FTC alleged. However,  
the company claimed those actions were not illegal and had not 
``chilled'' innovation. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is one of those unusual situations where both sides can  
declare that they won,'' Arquit said. ``For Intel, the stakes were 
enormous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That is because ``the last thing they need is for a government  
agency to label them a monopolist,'' at a time when the company 
also faces private antitrust lawsuits, Arquit said. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other side, the settlement spares the FTC from trying to  
litigate a tough case at a time when Intel faces fierce competition 
from chipmakers Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and National 
Semiconductor Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	A recent industry report showed consumers bought more low-end  
computers in January with AMD processors than Intel -- knocking 
Intel from the No. 1 spot for the first time in that area. The 
report was based only on retail store sales and did not reflect 
sales by computer manufacturers to consumers by phone or over the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel pointed to AMD's performance in the marketplace in court  
documents released last week. Two years ago, none of the top 
computer makers used AMD processors, it noted; today nine of the 
top 10 do. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Meadlock, Intergraph's chief executive officer, said he  
didn't know details of the settlement but hoped it would modify 
Intel's behavior toward competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have confidence in the FTC that they're trying to look out  
for the industry's interests,'' Meadlock said. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement holds no bearing on a separate, much broader  
lawsuit filed by Intergraph against Intel alleging antitrust 
violations and patent infringement. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel and the FTC signed the settlement proposal Sunday  
afternoon after telephone negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors reacted favorably to the settlement. Shares of Intel  
rose $5, or 4 percent, to $119.62 1/2 in trading on the Nasdaq Stock 
Market.

<HEADLINE> IRS Entering Credit on Tax Forms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government is making sure that thousands  
of people who qualify for new child tax credits don't miss a chance 
to cut income taxes this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Internal Revenue Service estimated Monday that so far, more  
than 30,000 taxpayers who appear to qualify for the $400-per-child 
credits failed to enter it on their tax forms. The IRS is fixing 
the mistake for them. 
</P>
<P>
	In some cases, this means a larger-than-expected income tax  
refund; in others, it means a smaller tax bill, IRS spokesman Don 
Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
	The credit is new for the 1998 tax year. Within certain income  
limits, a taxpayer can qualify for $400 credits for each dependent 
child, grandchild, stepchild, adopted child or foster child who is 
under age 17 and is a U.S. citizen or resident. 
</P>
<P>
	The child credit is largely responsible for a 15.5 percent  
increase in average refunds this year, from $1,497 to $1,729. 
Roberts said about a quarter of the 39 million tax returns filed 
thus far have claimed the credit. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS is finding that thousands of people checked a box on  
their 1040 forms -- column 4 of line 6c -- indicating that a 
dependent meets these qualifications, but they failed to enter the 
$400 or more on line 43 of the form. 
</P>
<P>
	By using Social Security records, the IRS can determine if one  
dependent qualifies and will automatically correct the mistake. The 
IRS for years has corrected tax return math errors and other 
mistakes, often to taxpayers' benefit. 
</P>
<P>
	If the service can't determine eligibility, taxpayers will get a  
letter from IRS explaining the discrepancy and requesting an 
amended return to take advantage of it. 
</P>
<P>
	For additional child credits, taxpayers should contact IRS about  
whether those dependents are eligible. 
</P>
<P>
	Some taxpayers cannot claim the credit because their incomes are  
too high. The credit is reduced by $50 for every $1,000 of a 
taxpayer's income that is above $75,000, or $110,000 for a married 
couple filing jointly. 
</P>
<P>
	Credits differ from deductions in that they reduce tax liability  
on a dollar-for-dollar basis, while a deduction reduces the amount 
of income that is subject to taxation.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Falls on Profit-Taking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar fell against the yen and the euro  
Monday as profit-takers stepped in and sent the U.S. currency lower 
following a week of gains. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 121.66  
Japanese yen, down from 122.80 yen on Friday. The euro was quoted 
at $1.0886, up from $1.0835. 
</P>
<P>
	A week ago Monday, the dollar was worth 119.76, ending the week  
at 122.80. The euro hit a series of new lows against the dollar 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar's rally continued Monday as trading resumed in Asia.  
But investors lost faith as the rally faltered and turned to taking 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
	``I returned from lunch and wondered what happened,'' said  
Hajime Sato, assistant general manager of the treasury department 
at Daiwa International Trust Bank in Tokyo. ``Apparently, after the 
dollar failed to touch 123.20 yen, players started profit-taking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar ended lower against the yen and the euro in Asian  
trading, then tried to resume its climb during London trading as 
bargain hunters stepped in. But the dollar resumed its slide during 
European trading and never recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	``By the time we came in, the damage was done,'' John Beerling,  
chief foreign exchange dealer at Norwest Bank Corp. in Minneapolis, 
said about the role of North American traders Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.4627 Swiss francs, down from  
1.4707, and 1.5156 Canadian dollars, down from 1.5199. The British 
pound rose to $1.6080, up from $1.6064. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the countries participating in the euro no longer  
are traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Monday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.7966 German 
marks, down from 1.8051; 6.0241 French francs, down from 6.0533; 
and Italian lire, 1,779.36, down from 1,785.71.

<HEADLINE>  Hornets Name Silas New Head Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT MILL, S.C. (AP) -- Paul Silas was appointed interim head  
coach of the Charlotte Hornets today, one day after Dave Cowens 
quit because he felt he was not being paid enough. 
</P>
<P>
	Silas, the only one of Cowens' three assistants with previous  
NBA head coaching experience, takes over a team struggling on and 
off the court. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where this thing is going, who the heck knows?'' said Silas, a  
friend and former Celtics' teammate of Cowens. ``Hopefully, 
miracles do happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cowens, dissatisfied with his salary, walked into the office of  
general manager Bob Bass before the team's practice Sunday at its 
training center and quit. 
</P>
<P>
	Cowens, the only coach to lead the Hornets to consecutive 50-win  
seasons (54-28 in 1996-97, 51-31 in 1997-98), signed a three-year, 
$1.89 million contract in May 1996. The contract called for him to 
get $575,000 his first year, $625,000 last year and $675,000 this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Bass described the reasons as ``irreconcilable differences,''  
but refused to elaborate, and team owner George Shinn could not be 
located for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	But Charlotte's players and assistant coaches, including Silas,  
said the resignation stemmed from Cowens' frustration at Shinn's 
refusal to give him a raise. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess he just couldn't take it any more,'' Silas said after  
running what was described as a somber practice following Cowens' 
departure. ``It really, really hurt him, this whole situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shinn has been accused of unwanted sexual conduct by three  
women, and fans are calling for him to either start paying top 
dollar to keep good talent or to sell the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Injuries have sidelined Charlotte's top two players, and one of  
them, Glen Rice, reportedly is about to be traded to the Los 
Angeles Lakers. The team is 4-11 and attendance has plummeted for a 
club that used to be among the NBA's leader in sellout crowds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hate to see this once-proud franchise headed in the  
direction it's headed,'' said forward Chuck Person, a 12-year NBA 
veteran in his first season with the Hornets. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know that when I played in Indiana and even with San  
Antonio, when we came to Charlotte it was really a home court and 
the fans were really some of the best fans in the world just from 
being around Carolina basketball. And now to see how the fans 
respond when our product runs on the floor, it's definitely a 
different scenario.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Person and the rest of the Hornets who spoke after Sunday  
night's practice all voiced support for Cowens, voted one of the 
NBA's 50 greatest players. 
</P>
<P>
	When Cowens went to Shinn last season and said he felt he should  
receive the NBA average of about $1.3 million, the Hornets offered 
him a four-year, $5.2 million extension. But Shinn reportedly 
withdrew the offer in February 1998 because he didn't feel Cowens 
was being appreciative enough. 
</P>
<P>
	Cowens went public with complaints about his salary last month  
as the team struggled to get started during the lockout-shortened 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coach just decided he had to do what's best for him,'' forward  
J.R. Reid said. ``For whatever reasons, Shinn and Coach didn't get 
along and couldn't work out the contract.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Silas said he tried to talk Cowens out of resigning.  
</P>
<P>
	``I told him there's just two more months left in the season,  
but his mind was made up,'' Silas said. ``At this point in the 
season, it's just shocking. That's the only word I can use.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Silas, who joined Cowens on NBA championship teams in Boston in  
1974 and 1976, was with five other teams during his 16-year playing 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	He coached the San Diego Clippers from 1980-83, compiling a  
78-168 mark. Silas was an assistant with New Jersey, New York and 
Phoenix before joining the Hornets in 1997. He interviewed last 
summer for head-coaching vacancies in Chicago, Sacramento and 
Seattle, but wasn't offered any of the jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a difficult position to be in,'' he said as he left  
the training center Sunday night, five hours after Cowens quit. 
``But if you're called upon, then I think you have to accept it for 
the good of the organization, for the good of the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Point guard B.J. Armstrong said the coaching change could give  
the team a fresh start. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think throughout all of this something positive will happen,  
because this is one less thing for us to be concerned about,'' he 
said.

<HEADLINE> Tenn. Trying To Lure Car Racing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- A bill that could eventually help lure  
NASCAR's Winston Cup racing series back to Middle Tennessee sailed 
through the state House and Senate on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill passed 97-0 in the House and 29-0 in the Senate, and  
goes to Gov. Don Sundquist for his signature. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill lets the Wilson County Sports Authority issue bonds for  
infrastructure improvements at a proposed $125 million 
superspeedway complex near Lebanon, about 30 miles east of 
Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
	Dover Downs Entertainment Inc., owner of the Dover Downs  
International Speedway in Delaware, where two Winston Cup races are 
run each season, proposes to build the new track. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill allows the Wilson County sports authority to use  
increases in tax revenue to pay off the bonds over 30 years. After 
that the tax income reverts to the state and local governments. 
</P>
<P>
	The authority is expected to issue about $20 million in bonds,  
according to Barry Brooke, vice president of project developer 
Lawler-Wood LLC. The money can be used only for public improvements 
such as roads and sewerage. 
</P>
<P>
	The initial project is proposed to be a 1.33-mile oval  
superspeedway with 50,000 seats. Brooke said NASCAR's Busch, 
Craftsman Truck and ARCA series are expected to race at the track 
when it opens, projected for early 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Dover Downs officials are hopeful NASCAR will eventually  
put a Winston Cup series race back in Middle Tennessee. Nashville 
was on the tour, with two races, until 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooke said Dover Downs also is pursuing an Indy Racing League  
event. The IRL debuted in 1998 at the track in Delaware, where it 
has a three-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooke said the speedway complex in Tennessee will be expanded  
to include a short track, probably five-eighths of a mile, to 
replace the current Nashville Speedway. He said it could eventually 
include a dirt track and drag strip as well, depending on demand. 
</P>
<P>
	He said developers hope to start construction this summer. A  
lawsuit pending in Wilson County challenges the rezoning of 1,200 
acres where the speedway is to be built.

<HEADLINE> Diamondbacks' Womack Out Six Weeks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Newly acquired Tony Womack, who didn't want to be  
with the Arizona Diamondbacks, will be out six weeks because of a 
broken wrist. 
</P>
<P>
	X-rays confirmed Womack broke his right wrist when he was hit by  
a pitch Chicago White Sox pitcher Jim Parque on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The arm was placed in a cast, but Womack will participate in  
conditioning drills and a smaller cast may be placed on the arm in 
a week or two, manager Buck Showalter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Womack was slated to play left field, with Steve Finley in  
center and Luis Gonzalez in right. With Womack out, Arizona could 
move Gonzalez back to left, depending on who takes over temporarily 
for Womack. Showalter's options include David Dellucci, Bernard 
Gilkey, Pete Incaviglia and Andy Fox. 
</P>
<P>
	Womack, the NL's leader in stolen bases the last two seasons,  
was acquired last month from Pittsburgh. A player yet to be 
identified is to be sent to the Pirates as part of that deal. 
</P>
<P>
	It's been a rough start for Womack since he came to Arizona.  
First, he was unhappy with being moved from second base to the 
outfield, then the injury occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	Womack was set to be Arizona's leadoff hitter. Showalter likely  
will use several players, including Finley and Gonzalez, in that 
role until Womack returns. 
</P>
<P>
	If Womack is back in six weeks, he would miss the first 2 1/2 weeks  
of the season. Arizona plays its season opener April 5 at Los 
Angeles.

<HEADLINE> Lyrics From DiMaggio-Inspired Songs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Joe DiMaggio inspired artists through the years in both  
literature and song. Some musical examples: 

</P>
<P>
	From Paul Simon's ``Mrs. Robinson,'' from the soundtrack to  
``The Graduate,'' released in 1968: 
</P>
<P>
	``Where have you gone Joe DiMaggio?  
</P>
<P>
	``A nation turns its lonely eyes to you.  
</P>
<P>
	``What's that you say, Mrs. Robinson?  
</P>
<P>
	``Joltin' Joe has left and gone away.''  

</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio once met Simon in a New York restaurant after hearing  
the song -- a lament to lost heroes. ``I asked Paul what the song 
meant -- was it derogatory? He explained it to me,'' DiMaggio told 
The New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------

<HEADLINE>  Futuristic Olympic Torch Revealed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- The curve of a boomerang and the peaks  
of the Sydney Opera House have been combined to create the 2000 
Games' futuristic blue, silver and white Olympic Torch. 
</P>
<P>
	But Monday's unveiling of the torch provoked complaints from  
many news organizations over why Rupert Murdoch's News Ltd. 
newspapers got advance photos and publicity on the new design to 
display in Monday morning editions. 
</P>
<P>
	New South Wales state Olympics Minister Michael Knight said the  
presentation of the new torch was not a news event, and therefore 
could be offered as an exclusive to News Ltd., a major games 
sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
	SOCOG chief executive Sandy Hollway agreed with Knight, saying  
the torch announcement was not news. 
</P>
<P>
	The torch will be carried by 10,000 Australians on a 100-day,  
16,800-mile journey throughout the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Passing through almost 1,000 towns and communities, the torch  
will travel within an hour's drive of 85 percent of Australia's 
population, to complete its journey at Stadium Australia on Sept. 
15, when it will light the Sydney 2000 flame. 
</P>
<P>
	A fresh torch will be used for each of the 10,000 relay legs,  
and bearers will be able to buy the torch they carry for 300 
Australian dollars ($185 U.S.), the newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Weighing 2.2 pounds and made of stainless steel, anodized  
aluminum and textured aluminum, each layer of the 28-inch high 
torch represents fire, water and earth.

<HEADLINE> Corn, Soybeans Close Higher / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain futures and soybeans closed higher in  
trading Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Grain futures were driven higher as market participants were  
buying back positions ahead of Thursday's U.S. Agriculture 
Department crop production report, which is expected to show 
increased South American output. Grains were also supported by 
predictions of a snow storm that is expected to limit movement of 
grains in the central United States, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures closed mostly higher but gave back much of their  
early gains. Wheat was supported by feelings among market

<HEADLINE> Selig Statement on DiMaggio Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Statement by baseball commissioner Bud Selig on Monday on the  
death of Joe DiMaggio: 
</P>
<P>
	All of baseball is deeply saddened by the passing of the Yankee  
Clipper, Joe DiMaggio. For several generations of baseball fans, 
Joe was the personification of grace, class and dignity on the 
baseball diamond. His persona extended beyond the playing field and 
touched all our hearts. In many respects, as an immigrant's son, he 
represented the hopes and ideals of our great country. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe DiMaggio was a hero in the truest sense of the word. I  
idolized him from afar as a chld growing up in Milwaukee. In later 
years, when I had the opportunity to become acquainted with him, my 
admiration grew. Being with him was an event, bringing on an air of 
excitement, anticipation and joy. 
</P>
<P>
	Major League Baseball offers its condolences not only to members  
of the family but to baseball fans everywhere.

<HEADLINE>  Futuristic Olympic Torch Revealed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- The curve of a boomerang and the peaks  
of the Sydney Opera House have been combined to create the 2000 
Games' futuristic blue, silver and white Olympic Torch. 
</P>
<P>
	But Monday's unveiling of the torch provoked complaints from  
many news organizations over why Rupert Murdoch's News Ltd. 
newspapers got advance photos and publicity on the new design to 
display in Monday morning editions. 
</P>
<P>
	New South Wales state Olympics Minister Michael Knight said the  
presentation of the new torch was not a news event, and therefore 
could be offered as an exclusive to News Ltd., a major games 
sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
	SOCOG chief executive Sandy Hollway agreed with Knight, saying  
the torch announcement was not news. 
</P>
<P>
	The torch will be carried by 10,000 Australians on a 100-day,  
16,800-mile journey throughout the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Passing through almost 1,000 towns and communities, the torch  
will travel within an hour's drive of 85 percent of Australia's 
population, to complete its journey at Stadium Australia on Sept. 
15, when it will light the Sydney 2000 flame. 
</P>
<P>
	A fresh torch will be used for each of the 10,000 relay legs,  
and bearers will be able to buy the torch they carry for 300 
Australian dollars ($185 U.S.), the newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Weighing 2.2 pounds and made of stainless steel, anodized  
aluminum and textured aluminum, each layer of the 28-inch high 
torch represents fire, water and earth.

<HEADLINE> Hospital Is DiMaggio's Legacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOLLYWOOD, Fla. (AP) -- The photo is fairly recent, and it shows  
Joe DiMaggio with a jaunty grin, cradling an infant more carefully 
than any fly ball he ever caught. 
</P>
<P>
	The caption: ``Joe DiMaggio And The Babe.''  
</P>
<P>
	Even when DiMaggio turned old and gray, he still touched  
children -- literally. The photo can be found at Joe DiMaggio 
Children's Hospital, his legacy to South Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was the last phase of his life,'' said Frank Sacco, chief  
administrator at the hospital. ``He played baseball and he donated 
himself to a lot of causes. In the last seven years, this became 
the most important focus of his life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The former New York Yankees great died at home early Monday, and  
at the hospital -- a place accustomed to death -- this one hit harder 
than most. Several hospital volunteers sat in the cafeteria at 
lunch talking about DiMaggio. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the end of an era,'' Sylvia Bloom said. ``Everyone loved  
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Near the hospital entrance, a Yankees flag bearing DiMaggio's  
No. 5 flew at half staff. In the gift shop, he was the main topic. 
</P>
<P>
	``The comments are so nice,'' volunteer Esther Borstein said.  
``Everyone has praised him to the high heavens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio's association with the children's hospital began in  
1992. Sacco, looking to promote a unit that is part of Memorial 
Regional Hospital, called DiMaggio's attorney and requested a 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	During lunch over Italian cuisine, a deal quickly was reached.  
The agreement was just a few pages long, and DiMaggio made only one 
stipulation: No child could be denied treatment because of an 
inability to pay. 
</P>
<P>
	He donated his name and time, rather than money, and his efforts  
raised more than $4 million. The result is a 150-bed hospital that 
had 6,000 admissions last year, performed 1,300 operations and had 
20,000 emergency visits. 
</P>
<P>
	A reluctant celebrity, DiMaggio threw out the first pitch at the  
hospital's old-timers' games to raise money, but much of his 
efforts took place behind the scenes. He frequently dropped by to 
visit sick children and their families. 
</P>
<P>
	``He did his best work anonymously,'' Sacco said.  
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio, battling lung cancer, was hospitalized for three  
months at Memorial this winter before being sent home Jan. 19. 
Sacco last spoke with him two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wasn't in a lot of pain or discomfort here, and I don't  
think that changed at home,'' Sacco said. ``He was in high spirits. 
He knew he had a very serious illness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, in DiMaggio's name, the hospital will continue the work of  
helping children who are ill. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a legend to live up to,'' Sacco said, ``and we'll do  
that.''

<HEADLINE>  Hornets Name Silas New Head Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT MILL, S.C. (AP) -- Paul Silas was appointed interim head  
coach of the Charlotte Hornets today, one day after Dave Cowens 
quit because he felt he was not being paid enough. 
</P>
<P>
	Silas, the only one of Cowens' three assistants with previous  
NBA head coaching experience, takes over a team struggling on and 
off the court. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where this thing is going, who the heck knows?'' said Silas, a  
friend and former Celtics' teammate of Cowens. ``Hopefully, 
miracles do happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cowens, dissatisfied with his salary, walked into the office of  
general manager Bob Bass before the team's practice Sunday at its 
training center and quit. 
</P>
<P>
	Cowens, the only coach to lead the Hornets to consecutive 50-win  
seasons (54-28 in 1996-97, 51-31 in 1997-98), signed a three-year, 
$1.89 million contract in May 1996. The contract called for him to 
get $575,000 his first year, $625,000 last year and $675,000 this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Bass described the reasons as ``irreconcilable differences,''  
but refused to elaborate, and team owner George Shinn could not be 
located for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	But Charlotte's players and assistant coaches, including Silas,  
said the resignation stemmed from Cowens' frustration at Shinn's 
refusal to give him a raise. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess he just couldn't take it any more,'' Silas said after  
running what was described as a somber practice following Cowens' 
departure. ``It really, really hurt him, this whole situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shinn has been accused of unwanted sexual conduct by three  
women, and fans are calling for him to either start paying top 
dollar to keep good talent or to sell the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Injuries have sidelined Charlotte's top two players, and one of  
them, Glen Rice, reportedly is about to be traded to the Los 
Angeles Lakers. The team is 4-11 and attendance has plummeted for a 
club that used to be among the NBA's leader in sellout crowds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hate to see this once-proud franchise headed in the  
direction it's headed,'' said forward Chuck Person, a 12-year NBA 
veteran in his first season with the Hornets. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know that when I played in Indiana and even with San  
Antonio, when we came to Charlotte it was really a home court and 
the fans were really some of the best fans in the world just from 
being around Carolina basketball. And now to see how the fans 
respond when our product runs on the floor, it's definitely a 
different scenario.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Person and the rest of the Hornets who spoke after Sunday  
night's practice all voiced support for Cowens, voted one of the 
NBA's 50 greatest players. 
</P>
<P>
	When Cowens went to Shinn last season and said he felt he should  
receive the NBA average of about $1.3 million, the Hornets offered 
him a four-year, $5.2 million extension. But Shinn reportedly 
withdrew the offer in February 1998 because he didn't feel Cowens 
was being appreciative enough. 
</P>
<P>
	Cowens went public with complaints about his salary last month  
as the team struggled to get started during the lockout-shortened 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coach just decided he had to do what's best for him,'' forward  
J.R. Reid said. ``For whatever reasons, Shinn and Coach didn't get 
along and couldn't work out the contract.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Silas said he tried to talk Cowens out of resigning.  
</P>
<P>
	``I told him there's just two more months left in the season,  
but his mind was made up,'' Silas said. ``At this point in the 
season, it's just shocking. That's the only word I can use.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Silas, who joined Cowens on NBA championship teams in Boston in  
1974 and 1976, was with five other teams during his 16-year playing 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	He coached the San Diego Clippers from 1980-83, compiling a  
78-168 mark. Silas was an assistant with New Jersey, New York and 
Phoenix before joining the Hornets in 1997. He interviewed last 
summer for head-coaching vacancies in Chicago, Sacramento and 
Seattle, but wasn't offered any of the jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a difficult position to be in,'' he said as he left  
the training center Sunday night, five hours after Cowens quit. 
``But if you're called upon, then I think you have to accept it for 
the good of the organization, for the good of the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Point guard B.J. Armstrong said the coaching change could give  
the team a fresh start. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think throughout all of this something positive will happen,  
because this is one less thing for us to be concerned about,'' he 
said.

<HEADLINE>  Qatar Holds Local Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DOHA, Qatar (AP) -- Men in flowing white Arab robes and veiled  
women covered in black lined up today to vote in Qatar's municipal 
elections, the oil-rich emirate's first taste of democracy that is 
being closely watched throughout the Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the 29-member Municipality Council being elected will  
only have advisory powers, the vote is a landmark in this 
conservative region where open franchise is rare. The vote is also 
giving women a unique opportunity to vote and run for office. 
</P>
<P>
	Qataris, among the richest people in the region, drove in luxury  
cars to polling stations -- school buildings and white tents with 
multicolored interiors where free Arabic coffee was served. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the first time I am able to ask for something. This means  
freedom and democracy, which is new for us. We were always dreaming 
of such a day,'' said Ahmed al-Muftah, 59, outside a polling tent 
in District 10 in southern Doha. 
</P>
<P>
	A group of 20 women encased in black cloth from head to  
fingertips to toes trooped into the tent, divided into separate 
sections for men and women in keeping with Islamic traditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Sue Kelly, R-N.Y., who is observing the elections, said the  
coming together of Islamic customs and democracy was ``marvelous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Consider, this a nation where women are covered, yet given the  
opportunity to have a free democratic elections ... it means 
democracy,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Observers from eight other countries, including Britain and  
France, were also monitoring the polls. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 23,000 voters out of 150,000 citizens, are eligible to vote  
for the council that will represent 29 districts of Qatar. 
</P>
<P>
	The low voter turnout was because many Qatari men are members of  
the army and police, which makes them ineligible to vote by law. 
Also ineligible are those who have been citizens for less than 15 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Six women were among the 248 candidates.  
</P>
<P>
	Moza al-Malki, 41, a columnist and psychology professor, stands  
out as the only woman candidate who does not wear the traditional 
Muslim veil. 
</P>
<P>
	The role of women in the elections is a first for the Gulf  
region. Kuwait, the only Gulf state that has an elected parliament, 
does not allow women to vote or run for office. Oman's consultative 
council has two female members, but the body is indirectly elected. 
</P>
<P>
	Qatar has not held democratic elections since independence from  
Britain in 1971. Monday's elections are a first step toward an 
elected legislature that is expected to be set up early in the next 
century. 
</P>
<P>
	The reforms spring from the vision of Emir Sheik Hamad bin  
Khalifa Al Thani, a liberal monarch who since taking power in 1995 
has introduced a provisional constitution and lifted media 
censorship.

<HEADLINE> Man Shoots, Kills Dad at Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A man whose parents brought him to a  
hospital for treatment of emotional problems fatally shot his 
father outside the emergency room and wounded a janitor, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Bradford, 48, was arrested following the Sunday shooting  
at the University of California, San Francisco Mount Zion Medical 
Center, said homicide Inspector Joseph Toomey. 
</P>
<P>
	The man's 85-year-old father, Jerome Bradford, was rushed to the  
operating room but died about an hour later. The janitor, whose 
name was not available Sunday, was in stable condition with a leg 
wound. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm pretty upset that it happened in the hospital,'' said Dr.  
Michael Bogner, who was in the emergency room when the shooting 
occurred. ``I don't know how it could have been prevented.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police refused to discuss a motive.  
</P>
<P>
	Toomey said a hospital security guard noticed that Larry  
Bradford was holding a handgun and told him to put it away before 
calling 911. The man fired while the guard was on the telephone. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Bogner, Jerome Bradford and his wife had brought  
their son to the hospital for treatment for emotional problems. He 
was taken into police custody after the shooting.

<HEADLINE> One Devil of a Game for Florida A&AMP;M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- With his team about to clinch its first  
trip to the NCAA tournament, Florida A&AMP;M coach Mickey Clayton had 
something else on his mind -- getting his brother to put down a 
sign. 
</P>
<P>
	There he was, Craig Clayton, standing in a crowd of Rattlers  
fans at the Mid-Eastern Conference tournament, waving a sign for a 
national TV audience that said, ``We Want Duke.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The coach's jaw almost hit the floor.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's been in a mental asylum most of his life,'' Clayton said,  
joking. ``He had just been released for the game, and he went right 
back at midnight. I said, 'What's wrong with you, boy? We want to 
go and advance, but we don't want Duke.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Alas, Duke is what Florida A&AMP;M got.  
</P>
<P>
	Meet the Rattlers (12-18), your 1999 NCAA tournament feel-good  
story, one that will probably end Friday when they play the 
nation's best team. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida A&AMP;M lost its first 10 games of the season and was 1-13  
at one point. Four players were sidelined with injuries, leaving 
the team with only nine. Clayton nearly missed his flight to the 
MEAC tournament in Richmond, Va., because he was in a car accident 
on his way to the airport. 
</P>
<P>
	But somehow, the Rattlers knocked off the conference's top three  
teams, edging first-place South Carolina State in Saturday's 
tournament final. 
</P>
<P>
	Next up is a first-round date with the Blue Devils in Charlotte,  
N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Some say Duke is the best team ever to appear in the tournament.  
Some say Florida A&AMP;M is the worst. At least one oddsmaker had the 
spread at 47 points Monday, one of the highest ever. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's talk about David and Goliath, and the only thing we  
can do is carry big rocks,'' Clayton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've heard it'll be the largest margin of victory ever in an  
NCAA tournament game. That puts a lot of pressure on Duke,'' 
Clayton said. ``If the game is even allowed to be close, people 
will wonder what happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With most of the students out of town for spring break, word  
spread slowly about the Rattlers. Few fans greeted the team at the 
airport upon its return from Richmond. 
</P>
<P>
	But when the tournament brackets appeared in Monday newspapers,  
Clayton's office was inundated with calls. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have a secretary, so when they call, the next voice  
they hear is mine,'' said a tired-looking Clayton, adding he hasn't 
slept since Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The team held its first NCAA practice Monday, and some of the  
players wondered whether the Blue Devils were doing the same. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do you think Duke has got game tape on us?'' wondered  
sophomore point guard Morris Scott, who ranks sixth in the NCAA 
with 90 steals. 
</P>
<P>
	Monroe Pippins, the outstanding player of the MEAC tournament,  
said he has always followed coach Mike Krzyzewski and the Blue 
Devils. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love Duke,'' Pippins said. ``I've been a Duke fan since I  
was 5 years old. I have a lot of respect for Coach K., but he 
probably doesn't know who the hell I am.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gaither Gymnasium, where the Rattlers play, isn't any larger  
than a typical high school gym. Some of the dusty wooden bleachers 
are beginning to split, and before practice, an assistant coach 
sweeps the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	The players had to practice without water bottles Monday because  
someone had broken the door to the equipment locker and they 
couldn't open it. 
</P>
<P>
	Clayton calls his nine active players the ``Noble Nine.'' Since  
the team's equipment manager also was recently injured, the 
Rattlers don't even have enough for a full scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
	Sports has never been the top priority for this historically  
black school, which is perhaps most famous for its ``Marching 100'' 
band. The coach said the college graduated more black students than 
any other school last year, and eight of the nine basketball 
players are members of the honor roll. 
</P>
<P>
	Clayton sees the athletic success as a bonus.  
</P>
<P>
	``Your athletic department is basically your PR department for  
you institution,'' said Clayton, a third-generation alumnus who 
played for the Rattlers in the 1970s and coached the women's team 
before taking over the men's program in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The players aren't under any illusions. They know not a single  
No. 1 seed has ever lost to a No. 16 seed in the first round. They 
know Duke is one of the deepest teams around, and Florida A&AMP;M has 
only nine players. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Rattlers are playing to win -- even though their coach  
says he would be just as satisfied with a full-effort loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anything's possible,'' Scott said. ``We're all athletes. We  
wake up, put on our clothes, eat. They're not cyber-athletes or 
something like that.''

<HEADLINE> Economists Endorse Clinton Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A group of 100 prominent economists including  
six Nobel Prize winners came out Monday in support of President 
Clinton's plan to use future surpluses to reduce the national debt, 
arguing it would add billions of dollars to economic growth in 
coming years. 
</P>
<P>
	But a separate group of conservative economists denounced  
Clinton's budget as ``outrageous and misleading'' and warned that 
the president is relying on the ``mirage of a surplus'' to escape 
making fundamental reforms to the Social Security program. 
</P>
<P>
	The group of economists supporting the Clinton plan said that  
the president was right to dedicate the bulk of $4.4 trillion in 
projected surpluses over the next 15 years to reducing the $3.7 
trillion in national debt held by the public. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton touts his plan as shoring up the Social Security system  
-- which he would accomplish by paying down the national debt, 
reducing interest payments on that debt and thus putting the 
government in better shape to meet the demands that will come when 
the baby boomers retire. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will free up trillions in the hands of private investors  
who will be able to lend the money to businesses for investment in 
new plant and equipment,'' said a statement from Economists for 
Increased National Savings. 
</P>
<P>
	The group said that cutting the amount of debt held by the  
public from the current 44 percent of the total economy down to 7 
percent by 2014 would make more money available for businesses to 
borrow for productive investments. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Solow, one of the Nobel winners who signed the statement,  
told reporters that this increased productivity could translate 
into overall economic growth that would be 0.2 percent to 0.3 
percent higher annually, meaning an economy that would be 3 percent 
to 5 percent larger by 2015. 
</P>
<P>
	Solow said economists generally agree that one of the most  
important things the government can do to boost productivity is 
find ways to increase national savings. He said he and fellow Nobel 
winner James Tobin have been promoting such ideas since the early 
1960s during the Kennedy administration. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a debate about liberal versus conservative  
policies, but a debate about reducing the national debt,'' said 
Alicia Munnell, a former member of Clinton's Council of Economic 
Advisers and now a professor at Boston University. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the Republicans in Congress and Clinton are pledging to use  
about two-thirds of coming surpluses to lower the national debt as 
a way of putting Social Security on a sounder financial footing for 
the retirement of baby boomers. But the two sides are widely split 
on exactly how to accomplish this and what to do with the remaining 
one-third of the surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, a group of conservative economists on Monday  
released a critical review of Clinton's budget, calling it an 
``outrageous and misleading document.'' The conservative economists 
questioned how Clinton could discuss surpluses at a time when 
Social Security was facing trillions of dollars in unfunded 
liabilities that will come due when baby boomers start retiring. 
</P>
<P>
	``The mirage of a surplus ignores the entire unfunded liability  
for promises that the government has made to current and future 
Social Security recipients,'' the conservative economists said. 
</P>
<P>
	Allan Meltzer, an economist at Carnegie Mellon University and  
chairman of the panel, said that it would make more sense to use 
any surpluses that do materialize to cut taxes in ways that would 
foster increased investment as a way of promoting higher economic 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
	The conservative group, known as the Shadow Open Market  
Committee, meets twice a year to critique federal economic policies 
and the handling of monetary affairs by the Federal Reserve. 
</P>
<P>
	On the question of Fed policy, the group as it has for the past  
year said the central bank was failing to heed warning signs that 
the nation's money supply is growing too rapidly and thus sowing 
the seeds for future inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	It urged the Fed to quickly reverse course and start raising  
rates, something that many private economists believe is unlikely 
for some months to come given the fragility of the global economy. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Solow and Tobin, other Nobel winners who signed  
the statement supporting Clinton's surplus plan were Kenneth Arrow, 
Lawrence Klein, Paul Samuelson and Franco Modigliani. The 
predominantly liberal group of economists included many top policy 
makers from past Democratic administrations.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Presidents Attract Nicknames </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A nickname, says the proverb, is ``the  
heaviest stone the devil can throw at a man.'' Some wound and leave 
scars. Some stick like burrs. Others fall away and are forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
	American presidents have attracted and endured nicknames ever  
since George Washington was called the ``Sword of the Revolution,'' 
``Father of His Country,'' the ``Sage of Mount Vernon'' and, 
interestingly, ``The Old Fox.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton will probably never entirely shed ``Slick  
Willie,'' a nickname draped on him by an Arkansas newspaper writer 
years before he reached Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	But ``the Comeback Kid,'' the title Clinton awarded himself  
after finishing a surprising second in the 1992 New Hampshire 
primary, is likely to be equally enduring. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a title Clinton retains -- for his two presidential  
victories, his tiptoeing through the land mines of scandal and his 
acquittal in a Senate impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clinton seemed plainly to be relishing the symbolism of the  
Comeback Kid coming back again,'' The Washington Post's John Harris 
observed last month as he described Clinton's post-impeachment 
swing through New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	Presidential nicknames have been piling up for two centuries.  
Five presidents were called ``accidental'' or ``his accidency,'' 
because they gained office either by the death of the president 
they served as vice president or through other less than usual 
circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
	Many presidential nicknames were plainly sarcastic.  
</P>
<P>
	When John Adams insisted that Congress call President Washington  
``His Highness,'' some senators, snickering behind their hands, 
dubbed Adams ``His Rotundity'' 
</P>
<P>
	William Henry Harrison was a ``Log Cabin candidate'' before  
Abraham Lincoln but was also widely known as ``Tippecanoe,'' after 
his 1811 victory on a battlefield of the Indian Wars. 
</P>
<P>
	Many people thought of Martin Van Buren as sly and ``foxy,''  
``the Little Magician.'' But finally, to his political foes he was 
little Van, ``the used-up man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Jackson was ``Old Hickory'' for the tree so hard it  
resisted nails. Some Americans, trying to recycle the title, called 
James Polk ``Young Hickory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zachary Taylor is still known as ``Old Rough and Ready,'' a  
reputation earned during the 1848 war with Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Theodore Roosevelt will always be a ``Rough Rider,'' even though  
his cavalry regiment had no horses with them when they captured San 
Juan Hill. The president detested ``Teddy,'' even though he had 
been called ``Teedy'' as a boy. 
</P>
<P>
	Lincoln survived many nickname salvos: tyrant, dictator,  
destroyer of liberty, ``Black Republican,'' ``the Illinois 
Baboon,'' ``the Original Gorilla.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ``railsplitter's'' defenders, of course, could fire back  
with ``Honest Abe,'' ``Father Abraham'' and ``The Great 
Emancipator.'' Lincoln's secretaries had their own nicknames for 
the commander in chief -- ``The Ancient'' and ``The Tycoon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the 20th century, Americans remember the monosyllabic Calvin  
Coolidge as ``Silent Cal,'' and Franklin Roosevelt, the first of 
the alphabet presidents, as plain old FDR. To those who could not 
bear to speak his name, Roosevelt was ``that man in the White 
House.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dwight Eisenhower was ``Ike'' and President Truman was ``Give  
'em Hell Harry.'' Gerald R. Ford was just ``Jerry'' and John F. 
Kennedy was ``Jack'' or ``JFK.'' But Jimmy Carter became the first 
president to insist on using the diminutive form of his name at all 
times. He was ``Jimmy'' from back-lot barbecues to state dinners. 
</P>
<P>
	``Slick Willie'' by the way, has a somewhat shaky precedent. One  
of the more obscure nicknames thrown at William McKinley, the 
century's first president, was ``Wobbly Willie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In more recent times, Lyndon Johnson branded himself and  
everything near him LBJ. He was dubbed ``Landslide Lyndon'' for the 
thin and contested margin by which he won his first Senate seat. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Nixon endured ``Tricky Dick'' for much of his political  
career. 
</P>
<P>
	Ronald Reagan, ``Dutch'' to his oldest friends, fared better as  
``the Great Communicator.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Diet Guidelines May Add Food Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration urged a federal  
panel Monday to add food safety tips to the widely-used dietary 
guidelines, saying that after years of advising Americans on what 
to eat, it is time to teach them how to handle their food. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe the time has come to include food safety in the  
guidelines,'' said Catherine Woteki, the Agriculture Department's 
undersecretary for food safety. ``Government has an obligation to 
help people protect themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woteki's comments came during a meeting of an advisory committee  
reviewing the ``Dietary Guidelines for Americans.'' The guidelines, 
last altered in 1995, are reviewed every five years for changes. 
The panel will issue a report later this year with revisions for 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The guidelines include advice such as choosing a diet with  
plenty of grain products, vegetables and fruits as well as eating a 
diet low in fat, saturated fat and cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
	The guidelines have never included food safety information, but  
times and dangers have changed since the early 1980s when the 
guidelines began, Woteki said. She declined to recommend particular 
guidelines but said they might include advice on appropriate 
temperatures to store food or how to avoid mixing raw chicken with 
vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
	``Food safety is a critical factor in any discussion about diet  
and long-term health,'' Woteki said. ``New pathogens have emerged 
just in the last decade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just in the last few months, consumers have witnessed numerous  
recalls of food products due to contamination with the bacteria, 
listera monocytogenes. A large recall in December by the Bil Mar 
Foods plant in Zeeland, Mich., has even been linked to an outbreak 
that has resulted in at least 14 deaths, six miscarriages and 97 
illnesses across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration already has support among some nutritionists,  
including the American Dietetic Association. ``Given the scope of 
consumer concerns about food safety, ADA urges the committee to 
consider adding food safety messages in an informative but not 
alarming way,'' Kathryn M. Carroll, senior nutrition scientist for 
the ADA, told the panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Cutberto Garza, who serves as chairman of the advisory  
panel, said the committee would take the request ``very 
seriously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Food-borne illnesses cost society between $6.6 billion and $37  
billion annually in medical costs and lost productivity, Woteki 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are food-borne illnesses associated with virtually every  
category of food,'' Woteki said, noting that while meat and poultry 
are the largest contributors, other foods also carry pathogens. 
</P>
<P>
	``Education is a very important component in this strategy,''  
she said. ``Consumers need to know what they can do to protect 
themselves.''

<HEADLINE> Educators Watch School Bill Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As a popular bill designed to loosen federal  
strings on education continues to test the bipartisanship of a 
post-impeachment Congress, many educators said they're worried the 
dispute will leave them grappling with too many kids per class and 
restrictive rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans failed Monday evening in their attempt to limit the  
number of proposals that can be attached to the so-called 
``ed-flex'' bill, which gives states more flexibility in spending 
federal education dollars. Democrats want the chance to vote on 
amendments including new money to pay for new teachers and reduce 
class size. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, debate on the bill got emotional, with Republicans  
getting frustrated with Democrats' attempts to add other measures 
to the bill. There was talk of Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott 
pulling the bill from consideration, but Senate Health, Education, 
Labor and Pensions Committee Chairman Jim Jeffords of Vermont said 
the bill was likely to last the week, adding ``we want to work out 
a compromise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton called on Congress to allow a straight vote on  
the Democrats' plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``The American people expect us to work together to improve the  
education of our students,'' Clinton said in a statement from 
Nicaragua, where he was traveling. ``I call on the Republican 
leadership to allow an up-or-down vote on more teachers and smaller 
classes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans will try again to limit debate on the bill Tuesday.  
If that fails, they'll try to water down the Democrats' class-size 
proposal by giving states the option to spend the new money for 
teachers on special education. 
</P>
<P>
	In Pennsylvania, state officials are eager to see the  
``ed-flex'' bill approved as they face school districts that want 
to use federal money to train more reading teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	``They believe they've tackled the issue of math and science,''  
said Ron Tomalis of Pennsylvania's education department. ``But the 
federal regulations don't allow them the flexibility to address the 
needs of their kids. To us, this is a common sense way of looking 
at the delivery of education to our kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republican Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge said many educators are  
frustrated that the bill, which started out popular and with wide 
bipartisan support, has become embroiled in partisan battles. 
</P>
<P>
	``The opportunity to give more flexibility to the states will be  
imperiled if not lost if they keep playing politics,'' Ridge said 
in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Ever since education emerged as a key issue in last November's  
congressional elections, lawmakers have been scrambling to take 
credit for action on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``This bill is simply being held hostage by politics,'' said  
Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H. ``After someone goes out and takes another 
poll or does another focus group, I imagine we'll have more 
proposals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Democrats say the haggling is actually a referendum on their  
proposals to reduce class size and hire new teachers -- not simply a 
disagreement on congressional procedure. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have offered as many different innovative ways with which to  
break this impasse as I can think of, short of just caving and 
giving up all of our rights as senators to offer education 
amendments on an education bill,'' said Democratic Senate leader 
Thomas Daschle of South Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic amendments include a plan that would add to a  
$1.2 billion program passed last year to help the nation's school 
districts hire thousands of new teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans have resisted putting issues such as the class size  
proposal into the ``ed-flex'' bill, saying they should be saved for 
later this year when when Congress begins debating the 
reauthorization of another major education bill -- the Elementary 
and Secondary Education Act. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gayle Yeska, whose Iowa school district just predicted the  
layoffs of 102 of its 1,000 teachers, is focused on class size. The 
layoffs make the high-school French teacher sure that class sizes 
will grow beyond the 32 students per class that many of her 
colleagues face. 
</P>
<P>
	``Education is too important to become a political football,''  
Yeska said. 

</P>
<P>
	--------------

	The bill number is S. 280

	Joe DiMaggio Dies  
</P>
<P>
	HOLLYWOOD, Fla. (AP) -- Baseball Hall of Famer Joe DiMaggio died  
today at age 84. The former New York Yankees star, whose 56-game 
hitting streak is one of the most enduring records in baseball, had 
lung cancer surgery last October and had several postoperative 
infections that nearly killed him. Morris Engelberg, DiMaggio's 
long-time friend and attorney, said the star centerfielder died at 
his home shortly after midnight. DiMaggio's hospital stay was 
marred by several premature reports of his death, including a TV 
bulletin he watched announcing his demise. He was discharged from a 
hospital in January and doctors said he was making great progress.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton embarks today on his  
four-day, four-nation mission to Central America just as 15,000 
Guatemalans and Salvadorans illegally in the United States become 
eligible for deportation. Clinton turned down pleas for an 
extension of the halt in deportations that was instituted after the 
devastation of Hurricane Mitch last fall. Clinton will start with a 
survey of damage done by Hurricane Mitch to a Nicaraguan town. The 
president will see the spot where last October a mudslide swept 
away a pair of villages, killing about 2,000 people.

	LONDON (AP) -- Overwhelmed by the crush of media attention,  
Monica Lewinsky today temporarily fled the first stop on her 
two-week book tour of Britain after signing only a few copies of 
``Monica's Story.'' Ms. Lewinsky seemed unprepared for the hundreds 
of photographers yelling and shouting her name in the book 
department of the landmark London department store Harrods. ``I 
said to her `Welcome and good luck' but she was shaking. She was so 
scared, the poor girl,'' said Frankie Ruberg, a customer who passed 
Ms. Lewinsky as she made her way to the signing area. The 90-minute

the growing battle over a trade dispute involving bananas. The EU 
is complaining about proposed U.S. tariffs on some imported 
European goods. But U.S. officials say the sanctions are designed 
to try and change import policies that American banana sellers say 
squeeze them out of the European market. The WTO today summoned all

elections, the Shiite Muslim group's leader was quoted today as 
saying. Sheik Hassan Nasrallah also told the leftist As-Safir 
newspaper that Hezbollah would not go along with any amendments to 
a 1996 U.S.-brokered understanding barring Israel and Lebanese 
guerrillas from attacking civilian areas or launching attacks from 
them. The hard-line Hezbollah stance came amid reports that Martin 
Indyk, a U.S. assistant secretary of state, would visit Lebanon

	Report: Birth Pain Payments Halted  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The federal government has ordered doctors and  
hospitals to stop demanding cash payments from poor women for the 
epidural injection to relieve pain in childbirth, The New York 
Times reported today. Medicaid patients may not be charged for some 
medical services related to pregnancy and Medicaid reimburses 
doctors and hospitals. But doctors say the reimbursements for pain 
relief treatment are woefully small. Patients unable to pay cash 
for the epidural injection, which blocks pain in the lower part of 
the body, often were offered weaker forms of pain relief.

<HEADLINE> DiMaggio Wasn't Fond of Lyric </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -- Simon &AMP; Garfunkel could sing what  
they wanted, but Joe DiMaggio didn't especially like it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know why they said that. Where did they think I've  
gone? I'm right here,'' DiMaggio would say when someone played 
``Mrs. Robinson'' on the jukebox at The Irish Pub. 
</P>
<P>
	``But he understood it was the America he represented and the  
sport he represented, that it was Joe DiMaggio as a metaphor,'' 
said Cathy Burke, co-owner of the pub and a longtime DiMaggio 
friend. 
</P>
<P>
	Burke and her husband Richard, who met DiMaggio through a mutual  
friend 15 years ago, frequently hosted him in their New York and 
Atlantic City apartments. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Burke recalled DiMaggio as gracious, thoughtful and  
respectful of the fans who loved him. 
</P>
<P>
	``He felt a responsibility to the public because he was Joe  
DiMaggio,'' she said Monday. ``People looked up to him and he would 
never do anything he felt would hurt his public. We've been with 
him so many times when people would ask for autographs or say 
hello. I've never seen him decline, even though there were times 
people really overstepped the line. 
</P>
<P>
	``One time, at dinner, someone came up to him with 12 baseballs.  
He sat and he signed every one of them,'' Mrs. Burke said. 
</P>
<P>
	On his visits to New York, DiMaggio would stay at the couple's  
Fifth Avenue co-op. 
</P>
<P>
	Last April, the three were planning a quiet evening to celebrate  
Mrs. Burke's birthday when the telephone rang. It was Woody Allen's 
assistant, saying Allen wanted to take DiMaggio out to dinner. 
Deferential to his hosts, DiMaggio said no. He had plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Then Allen's assistant called back. Would they all like to go  
out to dinner? DiMaggio asked Mrs. Burke, she said yes, and all 
three joined Allen, Soon-Yi Previn and two other friends for dinner 
at Elaine's, the trendy Manhattan bistro. 
</P>
<P>
	When DiMaggio came to Atlantic City for an autograph show or a  
boxing match he would stay in the Burkes' apartment above the Pub, 
eating homemade chicken soup with garbanzo beans and drinking root 
beer. 
</P>
<P>
	``He loved Atlantic City. He liked to go up on the Boardwalk and  
he loved the fights,'' Mrs. Burke said. 
</P>
<P>
	There was the time that Mrs. Burke, walking through the Pub's  
dining room, overheard a group of fans arguing about who was 
baseball's greatest player. ``I heard one of them say, `If I ever 
met Joe DiMaggio, I would faint dead away.' Well, Joe was upstairs 
at the time. I just couldn't resist the moment,'' Mrs. Burke said. 
</P>
<P>
	She led the five upstairs without telling them why, then told  
them to wait in an anteroom. After clearing it with DiMaggio, she 
brought them into the apartment, where DiMaggio sat watching a John 
Wayne movie. 
</P>
<P>
	``You should've seen the looks on their faces,'' Mrs. Burke  
said. He sat with them for 45 minutes, just talking. It was vintage 
DiMaggio. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there was the time a group of MTV producers in their 20s  
and 30s were in town in 1989 and DiMaggio happened to be in the 
Pub. ``They said, `Mr. DiMaggio, can we take your picture?' This is 
the greatest honor we've ever had.' Despite their age, they 
responded to him like they would to a rock star,'' Mrs. Burke said. 
</P>
<P>
	Early Monday, Mrs. Burke got a telephone call from a DiMaggio  
friend in Florida. Joltin' Joe had -- finally -- left and gone away. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're devastated,'' Mrs. Burke said, wiping away tears. ``The  
country has lost a hero, but it's a great personal loss, too. We 
knew he was ill, but it's always too soon. It's always too soon.''

<HEADLINE> Johnson Returns to Orioles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- As he looked across the diamond at  
the team he took to the playoffs in successive seasons, Davey 
Johnson couldn't help thinking what might have been. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, who resigned as the Baltimore Orioles manager during a  
feud with owner Peter Angelos after the 1997 season, greeted his 
former players and coaches with handshakes and hugs Monday in his 
new role as manager of the Los Angeles Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not just another game. I have sentimental feelings about  
today,'' he said before the teams played an exhibition game. 
</P>
<P>
	Dressed in Dodger Blue, Johnson said he experienced ``mixed  
emotions'' at seeing the Orioles for the first time since his 
departure in November 1997 after two straight appearances in the AL 
championship series. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's where I learned to play the game, in the city of  
Baltimore,'' he said. ``I had a lot of friends there. I thought 
they had a chance to do something special last year, take it a step 
further. It didn't give me any satisfaction at all seeing them have 
a rough season last year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, who broke into the majors as a second baseman with  
Baltimore, took what he described at the time as his ``dream job'' 
when he became manager of the Orioles. He took the Orioles to the 
AL championship series in 1996 and 1997, but Baltimore never made 
it to the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles lost to the New York Yankees in the '96 playoffs, a  
series best remembered for a play in which a young fan reached over 
the wall at Yankee Stadium to take away a certain catch from 
outfielder Tony Tarasco. The Cleveland Indians eliminated the 
Orioles the following year when Tony Fernandez homered off Armando 
Benitez in Game 6. 
</P>
<P>
	A few weeks after that, Johnson sent a fax to Angelos asking for  
a contract extension and threatened to resign if the situation 
wasn't rectified. On the day Johnson was voted AL manager of the 
year, Angelos accepted the resignation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I only have good feelings about my time with the Orioles,''  
Johnson said. ``Mr. Angelos brought me back there, and for that I 
will be forever indebted. I know what he expected; we just fell 
short. Who knows? If that 12-year-old didn't reach over the wall 
and Benitez didn't hang a slider, I might still be over there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson spent last season as an assistant in Japan, watching  
baseball on TV and playing golf. The Orioles, meanwhile, didn't 
even reach .500 under manager Ray Miller, Johnson's pitching coach 
in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``I called him the day he resigned and tried to talk him out of  
it,'' Miller said. ``I think he's arguably the best in the game if 
you want to go by winning percentage. He deserves all the 
accolades. I have a lot of respect for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson gladly gave up the life of leisure when Dodgers general  
manager Kevin Malone, the Orioles' assistant GM during Johnson's 
reign, hired him to manage in Los Angeles. Malone was also at 
Monday's game, which the Orioles won 10-0. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't as bad as it looked,'' Johnson said with a sheepish  
grin.

<HEADLINE>  Gwynn's Hit Parade Nears 3,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEORIA, Ariz. (AP) -- If Tony Gwynn could script his 3,000th hit,  
it would come at home in front of a packed house. Camera flashes 
would be going off all over the stadium, sort of like when Mark 
McGwire and Sammy Sosa stepped to the plate last season. 
</P>
<P>
	The only difference is, Gwynn wants the ball to stay in the  
yard. He wants to get it back and doesn't want to have to pay for 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	He'd be more than content with a nice little grounder to his  
favorite spot -- between shortstop and third base, or the ``5.5 
hole,'' as he calls it. 
</P>
<P>
	``A base hit for me would be, I think, textbook, because it's  
what I've done pretty much through my whole career,'' said the San 
Diego Padres batting star, who enters the season 72 hits from the 
milestone. 
</P>
<P>
	Going the opposite way means the left-hander is dialed in, which  
he wasn't for a good deal of 1998. He still hit .321, an average 
that most major leaguers would kill for, but it was the first time 
in six seasons that he hit lower than .353. And it was a dropoff of 
51 points from 1997, when he hit .372 to win his fourth straight NL 
batting title, and eighth overall. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn went through a couple of 0-for-14 slumps, tying the worst  
of his career, then saw one drag on to 0-for-19. Just as he was 
pulling out of an 8-for-52 slump, he went on the disabled list with 
an Achilles' injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was inconsistent last year,'' Gwynn said. ``There were  
periods when my mechanics were just terrible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	How does a guy who's topped .300 for 16 straight seasons  
struggle? 
</P>
<P>
	``I tell you what, I did not know,'' said Gwynn, a lifetime .339  
hitter who suffered along with the rest of the Padres' offense for 
most of the year, relying on the pitching staff to help carry the 
team to the World Series. ``We would be wracking our brains 
wondering what the hell was going on. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't care how many years you hit .300, how many things  
you've done on the offensive end, if you're in the middle of the 
rut, it's hard, man, it's hard to get out because you just don't 
think you can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn finally did in the World Series, but by then, he was one  
of the few Padres on his game. He hit .500, going 8-for-16, and 
homered off David Wells in the opener at Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was really the best run I had of the last two months,''  
Gwynn said. ``So the postseason did a lot for my confidence, 
because I was doing exactly what I wanted to do. They came in, I'd 
let it go. If they were going away, I'd carve it to left. I hope I 
can back to doing that. But mentally, man, I was beat up at the 
end. I couldn't understand why I was sucking gas like I was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Batting coach Merv Rettenmund said Gwynn pulled the ball a lot  
in batting practice last year instead of hitting it crisply to 
left. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was not one of his most consistent years here,''  
Rettenmund said. ``That's tough to say when someone hits whatever 
he hits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn turns 39 on May 9, a few weeks before he hopes to get his  
3,000th hit. He said he worked hard during the winter, watching 
tape, hitting in the cage, hitting off a tee. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was unbelievable,'' Rettenmund said. ``He hit every day. I  
bet he hit twice on some days. There's no one who hits 300, 320 
days a year. That's why he's what he is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And there's a reason Gwynn swings for that spot between third  
and short. 
</P>
<P>
	``Early on in my career, I could run, I could really run,'' he  
said. ``I knew if I could make that shortstop go in that hole to 
get it, he couldn't throw me out. And then as I got older, it was 
like hey, I've got to get it through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn has a little patch with ``5.5 hole'' sewn on the tongue of  
his shoes. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I've stepped up to the plate, I've had catchers say `Hey,  
T, what's the 5.5 hole?' and I say, `Hold on a few minutes and 
you'll see.' That's where I made my living, on the left side. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still have it put on my shoes, but last year I just  
completely got away from it. I didn't execute. This spring I'm 
trying to get back to doing that.''

<HEADLINE> FTC, Intel Reach Proposed Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Intel Corp. and the Federal Trade Commission  
said today they have agreed to a proposed settlement over 
government charges that the nation's largest computer chipmaker 
illegally bullied three other companies into handing over secret 
information about their products. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel and the FTC announced the settlement on the eve of the  
company's antitrust hearing before an administrative law judge in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The company and the FTC jointly filed a motion to withdraw the  
government charges that were filed June 8, said FTC spokeswoman 
Michelle Muth. She could not discuss details of the settlement, 
which must be approved by commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
	That approval is expected within two weeks. It would be highly  
unusual for commissioners to reject a recommended settlement from 
the agency's own Bureau of Competition. They could approve the 
settlement during a formal meeting or they could circulate it for 
signatures. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel also declined to talk about the settlement's contents.  
</P>
<P>
	The FTC's statement described ``remaining issues under  
investigation,'' a veiled reference to what's widely believed to be 
a much broader antitrust probe of Intel's business behavior in the 
nation's technology industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``We continue to cooperate with them on that as they continue to  
request documents,'' Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy said, adding that 
the pending settlement agreement was related only to the June 8 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency said its lawyers were ``committed to working  
expeditiously to resolve those concerns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a much broader case the FTC can bring and may bring in  
the future,'' said Steve Newborn, a Washington lawyer who 
represents some of Intel's competitors and has argued for a broader 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Newborn said he wasn't surprised to see the settlement proposed,  
citing the Justice Department's ongoing antitrust case against 
Microsoft Corp., which has faced embarrassing disclosures in the 
courtroom from its internal e-mails and from testimony by some of 
its own executives. 
</P>
<P>
	``They saw what's happened to Microsoft and they didn't want to  
go through that,'' Newborn said. ``I've never thought Intel was 
stupid enough to go to trial in this case. On a simple cost-benefit 
analysis, there was no reason for Intel to be fighting this 
fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the news, Intel stock jumped 3.5 percent, rising $4 to  
$118.62 1/2 a share this morning on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel and the FTC signed the settlement proposal Sunday  
afternoon after telephone negotiations led by Peter Detkin, the 
company's assistant general counsel. 
</P>
<P>
	``The opposition's case has become more and more apparent to the  
other side,'' Mulloy said. ``A few weeks ago, it became apparent 
there was an opening there for discussion, things started falling 
into place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Intel, the world's largest manufacturer of microprocessors, had  
already acknowledged it did most of what the FTC alleged, but the 
company claimed that those actions were not illegal and that its 
business practices had not ``chilled'' innovation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We view this compromise agreement as a 'win-win' for both  
parties and we are satisfied that the agreement gives us value for 
our intellectual property rights. This is acceptable to both 
parties and was the result of constructive dialogue between Intel 
and the FTC,'' said Craig Barrett, president and chief executive 
officer of Intel. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC had alleged that Intel illegally withheld from three  
companies advanced technical information about its upcoming 
microprocessors to ``extort'' valuable technology that the 
companies had developed independently. 
</P>
<P>
	It called the company's actions ``a raw exercise of monopoly  
power to muscle competitors into signing over intellectual property 
rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Intel contended it is legal for the company to decide what  
secrets to disclose to its customers about its upcoming products. 
The company makes processors for more than 80 percent of the 
world's computers and recently introduced its fastest chip ever, 
the Pentium III. 
</P>
<P>
	The three companies allegedly bullied by Intel were Digital  
Equipment Corp., Intergraph Corp. and Compaq Computer Corp., which 
now owns Digital. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for Intergraph, Aggie Frizzell, said the company's  
executives were meeting today with FTC lawyers to discuss the 
proposed settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the legal issues in Intel's case were narrow, the FTC  
faced problems winning the case. 
</P>
<P>
	It filed its lawsuit during a period of unprecedented  
competition facing Intel from rival chipmakers, such as from 
Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and National Semiconductor Corp.

<HEADLINE> Colts Sign Backup QB Stoney Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Stoney Case, a backup quarterback the past  
four years with the Arizona Cardinals, signed with the Indianapolis 
Colts on Monday as an unrestricted free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the contract were not disclosed, although The  
Indianapolis Star reported last week that Case was offered a 
two-year, $2 million contract that included a $500,000 signing 
bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	Case, 26, is the fifth free agent and the first offensive player  
signed by the Colts since the free-agent signing period began on 
Feb. 12. He will remain a backup in Indianapolis, playing behind 
Peyton Manning. 
</P>
<P>
	Case, Arizona's third-round draft pick in 1995, has played in  
just four games, and his only career start was at Philadelphia in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	He told The Star, ``I understand Peyton is the man but you need  
more than one good quarterback. I know I can step in and do the job 
if something happens to Peyton.''

<HEADLINE> How White Pol Won Black Ward </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Determined to put more power in the hands of  
black voters, a federal court last summer redrew Chicago's ward 
boundaries. Tom Murphy winced when he got a look at the map. 
</P>
<P>
	``They had moved my house out of my ward,'' the veteran white  
alderman recalls. Soon, eight black rivals were running against him 
in the newly drawn ward, where eight voters in 10 were black. 
</P>
<P>
	But on election night last month, the 45-year-old Murphy was all  
smiles -- he had won, with considerable black support. 
</P>
<P>
	Civil rights forces seem disconcerted by Murphy's victory. But  
his supporters say it could signal an easing of racial tensions in 
Chicago, where roughly 40 percent of the city's 2.7 million people 
are black. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to get away from this color thing,'' says Roosevelt  
Hamilton, a 65-year-old federal retiree who says he won't vote for 
black candidates just because they are black and so is he. 
</P>
<P>
	``Alderman Murphy has done a lot for the 18th Ward. He has  
brought a library into our area. He has brought banks into our 
area. When we need to talk with him, he's Johnny on the spot. He 
gets the job done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Richard M. Daley also was re-elected Feb. 23, carrying  
several prdominantly black wards against Rep. Bobby Rush, a former 
Black Panther. Both results marked a sharp switch from the extreme 
racial polarization in the era of Harold Washington, Chicago's 
first black mayor. 
</P>
<P>
	White politicians have won in mostly minority Chicago areas  
before, usually where the racial makeup of a ward changed 
gradually. But Murphy won immediately after a redistricting aimed 
at getting a black elected. 
</P>
<P>
	Civil rights advocates, however, note that no black aldermen  
represent predominantly white wards on Chicago's 50-member City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
	``This thing is being romanticized,'' says political consultant  
and civil rights advocate Don Rose. 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy's ward was 54 percent black before the remap. Now, it's  
about 85 percent black. The east end is predominantly black; the 
west end blue-collar white ethnic. 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy won with 58 percent overall and claims his support among  
black voters topped 50 percent. Experts aren't so sure but agree 
that his black support was substantial. 
</P>
<P>
	``They couldn't have done it without significant support from  
the black community,'' says Loyola University political scientist 
John Pelissero. 
</P>
<P>
	The remap resolved a six-year court fight. Civil rights forces  
claimed that Chicago's ward boundaries discriminated in a way that 
gave black voters 19 black aldermen when the population figures 
would suggest 20. 
</P>
<P>
	What the civil rights forces didn't count on, though, was  
someone like Murphy, an eight-year veteran whose campaign slogan 
was ``He delivers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy runs his ward in old-fashioned machine style: public  
payroll jobs for precinct captains and ``community service 
representatives'' who fan out to befriend the voters with favors 
that pay off on Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday night, ward residents visit Murphy's office and,  
behind closed doors, he listens to their problems, godfather-style. 
</P>
<P>
	``They want to see that their streets get resurfaced, they want  
to see that the sidewalks get done on their block, they want to see 
that the schools in their neighborhood are being improved,'' he 
says. ``It can be anything from getting a tree cut down to having a 
car that's been left on the street towed to city employment. They 
come in looking for city jobs.''

	When Chicago was buried under a huge snowfall in January, Murphy  
fought to get every street in the ward plowed fast. Failure to do 
so has been known to cost Chicago officials their jobs, and 
Election Day was only weeks away. A black Murphy aide was pounding 
on doors, warning people to move their cars so they wouldn't get 
buried under newly plowed snow.

<P>
	``That's when you really have to produce,'' Murphy says. ``If  
you don't produce, then ...'' He draws his index finger across his 
throat.

<HEADLINE> Stanford Assistant New Coach at UNR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RENO, Nev. (AP) -- Stanford assistant Trent Johnson was named  
head basketball coach at the University of Nevada Monday on the 
strength of his West Coast recruiting ties and a pledge to build a 
winning program. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is very, very doable in terms of building a  
winner, building a program,'' Johnson, 42, said during a news 
conference on the Reno campus of the Big West Conference school. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been spoiled the last three years playing in late March.  
... And I'm not talking about the NIT,'' he said of the Stanford 
squad that has gone 78-19 in his three years as an assistant to 
Mike Montgomery. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said he'll remain with the Cardinal through the NCAA  
tournament, but will mix in some recruiting for the Wolfpack at his 
native Seattle this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson signed a 3-year contract worth about $125,000 a year,  
``with a commitment to extend two years,'' UNR athletic director 
Chris Ault said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ault said he wanted to make the announcement quickly to get some  
publicity during the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevada finished 8-18, 4-12 in the Big West this year, suffering  
through a nine-game losing streak and failing to qualify for the 
conference tournament it held in Reno last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Pat Foster, who announced his resignation with a few weeks  
remaining in the season, posted a 90-81 record in six years with 
the Wolfpack.

<HEADLINE> Yankee Pettitte's Injury Is Mild </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Andy Pettitte's injury is only a mild muscle  
strain, the New York Yankees learned Monday after tests showed no 
serious problems with the pitcher's left elbow. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never thought it was anything serious,'' Pettitte said. ``I  
was aggravated because I knew they would shut me down. It will be a 
long week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pettitte, the only left-hander in the Yankees' starting  
rotation, threw seven pitches in the first inning of Sunday's game 
against Minnesota, then left the game after throwing three warmup 
pitches prior to the second inning. 
</P>
<P>
	He first reported elbow tenderness Feb. 22 after a bullpen  
session and missed his first scheduled batting practice session. 
He's optimistic he'll be ready by opening day. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you could project, you would say he will probably be  
ready,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre said. ``Hopefully he'll be all 
right. We won't know until he pitches. If he's not ready for the 
opener, the most important thing is to get him back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pettitte knows he has some catching up to do.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'll be behind, but I'll be ready by the season,'' he said.  
``There's plenty of time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hideki Irabu, whose bullpen session Sunday was cut short by  
stiffness in his upper left back, reported improvement and will 
make his scheduled start Wednesday against Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel better. I didn't think it's was an injury,'' Irabu said  
through interpreter George Rose. ``It's just tightness from 
throwing for the first time. I'm pretty confident I can do what 
they want me to do.''

<HEADLINE> Sober Message at Movie Trade Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- The movie industry's biggest trade show kicked  
off Monday with a sober message from the head of the 20th Century 
Fox studio: Skyrocketing production costs and huge paychecks are 
threatening the industry even at a time of record box office 
grosses. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are in a time of great promise and yet we are perhaps faced  
with greater problems,'' Bill Mechanic, chairman and CEO of Fox 
Filmed Entertainment, told more than 600 movie theater operators 
and others. 
</P>
<P>
	Mechanic's remarks at the annual convention were particularly  
noteworthy since they came from the chief of the studio that 
co-produced ``Titanic,'' the most expensive movie in Hollywood 
history -- and the one with the highest box office grosses. Fox also 
is distributing what likely will be the biggest movie of the year, 
the ``Star Wars'' prequel. 
</P>
<P>
	Coping with the wild extremes in the movie business was the  
overriding theme at ShoWest, which runs through Thursday with 
seminars, sneak previews, an all-star awards show and a look at the 
biggest technological innovation in the industry since the movie 
projector: digital cinema. 
</P>
<P>
	The movie industry last year enjoyed record box office grosses  
and soaring attendance, the international market for Hollywood 
films is growing by leaps and bounds and a building boom has 
brought more -- and higher-quality -- movie houses. But these gains 
have been countered by higher production and marketing costs, and 
financial problems by small and medium-sized theater chains. 
</P>
<P>
	Mechanic quoted Charles Dickens in saying the movie industry is  
experiencing the best of times and the worst of times. Mechanic 
said Fox is responding by trying to rein in production costs, 
including money to the stars. 
</P>
<P>
	``The days of the $20 million (salary) with 20 percent against  
the gross may be coming to an end,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mechanic pointed out that Fox had big success with ``Something  
About Mary'' with Ben Stiller and Cameron Diaz -- who before that 
picture didn't command top dollar. Even Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate 
Winslet weren't the stars that ``Titanic'' would make them when 
they were signed to the sinking ship epic, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But noting that Fox has movies coming out with Jodie Foster, Tom  
Hanks, Tom Cruise and Leonardo DiCaprio, Mechanic said: ``I'm only 
cautioning against the overuse and over-dependence'' of expensive 
star vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	As for budgets, Mechanic made it clear that ``Titanic'' was an  
aberration, with production costs that others have estimated at 
more than $200 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``We ended up making `Titanic' for an ungodly amount,'' he said.  
``But since then we haven't produced a single film for more than 
$70 million.''

<HEADLINE> IOC Weighs Secret Vote on Samaranch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- While the outcome is not in doubt, big questions  
remain over how the IOC will conduct a crucial confidence vote next 
week on president Juan Antonio Samaranch. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials of the International Olympic Committee are undecided  
whether to have a secret ballot or public acclamation on whether 
Samaranch should remain in office. 
</P>
<P>
	An endorsement of the 78-year-old Spaniard is assured. But with  
the world closely watching every move the IOC makes in the wake of 
its biggest corruption scandal, officials expect the committee will 
be criticized no matter what procedure is used. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC's executive board is expected to decide by midweek on  
what action to take against 19 members who remain under 
investigation in the Salt Lake bribery case, the head of the 
inquiry said. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC vice president Dick Pound said in New York that his  
investigation panel would hold a conference call Tuesday in hopes 
of bringing ``substantial closure'' to the review, then send its 
recommendations to the executive board in a second conference call 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Pounds said his commission had reached a decision on all cases  
but one. He refused to identify the member involved or say what 
actions the panel would recommend on any of the alleged offenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch, who has faced calls for his resignation from critics  
outside the IOC, announced in January that he would put his 
leadership to a vote of confidence at a special general assembly in 
Switzerland on March 17-18. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on numerous interviews over the past month, it's clear  
that Samaranch has overwhelming support among IOC members to 
continue in office. 
</P>
<P>
	The confidence motion, however, is not listed on the 10-point  
agenda for next week's meeting, where the assembly will vote on 
reform proposals and expulsion of members involved in the Salt Lake 
City bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC members told The Associated Press that the confidence  
question is still being debated among the general membership and 
the leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch has been canvassing the opinions of IOC members and is  
expected to settle on a formula later this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Executive board member Jacques Rogge said members are divided  
into those who favor a secret ballot and those who prefer a round 
of applause or show of hands. 
</P>
<P>
	``What counts is not the system,'' he said. ``What counts is  
whether (Samaranch) can have broad support, and I believe he 
will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rogge said neither of the proposed vote solutions would appease  
the IOC's critics. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the formula discussed by those seeking a public  
endorsement, Samaranch would give an opening statement to the 
assembly. The IOC's longest-serving member, Joao Havelange of 
Brazil, would then take the floor and ask the members to acclaim 
Samaranch by applause. 
</P>
<P>
	A secret ballot might be more democratic because it allows  
members to vote free of outside pressure. But it could also be seen 
as lacking accountability, especially at a time when the IOC is 
being urged to become more open. 
</P>
<P>
	A vote by acclamation could also be viewed as undemocratic, with  
members under pressure to side publicly with the majority in favor 
of Samaranch. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever we do, we will be criticized,'' Rogge said. ``If we  
have a secret ballot, people will say it should be public. If we 
have it public, people will say we should have had a secret 
ballot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rogge noted that when a government or prime minister asks for a  
confidence vote, a public ballot is held. 
</P>
<P>
	``To those who say it should be a secret ballot, I say that the  
impeachment vote of President Clinton, basically a vote of 
confidence, was a public vote,'' Rogge said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogge said he prefers a secret ballot. But he said the ultimate  
decision should not be made to appease others. 
</P>
<P>
	``The vote of confidence is not a sign to the outside world,''  
he said. ``It's for Samaranch to know if he has the support of his 
own members. I believe there will be overwhelming support.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the IOC does hold a secret ballot, a dozen or so members  
might vote against Samaranch, according to one delegate who spoke 
on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch, elected as IOC president in 1980, has not faced a  
contest since, re-elected three times by acclamation. In 1995, the 
IOC voted to raise its retirement age to 80 to allow Samaranch 
another term through 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the Salt Lake scandal broke late last year, the IOC  
counted 114 members. But fewer than 100 members will be eligible to 
vote at next week's session. 
</P>
<P>
	Four members have resigned and five others face expulsion and  
are ineligible to vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine new members, appointed at last year's Nagano Games, have  
not been invited to next week's extraordinary session. They are due 
to be sworn in officially at the next regular session, scheduled 
for June. 
</P>
<P>
	The 19 other members under investigation face expulsion, warning  
or exoneration.

<HEADLINE> Bengals Sign DL Oliver Gibson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- The Cincinnati Bengals signed their first free  
agent of the offseason Monday, agreeing to terms with defensive 
lineman Oliver Gibson. 
</P>
<P>
	Gibson, a backup nose tackle with the Pittsburgh Steelers for  
the past four seasons, agreed to a three-year contract. Terms 
weren't disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bengals lost safety Sam Shade and end Clyde Simmons off a  
defense that was last in the NFL at stopping the run and 28th 
overall. Cincinnati gave up 28.3 points per game, most in the 
league. 
</P>
<P>
	Nose tackle Kimo von Oelhoffen started every game last season,  
but had only 45 tackles -- ninth on the team -- and no sacks. The 
Bengals allowed an average of 163.3 yards rushing per game. 
</P>
<P>
	Gibson, 26, has been primarily the backup to Joel Steed in  
Pittsburgh. He's reunited with Dick LeBeau, who was his defensive 
coordinator for two years in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been frustrating for me behind Joel, because I know I can  
play,'' Gibson said. ``I think the Bengals have one of the fastest 
defenses in the NFL, and it's great to be back with coach LeBeau. I 
just like his style and the way he coaches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	LeBeau said Gibson could play either nose tackle or end.

<HEADLINE> Question Remain on GOP Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional Republican leaders have  
announced the broad principles that will guide them as they write a 
fiscal 2000 budget and a plan for handling huge surpluses expected 
for the foreseeable future. 
</P>
<P>
	The blueprint, which they will try selling next week to  
rank-and-file GOP lawmakers, signals how Republicans will position 
themselves politically in this year's budget battle with President 
Clinton. But it leaves several unanswered questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: What exactly have Republican leaders agreed to?  
</P>
<P>
	A: A vague framework that describes their general direction but  
saves specific decisions for later in the process. It says 
Republicans will only use Social Security surpluses for the 
elderly, not for general tax cuts or spending; will reserve more 
money than Clinton for Social Security and Medicare, or debt 
reduction if the two programs are not overhauled; will obey 
spending limits from the 1997 budget-balancing law; will increase 
defense spending and cut taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: If it is so vague, why is it important?  
</P>
<P>
	A: Because it makes several pivotal budgetary and political  
statements that are likely to be Republicans' marquee principles in 
this year's run-up to the 2000 elections. They want to be seen as a 
party that is protecting Social Security and Medicare and that 
wants to cut taxes and restrain spending. And by promising to not 
use Social Security funds for tax cuts, they want to immunize 
themselves against Democratic accusations that Republicans want to 
take away money from senior citizens and use it to cut rich 
peoples' taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: Can they do all that?  
</P>
<P>
	A: That is one of the key questions.  
</P>
<P>
	Take their promise to live within spending caps set by the 1997  
budget deal. For fiscal 2000, which begins Oct. 1, that agreement 
would hold discretionary spending to $536 billion, nearly one-third 
of the overall budget. Discretionary spending covers defense and 
domestic programs, but excludes automatically paid benefits like 
Medicare and payments to federal debt holders. 
</P>
<P>
	That $536 billion is a lot of money, but about $25 billion less  
than is being spent this year. Factor out one-time 1999 emergencies 
and it's still about $15 billion short. And then there are the 
billions extra both parties want to spend on defense and education. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: So will they keep spending within the $536 billion limit?  
</P>
<P>
	A: Republican leaders insist they will find enough savings by  
cutting some programs, using unspent funds and even some of 
Clinton's proposals to reduce spending and raise some fees. 
Democrats -- and many Republicans, usually in private -- say 
inevitably, many programs would be cut so deeply that spending 
bills will either be rejected by the GOP-controlled Congress, or 
vetoed by Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	And that could get Republicans precisely what they say they wish  
to avoid: A replay of last year's autumn spending showdown with 
Clinton, in which the president has most of the cards because a 
veto could cause a federal shutdown. As a result, many people from 
both parties think an agreement with Clinton to exceed the spending 
limits will be reached later in the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: Haven't Republicans successfully established themselves now  
as protectors of Social Security and Medicare? 
</P>
<P>
	A: Not yet. The polls show the public trusts Democrats more than  
Republicans on both issues, and that won't be easy for the GOP to 
overcome. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides, no one has seen the details of how Republicans would,  
as promised, ``Lock away every penny of the Social Security trust 
fund surpluses for our nation's elderly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats want to know specifically what they would do with the  
money, and how they can guarantee it won't be used for something 
else. They suggest Republicans may try using it to transform Social 
Security, in part, into personal retirement investments that people 
would control. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: Does this help the GOP get the tax cuts they want?  
</P>
<P>
	A: Maybe, but here too the details will be more telling.  
</P>
<P>
	Republicans are planning tax cuts totaling about $15 billion  
next year, but swelling to a $700 billion to $900 billion price tag 
through the decade. 
</P>
<P>
	They have pledged not to use Social Security surpluses to pay  
for the tax cuts. They think they win the fight over using 
surpluses from non-Social Security programs if their tax cuts are 
pitted against Democrats' calls for more spending. 
</P>
<P>
	But since sizable surpluses in the rest of the budget don't  
materialize until 2002, they will have to finance the early tax 
cuts other ways. They're examining several options, such as cutting 
capital gains tax rates, which generate revenue initially by 
encouraging people to sell their property. Democrats are waiting to 
pounce.

<HEADLINE> AN AMERICAN PORTRAIT: Pete Vonachen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEORIA, Ill. (AP) -- For some baseball fans, spring training is  
the start of the season. Time to scan split-squad scores in Florida 
and Arizona, read season previews in the sports pages, watch for 
trades. 
</P>
<P>
	For Pete Vonachen, co-owner of the Peoria Chiefs, a Class A farm  
team for the St. Louis Cardinals, spring training is the start of 
the best time of the year. Time for welcoming sunshine, eating hot 
dogs, talking baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	To the 73-year-old Vonachen, owning a team isn't about money or  
glory. Sometimes, it's not even about the game; his seat, just a 
few rows behind home plate in the stadium that bears his name, is 
usually empty. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he's shaking hands and greeting folks. Or he's over by  
the press box introducing a TV reporter to the young woman who sang 
the national anthem. Or he's standing with his arms crossed, 
harrumphing about lousy pitching. ``Used to be, I'd even collect 
the tickets,'' Vonachen says. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball season gives the dreamy-eyed Vonachen, stocked with  
stories and jokes, the chance to do what he does best: meet people 
and have fun. 
</P>
<P>
	For all his love of baseball, Vonachen's knack is not for the  
business side of things -- just as when he owned the hotel, the 
restaurant, the blacktop company. 
</P>
<P>
	``He owned the restaurant, and I can guarantee Pete can't make a  
pot of coffee. He owned that blacktop company, and he didn't know a 
thing about black-topping,'' says state Sen. George Shadid, a 
Democrat from nearby Pekin who counts himself among Vonachen's 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
	``He did know about baseball. But I don't know where he learned  
it, because he's not an athlete by any means.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vonachen was due in Jupiter, Fla., to scout players under  
contract with the Cardinals and assess his roster for this season. 
He expected to watch the pre-season opener against the Los Angeles 
Dodgers in Vero Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, it'll be fun. That's what it's all about,'' he says of the  
season's start. ``Talk to the manager, the coaches. Go out to 
dinner. Make a social event out of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spend time with Vonachen, and you realize he can turn anything --  
even taking tickets at the gate -- into a social event. As the 
Chiefs took on Indiana's Fort Wayne Wizards in the playoffs during 
a cool night last September, Vonachen was greeting dozens of people 
by name and handing out baseballs to children. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've known him all my life,'' says Dick Bogard, who recently  
sold several pharmacies and retired. ``He's a promoter. He'd do 
anything for you. And he just loves this city.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vonachen agreed to buy the Midwest League team one boozy night  
in 1984 at the urging of a couple of local sports writers. The team 
was poised to leave Peoria; with Vonachen, local baseball fans 
found a savior. 
</P>
<P>
	(Since then, Vonachen sold the team, only to buy it back with  
partners a few years later.) 
</P>
<P>
	While Bogard reminisces about his tryout for the Chicago White  
Sox, a batter jacks a foul ball over the fence, sending men and 
boys scrambling. Without rising from his seat, Bogard plucks it 
from the air. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told you I was an athlete,'' he says, showing off a  
knuckle-ball grip. ``And you know, Pete never played baseball in 
school. I don't think he ever played.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vonachen can tell you where he learned baseball: hanging out  
with Harry Caray, the late broadcaster for the Chicago Cubs. ``You 
go to the games every night, and you're bound to learn something 
about the game,'' Vonachen says. ``Harry knew all those people: 
players, coaches, managers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vonachen and Caray were friends for 48 years. They met when  
Caray was in town to broadcast a basketball game at Bradley 
University, where Vonachen ran the food service. They stayed out, 
Vonachen recalls, until 4:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Even up until a few years ago, says Shadid, their capacity for a  
good time was well known in Peoria. The limousine would pull up in 
front of a saloon, Caray would pop out one side, Vonachen would 
jump out the other. ``We just hit it off,'' Vonachen says. 
``Professionally, we had no ties whatsoever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands outside of Peoria heard of Vonachen, even if they  
didn't know who he was, when Caray would lean into the microphone 
at a Chicago Cubs game and say: ``And here's a big hello to my old 
friend Pete Vonachen, in Peoria.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Millions more were introduced to him through a national  
broadcast when he took the podium at Caray's memorial service a 
year ago and spoke of their friendship with love, compassion and a 
well-timed joke. 
</P>
<P>
	Vonachen wowed some of the biggest names in sport and  
entertainment. Being a friend of Caray's, he told the crowd, 
required a cast-iron stomach, endless stamina, and keeping ``your 
bags packed and your divorce lawyer on retainer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He gave another eulogy that was heard nationally in August, at  
the service for another good friend and Chicago broadcaster, Jack 
Brickhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	But Vonachen was a legend in central Illinois long before he  
went in front of the TV cameras at those funerals. ``Now everybody 
knows him ...,'' Shadid says. ``We can walk around, and people stop 
him, in Chicago, everywhere, and say, 'Hey, man, that was great.' 
'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vonachen brushes off the praise. He's just the son of a country  
doctor, he says, a third-generation guy from Peoria. Just someone 
who spoke from the heart about a best pal. 
</P>
<P>
	A boy, his cap pulled low on his head and a big fielder's glove  
dwarfing his arm, is leaning against a seat nearby, watching as the 
Chiefs' pitching gives up a two-run lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Fishing into his pocket, Vonachen pulls out a ball. With a  
``hey, kid,'' he gives it a toss, and makes another friend.

<HEADLINE> Y2K Nuclear Stand-Down Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Year 2000 computer crisis gives the United  
States and other nuclear powers a rare chance to get together and 
take their nuclear weapons off alert, a lawmaker said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	A nuclear stand-down is the only sure way to avoid a mishap on  
Jan. 1, 2000, when computers not upgraded to read the new 
millennium date could malfunction, Rep. Ed Markey, D-Mass., said at 
a Capitol Hill symposium on nuclear aspects of the so-called Y2K 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Kraig of the British American Security Information  
Council agreed that no matter what precautions are taken, 
``computer errors are by their very nature idiosyncratic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The real cure,'' he said, ``is to take the weapons off  
alert.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Experts at the symposium concurred with Pentagon assessments  
that, even in Russia, which is well behind the United States in 
correcting Y2K problems, it is highly unlikely that computer 
glitches will result in spontaneous missile launches or explosions 
in missile silos. 
</P>
<P>
	But Bruce Blair of the Brookings Institution said the Russian  
early-warning system, backed by thousands of missiles on 
hair-trigger alert, is especially susceptible to the computer bug. 
That, coupled with breakdowns in the cooling systems of 72 or 73 
deactivated Russian submarines, Blair said, raises ``the 
possibility of multiple Chernobyls.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blair said the Russian government is not ready to embrace the  
idea of a nuclear stand-down but has said it would discuss it with 
other nuclear powers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon as well is not receptive. But Pentagon spokesman  
Bryan Whitman said the military is looking at ways to prevent any 
unauthorized launch connected with Y2K problems. 
</P>
<P>
	A group of Russians is coming to Washington this month to  
discuss U.S. proposals, including one that would have Russian 
scientists set up at a special facility in Colorado during December 
and January to monitor U.S. nuclear weaponry into the new 
millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Defense Secretary John Hamre told a Senate hearing last  
month that ``our nuclear command and control system has been 
thoroughly tested and has performed superbly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A report this month by Congress's General Accounting Office,  
while faulting the Pentagon for being slow in fixing some of its 
computer systems, praised tests carried out by the North American 
Aerospace Defense Command. ``Year 2000 date rollovers worked 
properly, and NORAD officials were able to recover and continue the 
mission when testing problems occurred,'' the GAO said. 
</P>
<P>
	Speakers at the symposium urged the Nuclear Regulatory  
Commission to adopt a more assertive approach to assuring that 
nuclear power plants in this country are safe and that adequate 
backup systems will be in place. 
</P>
<P>
	David Lochbaum of the Union of Concerned Scientists alleged that  
the NRC has audited only 12 of 103 operating nuclear plants to 
assure their preparedness. The agency ``needs to change from being 
a spectator to being a regulator,'' Lochbaum said. 
</P>
<P>
	The NRC's executive director for operations, William Travers,  
testified in Congress last month that the commission is confident 
that all plants will be Y2K ready by October. Should noncompliance 
be spotted, he said, the NRC is ready to act and even shut down 
plants if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	NRC officials said inspectors will check on Y2K fixes at all the  
plants this spring.

<HEADLINE> Court To Rule on Indigent Appeals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today agreed to use a  
California murder case to clarify when a convicted criminal's 
court-appointed lawyer can refuse to file an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	The court said it will hear arguments by California officials  
that the state's procedure complies with a 1967 Supreme Court 
decision that limited when a court-appointed lawyer can refuse to 
file an appeal on grounds the appeal would be frivolous. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee Robbins was convicted of second-degree murder in Los Angeles  
in the Dec. 31, 1988, shooting death of his former roommate. He was 
sentenced to 17 years to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	His court-appointed lawyer filed a court brief that identified  
no issues for appeal but described the procedural history of the 
case and asked a California appeals court to conduct its own 
review. The lawyer also notified Robbins that he could file his own 
brief. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1967, the Supreme Court ruled that court-appointed lawyers  
could not refuse to pursue an appeal simply by filing a letter that 
said there were no issues that merited consideration on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the court said then that court-appointed lawyers who  
determine an appeal would be frivolous still must file a brief -- 
one that identifies any issue that might support an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Robbins filed his own brief, and it was denied by state courts.  
He then asked a federal judge to rule that his lawyer failed to 
follow the procedure required by the 1967 ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal judge ruled that Robbins was entitled to pursue a  
new state appeal. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the 
decision, saying Robbins' lawyer ``completely failed to identify 
any grounds that arguably supported an appeal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the appeal acted on today, the state's lawyers said Robbins'  
lawyer followed proper procedure and that Robbins should have been 
required to show he was harmed by the lawyer's actions. 
</P>
<P>
	The state's appeal said the 9th Circuit court's ruling  
invalidated the procedure used in many California cases and 
threatened to ``work a grievous hardship on the administration of 
justice in the nation's largest state.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robbins' new lawyer said the appeals court ruling did not throw  
out the entire California procedure but was limited to the facts in 
his case. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Smith vs. Robbins, 98-1037.

<HEADLINE> DiMaggio, No. 56 Linked Forever </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	In his last public appearance, on the final day of the 1998  
baseball season, Joe DiMaggio was driven around Yankee Stadium in a 
'56 Ford Thunderbird. 
</P>
<P>
	The model year was no accident.  
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio and No. 56 were linked forever after the summer of 1941  
when, day after day, game after game, Joe D. delivered base hits, 
establishing one of the most remarkable records in sports history. 
</P>
<P>
	Babe Ruth's record of 714 home runs fell. Roger Maris' record of  
61 home runs fell. Lou Gehrig's record of 2,130 consecutive games 
fell. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio's 56-game hitting streak endures.  
</P>
<P>
	The streak started innocently, almost unnoticed. DiMaggio was  
coming off two straight American League batting championships, and 
at 26 was already considered one of baseball's top young stars. The 
New York Yankees had won four World Series in his first five 
seasons but they were struggling at the start of 1941, stuck at 
.500 with a 14-14 record as they opened a three-game series against 
the Chicago White Sox on May 15. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio was in a slump, held hitless in the previous two games  
by Cleveland aces Bob Feller and Mel Harder. But in the first 
inning against the White Sox, he delivered an RBI-single against 
Chicago's Edgar Smith. The hit hardly stood out, since the Yankees 
lost the game, 13-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Batting streaks are rarely recognized in their early stages,  
hardly noticed until they reach double digits. When DiMaggio went 
4-for-5, including a home run and drove in three runs at Washington 
on May 27, the streak reached 12 games. 
</P>
<P>
	A week later, on the day Gehrig died at 39, DiMaggio had two  
hits, extending the streak to 19 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Now it was getting serious.  
</P>
<P>
	At the time, the modern National League record was 33 games by  
Rogers Hornsby and the American League record was 41 by George 
Sisler. DiMaggio's consistency was clearly a threat to those marks. 
</P>
<P>
	In a three-game series at St. Louis, he punished Browns pitchers  
for seven hits in 16 at-bats, with three home runs and seven runs 
batted in. DiMag was on a tear. 
</P>
<P>
	On June 21, he blooped a first-inning single off Detroit's Dizzy  
Trout, extending the streak to 34 games, passing Hornsby. Sisler 
was the next target. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the pressure was on.  
</P>
<P>
	``That's when the public, the press and the pitchers really  
started noticing,'' he said later. 
</P>
<P>
	Later that week, the streak was in danger. DiMaggio was hitless  
through seven innings of Game No. 38 at home against St. Louis. He 
was scheduled to be the fourth batter in the bottom of the eighth 
and with the Yankees leading 3-1, there probably wouldn't be a 
ninth. It was clearly a crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	With one out, Red Rolfe walked. Now Tommy Henrich huddled with  
manager Joe McCarthy. Henrich feared hitting into a double play 
that would end the inning and the streak. He suggested a sacrifice. 
McCarthy agreed. It was the first time the Yankees made a move 
designed strictly for the streak. 
</P>
<P>
	The bunt worked and DiMaggio, his swing saved, followed with a  
double against Eldon Auker, keeping the streak alive. 
</P>
<P>
	Two days later, DiMaggio went for 40 against an obscure  
Philadelphia pitcher named Johnny Babich, who swore he was going to 
stop the streak. 
</P>
<P>
	Babich said he would pitch around DiMaggio, give him nothing to  
hit. Fifty years later, Joe D. vividly recalled the encounter. 
</P>
<P>
	``My first time up, the count went to 3-0,'' he said. ``I got  
the hit sign, but the fourth pitch was way outside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his second at-bat, it was the same story -- four straight  
balls. It was clear what Babich was up to. Four walks in four trips 
would have ended the streak. The rules have been eased since then 
but at the time, DiMaggio was in jeopardy and he knew it. 
</P>
<P>
	``The third at-bat was the same,'' he said. ``Three straight  
balls. They gave me the hit sign again. This time, Babich got the 
fourth pitch not quite as far outside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio jumped on it, ripping the ball up the middle, through  
the pitcher's legs and into center field, extending the streak to 
40 games. ``Babich went down flat on his back,'' DiMaggio said. 
``When he came up, he was ashen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The next day, the Yankees played a doubleheader at Washington.  
Between games, DiMaggio's bat disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't just any bat,'' he said. ``This was a very special  
bat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With a backup bat, DiMaggio was 0-for-3 in the second game  
against Red Anderson. Henrich, who used the same model, offered his 
to DiMaggio. Using the borrowed bat, DiMaggio singled to keep the 
streak alive. 
</P>
<P>
	On July 1, DiMaggio tied Wee Willie Keeler's pre-1900 record of  
44 straight games in a doubleheader sweep of Boston. The next day, 
he continued his assault with a home run. 
</P>
<P>
	Keeler was a milestone. Now DiMaggio was in uncharted territory.  
It hardly distracted him. He just kept peppering pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees were in Cleveland on July 16, 1941, and on a rainy  
day, DiMaggio ripped three hits at League Park, where the Indians 
played some of their games. The ground was still damp the next 
night when a crowd of 67,468 crammed into larger Municipal Stadium 
on the lakefront. 
</P>
<P>
	In his first time at bat against Cleveland left-hander Al Smith,  
DiMaggio sent a shot down the third base line but slipped slightly 
on the heavy footing as he started out of the batter's box. Ken 
Keltner lunged to his right, backhanded the ball, and barely had 
time to throw him out. 
</P>
<P>
	After walking in his next at-bat, DiMaggio sent another shot  
down the line in the seventh. Again, Keltner grabbed the ball and 
threw him out. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were unconscious stops,'' Keltner said years later.  
``Both were backhanded plays, down the line. Both times, I got Joe 
by an eyelash. He could run, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Keltner, who led AL third basemen in fielding three times and  
assists four times, had developed a style of looking at the ball 
before throwing it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I grabbed the seams to make sure it didn't sail,'' he said.  
``On those plays, though, there was no time to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The third baseman had been playing deep.  
</P>
<P>
	``He was hitting with authority,'' Keltner said. ``I wanted to  
guard the line and stop the double. Ordinarily, I played him toward 
shortstop, but not that night. He wasn't bunting, I knew that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not once during the streak had DiMaggio bunted. There was no  
reason to expect him to change now. His last swing came in the 
eighth inning against reliever Jim Bagby. He came to the plate with 
the bases loaded and worked the count to 2-1, a good hitting 
situation. Then he sent a shot to shortstop, where Lou Boudreau 
turned it into an inning-ending double play. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees were leading 4-1 at the time. In the ninth inning,  
Cleveland rallied for two runs and had the tying run on third base 
with none out. If the Indians tied the game, DiMaggio would be up 
again in the 10th, with a chance to extend the streak. But relief 
ace Johnny Murphy escaped the jam, preserving the victory and 
depriving DiMaggio of any extra swings. 
</P>
<P>
	After two months, the streak was over.  
</P>
<P>
	He had 91 hits in 223 at-bats, 15 home runs, 35 extra-base hits  
and 55 RBIs. There were four games in which he had four hits, five 
games in which he had three hits and 13 games in which he had two 
hits. 
</P>
<P>
	From May 15 through July 16, 1941, he batted a torrid .408.  
</P>
<P>
	After the 56-game hitting streak ended, DiMaggio started a new  
one that lasted 16 games, giving him a remarkable stretch of hits 
in 72 of 73 games -- not including his All-Star game double. He 
would finish the season batting .357, leading the league with 125 
RBIs and winning the Most Valuable Player award.

<HEADLINE> NCAA Unveils Men's Tournament Field </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- So what if Florida A&AMP;M is a 44-point  
underdog to mighty Duke? 
</P>
<P>
	Back in December, when the Rattlers lost 13 of their first 14  
games, the odds seemed a lot steeper they would even get into the 
NCAA tournament at all. 
</P>
<P>
	``If someone would have told me six months, or even six weeks  
ago, that we would be playing in the NCAA tournament against Duke, 
I would have laughed,'' coach Mickey Clayton said Sunday after the 
Rattlers drew top-seeded Duke (32-1) -- and probably a lot of laughs 
-- in the first round of the East Regional. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida A&AMP;M (12-18) is not in the 64-team field as someone's  
idea of a joke, however. The Rattlers got there by getting hot and 
winning the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference's automatic bid by 
winning its league tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just have to continue to play together,'' said Jamaal  
Rhodes, a sophomore forward who will probably get the honor of 
covering Elton Brand next Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been branded the Cinderella through the conference  
tournament and we'll keep that moniker in this game, as well. But 
we aren't afraid of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rattlers would seem to find little comfort in recent  
history. No No. 16 seed or team with a losing record has ever won 
an NCAA game. Last year's biggest upset hopeful -- 13-16 Prairie 
View -- got crushed 110-52 by No. 1 seed Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	And the Rattlers have more recent experience with No. 1 seeds.  
They opened their season against Auburn, which was made No. 1 seed 
in the South when the 64-team field was unveiled Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The result? A 94-47 rout.  
</P>
<P>
	``We hope to draw from that experience,'' Clayton said. ``We're  
just going to go after these guys and see what happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, the Big Ten landed seven, and almost eight,  
teams in the field while the proud ACC got just three. 
</P>
<P>
	The other No. 1 seeds were Connecticut in the West and Michigan  
State in the Midwest. There seemed little controversy in the 
committee's selection of top seeds or final teams to fill out the 
34 at-large squads. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there are a lot of teams that didn't get in,'' said  
selection committee chairman C.M. Newton. ``Getting down to those 
last teams was hard, as it always is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If anybody has a gripe it might be Connecticut. Newton admitted  
the committee judged the Huskies the No. 2 team overall behind 
Duke. Yet they alone among the four No. 1 seeds were shipped far 
from home and will open play in Denver in the West Regional. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, leading scorer Richard Hamilton said traveling  
across the country does have its benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will help us, because then there's no distractions,'' he  
said. ``We've got to stick together, we got to be together to do 
the things we want to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Big Ten set the record with seven teams in 1990 and it was  
matched by the Big East in 1991 and the Big Ten again in 1994. The

conference tournament run Sunday with another upset over Michigan 
State.

<P>
	In addition to regular-season and tournament champion Michigan  
State, the other Big Ten teams selected were Ohio State, Indiana, 
Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Purdue, which almost ruined itself

<P>
	Michigan State (29-4) will play on Friday against Mount St.  
Mary's, the Northeast Conference champions coached by 800-game 
winner Jim Phelan. 
</P>

Conference tournament semifinals, opens play in the South Regional 
on Thursday in Indianapolis against Winthrop, the Big South 
champion making its first tournament appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut (28-2) will play on Thursday against Texas-San  
Antonio, which won the Southland Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The Big East and Big 12 each had five teams invited. The other  
multi-bid conferences were Conference USA and the Pac-10 with four 
each; Missouri Valley and Western Athletic with three teams each; 
and the Mid-American with two. 
</P>
<P>
	The other games in Charlotte will be Tennessee against No. 13  
Delaware; fifth-seeded Wisconsin against No. 12 Southwest Missouri 
State; and eighth-seeded College of Charleston against No. 9 Tulsa.

<HEADLINE> GOP Pushes Senate Residency Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Republicans in the state Legislature have  
introduced a bill that could block Hillary Rodham Clinton from 
running for Senate in New York. But its chief sponsor conceded 
Monday it has virtually no chance of becoming law. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, the measure has provided Republicans with an  
opportunity to vent their frustration over the possibility the 
first lady might run for, and even win, the seat being vacated next 
year by Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan. 
</P>
<P>
	Polls have shown Mrs. Clinton, who has never lived in New York,  
running well against the strongest potential GOP nominee, New York 
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. 
</P>
<P>
	``You ought to live here so you know what the state's all about,  
especially if you're going to be a United States senator,'' state 
Assemblyman David Townsend said of his bill to impose a five-year 
state residency requirement on candidates for U.S. Senate or House 
seats. Currently, there are no residency requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	Townsend said he is realistic about the legislation's chances  
given that Democrats control the Assembly and Assembly Speaker 
Sheldon Silver is a big booster of the Mrs. Clinton-for-Senate 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
	State Democratic chairwoman Judith Hope said she welcomes the  
GOP legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	``They think people elected them to get the Clintons. If they  
keep it up, they're going to guarantee, No. 1, that she runs and, 
No. 2, that she'll win,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Nixes China Warning on Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration chided Chinese  
authorities Monday for warning the United States against helping 
Taiwan develop a defense against missile attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Instead of worrying about a decision that has not been made to  
deploy defensive technologies that do not yet exist, the Chinese 
should focus on the regional and global proliferation of 
missiles,'' State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	He noted the Taiwanese are assessing their own capabilities and  
needs, and therefore it is too early to comment about their 
intentions. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, China warned that any U.S. transfer of missile  
defense technology to Taiwan would be the ``last straw'' and would 
``certainly lead to serious consequences.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin said the United States will fulfill its security  
commitments to Taiwan and will continue to assist the island, which 
the government in Beijing considers a renegade province, in meeting 
legitimate defensive needs. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Secretary of State Madeleine Albright made the same  
points to Chinese authorities last week during a visit to Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
	In Taipei, Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui told U.S. envoy  
William Perry that China's military threat against Taiwan forces 
the island to study joining a regional missile defense arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically, if China didn't consider Taiwan an enemy, dropped  
its hegemonic attitude and large-scale missile installations along 
the mainland coast, then there wouldn't be any reason'' for a 
missile defense system, Lee said, according to a statement released 
by his office. 
</P>
<P>
	Perry, who arrived in Taiwan after a visit to China, told Lee  
that China's top negotiator with Taiwan, Wang Daohan, expressed to 
him a wish for the sides to reduce their militaries, the statement 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Perry, a former defense secretary, said he suggested to Wang  
that China reduce its missile deployments along the coast facing 
Taiwan in order to test Taiwan's response, but had ``no way of 
knowing if China accepted'' his remarks, the statement said.

<HEADLINE> NYC Opera Stages 'Lizzie Borden' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Arts and Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- When the New York City Opera gave the premiere  
of ``Lizzie Borden'' in 1965, it sounded very dissonant. It doesn't 
seem nearly as dissonant now but it retains its fierce impact. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York City Opera presented a new production of the work,  
based on a real double murder, on Saturday night. Composer Jack 
Beeson and librettist Kenward Elmslie were present and took bows 
with the excellent cast. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhoda Levine directed Phyllis Pancella in title role, showing  
how Lizzie's mind began to slip early on. Robin Blitch Wiper, a 
delicate-voiced soprano, sang her younger sister Margret. 
</P>
<P>
	The story takes place in 1892 in Fall River, Mass., where Lizzie  
and Margret live with their father and his second wife Abigail. 
Their father is a strict man, who does not allow Lizzie to leave 
their home. Even the church children's choir, which Lizzie 
conducts, has to meet in the house. 
</P>
<P>
	And when the preacher (Dennie Petersen, making his company  
debut) asks Andrew Borden for money, the tightwad Borden is so 
angry he forbids Lizzie to see either the children or the preacher. 
</P>
<P>
	The singers all expertly wound up the increasing family tension.  
Stephen West as Andrew Borden sang with sternness when addressing 
his daughters but warmly to wife Abigail. In her rich soprano, 
Lauren Flanigan flaunted Abigail's position with pretty clothes 
that were denied the daughters. One of the most musically striking 
and emotionally chilling moments is a Flanigan-Pancella duet. 
</P>
<P>
	Wiper's delicate voice indicates she's about to crack. Her  
sanity is saved by eloping with a young sea captain, sung 
resolutely by Dean Ely. At times, Lizzie fantasizes he wants her. 
</P>
<P>
	In the final scene, Lizzie has been acquitted of murdering her  
father and stepmother and has sealed herself inside the house. The 
preacher calls, suggesting they read the Bible. She sends him away. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the opera's dissonance is in the orchestra, which was  
conducted by George Manahan. John Conklin designed a room with 
center wooden steps leading to the married couple's bedroom. Lizzie 
climbs it twice, carrying an ax. The room is big but with only one 
window it seems stiflingly airless. The production was first 
presented at Glimmerglass Opera in Cooperstown, N.Y.

<HEADLINE> Bond Prices Rise Slightly / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Treasury bonds rose modestly Monday, extending  
last week's strong gains. The rally has been driven by easing 
concerns that the U.S. economy will overheat, leading the Federal 
Reserve to boost interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Higher rates reduce the value of existing fixed-rate securities,  
such as bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 5/32 point  
Monday, or by $1.56 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which 
moves in the opposite direction, dropped to 5.59 percent from 5.60 
percent Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	With inflation under control, investors said bonds look more  
appetizing, particularly with yields at seven-month highs. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told the  
Mortgage Bankers Association that inflation is ``well behaved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But two other Fed officials were more cautionary.  
</P>
<P>
	William Poole, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St.  
Louis, said the bond market is correct to believe the central 
bank's next move will be a rate increase, according to Market News 
International. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago Federal Reserve Bank President Michael Moskow told the  
Wisconsin Bankers Association that inflationary pressures may build 
during 1999, especially if corporations resort to raising prices to 
boost profits. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market Friday, prices of short-term Treasury  
securities rose 1/32 point to 3/32 point, while intermediate 
maturities rose 1/8 point to 3/8 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a 
financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, reflecting price  
movements on bonds with maturities of a year or longer, rose 0.84 
point to 1,281.01. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 4.62 percent as the  
discount rose 0.01 percentage point from Friday to 4.50 percent. 
Six-month yields were unchanged at 4.70 percent, as the discount 
remained at 4.53 percent. One-year yields fell to 4.80 percent, 
while the discount fell 0.01 percentage point to 4.57 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, rose to 4.88 percent from 4.81 percent Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds rose 5/32 point to 123 15/16. The average 
yield to maturity fell to 5.23 percent from 5.24 percent Friday.

<HEADLINE>  Berra at a Loss for Words, For Once </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UPPER MONTCLAIR, N.J. (AP) -- It was hard for Yogi Berra to put a  
legacy into words. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh gosh,'' Berra said every time a reporter asked different  
versions of the same question: What made Joe DiMaggio, who died on 
Monday, the greatest player ever? 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh God,'' said Berra, normally never at a loss for a malaprop.  
</P>
<P>
	Then Berra, who played with DiMaggio from 1947 until DiMaggio  
retired in 1951, came up with the answer. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio was perfect.  
</P>
<P>
	``Never did anything wrong on the field. Never did,'' Berra said  
Monday, sitting next to a gray 1939 DiMaggio road jersey on display 
at Berra's baseball museum. 
</P>
<P>
	Berra said he never saw DiMaggio dive for a ball in the  
outfield. And when DiMaggio sprinted from first to second base, 
``You thought, `Where the hell is he going?' He got there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to admire a man like that,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Berra, who later joined DiMaggio in the Hall of Fame, said that  
as a young man, he watched DiMaggio play. When he came to the 
Yankees, DiMaggio was the man Berra and other younger players 
looked up to. 
</P>
<P>
	``I watched him, everything he did,'' Berra said.  
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio was the only player Berra remembers to come to Yankee  
Stadium for home games dressed in a suit. ``Blue shirt, white shirt 
and a beautiful tie,'' Berra said. ``He looked great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Berra saw DiMaggio carefully guard his privacy. Even decades  
after his marriage to Marilyn Monroe, Berra said, he never 
mentioned her. And no one else was allowed to mention her if they 
wanted to remain his friend. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he was a loner once the game was over, Berra said, he  
would play cards and eat dinner with them on the train to away 
games. ``He always had somebody waiting for him when he got off the 
train,'' Berra said. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio wouldn't talk much about the injuries that caused him  
to leave the game, Berra said, although DiMaggio wouldn't play if 
he thought he would hurt his team. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio's death leaves Berra as the likely replacement for  
DiMaggio on April 9, when DiMaggio was scheduled to throw out the 
first ball at the Yankees' home opener. Berra, who recently ended a 
14-year feud with Yankee owner George Steinbrenner, said if he does 
get invited to Yankee Stadium, he has only one wish: that Joe could 
be there, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``So I could catch the ball instead of throw it.''

<HEADLINE> New Congress Members Eager To Learn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Last year, Rep. Pat Toomey used to just fret  
about his own wallet. But as a newcomer to the twin worlds of 
politics and Congress, this Pennsylvania Republican now finds 
himself worrying about the nation's spending, too. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a demanding job, but Toomey can't contain his enthusiasm  
for it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's exciting for me to be immediately part of the mix,'' said  
Toomey, a 37-year-old former investment banker and restaurateur who 
is now on the Budget, Small Business and Banking committees as well 
as a task force on Social Security reform. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the new crop of House freshmen, Toomey and colleagues Jim  
DeMint, R-S.C., and Stephanie Tubbs-Jones, D-Ohio, were elected 
with no legislative experience. 
</P>
<P>
	That means they have to learn a lot -- from getting around the  
Capitol complex to hiring staff, studying issues and finding a home 
-- and learn it quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very exciting for me to be in the room where we're  
discussing the big issues of what the federal budgets ought to look 
like,'' Toomey said. ``It doesn't get much bigger than that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DeMint, who was surprised by his election as president of the  
Republican freshmen, said keeping tabs on the issues and other 
congressional details requires the skills of a juggler. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to keep a lot of balls in the air,'' added DeMint,  
a former advertiser, marketing consultant and owner of DeMint 
Marketing. He also was recruited by top Republican House leaders to 
work on sharpening the GOP's message. 
</P>
<P>
	DeMint, 47, first sampled politics as a volunteer strategist on  
the 1992 campaign of his predecessor, former Rep. Bob Inglis, 
R-S.C., who lost a Senate bid last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the 40 House freshmen are seasoned politicians, with  
many having served in their state legislatures or other government 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Michael Capuano, D-Mass., was mayor of Somerville. Rep. Jay  
Inslee, D-Wash., returns after a four-year absence. Other freshmen 
have been state judges, state attorney general, state highway 
commissioner or congressional aides. 
</P>
<P>
	Reps. David Wu, D-Ore., an attorney, and Brian Baird, D-Wash., a  
psychologist who lost a 1996 House race, also are among the novices 
-- a group whose prior legislative experience includes service on 
various school and local boards. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the eight Senate freshmen, only Democrat John Edwards, a  
North Carolina trial lawyer, had not previously held public office. 
</P>
<P>
	Tubbs-Jones, 49, is adjusting to doing more with less after  
nearly 20 years as an Ohio county judge and prosecutor. Her 
prosecutorial staff of 300 included 180 lawyers; she now depends on 
15 employees in congressional offices in Washington and Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the thing that's most significant for me is the amount  
of paper we process,'' Tubbs-Jones commented. 
</P>
<P>
	She got a taste of the national limelight last year when, as  
Cuyahoga County's prosecutor, she declined to review new DNA 
evidence in the case of Dr. Sam Sheppard, whose 1954 conviction for 
killing his wife led to the TV series and movie ``The Fugitive.'' 
The Ohio Supreme Court later overturned her decision. 
</P>
<P>
	She succeeded Democratic Rep. Louis Stokes, who retired after 30  
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Overwhelmed by the paper, too, is Toomey. But he skips most of  
it. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's enormous amounts of paper that I don't see because I  
intentionally don't look at it,'' he said. ``You don't have any 
time at all to waste.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A virtual unknown, Toomey even got support from such top  
Republicans as New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and former House 
Speaker Newt Gingrich. They campaigned on his behalf to help 
reclaim the seat for the GOP after Rep. Paul McHale, D-Pa., retired 
after three terms. 
</P>
<P>
	Toomey compared being in Congress to living in another world.  
``All of a sudden, you're immersed in a totally new universe,'' he

<HEADLINE> Tom Hanks Hospitalized for Blister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Tom Hanks was hospitalized Monday for an  
infected blister he got while shooting a movie in Fiji, his 
publicist said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hanks, 42, was told to remain overnight but will miss the  
Academy Awards luncheon and the NATO Star of the Decade Awards in 
Las Vegas later this week, spokeswoman Leslee Dart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hanks got a small blister on his right knee sometime last week  
while filming ``Cast Away.'' He wasn't able to keep the blister 
properly dressed because of the tropical climate and frequent 
filming in water, Ms. Dart said. 
</P>
<P>
	When he returned to Los Angeles, it apparently became infected  
and Hanks sought care at an undisclosed hospital on Sunday. Doctors 
advised him to stay off his feet for about a week.

<HEADLINE> Allied Waste To Buy Browning-Ferris </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Allied Waste Industries Inc. is buying  
Browning-Ferris Industries Inc. in a $7.3 billion merger that will 
join North America's second- and third-biggest trash hauling 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	No. 3 Allied Waste Industries is offering $45 a share for No. 2  
BFI, a 29 percent premium over Friday's closing stock price of 
$34.75. Allied Waste also will assume $1.8 billion in debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Allied Waste CEO Thomas H. Van Weelden will head up the new  
firm, Allied Waste Industries, from Allied's headquarters in 
Scottsdale, Ariz. The combined company's $6.6 billion in annual 
revenue would still be second in the solid waste services industry 
behind Waste Management Inc., which had $12.7 billion in revenue 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we have here is almost a perfect marriage,'' said Van  
Weelden, noting that BFI and Allied Waste's services overlap in 
only about 20 to 25 cities. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal got a warm welcome on Wall Street, where Allied's  
shares gained 13 percent or $1.93 3/4 to $16.93 3/4 and BFI's rose 12 
percent, or $4.12 1/2, to $38.87 1/2. Both stocks trade on the New York 
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger would enable Allied Waste to expand into BFI's  
territory on the West Coast and would create a national network of 
landfill, collection, transfer, recycling and other operating 
assets. 
</P>
<P>
	The BFI name and its trademark blue trucks will continue in most  
markets, Van Weelden said. Allied Waste operates 130 collection 
companies under various names. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like a very good deal for BFI shareholders,'' said  
Melville Cody, an analyst for Sanders Morris Mundy in Houston. 
``Allied Waste has set some targets for cost savings that if they 
can reach makes it a profitable deal for their shareholders too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Allied Waste's two biggest shareholders, Apollo Group and  
Blackstone Group, would buy $1 billion in newly issued Allied Waste 
convertible preferred stock to finance the acquisition. A bank 
group led by Chase Manhattan will provide $9.5 billion in 
financing, Allied Waste said. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined companies expect to save about $290 million in the  
first year of the deal by cutting overhead and duplication. Allied 
also is expected to sell almost $1 billion in non-essential 
businesses to pare down debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Allied Waste expects the deal to bring earnings per share of  
$1.60 in 2000 and $2.10 in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Argus Research Corp. analyst James Kelleher said Allied  
Waste could have trouble meeting its earnings estimates because of 
the amount of debt it was taking on. ``The economy is going to have 
to remain quite strong for Allied to hit its earning-per-share 
estimates,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Allied Waste operates primarily in the Midwest and Northeast. It  
had revenue of $1.6 billion in 1998 and has 7,500 employees and 
operations in 28 states. 
</P>
<P>
	Browning-Ferris had revenue of about $4.1 billion last year and  
has 26,000 employees. Its worldwide revenue amounted to about $4.7 
billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
	BFI operates more than 90 solid-waste landfills, about 30  
medical-waste landfills and about 90 recycling facilities 
throughout North America. BFI collects solid waste in 46 states, 
Puerto Rico and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Weelden said some of the 2,500 workers at BFI's Houston  
headquarters would lose their jobs, but he did not know how many. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal has been approved by the boards of directors of both  
companies. It must be approved by Browning-Ferris shareholders and 
get regulatory clearance, but is expected to close before October.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Arrives in Central America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) -- President Clinton began a pilgrimage  
today to the sites of Hurricane Mitch's worst horrors, proffering 
Central Americans hope for their reconstruction so that despair 
does not turn into political trouble for the region. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicaraguan President Arnoldo Aleman and an honor guard of  
crisply uniformed schoolchildren greeted Clinton with a dignitary's 
traditional red-carpet welcome at Augusto Cesar Sandino 
International Airport in Managua. 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton -- without his wife, sidelined by a recurring back  
problem -- embarked on his four-day, four nation mission just as 
15,000 Guatemalans and Salvadorans who were in the United States 
illegally become eligible for deportation. He has turned down pleas 
for an extension of the halt in deportations that was instituted 
after last fall's devastating storm. the stay in deportations 
expires today. 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton's first stop -- at one of only a few of the homes  
that were left standing in several villages after a wall of mud 
slid down Nicaragua's Casitas Volcano in October -- promises to 
underscore that many of those illegal immigrants have nothing to go 
home to. 
</P>
<P>
	To have them return now ``would cause us tragic problems of  
stability,'' warned Salvadoran President Armando Calderon Sol, who 
will greet the Clintons in San Salvador tonight. In advance of 
their arrival, Calderon pleaded for the United States to reconsider 
an extension of the stay on deportations. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Michael Hammer said the United States has  
determined the region is capable of ``beginning to receive their 
nationals.'' He said, however, that deportations are not expected 
to begin immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, Clinton's trip was scripted as a neighborly  
show of compassion, solidarity and assistance -- as much as the 
president could muster while his $956 million emergency aid package 
remained tangled in domestic spending politics on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	On the dried, cracked mud at the foot of Casitas Volcano, he was  
laying flowers at the impression left by the body of a small girl, 
victim of the Oct. 30 landslide that killed 2,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	In a nearby Posoltega, Nicaragua, schoolyard, Clinton was  
meeting with homeless, jobless and -- many of them -- hopeless 
survivors still living in plastic tents four months after Mitch 
moved on. 
</P>
<P>
	In advance of Clinton's arrival, thousands of people poured into  
Posoltega by truck, bus or on foot. Many carried American flags or 
signs such as ``Welcome Bill Clinton.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police set up roadblocks all along the coastal highway that has  
been rebuilt since Mitch cut it in dozens of places. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are losing hope and you don't want an uncertain  
future,'' Hammer said, laying out the goals of Clinton's trip, 
which follows on separate official missions to the region by Mrs. 
Clinton and Tipper Gore, wife of the vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without rebuilding schools, homes, roads, crops and jobs, it  
can lead to despair and corruption,'' Hammer said. ``The people 
need to realize that the United States stands with them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton brought to Nicaragua only a small grab bag of U.S. aid:  
</P>
<P>
	--$10.6 million from the Agency for International Development to  
repair, equip and staff health clinics, and $12.5 million for 
primary schools. 
</P>
<P>
	--Another $1.5 million in AID money for the International Red  
Cross to build 4,000 temporary homes starting this month. 
</P>
<P>
	--$1.8 million from the State Department to find and remove the  
civil-war-era land mines remaining in Nicaragua and Honduras. 
Mitch's floods and mudslides complicated the problem by shifting 
mapped areas of land mine deployment. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar packages for El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala would  
be announced at Clinton's subsequent stops in those nations, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Each grapples with its share of Mitch's ravages: more than 9,000  
dead, thousands more homeless, and as much as $10 billion in 
infrastructure damage. 
</P>
<P>
	In light of the crisis, Central American leaders fault Clinton's  
trade policy as halfhearted. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton submitted legislation to Congress last week providing  
enhanced trade benefits to Central American and Caribbean nations 
under the so-called Caribbean Basin Initiative. 
</P>
<P>
	Diplomats from those nations, who have long pressed for the same  
free-trade benefits that Mexico received under the North American 
Free Trade Agreement, said Clinton's latest CBI enhancement does 
not go far enough to build markets for Central American exports 
and, thus, restore jobs in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	Worse, Nicaraguan officials said, Clinton doomed the  
controversial trade package by sending it to Congress separate from 
the more politically popular direct-aid request. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicaraguan President Arnoldo Aleman beseeched Clinton in a  
letter last week to throw his ``credibility and prestige'' behind 
the CBI legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without that,'' said Nicaragua's ambassador to the United  
States, Francisco Aguirre Sacasa, ``I don't think it has a 
snowball's chance in Hell of being approved -- even in its diluted 
form.''

<HEADLINE> Japan Laments DiMaggio's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- In baseball-crazy Japan, the death of Joe DiMaggio  
was top news Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio's death Monday was carried prominently in all of  
Japan's major newspapers and on morning TV news broadcasts. Most 
also featured photos of him with Marilyn Monroe. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's biggest newspaper, the Yomiuri, devoted nearly a quarter  
of its domestic news page to the DiMaggio story. ``The Major League 
Record: 56-game hitting streak, Mr. Joe Dimaggio has died,'' said 
its four-column headline. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yomiuri noted that DiMaggio and Monroe visited Japan in 1954  
on a 24-day honeymoon here. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was major among the major,'' the Yomiuri quoted Shigeo  
Nagashima, coach of the Tokyo Giants baseball team, as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did not see him actually play, but I learned a lot about  
baseball through his pictures. I hope Japan will one day produce a 
player like him,'' Nagashima said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1950, Dimaggio made his first visit to Japan to give  
technical guidance to Japanese players. He joined in a home-run 
competition and showed defense skills at Tokyo's Korakuen Stadium, 
now the Tokyo Dome. 
</P>
<P>
	Dimaggio also came to Tokyo for Japan-U.S. baseball games in  
November, 1951, and homered at the Jingu Stadium in Tokyo.

<HEADLINE> Jerry Seinfeld Talks About Sitcom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ASPEN, Colo. (AP) -- Jerry Seinfeld says the influence of his  
television show isn't as great as some suggest. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see how dropping a Junior Mint into an operation  
influenced the '90s,'' he joked about an episode in which a candy 
landed inside a patient. 
</P>
<P>
	Seinfeld and the show's co-creator, Larry David, were hosts of a  
retrospective on the program at the U.S. Comedy Arts Festival on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	They said the show probably has had genuine impact on  
contemporary language and the evolution of the sitcom form. 
</P>
<P>
	The show popularized phrases like ``low talker'' and ``master of  
his domain'' -- accomplishments David said were unintentional. 
</P>
<P>
	``We never set out to write catch phrases. That was never done  
consciously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The show did set out to depart from the normal sitcom style.  
</P>
<P>
	``We took the sitcom off the stage,'' Seinfeld said. ``Every  
week we were outside. That had never been done before.''

<HEADLINE> McGwire Hits First Spring Home Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JUPITER, Fla. (AP) -- The crack of the bat was so sharp that it  
startled Ted Lilly. 
</P>
<P>
	Then again, the rookie pitcher had never heard a Mark McGwire  
home run up close. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire hit his first homer of 1999, a three-run shot Sunday for  
the St. Louis Cardinals in a 6-1 exhibition victory over the 
Montreal Expos. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nice to get it out of the way,'' McGwire said. ``But it's  
only spring training.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Just see the ball, hit the ball,'' he said. ``I believe it  
should never be changed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coming off his record-breaking season of 70, McGwire wasted no  
time finding his home-run swing. He launched a trademark drive high 
and far over the left-field wall in only his second official at-bat 
of the spring. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire homered a day after Sammy Sosa hit No. 1 for the Chicago  
Cubs. But there's no race -- at least, not yet -- and McGwire said he 
didn't even know about his rival's home run. 
</P>
<P>
	A sellout crowd at Roger Dean Stadium got exactly what it wanted  
when McGwire crunched an inside fastball from Lilly in the second 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never seen anything like that,'' the 23-year-old lefty  
said, shaking his head. ``I mean, it was loud.'' 
</P>
<P>
	J.D. Drew, Carlos Baerga and several other Cardinals greeted  
McGwire at the plate, but he did not punctuate this homer with the 
fake punch-to-the-gut routine that became his stamp during his 
historic season. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6,912 fans, many of them wearing No. 25 McGwire jerseys,  
gave him a standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
	The ball landed between the fence and the Expos clubhouse, an  
off-limits area where park officials considered building bleachers 
this spring expressly for McGwire watchers. 
</P>
<P>
	The souvenir was retrieved by stadium marketing director  
Jennifer Chalhub, preparing to drive a 1999 white convertible 
Camaro around the field as part of an in-between inning promotion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I heard he was up and I got out of the car to protect it,''  
she said. ``He came within 25 feet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chalhub was aware that McGwire's 70th home run ball sold for $3  
million or so, but she didn't try to cash in. Instead, she gave it 
to a little girl about 4 years old standing outside the gate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I figured a ball would mean more to a kid,'' Chalhub said. ``I  
didn't even say it was a Mark McGwire ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire hit seven home runs last year in exhibition play. The  
Cardinals share their training complex with Montreal, and the Expos 
are plenty familiar with McGwire. The All-Star first baseman hit 
his final five home runs last season against them, and six overall. 
</P>
<P>
	Had this been next month when the Cardinals play Montreal for  
real, Lilly might have just walked him. McGwire led the majors with 
an NL record 162 walks last year, and there were runners on second 
and third when he homered. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess we gave a home run to McGwire and everybody was  
pleased about that,'' Expos manager Felipe Alou said. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire drew a full-count walk in the first inning after hitting  
a long foul. He hooked another drive in the second before homering. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire did not bat again and left the game after three innings.  
He paused in the right-field corner to sign autographs for a few 
minutes before walking to the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the Cardinals' 14 home exhibition games at Roger Dean  
Stadium, 13 are sold out. McGwire items dominate the souvenir 
stand, with Big Mac hats, shirts, posters and model bats on sale. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather than a piece of merchandise, Lilly got a McGwire memory.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was pretty pumped up about the chance to pitch to him for  
the first time. But I went about it the wrong way. I tried to match 
power vs. power,'' he said, ``and obviously he has more.''

<HEADLINE> Court Might Reinstate Suit Vs. Doctors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today agreed to clarify the  
filing deadline for lawsuits that invoke a federal 
anti-racketeering law by studying the case of a Texas man who says 
he was illegally held in a psychiatric hospital by profit-greedy 
doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices said they will consider reinstating Mark Rotella's  
lawsuit against two dozen doctors stemming from his 16-month stay 
at Brookhaven Psychiatric Pavilion in Dallas, which ended in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	Rotella, now a Dallas-Fort Worth area resident, was 16 when in  
1985 he was admitted to Brookhaven on the request of his mother. He 
remained there until shortly after his 18th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	The hospital closed down in 1992. Two years later, its parent  
company -- Psychiatric Institutes of America -- pleaded guilty to 
charges of fraud and conspiracy and to violations of the federal 
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). 
</P>
<P>
	A series of Supreme Court rulings has permitted broad use of  
RICO, a law originally aimed at mobsters, and allow lawsuits by 
anyone allegedly harmed by a ``pattern'' of illegal activities. The 
law has been invoked to accuse numerous huge corporations of 
racketeering. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Psychiatric Institutes of America had provided  
financial incentives to doctors who unnecessarily admitted, treated 
and retained patients at its facilities across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Rotella sued doctors who had been associated with  
Brookhaven in Dallas, seeking to collect monetary damages under the 
civil provisions of the RICO law. 
</P>
<P>
	They sought to have the lawsuit thrown out, citing the four-year  
statute of limitations courts have imposed for filing RICO 
lawsuits. The doctors' lawyers said the four-year period began, at 
the latest, when Rotella was released from Brookhaven in 1986, 11 
years before he sued. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rotella's lawyers contended that the deadline clock should  
not have begun ticking until 1994, when he discovered the facts 
that would lead him to suspect a pattern of racketeering activity. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal appeals courts have split on the appropriate start for  
the four-year statute of limitations. In Rotella's case, the 5th 
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled he missed the deadline after it 
selected ``the discovery of the injury alone'' trigger -- not ``the 
discovery of both the injury and the pattern of racketeering 
activity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Rotella vs. Dallas Psychiatric Associates, 98-896.

<HEADLINE> Former King Congregation Moves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Ebenezer Baptist Church holds many memories for  
Christine King Ferris: It was where she was baptized, where she 
married and where her famous brother and father once preached. 
</P>
<P>
	But it also was where the funeral for her slain sibling, the  
Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., was held in 1968 and where six years 
later her mother, Alberta, was gunned down while playing the organ. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have mixed emotions,'' said Mrs. Ferris as she walked away  
from the old church toward congregation's new $8 million sanctuary. 
``I will always have an affinity for Ebenezer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Ferris was among the hundreds of members and visitors  
Sunday who filled the old church's wooden pews to pray and reflect 
on Ebenezer's 76-year history before marching over to the new 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
	Singing ``We're Marching to Zion,'' and led by children, the  
congregation marched over to the fan-shaped building where church 
leaders cut the yellow ribbons on the doors of the new sanctuary. 
</P>
<P>
	The congregation had long since outgrown the old, 750-seat  
building, with its cracked ceiling and creaky floors. The new 
building can accommodate both a 150-member choir and 1,800 in its 
oak pews, all of which were filled during the first worship 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now we'll be able to do what we did (Sunday) -- let as many  
people come in as want to. We won't have to turn them away,'' said 
the Rev. Joseph Roberts Jr., the church's senior pastor. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither King's widow, Coretta Scott King, nor any of his  
children were at the service. 
</P>
<P>
	For years, Ebenezer was the cradle of the civil rights movement,  
serving as one of the places where black leaders plotted 
strategies. Both King, his father and grandfather once preached 
from Ebenezer's pulpit. 
</P>
<P>
	The ceremony was bittersweet for many of the church's members,  
including Jethro English, an 86-year-old deacon who joined Ebenezer 
in 1925. 
</P>
<P>
	As a young boy, English was baptized at Ebenezer and it's where  
he and his wife of 61 years were married by the Rev. Martin Luther 
King Sr. He was a pallbearer at the younger King's funeral and was 
sitting in the choir when Mrs. King was slain. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are so many precious memories there,'' English said.  
``I've seen the tragedies and I've seen the victories.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he added, ``The new sanctuary is a dream come true.''  
</P>
<P>
	For decades, Ebenezer has anchored the surrounding area known as  
``Sweet Auburn,'' once a center of black business that has since 
fallen on hard times. The neighborhood is where King grew up and is 
buried. 
</P>
<P>
	Each year, nearly a half million people visit the historic  
church. 
</P>
<P>
	With its faded red brick facade, the historic Ebenezer stands in  
stark contrast to the Afrocentric architecture of the New Horizon 
Sanctuary, with its modern look and towering windows. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Park Service, which already runs the visitor's  
center at the Martin Luther King Jr. National Historic Site, will 
assume responsibility for the preservation of Ebenezer. The Park 
Service will offer tours, lectures, book signings and other 
programs at the church. 
</P>
<P>
	Political and social action will remain a focus of the new  
church's activity, Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The mandate from Dr. King is still very much ours,'' he said.

	EU, U.S. Clash in WTO Meeting  
</P>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- The United States and the European Union made  
their cases before the World Trade Organization today over hefty 
U.S. sanctions imposed amid the bitter trans-Atlantic banana trade 
row. The EU denounces the U.S. sanctions, but Washington insists it 
has the right to take the step due to EU reluctance to change 
import policies that American banana sellers say squeeze them out 
of the European market. The WTO summoned all its 134 member 
countries to the meeting requested by the EU to discuss the U.S. 
sanctions. But many members fear the high-profile meeting will only 
worsen the dispute between the two most powerful WTO members.

	BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- Hezbollah will not accept any temporary  
truce in south Lebanon during the run-up to Israel's May 17 
elections, the Shiite Muslim group's leader was quoted today as 
saying. Sheik Hassan Nasrallah also told the leftist As-Safir 
newspaper that Hezbollah would not go along with any amendments to 
a 1996 U.S.-brokered understanding barring Israel and Lebanese 
guerrillas from attacking civilian areas or launching attacks from 
them. The hard-line Hezbollah stance came amid reports that Martin 
Indyk, a U.S. assistant secretary of state, would visit Lebanon

figure Susan McDougal insists she has no information on President 
Clinton and the first lady's business dealings in Arkansas. Mrs. 
McDougal already has served 18 months on a civil contempt citation, 
and she goes on trial today for refusing to answer Independent 
Counsel Kenneth Starr's questions about the Clintons. If convicted, 
she could be sent back to prison and fined up to $750,000. But her

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Will Fix Privacy Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Reacting to privacy concerns over a flaw in  
Windows that could be used to trace the authorship of some 
electronic documents, Microsoft promised late Monday to offer 
software to strip out an identifying number that is planted partly 
within computer files. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven Sinofsky, a vice president for Microsoft's Office  
products, said the company also almost certainly will offer a patch 
for the tens of millions of customers who use its popular 
collection of Office 97 business programs, which include Word and 
Excel. 
</P>
<P>
	That software fix, to be administered by customers themselves,  
would prevent the identifier number from being quietly embedded 
within electronic documents in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``We take these things very seriously,'' Sinofsky said.  
</P>
<P>
	The company previously promised only to allow customers to  
remove the serial number from their computers, not from individual 
documents, such as business letters and spreadsheets. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft confirmed over the weekend that its latest version of  
Windows generates a unique serial number for each computer that is 
partly planted within some documents. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the company also acknowledged it may have been  
harvesting those serial numbers from customers -- along with their 
names and addresses -- even when customers had explicitly indicated 
they didn't want the numbers disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Privacy groups complained that the list of serial numbers,  
together with names and addresses, could be used to trace 
electronic documents to a specific computer even when an author 
wished to remain anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard M. Smith of Brookline, Mass., the software programmer  
who first noticed the numbers hidden within his Microsoft files, 
compared the situation to a person's Social Security number being 
stamped on every document he creates. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said Monday that Microsoft was acting appropriately.  
</P>
<P>
	``For the document problem, that's what they need to do,'' Smith  
said. ``There are a lot of documents that already have the stuff in 
it. You don't want to be storing those (numbers) in there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those numbers are part of a 32-digit identifier created by  
Windows 98 whenever customers register their new software with 
Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said late Monday it still was investigating whether  
it might be inadvertently collecting the numbers during the 
electronic registration process for Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a letter posted to its Web site, Microsoft promised to  
change the procedure ``to not send the hardware ID, unless the user 
checks the option to send hardware information to Microsoft.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It acknowledged ``there are hypothetical scenarios in which this  
number could be used to learn something about the user's system 
without his or her knowledge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The number appears in a log of information transmitted to  
Microsoft, even when customers say they don't want details about 
their computers sent to the company. 
</P>
<P>
	The controversy was aggravated by the prominence of Microsoft's  
products: Its bundle of affected business programs is used by 
nearly 90 percent of consumers of such programs, and its dominant 
Windows operating systems run most of the world's personal 
computers.

<HEADLINE> Gwynn's Hit Parade Nears 3,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEORIA, Ariz. (AP) -- If Tony Gwynn could script his 3,000th hit,  
it would come at home in front of a packed house. Camera flashes 
would be going off all over the stadium, sort of like when Mark 
McGwire and Sammy Sosa stepped to the plate last season. 
</P>
<P>
	The only difference is, Gwynn wants the ball to stay in the  
yard. He wants to get it back and doesn't want to have to pay for 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	He'd be more than content with a nice little grounder to his  
favorite spot -- between shortstop and third base, or the ``5.5 
hole,'' as he calls it. 
</P>
<P>
	``A base hit for me would be, I think, textbook, because it's  
what I've done pretty much through my whole career,'' said the San 
Diego Padres batting star, who enters the season 72 hits from the 
milestone. 
</P>
<P>
	Going the opposite way means the left-hander is dialed in, which  
he wasn't for a good deal of 1998. He still hit .321, an average 
that most major leaguers would kill for, but it was the first time 
in six seasons that he hit lower than .353. And it was a dropoff of 
51 points from 1997, when he hit .372 to win his fourth straight NL 
batting title, and eighth overall. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn went through a couple of 0-for-14 slumps, tying the worst  
of his career, then saw one drag on to 0-for-19. Just as he was 
pulling out of an 8-for-52 slump, he went on the disabled list with 
an Achilles' injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was inconsistent last year,'' Gwynn said. ``There were  
periods when my mechanics were just terrible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	How does a guy who's topped .300 for 16 straight seasons  
struggle? 
</P>
<P>
	``I tell you what, I did not know,'' said Gwynn, a lifetime .339  
hitter who suffered along with the rest of the Padres' offense for 
most of the year, relying on the pitching staff to help carry the 
team to the World Series. ``We would be wracking our brains 
wondering what the hell was going on. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't care how many years you hit .300, how many things  
you've done on the offensive end, if you're in the middle of the 
rut, it's hard, man, it's hard to get out because you just don't 
think you can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn finally did in the World Series, but by then, he was one  
of the few Padres on his game. He hit .500, going 8-for-16, and 
homered off David Wells in the opener at Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was really the best run I had of the last two months,''  
Gwynn said. ``So the postseason did a lot for my confidence, 
because I was doing exactly what I wanted to do. They came in, I'd 
let it go. If they were going away, I'd carve it to left. I hope I 
can back to doing that. But mentally, man, I was beat up at the 
end. I couldn't understand why I was sucking gas like I was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Batting coach Merv Rettenmund said Gwynn pulled the ball a lot  
in batting practice last year instead of hitting it crisply to 
left. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was not one of his most consistent years here,''  
Rettenmund said. ``That's tough to say when someone hits whatever 
he hits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn turns 39 on May 9, a few weeks before he hopes to get his  
3,000th hit. He said he worked hard during the winter, watching 
tape, hitting in the cage, hitting off a tee. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was unbelievable,'' Rettenmund said. ``He hit every day. I  
bet he hit twice on some days. There's no one who hits 300, 320 
days a year. That's why he's what he is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And there's a reason Gwynn swings for that spot between third  
and short. 
</P>
<P>
	``Early on in my career, I could run, I could really run,'' he  
said. ``I knew if I could make that shortstop go in that hole to 
get it, he couldn't throw me out. And then as I got older, it was 
like hey, I've got to get it through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn has a little patch with ``5.5 hole'' sewn on the tongue of  
his shoes. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I've stepped up to the plate, I've had catchers say `Hey,  
T, what's the 5.5 hole?' and I say, `Hold on a few minutes and 
you'll see.' That's where I made my living, on the left side. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still have it put on my shoes, but last year I just  
completely got away from it. I didn't execute. This spring I'm 
trying to get back to doing that.''

<HEADLINE> DiMaggio's Estranged Son Gets Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOLLYWOOD, Fla. (AP) -- Despite an estranged relationship in  
recent years, Joe DiMaggio did not forget his only child in death. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the items bequeathed in DiMaggio's last will and testament  
is a trust fund that will pay Joseph Paul DiMaggio Jr. $20,000 a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio Jr., who works in a Northern California junkyard and  
lives in a trailer, said last month he hasn't seen his father in 
about two years. He did not visit his father's bedside during the 
Hall of Famer's illness. 
</P>
<P>
	The bequest, in a will signed May 21, 1996, appeared to be the  
smallest gift in the document, which also established trust funds 
for DiMaggio's two grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
	Great-grandchildren Kendahl R. Stein and Mitchell J. Stein each  
received trusts of $250,000. Great-granddaughters Valerie F. Hamra 
and Vanessa S. Hamra received trusts of $500,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
	Yankee Clipper Enterprises, a company wholly owned by DiMaggio,  
was to be liquidated as soon as possible and the money poured into 
his residuary estate -- whatever money remains after the specific 
bequests. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio Jr.'s trust is slated to get 45 percent of the  
residuary estate. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty percent of the residuary estate was slated for the trust  
fund of granddaughter Paula Sue DiMaggio. The remaining 15 percent 
will be set aside for his other granddaughter, Katherine Marie 
DiMaggio. Both are the adopted daughters of DiMaggio Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	Paula Sue also is to receive all the silver, china, linen,  
jewelry, furniture and cars belonging to DiMaggio at the time of 
his death. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris Engelberg, DiMaggio's ``dear friend and attorney,'' was  
named personal representative and attorney of the estate, as well 
as trustee for all the trusts. He is entitled to ``reasonable 
compensation'' for acting as trustee, but a specific amount was not 
listed. 
</P>
<P>
	The will called for Engelberg to handle the licensing and use of  
all DiMaggio memorabilia -- baseballs, T-shirts, photographs, mugs, 
jerseys, bats and baseball gloves. 
</P>
<P>
	Another Joseph DiMaggio, the son of the baseball great's dead  
brother Mike, was left $100,000.

<HEADLINE> DiMaggio: Remembering a Quiet Hero </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Near the end of his career, at a time when his body often ached  
from nagging injuries, Joe DiMaggio was asked whether he wasn't 
occasionally tempted to relax on the field, to coast for a couple 
of innings. 
</P>
<P>
	His answer spoke volumes about the kind of player he was.  
</P>
<P>
	``Never,'' he said. ``Somebody might be out there, watching me  
for the first time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joe D. didn't want any fan, new or old, to feel disappointed.  
</P>
<P>
	The first time I saw DiMaggio in 1947, I was disappointed so I  
booed him. Not because he didn't live up to expectations. Quite the 
opposite. 
</P>
<P>
	He rattled a double off the left field wall at New York's Polo  
Grounds, helping the Yankees beat my team, the New York Giants, in 
the annual Mayor's Trophy game. 
</P>
<P>
	That did not sit well with this 8-year-old, seeing his first  
major league baseball game. 
</P>
<P>
	So I booed perhaps the most graceful, classic player of his  
time. Booed him good. 
</P>
<P>
	Years later, when I knew better, I felt guilty. Joe D. was not  
to be booed. He was to be admired, not only for his skills, which 
were plentiful, but for his style, which was special. 
</P>
<P>
	For one generation of New York fans, the debate raged over  
baseball's best center fielder -- Willie, Mickey or the Duke. 
</P>
<P>
	For the generation before that one, there was no argument. It  
was Joe D. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio played baseball with a sense of dignity. He rarely  
showed emotion. He would never think of standing at home plate, 
admiring his home runs. That would be showing up the pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
	He would never preen and prance the way modern players often do.  
There were no contrived gestures, no punching the air, no pointing 
to the sky. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio would simply put his head down and trot around the  
bases, shake hands as he crossed the plate, and head for the 
dugout. He was the quintessential professional, dignified and 
gracious, a quiet hero. 
</P>
<P>
	He covered center field so effortlessly. He would glide after  
the ball with long, classic strides, loping across the outfield 
like a gazelle. Maybe that's why they called him the Yankee 
Clipper. He was never out of position, never caught napping. 
</P>
<P>
	None of this was a particularly big deal with him. He played  
poker-faced baseball, effortlessly and expressionless. 
</P>
<P>
	The only exception was in the 1947 World Series against the  
Brooklyn Dodgers, when he hit a ball to the deepest part of left 
field at Yankee Stadium with two men on base. Al Gionfriddo, a 
journeyman outfielder who had just entered the game, ran it down 
and made the catch in front of the bullpen, just as DiMaggio was 
reaching second base. Joe D. kicked the dirt in disgust. It was a 
rare peek behind the public facade. 
</P>
<P>
	Years after his record 56-game hitting streak, DiMaggio revealed  
the pressure he felt. ``I was able to control myself,'' he said. 
``That doesn't mean I wasn't dying inside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He demanded that on Oldtimers' Day at Yankee Stadium, he always  
be the last to be introduced, as a gesture to his status. In 1968, 
the year Mickey Mantle retired, the club chose to introduce Mantle 
last. DiMaggio viewed it as a slight, and it strained his 
relationship with the front office for years. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio was a private man, on the field and off. At one  
Oldtimers' Day at Yankee Stadium, many of his ex-teammates gathered 
in a lounge near the clubhouse, telling stories to and about one 
another. DiMaggio sat alone at a corner table, a solitary figure. 
</P>
<P>
	And yet, his closest friend when he played was pitcher Lefty  
Gomez, the perpetual life of the party. ``I wish I could be like 
Lefty,'' he once confided to restaurateur Toots Shor. 
</P>
<P>
	But he couldn't. It just wasn't in him.  
</P>
<P>
	If you gained his confidence, he could be a charming  
storyteller. Once, when I asked him about his 56-game hitting 
streak, DiMaggio lit up as he told an anecdote, laughing as he 
recalled the details. 
</P>
<P>
	The only subject that was off-limits was his short, stormy  
marriage to Marilyn Monroe. 
</P>
<P>
	Years after Monroe's death, DiMaggio came to the offices of The  
Associated Press for an interview. When he arrived, he saw a 
poster-sized picture of Monroe -- the famous AP photo of her skirts 
billowing as she stood over a subway grating -- hanging in the hall. 
Seething, he made an immediate U-turn and left the building. 
</P>
<P>
	For DiMaggio, privacy was always hard to maintain.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, he was flying from Miami to New York to throw out the  
first ball at the World Series. Arriving at the gate for his 
flight, he was ushered across the hall, seated out of the way at an 
empty gate, where he could remain fairly undisturbed. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio was recognizable, everywhere he went. Once, I walked  
one block with him in Manhattan, heading from his hotel to an 
appearance at Radio City Music Hall. In the streets, he must have 
been stopped a half-dozen times by vendors, cabbies, pedestrians, 
all calling to him, ``Hey, Joe D., how you doin'?'' 
</P>
<P>
	And that was more than 40 years after he played his last game.  
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio responded with a wave and a smile. He enjoyed the  
acclaim. Nobody deserved it more.

<HEADLINE> Japan Banks Promise Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Major Japanese banks assured a government  
commission Monday they would post profits next fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	The assurances came at hearings before a government commission  
that will be doling out taxpayer money to help debt-plagued banks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Financial Reconstruction Commission required the executives  
from 15 banks that have applied for the bailout to explain how much 
bad loans they were writing off as well as what kind of changes 
they planned to carry out to boost profitability. 
</P>
<P>
	They were also asked about their plans for repaying the public  
funds. 
</P>
<P>
	The massive bad debt problem at Japan's top banks are leftover  
from the excessive lending of the late 1980s and early 1990s. 
Fixing the problem is viewed as a crucial step toward turning 
around the economy, mired in the worst recession in decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Friday, the banks formally asked the commission for a total  
of $61 billion in public assistance. Based on the hearings Monday, 
the commission will set the terms on the bailout on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Each of the banks, including the Industrial Bank of Japan and  
the Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, predicted that they expect losses for the 
fiscal year ending March 31 but that they see profits for the next 
fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	The banks also said that the public funds will help them boost  
lending to cash-strapped Japanese companies and individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank told the commission it expects a parent net  
profit of about $415 million next fiscal year, although it expects 
a loss of $3.2 billion this fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	Sakura Bank expects its parent will earn about $620 million next  
fiscal year, compared with a loss of $3 billion this year.

<HEADLINE> White House Targets Farm Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is announcing a  
final strategy for reducing pollution from so-called factory farms, 
but environmentalists said Monday it doesn't go far enough or fast 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan to control pollution from cattle feedlots, poultry  
farms and large hog farms will serve as a blueprint for tighter 
regulations to be developed over the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the more stringent requirements, including compliance  
with permits under tougher federal standards, would not go into 
effect until 2002 and in some cases several years after that, 
environmentalists complained. 
</P>
<P>
	``It does nothing in the near term to address the serious  
shortcomings of current animal waste practices,'' said Joe Rudek, a 
scientist for the Environmental Defense Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan, a draft of which was unveiled last September, was to  
be announced Tuesday by Vice President Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	``This comprehensive strategy tackles a major threat to water  
quality. Through tough standards and flexible new approaches, we 
can ensure communities across the country cleaner, safer water,'' 
Gore planned to tell environmental and agricultural leaders who 
were invited to the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials said the plan will require thousands of  
additional facilities to get permits and develop nutrient 
management plans. While many of the regulations will not go into 
effect until after 2001, thousands of additional operators will 
have to get permits under existing standards. 
</P>
<P>
	The broad outline is similar to a draft version released last  
September. 
</P>
<P>
	The Environmental Protection Agency is to develop the new  
technology standards for reducing pollution, mostly nutrient runoff 
into lakes and streams. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, called it ``a giant leap toward holding  
the biggest livestock producers accountable for water pollution,'' 
including large poultry processors and operators of large, 
concentrated hog farms. 
</P>
<P>
	But environmentalists, who have called for a moratorium on new  
permits for such facilities, were not as enthusiastic. 
</P>
<P>
	Kathryn Hohmann of the Sierra Club said the plan provides ``no  
real protection of groundwater'' and fails to adequately address 
pollution from open-air manure lagoons. 
</P>
<P>
	``Instead of cleaning up, the plan will have many of the largest  
factory farms writing up strategies for storing and disposing large 
volumes of manure, based on existing federal waste management 
standards and practices,'' the Environmental Defense Fund said in a 
statement.

<HEADLINE> Harvard Prof. Pays Homage to Joe D. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In our sagas, mourning may include celebration  
when the hero dies, not young and unfulfilled on the battlefield, 
but rich in years and replete with honor. And yet the passing of 
Joe DiMaggio has evoked, in me, a primary feeling of sadness for 
something precious that cannot be restored -- a loss not only of the 
man, but also of the splendid image he represented. 
</P>
<P>
	I first saw DiMaggio play near the end of his career in 1950,  
when I was 8 and Joe was having his last great season, batting .301 
with 32 homers and 122 RBIs. He became my hero, my model, and my 
mentor, all rolled up into one remarkable man. (I longed to be his 
replacement in center field, but a guy named Mickey Mantle came 
along and beat me out of the job). DiMaggio remained my primary 
hero to the day of his death, and through all the vicissitudes of 
Ms. Monroe, Mr. Coffee, and Mrs. Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with my untutored child's eyes, I could sense something  
supremely special about DiMaggio's play. I didn't even know the 
words or their meanings, but I grasped, in some visceral way, his 
gracefulness, and I knew that an aura of majesty surrounded all his 
actions. He played every aspect of baseball with a fluid beauty in 
minimal motion, a spare elegance that made even his swinging 
strikeouts look beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
	His stance, his home run trot, those long flyouts to left-center  
in Yankee Stadium, his apparently effortless loping run -- he was no 
hot dog -- to arrive under every catchable fly ball at exactly the 
right place and time for an ``easy'' out. If the sports cliche of 
``poetry in motion'' ever held real meaning, DiMaggio must have 
been the intended prototype. 
</P>
<P>
	You cannot extract the essence of DiMaggio's special excellence  
from the heartless figures of his statistical accomplishments. He 
did not play long enough to amass leading numbers in any category -- 
only 13 full seasons from 1936 to 1951, with prime years lost to 
war, and a fierce pride that led him to retire the moment his 
skills began to erode. 
</P>
<P>
	He sacrificed records to the customs of his time. He hit a  
career high .381 in 1939, but would probably have finished well 
over .400 if manager Joe McCarthy hadn't insisted that he play 
every day in the meaningless last few weeks, long after the Yanks 
had clinched the pennant. DiMaggio, who was at .408 on Sept. 8, had 
developed such serious sinus problems that he lost sight in one 
eye, could not visualize in three dimensions, and consequently 
slipped nearly 30 points in his batting average. In those different 
days, if you could walk, you played. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio's one transcendent numerical record -- his 56-game  
hitting streak in 1941 -- deserves the usual accolade of most 
remarkable sporting episode of the century, Mark McGwire 
notwithstanding. 
</P>
<P>
	Several years ago, I performed a fancy statistical analysis on  
the data of slumps and streaks, and found that only DiMaggio's 
shouldn't have happened. All other streaks fall within the 
expectations for great events that should happen once as a 
consequence of probabilities, just as an honest coin will come up 
heads 10 times in a row once in a very rare while. But no one 
should ever have hit in 56 straight games. Second place stands at a 
distant 44, a figure reached by Pete Rose and Wee Willie Keeler. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio's greatest record is therefore all heart, not the rare  
expectation of luck. We must also remember that third baseman Ken 
Keltner robbed DiMaggio of two hits in the 57th game, and that he 
then went on to hit safely in 16 straight games thereafter. 
DiMaggio also compiled a 61-game hit streak when he played for the 
San Francisco Seals in the minor Pacific Coast League. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio was a man of few words, but wholly possessed of  
integrity and refinement on and off the field. 
</P>
<P>
	One afternoon in 1950, I sat next to my father near the third  
base line in Yankee Stadium. DiMaggio fouled a ball in our 
direction and my father caught it. We mailed the precious relic to 
the great man and, sure enough, he sent it back with his signature. 
That ball remains my proudest possession to this day. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty years later, during my successful treatment for a  
supposedly incurable cancer, I received a small square box in the 
mail from a friend and book publisher in San Francisco, and a 
golfing partner of DiMaggio. I opened the box and found another 
ball, signed to me by DiMaggio (at my friend's instigation) and 
wishing me well in my recovery. What a thrill and privilege -- to 
tie my beginning and middle life together through the good wishes 
of this great man. 
</P>
<P>
	Ted Williams is, appropriately, neither a modest nor succinct  
man. When asked recently to compare himself with his rival and 
contemporary DiMaggio, the greatest batter in history simply 
replied: ``I was a better hitter, he was a better player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Simon and Garfunkel were right in singing, ``Where have you  
gone, Joe DiMaggio? A nation turns its lonely eyes to you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was the glory of a time that we will not see again.  
</P>
<P>
	NOTE: Harvard professor and author Stephen Jay Gould, a lifelong  
fan of Joe DiMaggio, wrote this tribute for The Associated Press. 
His most recent best seller is ``Questioning the Millennium.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Brings Carpool Into Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Carpooling is not usually part of a ride to  
the White House. But it is part of Vice President Al Gore's agenda 
for 2000 and beyond, as he seeks to succeed President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Like president, like vice president. So far, anyhow. Gore is  
delivering small-scale administration proposals, doling them out 
much as Clinton did in campaigning for his second term. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest, aimed at easing traffic jams, or directing commuters  
to ways around the roadblocks, is one in a series due this week and 
next. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president will be announcing steps to help passengers  
cope with the frustrations of flying, another step in the 
administration's clean water plan, a proposal to make prescription 
labels more easily understandable. 
</P>
<P>
	Nothing major, but all pieces of what the administration bills  
as a quality-of-life initiative, a certain theme in the Gore 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	To Gore's advantage against his only current challenger for the  
Democratic nomination in 2000, former Sen. Bill Bradley, his office 
provides a platform no rival can match. Clinton has given his vice 
president the franchise to announce national ideas like the traffic 
control plan he presented Monday -- plus aid, disaster relief and 
other programs with a special impact in crucial early presidential 
primary states. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has proclaimed Gore the most influential achiever ever  
to serve as vice president. ``The best partner and friend, adviser 
and prodder any president could ever have,'' Clinton calls him. 
</P>
<P>
	And in the best office for a promotion. Vice presidents seeking  
to be nominated for president almost always are. The last exception 
was Alben Barkley in 1952, and he was 74 at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	That doesn't apply to the next step. Richard Nixon in 1960 and  
Hubert H. Humphrey in 1968 were defeated in the general election. 
George Bush won in 1988. Vice presidents can inherit problems, too. 
An economic slump dampened Nixon's first, losing campaign. Eight 
years later, he beat Humphrey, in part because the vice president 
would not stray from administration policy on the war in Vietnam. 
Bush tried to sound like Ronald Reagan-plus on taxes, leading to 
his ``read my lips'' campaign vow that he'd veto any increase, on 
which he reneged as president and suffered for it in the 1992 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The political art form is to remain the loyal No. 2 man while  
establishing an independent campaign identity, no easy balancing 
act. Especially for a vice president seeking to share the credit 
for the thriving economy and budget surpluses -- without being seen 
as only another chapter in the Clinton administration. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, those piecemeal proposals will do. They put his name  
out front, and they deal with some of the things that rankle 
Americans most because they are so commonplace. Together, they add 
up to a $1 billion administration plan to make everyday life better 
and safer. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton is filling in some of the pieces -- his push for 85  
percent automobile seat belt use, for example, and his announcement 
of new regulations to standardize car seats for children. Gore is 
getting his share, too, like the proposal for $700 million to 
promote parks and open space in and around cities. 
</P>
<P>
	And, of course, Monday's effort to ease the lives of commuters  
stuck in worsening traffic congestion that the government says 
affects 41 percent of peak hour travel. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why do we call it rush hour, because as we all know, it lasts  
for more than an hour and there's not much rushing except from 
bumper to bumper?'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	So the vice president proposed a new, nationwide three-digit  
telephone number, 211 or 511, that drivers can dial for information 
on traffic tie-ups and for public transit data. Plus tax breaks 
that would enable employers to offer workers up to $240 a month in 
incentives to join carpools or take trains or buses instead of 
driving on jammed highways. 
</P>
<P>
	``We simply don't have to accept steadily worsening congestion,  
steadily longer traffic jams as an inevitable part of America's way 
of life,'' Gore said. ``We know how to change it, and by working 
together we can and will change it.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE>  Bosnia Serb Premier Eases Stance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) -- Signaling an easing of  
tensions, the premier of Bosnia's Serbs today softened his threat 
to resign following an international ruling that removed a 
strategic city from Serb control. 
</P>
<P>
	Premier Milorad Dodik said he would ``reconsider'' the  
resignation of his government following last week's announcement 
that the city of Brcko (BIRCH-ko) would be placed under joint Serb, 
Muslim and Croat authority. 
</P>
<P>
	Dodik's comments -- and his praise of the international official  
who announced the Brcko ruling -- appeared to lessen the prospects 
of a breakdown of relations between Bosnia's Serbs and 
international officials in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, it raised the specter of renewed splits  
between Bosnian Serb moderates, like Dodik, and hard-liners who 
oppose cooperation with Croats and Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, the Serbs said they would boycott participation in  
joint national institutions with Bosnia's other ethnic groups to 
protest the Brcko ruling and the dismissal of their elected 
president, Nikola Poplasen. 
</P>
<P>
	Bosnian Serb lawmakers decided Sunday in an emergency session to  
suspend cooperation with Bosnia's Muslims and Croats after the 
international rulings, which have sparked violent protests since 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Poplasen told The Associated Press that the decision on Brcko  
``annuls'' the 1995 Dayton agreement, which ended the 3 1/2-year 
Bosnian war. 
</P>
<P>
	That accord divided Bosnia into Serb and Muslim-Croat republics,  
but its cornerstone was the concept of a multiethnic state. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bosnian Serb decision in effect reopens the ethnic divisions  
that the Dayton accord and years of international supervision were 
supposed to overcome. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bosnian-Serb lawmakers, in a 62-16 vote, instructed Serb  
officials to ``cease their work'' with the Muslim-Croat republic 
until the international decisions are reversed. 
</P>
<P>
	In separate votes, the lawmakers declared Poplasen's dismissal  
unconstitutional and ``therefore not accepted.'' They also rejected 
the decision on Brcko, calling it ``unjust and completely against 
the Dayton peace agreement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the northern town of Doboj, several thousand Serbs rallied  
Sunday to protest both the loss of Brcko and the decision to 
dismiss Poplasen. 
</P>
<P>
	Carlos Westendorp, the chief international official in Bosnia  
who oversees the Dayton accord, fired Poplasen for refusing to 
officially name moderate Dodik as prime minister in the 
Bosnian-Serb republic. Dodik has served as caretaker premier since 
Poplasen defeated a pro-Western candidate in September elections. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Brcko issue aroused such passion among Bosnian Serbs  
that Dodik announced his own resignation from the caretaker post to 
protest the decision, then today said without elaboration that he 
would reconsider stepping down. 
</P>
<P>
	Control of Brcko was left unresolved in the Dayton agreement  
because of the strong claims by each of Bosnia's three communities 
-- Serbs, Croats and Muslims. Bosnian Serbs overran the city in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
	During Sunday's parliament session, Dodik appealed for  
international officials to change the decision on Brcko. ``We 
cannot accept that this is absolutely a done deal,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But a spokeswoman for Westendorp said that the Brcko decision  
cannot be reversed, although revisions are possible. 
</P>
<P>
	Westendorp said NATO peacekeepers will enforce the decision if  
Poplasen continues to refuse to leave the post. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has to go,'' Westendorp was quoted as saying by the Spanish  
daily El Pais. ``If he doesn't do it on good terms, the local 
security forces will have to remove him. And if they can't do it, 
it'll be the international forces who do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NATO troops remained on alert Sunday and the U.S. Embassy urged  
Americans in Bosnian Serb territory to consider leaving.

<HEADLINE> Japan Justice Minister Steps Down </HEADLINE>

<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's justice minister stepped down today amid a  
political storm over his handling of Arnold Schwarzenegger's entry 
into the country without a passport. 
</P>
<P>
	Shozaburo Nakamura, 64, offered his resignation to Prime  
Minister Keizo Obuchi, apologizing for sparking strident protests 
by opposition lawmakers that paralyzed Parliament last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Schwarzenegger flap was only the latest in a string of  
controversies ensnaring Nakamura, including his criticism of the 
country's pacifist constitution and his alleged role in a real 
estate scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am sorry my words and actions hindered the workings of  
Parliament,'' Nakamura was quoted as saying by Kyodo News service. 
</P>
<P>
	The resignation was the second to hit Obuchi's government since  
he took office last summer. But the prime minister's rising 
popularity ratings indicated his government was not in danger of 
falling. 
</P>
<P>
	National broadcaster NHK reported that Obuchi had picked upper  
house lawmaker Takao Jinnouchi, 65, as Nakamura's replacement. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unfortunate the situation had to come to this,'' Obuchi  
was quoted as telling reporters by Kyodo News agency. 
</P>
<P>
	The Schwarzenegger controversy centers on allegations that  
Nakamura, a fan of the former weightlifter, took home ministry 
documents that permitted the actor to enter Japan last October 
without a passport. 
</P>
<P>
	The documents should have been filed with the ministry, but  
critics say Nakamura kept them as a souvenir. Nakamura reportedly 
said an aide simply neglected to file the paperwork properly. 
</P>
<P>
	Two Parliamentary committee meetings were canceled Friday  
because the chief opposition party, the Democratic Party of Japan, 
and two smaller parties threatened to boycott them if Nakamura 
didn't step down. A formal censure motion has also been discussed. 
</P>
<P>
	Nakamura gave Schwarzenegger permission to enter the country  
through an airport in Osaka, in western Japan, on Oct. 27, though 
he did not have his passport. The star said later it was stolen 
just before he left the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Schwarzenegger, who has appeared in Japanese television  
commercials for instant noodles, beer and cable TV, was in Japan to 
attend an opening ceremony for a Universal Studios theme park. 
</P>
<P>
	Opposition parties welcomed the minister's resignation and  
called on the Obuchi administration to take responsibility for the 
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	Nakamura was ``unqualified'' to be justice minister, said  
Tsutomu Hata, a former prime minister and secretary general of the 
opposition Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
	``This calls into question the validity of Obuchi's power  
itself,'' Hata was quoted by Kyodo as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	The paperwork dispute added to Nakamura's declining popularity.  
In January, he was criticized after suggesting in a widely reported 
speech to members of his ministry that Japan should revise its 
U.S.-written constitution to allow it more military freedom. 
</P>
<P>
	``Japanese are writhing because they cannot revise the  
constitution, which was imposed by Allied forces so that the 
country would not be allowed to wage war, defend itself or have an 
army,'' Nakamura was quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	He later retracted the remark, which angered many Japanese who  
consider the pacifist constitution a guarantee against the 
militarist policies that led to the devastating defeat of World War 
II. 
</P>
<P>
	Nakamura also reportedly criticized U.S. economic policy in the  
speech, comparing it to attacking an adversary with ``atomic bombs 
and missiles when another country looks to be winning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The comment was seen as a possible irritant to already-tense  
U.S.-Japan trade relations. 
</P>
<P>
	The first official under Obuchi to resign was the head of  
Japan's Defense Agency, Fukushiro Nukaga, who stepped down in 
November amid a scandal over procurement contracts for military 
equipment.

<HEADLINE> Tycoon Appeals BCCI Conviction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- An imprisoned Pakistani shipping tycoon on Monday  
appealed his 1997 conviction in the fraud that led to the 
spectacular failure of the Bank of Credit and Commerce 
International. 
</P>
<P>
	Abbas Gokal is serving a 14-year sentence for two counts of  
conspiracy -- plotting to commit false accounting and conspiring to 
defraud BCCI -- in a fraudulent scheme that funneled $1.2 billion 
out of the bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Gokal, 62, received the steepest sentence of its kind to be  
meted out by a British court. At the sentencing, the judge said 
Gokal's actions had threatened the integrity of the entire 
international banking system. 
</P>
<P>
	Gokal was present at London's Law Courts for the start of a  
hearing before three Court of Appeal judges. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the main grounds of his appeal centers on the  
circumstances in which he was brought within this jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
	Gokal was arrested in July 1994 in Frankfurt, Germany, as his  
flight from Karachi, Pakistan, to the United States stopped for 
refueling. He was extradited to Britain in December 1994 and went 
on trial in September. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors convicted him after hearing prosecutors from Britain's  
Serious Fraud Office contend that he had siphoned the money out of 
BCCI and then used it to pay for private jets, fancy homes and 
Rolls-Royces. 
</P>
<P>
	Gokal said he was innocent and had to use public assistance to  
get legal representation. 
</P>
<P>
	Gokal's Gulf Group, a Middle East shipping company, was the  
biggest borrower from BCCI. He and his brothers, Mustafa and 
Murtaza, once controlled more than 100 shipping vessels in the 
Middle East, but their financial empire ran into trouble in the 
late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	For years, BCCI kept giving them money and juggled its books to  
try to cover up the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Accountant Abdul Chiragh, from southern England, was found  
guilty of setting up bogus accounts in the names of offshore 
companies. He was sentenced to 5 1/2 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Mustafa and Murtaza Gokal have avoided prosecution by staying in  
Pakistan, which has no extradition treaty with Britain. Other 
alleged conspirators are believed to be out of the reach of British 
justice, mostly in Pakistan.

<HEADLINE>  Baseball Great Joe DiMaggio Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOLLYWOOD, Fla. (AP) -- At Yankee Stadium and the White House,  
from Dodgertown to Cooperstown, Joe DiMaggio's friends and fans 
paid tribute to a man acclaimed as baseball's greatest living 
player. 
</P>
<P>
	The reign ended Monday, when DiMaggio died at home following a  
five-month battle with lung cancer. His legacy, however, survives. 
</P>
<P>
	``He became the very symbol of American grace, power and  
skill,'' President Clinton said. ``I have no doubt that when future 
generations look back at the best of America in the 20th century, 
they will think of the Yankee Clipper and all that he achieved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A funeral will be held Thursday in DiMaggio's native Northern  
California, with burial to follow in the San Francisco area. 
Meanwhile, eulogies poured in from ballfields and beyond with 
remembrances of The Streak and DiMaggio's many other achievements. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was to people all over the world what a baseball player was  
supposed to be like,'' said former Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you said to God, `Create someone who was what a baseball  
player should be,' God would have created Joe DiMaggio. And he 
did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To many, Joltin' Joe's death at age 84 marked the end of an era.  
The Yankees center fielder captivated and inspired a nation coping 
with the Depression and World War II, and his fame endured and even 
grew after retirement in 1951. 
</P>
<P>
	He was remembered for his elegance playing the most glamorous  
position in baseball on the most glamorous team in sports. 
</P>
<P>
	American flags at Yankee Stadium, including one in left field's  
hallowed Monument Park, were lowered to half staff. So was the Hall 
of Fame flag in Cooperstown, N.Y., where a wreath was placed around 
DiMaggio's plaque. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reverence for him was unsurpassed,'' said Hall of Fame  
spokesman Jeff Idelson. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio spent his final years in a waterfront residence, living  
alone until he became sick. He spent 99 days in a hospital before 
going home Jan. 19, and died barely one month shy of the Yankees' 
home opener, where he hoped to throw out the first ball. 
</P>
<P>
	At DiMaggio's bedside when he died were brother Dominick, a  
former major league outfielder; two grandchildren; and two friends. 
</P>
<P>
	His estranged relationship with his only child was reflected in  
his last will and testament. 
</P>
<P>
	A trust fund will pay $20,000 a year to Joseph Paul DiMaggio  
Jr., who works in a Northern California junkyard and lives in a 
trailer. The bequest appeared to be the smallest gift in the 
document, which by comparison established trust funds of $500,000 
apiece for two great-granddaughters. 
</P>
<P>
	An immigrant Italian fisherman's son, DiMaggio spent his entire  
13-year career with the Yankees. He played for 10 pennant winners 
and nine World Series champions, batting .325 lifetime with 361 
home runs. He won three AL Most Valuable Player awards, appeared in 
11 All-Star games and entered the Hall of Fame in 1955. 
</P>
<P>
	A handsome, quiet man who cherished his privacy, DiMaggio  
nonetheless ascended to the top rank of popular culture when he was 
briefly married to Marilyn Monroe in the mid-1950s. The reluctant 
celebrity blossomed from a mere ballplayer into an American icon 
cited in the works of Ernest Hemingway and Paul Simon. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio's place in baseball history was secure as early as  
1941, when he hit in 56 consecutive games -- one of the most 
enduring records in sports. A popular song of the day reflected the 
common sentiment: ``Joe, Joe DiMaggio, we want you on our side.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the 50th anniversary of the streak, DiMaggio expressed  
surprise he still held the record. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of great ballplayers,'' he said. ``One day,  
someone's going to come along and break it. But I've been saying 
that for 50 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There were other records, and there would have been even more  
had he not volunteered for the Army during World War II. He spent 
2 1/2 years in the Army's physical training program for air cadets. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, more than 30 years after they were written, the lyrics of  
the Simon and Garfunkel song ``Mrs. Robinson'' ring sad but true: 
</P>
<P>
	``Where have you gone Joe DiMaggio?  
</P>
<P>
	``A nation turns its lonely eyes to you.  
</P>
<P>
	``What's that you say, Mrs. Robinson?  
</P>
<P>
	``Joltin' Joe has left and gone away.''

<HEADLINE> Japan Banks Promise Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Major Japanese banks assured a government  
commission Monday they would post profits next fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	The assurances came at hearings before a government commission  
that will be doling out taxpayer money to help debt-plagued banks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Financial Reconstruction Commission required the executives  
from 15 banks that have applied for the bailout to explain how much 
bad loans they were writing off as well as what kind of changes 
they planned to carry out to boost profitability. 
</P>
<P>
	They were also asked about their plans for repaying the public  
funds. 
</P>
<P>
	The massive bad debt problem at Japan's top banks are leftover  
from the excessive lending of the late 1980s and early 1990s. 
Fixing the problem is viewed as a crucial step toward turning 
around the economy, mired in the worst recession in decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Friday, the banks formally asked the commission for a total  
of $61 billion in public assistance. Based on the hearings Monday, 
the commission will set the terms on the bailout on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Each of the banks, including the Industrial Bank of Japan and  
the Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, predicted that they expect losses for the 
fiscal year ending March 31 but that they see profits for the next 
fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	The banks also said that the public funds will help them boost  
lending to cash-strapped Japanese companies and individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank told the commission it expects a parent net  
profit of about $415 million next fiscal year, although it expects 
a loss of $3.2 billion this fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	Sakura Bank expects its parent will earn about $620 million next  
fiscal year, compared with a loss of $3 billion this year.

	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- The report from an independent inquiry  
into Sydney's successful bid for the 2000 Olympics will be delayed 
four days, organizing committee president Michael Knight said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight, who called for the audit of about 3,000 pages of bid  
documents after the bribes scandal engulfed the International 
Olympic Committee, said Tom Sheridan would release his findings on 
March 15. Sheridan had been expected to report on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Sony To Cut 17,000 Jobs by 2003 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The Sony Group on Tuesday announced it will cut  
17,000 jobs over the next four years as part of a sweeping 
restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
	The cuts, to be completed by March 2003, represent about 10  
percent of the Sony group's total work force, said company 
President Nobuyuki Idei. The cuts will come mostly from limiting 
the number of new employees Sony hires each year, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Sony will also eliminate 15 manufacturing facilities around the  
world, leaving it with 55 by 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	The cuts, intended to reduce costs and improve profitability,  
are part of broader changes in the way Sony will run its 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The company will reorganize its electronics business to reflect  
a gradual shift from traditional products such as TVs and portable 
stereos to laptop computers, digital cameras and video games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to evaluate what sort of businesses will create the  
most value in the long-term,'' said Idei. 
</P>
<P>
	Sony would ``invest aggressively'' in research, capital  
equipment and facilities to meet those changes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sony Computer Entertainment, which makes the popular PlayStation  
game consoles, will be made into a fully owned division of Sony 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Sony Computer Entertainment is currently run as a separate  
company and is equally owned by Sony and Sony Music Entertainment 
Japan Inc.. 
</P>
<P>
	Idei said new division would be one of ``four pillars'' of  
Sony's electronics business, which would also include a unit making 
TVs, VCRs and audio products; one focusing on cellular phones, 
computers and digital cameras; and another to develop the computer 
chips, batteries and disk dives used in a variety of Sony products. 
</P>
<P>
	The company will also buy up the shares of three publicly-traded  
affiliates -- Sony Music Entertainment, Sony Chemical Corp. and Sony 
Precision Technology Inc. -- to make them wholly owned subsidiaries. 
</P>
<P>
	The cuts and restructuring at Sony are the latest in a string of  
similar announcements throughout corporate Japan, which is trying 
to deal with this country's worst recession since World War II.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Falls, Japanese Stocks Sink / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar dropped against the yen today as U.S.  
banks and Japanese exporters sold the currency to take profits from 
last week's sharp rise, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 121.78 yen in late-afternoon trading, down  
1.16 yen from late Friday in Tokyo and below its New York level of 
122.80 yen late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average sank 114.95 points,  
or 0.77 percent, to close at 14,779.05 points. On Friday, the 
average jumped 710.55 points, or 5.0 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar rose against the yen last week after Japan's central  
bank pushed interest rates lower by flooding the short-term money 
market with funds. 
</P>
<P>
	The advance continued in early Asian trading today with the  
dollar climbing to as high as 123.18 yen, but investors began to 
sell when the rally appeared to have run out of steam, traders 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I returned from lunch and wondered what happened,'' said  
Hajime Sato, assistant general manager of the treasury department 
at Daiwa International Trust Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	``Apparently, after the dollar failed to touch 123.20 yen,  
players started profit taking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. currency was quoted as low as 121.50 yen in Tokyo.  
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 132.09 yen, down  
from 132.98 yen late Friday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo stocks plunged in late trading today, erasing a gain of  
more than 1 percent in the major index, on worries that the rise in 
the yen could erode profits for Japanese companies. 
</P>
<P>
	In the morning, the Nikkei rose to as high as 15,116.10 -- its  
first time above 15,000 since Dec. 10 -- following a 5 percent rally 
on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	But the average fell back on fears a stronger currency could rob  
Japan's giant exporters of earnings by making their products more 
expensive and less competitive overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	The decline accelerated as some companies sold shares which they  
hold in affiliated companies -- so-called ``cross-shareholdings'' -- 
to boost profits before the fiscal year ends this month. 
</P>
<P>
	``There still seems to be a lot of pressure from companies  
wanting to unwind cross-shareholdings above the 15,000 level,'' 
said Kunihiro Hatae, general manager at Tokyo Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section rose 1.03 points, or 0.09 percent, to 1,147.75 
points. The TOPIX closed up 41.61 points, or 3.76 percent, on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading on the main section of the Tokyo exchange was estimated  
at 649.37 million shares, slightly less than the 669.85 million 
shares traded on Friday. Declines outnumbered advances 658 to 538,

<HEADLINE> Fire Burns at L.A. Sports Arena </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A smoky fire devoured stacks of roofing  
insulation atop unfinished Staples Center on Monday, but damage was 
considered minor and there should be no delays in opening the new 
home for basketball's Los Angeles Lakers and Clippers, and hockey's 
Los Angeles Kings. 
</P>
<P>
	Black, greasy smoke spewed into the downtown sky from the arena  
shortly after 8 a.m. Fifty firefighters had the blaze out in 41 
minutes without injury, city fire spokesman Brian Humphrey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stacks of plastic-wrapped, 4-by-8-foot insulation sheets went up  
in flames. Arena spokesman Michael Roth said the loss is $25,000 to 
$50,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``The blaze was attributed to an electrical problem,'' although  
investigators did not immediately specify the problem, Humphrey 
said. ``We do know that there was wiring and cabling in the area.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The building appeared undamaged, Humphrey said.  
</P>
<P>
	``I would describe the structure as rock solid,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Murphy, vice president in charge of development for the  
center, said some of the sheet metal decking of the roof might have 
to be replaced because of possible heat damage. 
</P>
<P>
	The $350 million arena is expected to open in October.

<HEADLINE> Dow Falls; Nasdaq Jumps / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrials retreated Monday from  
last week's record high as investors took some profits, but the 
broader market indexes shot higher on renewed strength in 
technology shares. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow lost 8.47 points to close at 9,727.61. The blue-chip  
index opened higher, then retreated as much as 61.75 before 
regaining some of the loss in the final hour of trading. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just giving back some of the gains of last Thursday and  
Friday,'' said John Shaughnessy, chief investment strategist at 
Advest Inc. ``But the backdrop of this market continues to be very, 
very solid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index added 7.26 to reach a record  
1,282.73, beating its previous closing high of 1,279.69 set on Jan. 
29. The Nasdaq composite climbed 60.51 to 2,397.62, but is still 
nearly 113 points below its all-time closing high of 2,510.09 made 
on Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks rallied after a weak performance last week.  
Computer-chip maker Intel reached a preliminary agreement to settle 
Federal Trade Commission charges that it had illegally threatened 
to withhold critical information about its Pentium chip unless 
three other companies handed over secret information about their 
products. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel shares climbed 5 to 119 5/8, sparking a broad rally in  
Nasdaq-traded computer stocks. Dell Computer, for example, advanced 
2 3/8 to 45 3/8 in leading volume in Nasdaq trading. On the New York 
Stock Exchange, Dow component IBM rose 1/2 to 178 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
	But in general on the Big Board, two days of spectacular  
back-to-back gains in the Dow couldn't hold. The Dow added a total 
of 460 points on Thursday and Friday, closing the week at a record 
9,736.08. 
</P>
<P>
	Rising bond prices helped push up stocks Friday and were higher  
again Monday. The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond was up 15.63 
cents per $1,000 in value late Monday. Its yield, which moves in 
the opposite direction to price, was 5.59 percent, down from 5.60 
percent on Friday. But that wasn't enough to help blue-chip stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil stocks rose as oil prices continued to climb on signs that  
worldwide oil production will decline. Crude oil for April delivery 
settled at $13.63 a barrel, up 33 cents. Exxon added 1 1/4 to 70 
15/16. 
</P>
<P>
	The stock market was also helped by some takeover news.  
Belgian-Dutch financial services group Fortis agreed to pay $2.8 
billion, or $55 a share, for American Bankers Insurance Group Inc. 
a Miami-based insurer. ABI's shares rose 5 5/8 to 52. 
</P>
<P>
	Allied Waste Industries Inc. said it would pay $7.3 billion, or  
$45 a share, for larger rival Browning-Ferris Industries Inc. 
Browning Ferris shares climbed 4 1/8 to 38 7/8, while Allied Waste's 
shares added 1 15/16 to 16 15/16. 
</P>
<P>
	On the New York Stock Exchange, declining issues outnumbered  
advancers by a 6-to-5 margin. Consolidated Big Board volume was 
moderately heavy at 879.77 million shares, below Friday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index rose 0.96 to 604.10, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 4.77 to 712.18. The Russell 
2000 index of smaller companies rose 2.05 to 400.06. 
</P>
<P>
	In overseas stock markets, the Nikkei 225 index in Tokyo eased  
0.77 percent. In Europe, the DAX index in Frankfurt fell 1 percent, 
the CAC in Paris eased 0.32 percent, but the FT-SE 100 index in 
London inched 0.05 percent higher.

<HEADLINE>  L.A. Clippers' Skid Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Los Angeles Clippers are perfect this  
season -- perfectly awful. 
</P>
<P>
	At 0-15, they are two losses from tying the NBA record for worst  
start. And next up are two games against the streaking Lakers, 7-0 
since rebounding terror Dennis Rodman joined the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``The main objective right now is get a win, no matter who we're  
playing,'' forward Lamond Murray said Monday after practice. 
</P>
<P>
	The Miami Heat set the record for worst start with 17 losses in  
their expansion season of 1988. The Clippers could surpass that 
mark on Wednesday and achieve two dubious others. 
</P>
<P>
	Still possible are records for most consecutive games lost in a  
season -- 23 by Vancouver in 1996 and Denver last season -- and most 
consecutive games lost -- 24 by Cleveland in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody's feeling the pressure, from the front office to the  
coaching staff to the players on the floor,'' Murray said. ``If you 
let down and just quit, it's going to be a long road.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Losing is nothing new to this team. The Clippers started the  
season 0-16 in 1994, when Murray was a rookie out of California. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was more disappointing for me because I just came fresh  
out of college, a winning atmosphere,'' he said. ``That was more 
difficult for me to deal with than it is now because I've been 
through it and I know that you must keep pushing on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Clippers have come close to winning, losing in double  
overtime to Vancouver on Feb. 16. They actually led at halftime on 
the road last week against Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	``If these games were 12 minutes as opposed to 48, we'd be at  
least 8-7,'' guard Darrick Martin said. ``In Houston, we played a 
good 24 minutes and they came out in the third quarter and blew us 
away. When we can find consistency, that's when we'll find more 
wins.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oh, the Clippers have been consistent all right. Consistently  
terrible. Chris Ford is still waiting for his first win since 
becoming coach after the NBA lockout ended in January. 
</P>
<P>
	``I need more self-sacrifice from those guys. They have to be  
more committed,'' he said. `We only have a 35-game schedule left.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Point guard Sherman Douglas, a 32-year-old veteran who signed  
with the team last month, doesn't blame Ford. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anytime we execute and do what he tells us to do, we're in the  
ballgame,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford has tried just about everything to stop the streak. He's  
juggled the lineup, trying nine different combinations; benched 
players; and given players substantial minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm searching to see who I can get help from,'' he said. ``I  
don't see the response from them that is needed for us to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Clippers expect a bit of good news Wednesday. Rookie center  
Michael Olowokandi, on the injured list with a sprained left ankle, 
could return then to play against the Lakers at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
	Finding someone who can help has Clippers vice president of  
basketball operations Elgin Baylor exploring possible deals in time 
for Thursday's trade deadline. Ford talked to team owner Donald 
Sterling and Baylor on Monday, suggesting some moves. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I came here, I thought we had some good, young talent,  
but I didn't think they had an identity and I didn't think that 
they really knew how to play together,'' Ford said. ``That's still 
holding true. 
</P>
<P>
	``Are we asking for things that can't be done? No, we're asking  
for things that should be done. Until our guys decide they're going 
to do those things, they're not going to get over the hump.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Clippers play the Lakers -- to whom they've already lost  
twice this season -- on Tuesday and Wednesday. The Clippers could 
set the record against Sacramento at home Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Portland comes to town on Saturday, then the Clippers go on the  
road against Seattle on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Getting used to losing scares veteran point guard Pooh  
Richardson. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you sit in the back of the bus long enough, you've got to  
be careful because you'll think you belong there,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> George Jones Significantly Better </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- George Jones, critically injured in a  
traffic accident, has made significant improvement and may soon be 
able to breathe without a ventilator. 
</P>
<P>
	``He still has a life-threatening injury, but everyone is  
encouraged by how well he has done since his accident,'' Vanderbilt 
University Medical Center spokesman Wayne Wood said this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The 67-year-old country music legend remained in critical  
condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones had a quiet night, two days after nearly dying when he  
smashed his sport-utility vehicle into a bridge near his home. He 
was talking on his cell phone at the time, and wasn't wearing a 
seat belt, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Alcohol was not a factor in the crash, according to the  
Tennessee Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors hope to begin weaning Jones off his ventilator today. He  
also may start getting nutrients through a tube to his stomach, Dr. 
Virginia Eddy said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got to say that he's done remarkably well,'' Eddy said  
Sunday. ``That's not to say that he's not very fragile at this 
point, but he's made a lot of progress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eddy was not among the first physicians to treat Jones, but said  
that from his medical records ``it looked to me like he was on 
death's door'' when he arrived at the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	It took emergency workers about two hours to free him from the  
car. His liver was cut deeply, and his right lung was punctured. 
</P>
<P>
	As long as his liver doesn't bleed, Jones has a good chance of  
recovery, the doctor said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The liver heals itself very well, and his injuries are of the  
type that I really would expect to heal just fine without any 
surgery,'' Eddy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones is conscious, but sedated. He has not spoken since the  
accident, said his wife, Nancy Jones. He is communicating by 
squeezing her hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the squeeze of the hand, I knew he was going to fight,''  
Mrs. Jones said. ``George is just a strong person. He has a strong 
will and a reason to live.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starting with his first hit ``Why Baby Why'' in 1955, Jones has  
charted more than 140 records, including classics like ``He Stopped 
Loving Her Today'' and ``A Good Year for the Roses.'' He was 
married to duet partner Tammy Wynette for six years, and the pair 
were known as ``The King and Queen of Country Music.'' Wynette died 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones has been cited as an influence by singers outside the  
country genre, including Elvis Costello and Ray Charles, both of 
whom have recorded with him.

<HEADLINE> Wilkins Pleased With Pitching Job </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRADENTON, Fla. (AP) -- It was only 16 pitches and hardly anyone  
saw them, but Marc Wilkins cherished Monday's appearance in a 
Pittsburgh Pirates' ``B'' game against Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	The right-handed reliever pitched a scoreless relief inning  
against the Devil Rays, his first game appearance since shoulder 
surgery Sept. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a little emotional for me,'' Wilkins said. ``It really  
hit me when I was walking off the mound. All of a sudden my eyes 
starting tearing up, kind of like when you're watching a movie and 
it kind of hits you at the end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He recalled the anxiety of not knowing if he would be able to  
return. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a great relief for me to go out and face batters  
without feeling any pain. We'll see how I feel tomorrow and the 
next day, but I'm very encouraged,'' Wilkins said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilkins struck out two of four batters. Another flied out to  
center field, and a fourth reached on third baseman Aramis 
Ramirez's error. 
</P>
<P>
	``''I tried to make this no different than the last 15 times  
I've been on the mound, pitching batting practice or throwing 
sideline sessions. Once I got on the mound, though, that all went 
out the window,'' Wilkins said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said it was hard not to realize the importance of the moment.  
</P>
<P>
	``There was an adrenaline rush from facing hitters,'' Wilkins  
said. ``I really tried to keep my composure the best I could and 
just tried to make good pitches but that was difficult to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wilkins, 28, missed most of last season because of shoulder  
problems. He pitched 15 1-3 innings in 16 appearances with the 
Pirates and a 6 1-3 innings in seven appearances at Triple-A 
Nashville and Double-A Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	He had been one of the Pirates' top relievers in 1996 and 1997.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've been waiting for this for a long time,'' Wilkins said.  
``I've been waiting to see if I can get hitters out again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wilkins will pitch in a regular exhibition game later this week,  
possibly during Thursday's doubleheader with Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was kind of upset they wouldn't let me pitch in the real  
games right away,'' he said. ``But I understand that they want to 
take things slow with me. They want to make sure my velocity is 
where it should be. ``I really felt I'd have some pain when I 
started throwing down here but there hasn't been any. I feel good, 
way better than I thought I would. It's surprised me that I've felt 
this good. I still have a little bit of a restricted feeling when I 
pitch but it's not uncomfortable or anything like that.''

<HEADLINE> Future of Montreal Expos Uncertain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Two days past deadline for the Expos to obtain  
financing for a new stadium, team president Claude Brochu said he 
doubted a new ballpark will be built in Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
	After Brochu and baseball commissioner Bud Selig met as part of  
an economic study group, Selig reiterated that he won't extend the 
deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	A senior baseball official, speaking on the condition he not be  
identified, said Selig will wait a few weeks or more to see if the 
situation changes in Montreal. If nothing happens, Selig will then 
give Brochu permission to negotiate with potential buyers who would 
move the franchise, possibly for the 2000 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything has been clearly stated by the government,'' Brochu  
said. ``A new poll in Montreal shows 65 percent are against 
government funding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brochu has been fighting with some of the limited partners in  
the group that owns the team, including chairman Jacques Menard, 
who was given until Saturday by Selig to obtain stadium financing 
and funding for a new ownership group. 
</P>
<P>
	Selig and other baseball officials have said the Expos cannot be  
a viable franchise without a new ballpark, and some owners -- most 
notably the New York Yankees' George Steinbrenner -- have criticized 
the team for becoming a drain on baseball's revenue-sharing system. 
</P>
<P>
	``The deadline has passed. We'll just have to wait and see what  
happens,'' Selig said. 
</P>
<P>
	Groups in Northern Virginia, downtown Washington and Charlotte,  
N.C., have expressed interest in obtaining a team. 
</P>
<P>
	Any group wishing to move the Expos to Washington or Northern  
Virginia probably would have to overcome a legal battle with 
Orioles owner Peter Angelos, who says he would attempt to block a 
team from moving that close to Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	Brochu, recognized by baseball as the team's controlling owner,  
said nothing had been accomplished by the initiatives of Menard, 
who has attempted to bring in new partners, including New York art 
dealer Jeffrey Loria. Brochu was offered about $10 million by the 
Expos' current partners for his 7.6 percent share of the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been very disruptive,'' he said. ``It's gotten us to  
where we are today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball has been reluctant to move franchises. The last to  
relocate was the Washington Senators, who became the Texas Rangers 
after the 1971 season. Because of that reluctance, Selig wants to 
wait a little bit longer to see if any effort to save the Expos 
takes root in Montreal, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brochu said the next step is up to Selig.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to do what he tells me,'' Brochu said.

<HEADLINE> Treasury Bill Rates Fall / T-Bills  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Interest rates on short-term Treasury  
securities fell in Monday's auction. 
</P>
<P>
	The Treasury Department sold $7.5 billion in three-month bills  
at a discount rate of 4.510 percent, down from 4.570 percent last 
week. An additional $7.53 billion was sold in six-month bills at a 
rate of 4.540 percent, down from 4.585 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-month rate was the lowest since Feb. 16, when the  
bills sold for 4.440 percent. The six-month rate was the lowest 
since Feb. 22, when the rate was 4.430.

	The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors  
-- 4.638 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling 
for $9,886.00 and 4.724 percent for a six-month bill selling for 
$9,770.50.

	In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the  
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index

<HEADLINE> Clinton Mourns Joe DiMaggio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Text of statement by President Clinton on the death of Joe  
DiMaggio: 
</P>
<P>
	Today, America lost one of the century's most beloved heroes,  
Joe DiMaggio. This son of Italian immigrants gave every American 
something to believe in. He became the very symbol of American 
grace, power and skill. A brilliant individual performer, he led 
his magnificent Yankees to the World Series 10 out of his 13 years. 
His electrifying 56-game hitting streak, unequal to this day, is 
one of the most remarkable achievements by any athlete in any 
sport. 
</P>
<P>
	He stood tall off the field as well. In 1943, he volunteered for  
the Army and swapped his Yankee paycheck for $50-a-month private's 
salary. He and the foundation he started gave mightily to help poor 
children benefit from the world's best medical care. And he was an 
incredibly devoted father, grandfather and great-grandfather. 
</P>
<P>
	I have no doubt that when future generations look back at the  
best of America in the 20th century, they will think of the Yankee 
Clipper and all that he achieved. Hillary and I extend our thoughts 
and prayers to his family.''

<HEADLINE> Ecuador Declares Surprise Holiday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- The government declared a banking holiday  
for Monday and Tuesday to protect its shaky currency, the sucre, 
which plunged last week. 
</P>
<P>
	An hour before the banks were to open, bank superintendent Jorge  
Egas announced the surprise closings for Monday in a nationally 
televised address. He said later that the banks would remain closed 
through Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The move was to ``preserve the stability of bank reserves, limit  
the withdrawals that could effect the domestic financial system, 
and avoid pressure on the currency and the continued rise in 
prices,'' Egas said. 
</P>
<P>
	The banking holiday also closed the domestic foreign exchange  
market. 
</P>
<P>
	Ecuador is embroiled in its worst economic crisis in the last 20  
years due to $2.6 billion in damage from El Nino-related floods and 
mudslides last year and falling prices of its main export, oil. 
</P>
<P>
	The sucre lost more than a quarter its value in wild trading  
last week amid growing uncertainty over the Andean nation's 
economic outlook. The instability was fed by rumors the government 
planned to seize dollar-denominated bank accounts to buy sucres and 
that a major bank was going to collapse. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors also have not been sold on President Jamil Mahuad's  
plans to cut Ecuador's budget deficit, which is running at $1.2 
billion, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to the uncertainty, Ecuador's state energy workers have  
threatened to interrupt the flow of oil and electricity if Congress 
approves a Mahuad-sponsored bill to cut public spending.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Seek Tough N.Korea Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Five Republican House leaders appealed to  
former Defense Secretary William Perry, the Clinton 
administration's point man on North Korea, to recommend a tougher 
U.S. policy toward North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	``North Korea's nuclear ambitions, chemical-biological  
capability and its burgeoning missile capability present a clear 
and present danger to the security of the United States,'' the 
lawmakers wrote to Perry in a letter released on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Signing the letter were House International Committee Chairman  
Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, 
R-Ill.; House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas; Rep. Christopher 
Cox, R-Calif., chairman of the House Policy Committee; and Rep. Joe 
Knollenberg, R-Mich., a member of the House Appropriations 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	They urged an overhaul in policy ``from the ground floor up.''  
</P>
<P>
	Perry is expected to issue a report this month dealing with  
North Korea's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile capability and 
other issues. It follows North Korea's firing a rocket over Japan 
six months ago -- and later threatening to fire more. 
</P>
<P>
	An end to the development, testing and proliferation of such  
missiles must be part of any new U.S. policy toward North Korea, 
the lawmakers insisted. They also called for stronger enforcement 
of a 1991 agreement banning both sides on the Korean peninsula from 
developing weapons of mass destruction and for ``an end to 
state-sponsored illegal narcotics production and trafficking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the State Department, spokesman James Rubin said Perry ``is  
now in the region, consulting with our friends and allies as he 
conducts his policy review.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He has met with key congressional figures and will do so again  
as he proceeds to gather as many views as possible for his 
consideration,'' Rubin said. ``I cannot speculate on the outcome of 
the review, still a work in progress, but I am certain it will 
carefully evaluate the views expressed in Congressman Gilman's 
letter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The letter came as the United States entered a second week of  
negotiations with North Korea over U.S. access to a suspected 
underground nuclear complex. Talks at the U.S. mission to the 
United Nations in New York were scheduled to continue Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Perry, meanwhile, conferred in Seoul on Tuesday with top South  
Korean policy-makers , including a breakfast session with Foreign 
Minister Hong Soon-young and national security adviser Lim 
Dong-won. He also was scheduled to meet President Kim Dae-jung 
later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	In his arrival statement Monday night, Perry said the United  
States supports South Korea's policy of greater economic and 
diplomatic engagement with North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	But he also said Seoul and Washington must work together to  
resolve North Korea's missile program and suspected nuclear 
activity. ``We must stand together to resolve problems in these 
areas even as we look for possibilities for engagements in other 
areas,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korea wants the United States and Japan to offer North  
Korea expanded economic and diplomatic benefits in exchange for 
abandoning its missile and nuclear programs and moves toward 
establishing peace on the Korean Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, those issues have been dealt with individually, but  
South Korea thinks they should be lumped together in one 
negotiating package.

<HEADLINE> Candy Maker Files for Bankruptcy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The maker of the Clark Bar, which found  
success with a 5-cent-sized candy bar sent to American troops 
during World War I, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection 
Monday after years of financial turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clark has had many problems in the past several years,'' Clark  
Bar America Inc. spokeswoman Diana Scally said. ``Unfortunately, 
it's just gotten to the point where we need protection from 
creditors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials have worked for the past 18 months on a  
restructuring plan but ran out of time and had no option but to 
seek bankruptcy protection in federal court, Scally said. The candy 
bar ran into trouble once before when its previous maker filed for 
bankruptcy protection. 
</P>
<P>
	The filing will enable Clark to keep operating under a court's  
supervision while it develops a plan for returning to solvency, to 
facilitate a restructuring or a sale of all or parts of the retail 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the best option to keep some 100 employees working to  
produce the signature Clark Bar, a chocolate-coated peanut butter 
crunch bar, and other variations, Scally said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials are discussing bringing in new investors or selling  
the company; no immediate layoffs are expected, Scally said.

<HEADLINE>  DiMaggio Remembered As Shy, Modest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARTINEZ, Calif. (AP) -- The lanky white-haired gentleman wheeled  
his shopping cart gently through Longs Drugs, stopping to chat with 
his granddaughter. His eyes focused on the floor, avoiding the 
astonished stares of strangers. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, Joe DiMaggio would slip over to Amato's restaurant for a  
meal. He'd sit in the back room, shielded from gawkers and 
autograph hunters. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio often visited Martinez, the town of his birth, for long  
afternoons of fishing with cousins and quiet evenings with 
grandkids. He avoided crowds, skipping funerals and showing up 
unexpectedly at the mortuary to pay his last respects. 
</P>
<P>
	``His head was always down, he wouldn't look around. No eye  
contact,'' said Ernie Lasell, who owned a hardware store and used 
to sell DiMaggio his fishing licenses. ``He was just a naturally 
shy guy, very modest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marie Amato Goodman, whose family ran the restaurant that sits  
about 80 yards from dusty two-lane Joe DiMaggio Drive, said he was 
a humble man who ``had the limelight but didn't capture it and go 
with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When he came into the restaurant, my mother grabbed Joe and  
took him in the back,'' said Goodman, a third cousin of DiMaggio. 
``He was very private, unobtrusive in all situations. I think Joe 
never forgot who he was and where he came from, and the loyalties 
that come with family and friends in a small town.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most Americans born before World War II remember DiMaggio as the  
dashing ``Yankee Clipper,'' the man who had a 56-game hitting 
streak and married Marilyn Monroe. Baby boomers think of DiMaggio 
as the guy hawking Mr. Coffee on TV. 
</P>
<P>
	But neighbors and relatives in Martinez knew DiMaggio as the  
quiet son of a Sicilian fisherman. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio was born in Martinez, a middle-class town about 30  
minutes east of San Francisco, on Nov. 25, 1914. On his birth 
certificate, the midwife that delivered DiMaggio listed ``Fishman'' 
as the occupation of his father, Giuseppe DiMaggio. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe DiMaggio was born in a small wood house on Berrellessa  
Street, along the Martinez waterfront. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuseppe and Rosalia Mercurio DiMaggio moved their family to the  
North Beach section of San Francisco when Joe was 1. The area also 
was an Italian enclave in those days. Now it is largely Asian. 
</P>
<P>
	Dante Benedetti played baseball with the DiMaggio boys. The kids  
used to play on a grassy lot next to a creamery when the horses 
were out pulling milkcarts. They used dried horse manure, covered 
with a sack, for bases. 
</P>
<P>
	``You never slid head first into those,'' Benedetti said.  
</P>
<P>
	Benedetti, who owned the New Pisa restaurant in that  
neighborhood, remembers young Joe DiMaggio sitting by himself at 
North Beach Playground, rolling Bull Durham cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because he was such a good player, he was the only one the  
director let smoke during the games,'' Benedetti said. ``He was a 
shortstop. He used to overthrow first base, he had such a strong 
arm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There's a fable that DiMaggio avoided following in his father's  
footsteps only because he got seasick. Benedetti laughs at such 
nonsense, pointing out the $25,000 bonus offered by the New York 
Yankees was reason enough to stay on land. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know you'd get seasick if somebody offered you $500 a  
month,'' he said. ``After Joe signed, all the fishermen down there 
started to buy their kids gloves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two brothers, Dom and Vince, joined Joe in the major leagues.  
But Giuseppe DiMaggio never really understood. He sent his son a 
letter during his first spring training with the Yankees, in 1936. 
</P>
<P>
	``Come home, Joe,'' the letter said. ``The fish are running.  
Give up this game of baseball. It is for loafers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Benedetti remembers DiMaggio being painfully shy throughout his  
playing days. After his hitting streak in 1941, the residents of 
North Beach threw a testimonial dinner for DiMaggio. When called to 
the microphone, he froze and couldn't speak. 
</P>
<P>
	``He walked by himself. He was a loner,'' Benedetti said. ``You  
couldn't get a word out of him. He talked through his bat and his 
ability to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Benedetti, along with the rest of the neighborhood, attended  
DiMaggio's wedding to actress Dorothy Arnold in 1939 at Sts. Peter 
and Paul Church, whose twin steeples tower over North Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	Gloria Alioto also remembers that wedding vividly, though she  
did not attend. She got married the same day at the same church, 
and her wedding was delayed two hours because of the fanfare 
surrounding DiMaggio's marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	Along the waterfront in Martinez, the ``Joltin' Joe'' is berthed  
quietly. DiMaggio was given the 22-foot speedboat on Joe DiMaggio 
Day, a celebration attended by 69,551 fans at Yankee Stadium on 
Oct. 1, 1949. He donated it to the city. 
</P>
<P>
	When town leaders proposed building a Joe DiMaggio Museum,  
though, the former ballplayer didn't offer help or promise any 
memorabilia, and the idea died. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio tried to avoid attention during his visits to Martinez,  
though that was sometimes next to impossible. 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Lopas remembers pressing his face to the window in awe as  
newlyweds DiMaggio and Marilyn Monroe strolled from a limousine 
into a neighbor's house in Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
	``Joe just slipped into town and he slipped out,'' Lopas said.  
``The city wanted to claim him, but he didn't claim it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mostly, mention of DiMaggio brings back memories of a classy guy  
who shunned the spotlight that his talent attracted. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a prime example of what athletes should be like. He's a  
great tribute to baseball and sports in general,'' said Fred 
Scolari, who grew up near the DiMaggio family in North Beach and 
went on to an NBA career from 1946-55. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just the way he commanded respect because I think he gave  
you respect. He sat in a corner and had his Coca-Colas. He didn't 
seek out anybody.''

<HEADLINE> NASA Unable To Save Star Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- NASA was unable to save a multimillion-dollar  
star research mission but continued efforts Monday to bring its 
satellite under control to determine what went wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	All the frozen hydrogen needed to cool the Wide-Field Infrared  
Explorer satellite's telescope melted and forced its way out a vent 
into space over the weekend, rendering the instrument useless and 
ending the mission before it began. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA spent about $73 million on the satellite's development,  
launch and operations, said Don Savage, a space agency spokesman. 
Had the mission gone forward, operations and data analysis costs 
would have put the total over $80 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Ed Weiler, associate administrator for space science at NASA  
headquarters, said in a statement he was disappointed but was 
confident that upcoming missions could accomplish some of the 
goals, ``so it will be science delayed rather than science lost.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The satellite, nicknamed Wire, was intended to study  
``starburst'' galaxies, those in which rapid star formation is 
taking place. It was also going to study infant galaxies known as 
protogalaxies. 
</P>
<P>
	The satellite incorporated a variety of new technologies and can  
still be used for engineering tests, said Lynn Jenner, a 
spokeswoman for Goddard Space Flight Center, where it was 
developed. 
</P>
<P>
	Wire was launched March 4. It was in its second orbit when  
ground stations detected that it was spinning rather than 
maintaining a stable orientation, and that the container for the 
hydrogen was warmer than expected. 
</P>
<P>
	The hydrogen was supposed to have lasted four months. Instead,  
officials believe, a cover over the telescope came off prematurely 
and allowed sunlight to fall on the instrument, melting the 
hydrogen, which in turn caused the spin. 
</P>
<P>
	The telescope needed the frozen hydrogen to keep temperatures  
below minus-430 degrees so the instrument's own heat wouldn't 
obscure infrared light from space.

<HEADLINE> FDA Recalls Frozen Mamey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The Food and Drug Administration announced a  
voluntary nationwide recall Monday of some frozen mamey products 
after the fruit was linked to a typhoid fever outbreak that has 
sickened at least 13 people. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency urged customers who bought frozen mamey in clear  
plastic bags under the ``El Sembrador'' and ``La Fe'' brands to 
return it to the place of purchase for a full refund. 
</P>
<P>
	Health officials in Florida linked the typhoid fever cases to  
frozen packages of mamey, a tropical fruit often used to make 
shakes called batidos in Spanish-speaking communities. 
</P>
<P>
	The frozen mamey is being recalled as a precautionary measure  
while FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention work 
with Florida officials to determine the source of the 
contamination, the FDA said in a news release. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida officials ordered all frozen mamey, regardless of brand,  
removed from shelves in the state last month after interviews with 
typhoid patients suggested the illness could be traced to the 
frozen fruit, which has a pulp ranging in color from salmon pink to 
red. 
</P>
<P>
	But the federal recall affected only the two brands and a third  
product with no brand name produced by Agrodex, Guatemala. That 
product, imported by Jagua Trading Group Corp. of Miami, is sold in 
clear plastic packages usually to retailers -- not directly to 
consumers -- with the label ``Mamey, Mammea americana, Product of 
Guatemala.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The La Fe brand was distributed in Florida, California,  
Connecticut, New Jersey, New York, Georgia, Arizona, Illinois, 
Louisiana, Philadelphia, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Oregon by 
Gonzales &AMP; Tapanes Foods of Miami and North Bergen, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	The El Sembrador brand was distributed in North Carolina,  
Illinois, Georgia, Florida and New York by L &AMP; J General 
International Corp. of Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA first issued a warning Feb. 20 that customers should not  
eat El Sembrador brand frozen mamey from Guatemala or drinks made 
from the product. 
</P>
<P>
	Typhoid fever can cause headache, joint pain, sore throat,  
constipation, loss of appetite and pink spots on the skin. Prompt 
treatment with antibiotics cures more than 99 percent of cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Salmonella typhi bacteria are excreted in the stool of an  
infected person and can spread by contaminating food or water. The 
National Center for Infectious Diseases reported 327 cases of 
typhoid nationwide last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The 13 cases of typhoid fever linked to the mamey between  
mid-December and Feb. 18 all required hospitalization, according to 
the FDA. Those cases appeared mostly in Hispanic communities in 
South Florida.

<HEADLINE> Duke Finishes Season at No. 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Duke, Michigan State, Connecticut and Auburn, the top four seeds  
in the NCAA tournament, finished in that order today in the final 
AP college basketball poll of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the third No. 1 finish for the Blue Devils (32-1), who  
entered the NCAA tournament on top of the rankings in 1986 and 
1992, the latter the year they repeated as national champions. 
</P>
<P>
	The top seed in the East Regional and winners of 27 straight,  
the Blue Devils received 69 of 70 first-place votes and 1,749 
points from the nationwide media panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan State (29-4), the top seed in the Midwest, received the  
other No. 1 vote and 1,654 points, 19 more than Connecticut (28-2), 
the top seed in the West. 
</P>
<P>
	Auburn (27-3), the top seed in the South, was followed in the  
Top Ten by Maryland, Utah, Stanford, Kentucky, St. John's and 
Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati dropped four spots to lead the Second Ten and was  
followed by Arizona, North Carolina, Ohio State, UCLA, College of 
Charleston, Arkansas, Wisconsin, Indiana and Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	The last five ranked teams were Iowa, Kansas, Florida, North  
Carolina Charlotte and New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas, the Big 12 champions, moved back into the rankings after  
a three-week absence, while North Carolina Charlotte, the 
Conference USA champions, entered the Top 25 for the first time 
this season. The 49ers were ranked for three weeks last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota and Missouri, which both lost their opening conference  
tournament games last week, dropped out from 23rd and 24th, 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke and Connecticut were the only teams to hold the No. 1  
ranking this season. The Blue Devils were No. 1 in the preseason 
poll and first two weeks of the season. The Huskies were on top for 
the next 10 weeks, then Duke was there the last five polls of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Twelve teams were ranked every week this season, including North  
Carolina, which has the longest consecutive streak. The Tar Heels 
have been in every poll since the preseason voting in the 1990-91 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	The highest ranked team among the eight from the preseason poll  
that wasn't ranked at season's end was Temple, which was seventh. 
None of the other Atlantic 10 teams in the preseason poll -- Xavier, 
Rhode Island and Massachusetts -- were in the final Top 25. 
</P>
<P>
	The team not in the preseason poll that was ranked highest in  
the last poll was No. 10 Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Four teams -- California, Louisville, Texas and North Carolina  
Charlotte -- were one-week wonders. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty-three teams from 11 conferences were ranked during the  
season. The Big Ten led the way with seven, all of which made the 
NCAA tournament. The seven were all in the same poll for two weeks, 
tying the record for a conference. The Big East, Pac-10, 
Southeastern Conference and Big 12 each had five teams ranked 
during the season.

<HEADLINE> Report: Birth Pain Payments Halted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The federal government has ordered doctors and  
hospitals to stop demanding cash payments from poor women for a 
popular procedure to relieve pain in childbirth, The New York Times 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Medicaid patients may not be charged for prenatal care, delivery  
or other medical services related to pregnancy, according to 
federal law, and Medicaid reimburses doctors and hospitals for 
their services. 
</P>
<P>
	But doctors say the reimbursements for pain relief treatment are  
woefully small, sometimes less than 20 percent of what private 
insurance companies pay, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	The national director of the Medicaid program, Sally Richardson,  
received reports that health care providers were requiring the cash 
payments for Medicaid-covered services, particularly the use of an 
epidural injection to lessen childbirth pain, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	In one instance, an obstetrician ordered the epidural but  
withheld it from a woman in active labor because she hadn't paid 
for it and didn't have cash, Ms. Richardson said. The doctor 
refused to take payment by check, credit card or money telegram, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Treatment of a Medicaid patient in this manner is not just a  
concern, it is alarming,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Health policy experts reported complaints from patients across  
the country, but federal officials were unsure of the scope of the 
problem, the Times said. 
</P>
<P>
	Patients unable to pay cash for the epidural injection, which  
blocks pain in the lower part of the body, often were offered 
weaker forms of pain relief. 
</P>
<P>
	A survey last year by the American Society of Anesthesiologists  
found that New York, for example, typically paid $55 to $105 for 
the epidural block, while insurance companies often paid more than 
$800. 
</P>
<P>
	Medicaid covers the bills in more than a third of U.S.  
childbirths. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government's order follows the enactment of a  
California law that prohibits hospitals from denying anesthesia to 
women during childbirth based on their ability to pay for the 
procedure up front. 
</P>
<P>
	The law, which went into effect Jan. 1, arose from a case  
involving a Medi-Cal insurance patient who was denied an epidural 
while in labor at Northridge Hospital Medical Center in Los 
Angeles. An anesthesiologist had demanded she pay $400 in cash for 
the pain-control procedure.

<HEADLINE> Candy Maker Files for Bankruptcy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The maker of the Clark Bar, which found  
success with a 5-cent-sized candy bar sent to American troops 
during World War I, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection 
after years of financial turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clark has had many problems in the past several years,'' Clark  
Bar America Inc. spokeswoman Diana Scally said Monday. 
``Unfortunately, it's just gotten to the point where we need 
protection from creditors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials have worked for the past 18 months on a  
restructuring plan but ran out of time and had no option but to 
seek bankruptcy protection in federal court, Scally said. The candy 
bar ran into trouble once before when its previous maker also filed 
for bankruptcy protection. 
</P>
<P>
	The filing will enable Clark to keep operating under a court's  
supervision while it develops a plan for returning to solvency. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the best option to keep some 100 employees working to  
produce the signature Clark Bar, a chocolate-coated peanut butter 
crunch bar, and other variations, Scally said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials are discussing bringing in new investors or selling  
the company, but no immediate layoffs are expected, Scally said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark has been making candy bars in Pittsburgh for more than a  
century. Irish immigrant D.L. Clark founded the company in 1886 in 
two back rooms of a small house on the city's north side. 
</P>
<P>
	He began selling candy in the streets of Pittsburgh and expanded  
to become a leading manufacturer, experimenting with ingredients 
never before used in candies -- including coconut, mint and peanut 
butter. Two well-known creations include the Clark and Zagnut bars. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clark Bar was wildly successful with soldiers when it was  
marketed as individually wrapped bars to facilitate shipment to 
American troops during World War I. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clark family sold the business in 1955 and ownership changed  
several times before Pittsburgh Food and Beverage was thrown into 
bankruptcy and Clark was shut down for several months in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Clister purchased the company in bankruptcy court that same  
year and renamed the company Clark Bar America. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jim Clister's sole intention of buying Clark almost four years  
ago was to keep Clark in Pittsburgh,'' said chief executive officer 
Archie Strimel. ``Even thought we have not been able to dig out of 
the financial difficulties inherited, our goal continues to be to 
try to restructure the company and keep it in the Pittsburgh 
area.''

<HEADLINE> Deportations Moratorium Ends Today </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) -- President Clinton may have  
Hurricane Mitch on his mind during his Central American tour, but 
many here are just as concerned about his position on deporting 
illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has halted deporting Central Americans living  
illegally on its soil since Mitch hit the area in October, in an 
effort to not increase the ravaged countries' burdens. 
</P>
<P>
	But the moratorium on deportations ends today for El Salvador  
and Guatemala, and Central American governments insist they need 
more time. 
</P>
<P>
	``We Central Americans fear a massive deportation from the  
United States, which would be equal to or worse than Mitch,'' said 
leftist Salvadoran congressman Ramon Bach. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would cause us tragic problems in terms of stability,''  
said rightist President Armando Calderon Sol, chosen by other 
Central American presidents to speak on their behalf on the issue 
during Clinton's four-day trip. 
</P>
<P>
	``There would be an explosion in Central America and in El  
Salvador if that occurred.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In El Salvador, Clinton's second stop today, roughly a fifth of  
the country's 5.5 million people work in the United States and the 
money they send home provide a fifth of its foreign income. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of thousands of Hondurans, Guatemalans and Nicaraguans  
also are in the United States. Some immigration experts estimate 
that as many as 700,000 Central Americans are in the United States 
illegally. 
</P>
<P>
	Guatemala's president, Alvaro Arzu, asked Clinton in an open  
letter to extend the moratorium for his country and El Salvador to 
18 months, the grace period given to Honduras and Nicaragua, which 
were harder hit by Mitch. 
</P>
<P>
	Extending the moratoriums ``would allow all of us additional  
time to deal with the complex social issues we are facing'' due to 
the hurricane and economic problems, Arzu said. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House said today that an extension was not imminent.  
</P>
<P>
	``We have concluded that both countries are capable of beginning  
to receive their nationals,'' spokesman Michael Hammer said before 
Clinton's departure. ``We don't expect that deportations will begin 
immediately, but there's no further extension being contemplated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But even Honduras, which would not face the deportation of its  
citizens from the United States until late 2000, is asking for more 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	``The moratorium should be reconsidered in view of the economic  
situation facing Honduras, which is prostrate and cannot generate 
jobs,'' said Foreign Minister Roberto Flores Bermudez. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaders throughout the region were appealing for a hold on  
deportations long before Mitch hit the region -- though the 
hurricane added urgency to their appeals. 
</P>
<P>
	Calderon Sol said he would ask Clinton to delay deportations at  
least until the United States takes steps toward free trade and 
investment with the region so that jobs can be created. 
</P>
<P>
	The explosive growth of Central American immigration to the  
United States came in the 1980s, when wars prompted hundreds of 
thousands to flee for their lives. 
</P>
<P>
	Once in the United States, they found jobs and began sending  
vital funds home. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many people here live on their relatives'' up north, said  
Juana de Jesus Morales, 39, who has a cousin in the United States. 
The money sent home by the cousin ``is the only aid my aunt has. 
She sells little cakes, but she doesn't make enough to live on,'' 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Like many here, Morales expressed fear that an expulsion would  
flood the country with U.S.-trained gang members who are blamed for 
much of El Salvador's crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Those working in the United States should be helped, she said.  
</P>
<P>
	But ``the criminals -- let them be stoned. I don't say that; it's  
the word of the Lord,'' she added, waving a Bible she had just 
carried to her Baptist church service.

<HEADLINE> Japan Suspends Satellite Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's government-run space development agency  
will suspend experiments aboard two unmanned satellites by late 
November because of glitches related to the Y2K computer problem, 
officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan successfully linked a pair of satellites twice last  
summer, the first ever such outer space maneuver conducted via 
remote control from Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the satellites will have enough power to conduct further  
testing, additional experiments will be temporarily halted from 
around December. 
</P>
<P>
	Yoichi Fujita, spokesman of the National Space Development  
Agency, said the agency has yet to address the Y2K problem as it 
relates to control computers on the ground, although the two 
orbiting satellites are free from the so-called ``millennium bug.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fujita said testing of robot arms mounted on the satellites and  
a third rendezvous will be among other experiments to be carried 
out by late November. 
</P>
<P>
	On Nov. 28, 1997, Japan successfully launched the two  
satellites, nicknamed ``Orihime'' (Vega) and ``Hikoboshi'' 
(Altair). 
</P>
<P>
	A series of experiments under zero gravity were conducted in  
anticipation of the need for remote-controlled docking of supply 
shipments ferried by unmanned spacecraft to the space stations of 
the future. 
</P>
<P>
	The Y2K problem is an outgrowth of an old computer programming  
technique in which years were labeled for record-keeping purposes 
only by their final two digits, such as ``99'' for 1999. An unknown 
number of computers are expected to malfunction when the date 
changes to 2000, which some computers might interpret as 1900, 
instead of the start of the new millennium.

<HEADLINE> Few Patients Get Cholesterol Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Despite a drumbeat of research and  
advertising, at least 20 million Americans at risk of heart attacks 
aren't getting cholesterol-lowering drugs that could save their 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest statistics, released Monday at a cardiology  
conference in New Orleans, underline one of heart experts' biggest 
frustrations: Even though the benefits of these medicines are now 
beyond dispute, they are prescribed to perhaps only one in five of 
those who could benefit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Increasingly we know what to do,'' said Dr. Richard Pasternak  
of Massachusetts General Hospital. ``The issue is why it's not 
getting done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Experts said doctors and their patients share the blame.  
</P>
<P>
	The drugs, called statins, can reduce cholesterol levels by 60  
points or so. Taking them cuts the chances of heart attacks by 
about one-third. 
</P>
<P>
	Studies showing their benefits have become a staple at  
conferences like this week's meeting of the American College of 
Cardiology. In general, they show that people who already have 
serious heart disease benefit most. But the drugs appear to help 
just about everyone with modestly elevated cholesterol levels or 
abnormally low amounts of the ``good cholesterol'' that protects 
against heart attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, the government recommended giving the medicines to  
those with elevated levels of ``bad cholesterol.'' Since then, the 
evidence in favor of statins has only gotten stronger. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, doctors often do not recommend them even to  
patients who are at highest risk of heart attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. James Froehlich of the University of Michigan reviewed  
surveys of about 250,000 patient visits to doctors between 1990 and 
1996. He found that just 14 percent of those diagnosed with 
cardiovascular disease went away with a prescription for a 
cholesterol-lowering drug. 
</P>
<P>
	The use of these medicines is going up and had increased to  
about 18 percent by 1996, the last year of the survey. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Antonio M. Gotto of Cornell University said that between 4.5  
million and 5 million Americans are currently taking statins, while 
at least 25 million could benefit. Only about half of heart attack 
victims are sent home from the hospital with prescriptions for 
statins. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's enough blame to go around. It's not just the doctors'  
fault,'' Pasternak said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gotto noted that patients themselves are often unenthusiastic  
about taking statins, because they are not terribly afraid of heart 
trouble. Many women think heart problems won't harm them -- even 
though they are the No. 1 killer of U.S. women -- while men often 
believe they can get all the treatment they need after they have a 
heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they were told statins prevented cancer, they'd be taking  
it in droves,'' Gotto said. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts at the conference cited several other reasons for low  
use: 
</P>
<P>
	--Doctors are better paid for treating diseases than for  
preventing them. 
</P>
<P>
	--The drugs are expensive. They often cost $75 to $100 a month.  
</P>
<P>
	--Doctors are by nature extremely conservative and slow to adopt  
new ideas. 
</P>
<P>
	--There are lingering concerns about the drugs' safety, even  
though the latest data suggest they are extremely safe and produce 
few side effects. 
</P>
<P>
	--Patients with no outward symptoms of heart trouble are often  
reluctant to take drugs that don't make them feel better.

<HEADLINE> Hoffman Is Highest-Paid Reliever </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEORIA, Ariz. (AP) -- San Diego Padres closer Trevor Hoffman  
became baseball's highest-paid reliever Monday when he agreed to a 
$32 million, four-year contract extension through 2003, the 
Associated Press learned. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, which also is the largest in club history, followed an  
offseason of change for the Padres. They lost several marquee 
players after the New York Yankees swept them in the World Series, 
some because they couldn't afford them, and others in order to get 
younger and faster. 
</P>
<P>
	The Padres now have the two relievers with the highest average  
annual salaries in baseball. Randy Myers is owed $6 million this 
year in the middle year of an $18 million, three-year deal he 
signed in November 1997 with Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	Acquired Aug. 6, Myers was ineffective and has been on the  
trading block, but the Padres would have to eat some of his salary 
in any potential deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffman's extension includes a $10 million club option for 2004  
which, if exercised, would make the deal worth $40 million over 
five years. The Padres can buy out the option year for $2 million. 
For the first time ever, the team has granted a no-trade clause. 
</P>
<P>
	Either way, Hoffman, the premier closer in baseball last year  
with 53 saves in 54 chances, gets what he wanted -- an $8 million 
average annual salary. His last two deals have been at the 
so-called San Diego discount, and Hoffman, who wanted to remain 
with the Padres, made it clear that a new deal would be on his 
terms. He set a deadline of opening day for completing an 
extension. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffman, 31, will be paid $4.1 million in 1999, the final year  
of an $8.4 million, three-year extension he signed in August 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The largest previous deal in Padres history was the $15.5  
million, three-year contract given to left-hander Sterling 
Hitchcock, the MVP of the NL championship series, on Jan. 27. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Kevin Towers, who attended the Padres' game  
against San Francisco at Scottsdale on Monday, wouldn't confirm or 
deny the deal. A source familiar with the deal, speaking on the 
condition he not be identified, said San Diego planned to announce 
it Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffman was not at Monday afternoon's game, but said earlier in  
the day that talks were ``moving in the right direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just a few days ago, Hoffman wondered whether a deal would get  
done. But talks proceeded at a remarkable clip after Hoffman met 
this weekend with owner John Moores and club president Larry 
Lucchino, who were in town for the club's board of directors 
meeting on Saturday. Hoffman summoned his agent from Florida, and 
negotiations went late into Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Really, it's been a lot of KT's (Towers') input in regard to  
getting stuff started,'' Hoffman said. ``I don't know if they want 
to wait until the end of spring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffman's .981 save percentage last year was the best in major  
league history and his 53 saves tied the NL record. He made the 
All-Star team for the first time and was runner-up to Atlanta's Tom 
Glavine in the NL Cy Young balloting. 
</P>
<P>
	The Padres were 62-4 in games in which Hoffman pitched. His only  
blown save came on July 26, when he allowed Moises Alou's 
first-pitch homer in the ninth. That came one day after he matched 
Rod Beck's big league record with 41 straight saves, a mark later 
surpassed by Boston's Tom Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
	Retaining the popular reliever is certain to be a hit with the  
fans, who saw Kevin Brown, Steve Finley and Ken Caminiti leave as 
free agents, and Greg Vaughn and Joey Hamilton depart via trades. 
</P>
<P>
	The Padres traded Vaughn in part because of his potential free  
agent status, and Hoffman feared he might be traded for the same 
reason. Now he becomes the first player locked up through 2002, 
when the club is scheduled to move into a new downtown ballpark 
that was overwhelmingly approved by voters two weeks after the 
World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with all the offseason moves, the Padres project a player  
payroll of about $48 million, a $3 million increase from the figure 
they opened 1998 at. 
</P>
<P>
	The Padres might have signed Hoffman for an average of $6  
million a year in November, but the team broke off talks. The 
market moved substantially when the division rival Los Angeles 
Dodgers signed Brown to a $105 million, seven-year deal in 
December.

<HEADLINE> Journalist Sentenced for Child Porn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENBELT, Md. (AP) -- A journalist was sentenced Monday to 18  
months in prison for collecting and forwarding child pornography 
online in what he maintained was research for a story. 
</P>
<P>
	His voice quavering, Larry Matthews assured a federal judge he  
was acting as a journalist, but conceded that after reporting on 
child pornography for a year, ``I had become desensitized and maybe 
even irresponsible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Matthews received the lightest sentence possible under federal  
guidelines. He could have been sentenced to 30 years in prison and 
a $500,000 fine after pleading guilty in July. He also was ordered 
to pay a $4,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe Mr. Matthews crossed the line,'' U.S. District Judge  
Alexander Williams said. ``I also believe that it was immoral.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Matthews, who had worked as a producer at National Public Radio,  
was given 60 days to report to prison. It was unclear Monday 
whether his attorneys would try to keep him out of jail pending an 
expected appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams said he would recommend Matthews serve his sentence in  
a halfway house, provided federal prison officials agree. 
</P>
<P>
	Matthews is the first journalist prosecuted for accessing child  
pornography on the Internet, according to the Reporters Committee 
for Freedom of the Press. Media and civil rights groups have 
defended his right to research a story. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge had refused to allow Matthews to use a First Amendment  
defense, prompting him to plead guilty in July to charges of 
receiving pornographic images on his computer and transmitting 
child pornography. 
</P>
<P>
	A 55-year-old father of four, Matthews had done stories on the  
increase of child porn on the Internet in 1995 while working for 
radio station WTOP-AM in Washington.

<HEADLINE> Bush Files 2000 Committee Papers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Striding past a gaggle of television cameras  
and reporters, members of Texas Gov. George W. Bush's presidential 
exploratory effort filed papers Monday officially establishing his 
campaign committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The unusually large press contingent on hand to chronicle a  
routine step already undertaken by most of next year's presidential 
hopefuls was merely the latest sign of the heightened interest 
surrounding Bush's expected candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
	In a demonstration of the high-powered support he is drawing  
within the Republican Party, Bush's two-page exploratory committee 
filing was delivered by a roster of GOP heavyweights. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Paul Coverdell of Georgia, former Republican Party chairman  
Haley Barbour, Reps. Jennifer Dunn of Washington and Pete Sessions 
of Texas, as well as former Reps. Gerald Solomon and Susan Molinari 
of New York, hand-delivered the document to the Federal Election 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now we test the waters,'' said Dunn, who joins Barbour and  
Coverdell on the 10-member exploratory committee that Bush unveiled 
Sunday in Austin. 
</P>
<P>
	With the formation of the exploratory committee, Bush now can  
raise and spend the money needed to assess his all-but-declared 
presidential bid. Advisers have said he hopes to quickly collect 
about $25 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm confident there will be plenty of support for a George  
Bush candidacy for president -- financial and political support 
nationwide within the Republican Party and beyond. And the reason 
is the politics of performance,'' said Barbour. ``He is our 
strongest candidate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In another sign of the governor's growing commitment to a race  
for president, his chief political strategist is selling his 
private consulting business. Karl Rove, one of the top Republican 
consultants in Texas, said Monday that, at Bush's request, he has 
sold the company he founded in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bush doesn't want my focus diluted. If he's going to make the  
run, he'd like to have me available,'' Rove said.

<HEADLINE> McGwire Hits First Spring Home Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JUPITER, Fla. (AP) -- The crack of the bat was so sharp that it  
startled Ted Lilly. 
</P>
<P>
	Then again, the rookie pitcher had never heard a Mark McGwire  
home run up close. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire hit his first homer of 1999, a three-run shot Sunday for  
the St. Louis Cardinals in a 6-1 exhibition victory over the 
Montreal Expos. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nice to get it out of the way,'' McGwire said. ``But it's  
only spring training.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Just see the ball, hit the ball,'' he said. ``I believe it  
should never be changed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coming off his record-breaking season of 70, McGwire wasted no  
time finding his home-run swing. He launched a trademark drive high 
and far over the left-field wall in only his second official at-bat 
of the spring. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire homered a day after Sammy Sosa hit No. 1 for the Chicago  
Cubs. But there's no race -- at least, not yet -- and McGwire said he 
didn't even know about his rival's home run. 
</P>
<P>
	A sellout crowd at Roger Dean Stadium got exactly what it wanted  
when McGwire crunched an inside fastball from Lilly in the second 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never seen anything like that,'' the 23-year-old lefty  
said, shaking his head. ``I mean, it was loud.'' 
</P>
<P>
	J.D. Drew, Carlos Baerga and several other Cardinals greeted  
McGwire at the plate, but he did not punctuate this homer with the 
fake punch-to-the-gut routine that became his stamp during his 
historic season. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6,912 fans, many of them wearing No. 25 McGwire jerseys,  
gave him a standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
	The ball landed between the fence and the Expos clubhouse, an  
off-limits area where park officials considered building bleachers 
this spring expressly for McGwire watchers. 
</P>
<P>
	The souvenir was retrieved by stadium marketing director  
Jennifer Chalhub, preparing to drive a 1999 white convertible 
Camaro around the field as part of an in-between inning promotion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I heard he was up and I got out of the car to protect it,''  
she said. ``He came within 25 feet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chalhub was aware that McGwire's 70th home run ball sold for $3  
million or so, but she didn't try to cash in. Instead, she gave it 
to a little girl about 4 years old standing outside the gate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I figured a ball would mean more to a kid,'' Chalhub said. ``I  
didn't even say it was a Mark McGwire ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire hit seven home runs last year in exhibition play. The  
Cardinals share their training complex with Montreal, and the Expos 
are plenty familiar with McGwire. The All-Star first baseman hit 
his final five home runs last season against them, and six overall. 
</P>
<P>
	Had this been next month when the Cardinals play Montreal for  
real, Lilly might have just walked him. McGwire led the majors with 
an NL record 162 walks last year, and there were runners on second 
and third when he homered. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess we gave a home run to McGwire and everybody was  
pleased about that,'' Expos manager Felipe Alou said. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire drew a full-count walk in the first inning after hitting  
a long foul. He hooked another drive in the second before homering. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire did not bat again and left the game after three innings.  
He paused in the right-field corner to sign autographs for a few 
minutes before walking to the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the Cardinals' 14 home exhibition games at Roger Dean  
Stadium, 13 are sold out. McGwire items dominate the souvenir 
stand, with Big Mac hats, shirts, posters and model bats on sale. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather than a piece of merchandise, Lilly got a McGwire memory.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was pretty pumped up about the chance to pitch to him for  
the first time. But I went about it the wrong way. I tried to match 
power vs. power,'' he said, ``and obviously he has more.''

<HEADLINE> Edison Bros. To File for Bankruptcy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Severe competition and disappointing operating  
results will force Edison Brothers Stores Inc. to file for 
bankruptcy Tuesday morning, company officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Edison, a national retail discount chain that sells apparel and  
footwear, on Monday said it is filing for bankruptcy protection in 
Delaware under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The filing 
will enable Edison to keep operating under a court's supervision 
while it develops a plan for returning to solvency, to facilitate a 
restructuring or a sale of all or parts of the retail organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Edison officials said they have no plans to lay off workers in  
its stores and distribution centers, although officials said 250 
positions at its headquarters had been eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
	Edison emerged from a previous Chapter 11 reorganization in  
September 1997, and a new management team took over the company in 
January 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Edison operates Bakers and Wild Pair footwear stores, 5-7-9  
junior apparel stores, Riggings, JW, Coda and Repp Ltd., Big and 
Tall menswear stores and Repp by Mail men's catalog. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Edison were unchanged at 31 1/4 cents in light trading on  
the Nasdaq Stock Market.

<HEADLINE>  Berra at a Loss for Words, For Once </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UPPER MONTCLAIR, N.J. (AP) -- It was hard for Yogi Berra to put a  
legacy into words. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh gosh,'' Berra said every time a reporter asked different  
versions of the same question: What made Joe DiMaggio, who died on 
Monday, the greatest player ever? 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh God,'' said Berra, normally never at a loss for a malaprop.  
</P>
<P>
	Then Berra, who played with DiMaggio from 1947 until DiMaggio  
retired in 1951, came up with the answer. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio was perfect.  
</P>
<P>
	``Never did anything wrong on the field. Never did,'' Berra said  
Monday, sitting next to a gray 1939 DiMaggio road jersey on display 
at Berra's baseball museum. 
</P>
<P>
	Berra said he never saw DiMaggio dive for a ball in the  
outfield. And when DiMaggio sprinted from first to second base, 
``You thought, `Where the hell is he going?' He got there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to admire a man like that,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Berra, who later joined DiMaggio in the Hall of Fame, said that  
as a young man, he watched DiMaggio play. When he came to the 
Yankees, DiMaggio was the man Berra and other younger players 
looked up to. 
</P>
<P>
	``I watched him, everything he did,'' Berra said.  
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio was the only player Berra remembers to come to Yankee  
Stadium for home games dressed in a suit. ``Blue shirt, white shirt 
and a beautiful tie,'' Berra said. ``He looked great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Berra saw DiMaggio carefully guard his privacy. Even decades  
after his marriage to Marilyn Monroe, Berra said, he never 
mentioned her. And no one else was allowed to mention her if they 
wanted to remain his friend. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he was a loner once the game was over, Berra said, he  
would play cards and eat dinner with them on the train to away 
games. ``He always had somebody waiting for him when he got off the 
train,'' Berra said. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio wouldn't talk much about the injuries that caused him  
to leave the game, Berra said, although DiMaggio wouldn't play if 
he thought he would hurt his team. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio's death leaves Berra as the likely replacement for  
DiMaggio on April 9, when DiMaggio was scheduled to throw out the 
first ball at the Yankees' home opener. Berra, who recently ended a 
14-year feud with Yankee owner George Steinbrenner, said if he does 
get invited to Yankee Stadium, he has only one wish: that Joe could 
be there, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``So I could catch the ball instead of throw it.''

<HEADLINE>  Yanks Wanted To Honor DiMaggio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Joe DiMaggio fell a month and a day short of another appearance  
at Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio, who died today, had tacked to his bed a sign that said  
``April 9,'' opening day at Yankee Stadium, where he was supposed 
to throw out the first ball. 
</P>
<P>
	``Five days ago, on March 2, I visited with Joe at his home in  
Hollywood, Fla. He was weak but spirited and alert,'' said George 
Steinbrenner, the New York Yankees' owner. ``I told him, 'Joe, you 
have a date with the Yankees on opening day. We are counting on you 
to throw out the first ball.' 
</P>
<P>
	``He just smiled.''  
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio made a lot of people smile, as was apparent by the  
tributes that began pouring in minutes after his death was 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
	He also transcended baseball, much like Michael Jordan in  
basketball a half-century later, and was a spokesman long after he 
retired for a variety of products, including Mr. Coffee. In New 
York's Grand Central Station, a bank he endorsed simply posted the 
pinstriped number ``5.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And he reached fans and non-fans as an American hero.  
</P>
<P>
	``Even though I was never one of those people who cared about  
baseball, I care a lot about Joe DiMaggio,'' said former New York 
Mayor Ed Koch, who grew up in the city during DiMaggio's heyday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He represented the best in America. It was his character, his  
generosity, his sensitivity. He was someone who set a standard 
every father would want his children to follow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	People in the sport agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``His persona extended beyond the playing field and touched all  
our hearts,'' baseball commissioner Bud Selig said. ``In many 
respects, as an immigrant's son, he represented the hopes and 
ideals of our great country. 
</P>
<P>
	``I idolized him from afar as a child growing up in Milwaukee.  
In later years, when I had the opportunity to become acquainted 
with him, my admiration grew. Being with him was an event, bringing 
on an air of excitement, anticipation and joy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tommy Lasorda, former Los Angeles Dodgers manager, suggested  
that DiMaggio's record 56-game hitting streak may stand for another 
100 years, unlike Babe Ruth and Roger Maris' home run records and 
Lou Gehrig's consecutive-game streak. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was always kind of shy,'' Lasorda said of DiMaggio. ``He  
felt uncomfortable with a lot of people, but yet he was always 
there as a tremendous representative of our game of baseball. He 
was an icon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Albany, a bill is before the New York legislature to rename  
the city's West Side Highway for DiMaggio. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm comforted, as are all New Yorkers, that we informed him  
before he died that the West Side Highway will be renamed the Joe 
DiMaggio Highway,'' said Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a longtime Yankees 
fan. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as baseball is played, Joe DiMaggio will exemplify the  
very best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Cooperstown, N.Y., the Hall of Fame flag was at half-staff  
and a wreath was placed on DiMaggio's plaque. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hall has also scheduled special DiMaggio video programming  
for March, put a tribute on its Web site and is planning an 
exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
	It will include the glove that outfielder Al Gionfriddo of the  
Brooklyn Dodgers used when he robbed DiMaggio of an extra base hit 
with a spectacular running catch in the 1947 World Series, and 
DiMaggio's contract for 1948, the first in sports to reach 
$100,000. Even the pen is there.

	And he reached fans and non-fans as an American hero.  
</P>
<P>
	``Even though I was never one of those people who cared about  
baseball, I care a lot about Joe DiMaggio,'' said former New York 
Mayor Ed Koch, who grew up in the city during DiMaggio's heyday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He represented the best in America. It was his character, his  
generosity, his sensitivity. He was someone who set a standard 
every father would want his children to follow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	People in the sport agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``His persona extended beyond the playing field and touched all  
our hearts,'' baseball commissioner Bud Selig said. ``In many 
respects, as an immigrant's son, he represented the hopes and 
ideals of our great country. 
</P>
<P>
	``I idolized him from afar as a child growing up in Milwaukee.  
In later years, when I had the opportunity to become acquainted 
with him, my admiration grew. Being with him was an event, bringing 
on an air of excitement, anticipation and joy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tommy Lasorda, former Los Angeles Dodgers manager, suggested  
that DiMaggio's record 56-game hitting streak may stand for another 
100 years, unlike Babe Ruth and Roger Maris' home run records and 
Lou Gehrig's consecutive-game streak. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was always kind of shy,'' Lasorda said of DiMaggio. ``He  
felt uncomfortable with a lot of people, but yet he was always 
there as a tremendous representative of our game of baseball. He 
was an icon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Albany, a bill is before the New York legislature to rename  
the city's West Side Highway for DiMaggio. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm comforted, as are all New Yorkers, that we informed him  
before he died that the West Side Highway will be renamed the Joe 
DiMaggio Highway,'' said Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a longtime Yankees 
fan. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as baseball is played, Joe DiMaggio will exemplify the  
very best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Cooperstown, N.Y., the Hall of Fame flag was at half-staff  
and a wreath was placed on DiMaggio's plaque. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hall has also scheduled special DiMaggio video programming  
for March, put a tribute on its Web site and is planning an 
exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
	It will include the glove that outfielder Al Gionfriddo of the  
Brooklyn Dodgers used when he robbed DiMaggio of an extra base hit 
with a spectacular running catch in the 1947 World Series, and 
DiMaggio's contract for 1948, the first in sports to reach 
$100,000. Even the pen is there.

<HEADLINE> Spring Training Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Gabe Alvarez made the biggest splash at spring training Monday --  
even bigger than Mark McGwire's second home run in two days -- not 
that Alvarez was proud of it. 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit's third baseman made five errors, including four on poor  
throws, and the Tigers made seven in all during a 9-7 loss to the 
Atlanta Braves at Lakeland, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	``I should have had every one of those balls,'' Alvarez said.  
``They were all routine plays.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alvarez, who had 19 errors in 55 games at third last season,  
made four throwing errors. First baseman Frank Catalanotto and 
non-roster pitcher Jeff Weaver made one error each for Detroit, 
which allowed five unearned runs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll run Gabe out there again,'' Tigers manager Larry Parrish  
said. ``Not tomorrow. But we've got to get him over it. He kind of 
had that, `Oh, God, don't hit the ball to me,' look. We've all had 
that at one time. But, if you're going to play up here, you've got 
to want the ball hit to you. Right now, I don't think he feels that 
way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Jupiter, Fla., McGwire launched one for the second time in  
three spring at-bats, connecting off Houston's Jose Lima -- who gave 
up Sammy Sosa's 66th and final home run last year. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire isn't putting much significance on the home runs.  
</P>
<P>
	``Hey, guys, this is spring training,'' he said after the St.  
Louis Cardinals' 2-1 loss. 
</P>
<P>
	At Fort Lauderdale, Fla., new Dodgers manager Davey Johnson saw  
many familiar faces -- his former teammates on the Baltimore 
Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not just another game. I have sentimental feelings about  
today,'' Johnson said before Los Angeles was routed 10-0. 
</P>
<P>
	Dodgers outfielders Trenidad Hubbard and Hiram Bocachica were  
injured during a violent outfield collision as Jerry Hairston Jr. 
circled the bases for an inside-the-park homer. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbard hurt his right thumb and wrist. Bocachica injured his  
right rib cage, and Dodgers manager Davey Johnson suspected the 
rookie might have cracked at least one rib. Both players were to 
undergo X-rays. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona, meanwhile, learned that newly acquired Tony Womack will  
be out six weeks because of a broken wrist sustained Sunday when he 
was hit by a pitch from Jim Parque of the Chicago White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	The arm was placed in a cast, but Womack will be able to  
participate in conditioning drills and a smaller cast may be placed 
on the arm in a week or two, manager Buck Showalter said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Port Charlotte, Fla., the Texas Rangers pulled off a triple  
play in a 6-4 win over the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas led 6-3 in the sixth inning when Fred McGriff walked and  
Julio Franco singled. John Flaherty lined a shot to third base that 
Rob Sasser caught. He threw to second baseman Kelly Dransfeldt to 
double up McGriff, and Dransfeldt's relay to first beat Franco back 
to the base. 
</P>
<P>
	In other games:  
</P>
<P>
                          *Pirates 3, Reds 2    	
</P>
<P>
	At Sarasota, Fla., Pete Harnisch, expected to be Cincinnati's  
opening day starter, pitched four shutout innings. He has given up 
only two hits in eight shutout innings this spring, striking out 
eight and walking none. 
</P>
<P>
                           *Mets 3, Expos 2    	
</P>
<P>
	At Port St. Lucie, Fla., Jason Isringhausen pitched in a game  
for the first time since winter ball in December 1997, throwing two 
innings. He allowed one hit, struck out four and balked in the only 
run he allowed. 
</P>
<P>
                        *Indians 4, Blue Jays 3    	
</P>
<P>
	At Dunedin, Fla., Pat Hentgen, in his first game appearance  
since missing his final three starts last year because of shoulder 
tendinitis, was pounded for four runs in 2 2-3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
                          *Twins 6, Red Sox 3    	
</P>
<P>
	At Fort Myers, Fla., Mark Portugal allowed two hits in three  
scoreless innings as he made his spring debut for Boston. 
</P>
<P>
                         *Royals 8, Marlins 4    	
</P>
<P>
	At Haines City, Fla., rookie outfielder Carlos Beltran hit his  
first home run of the spring for Kansas City and Steve Scarsone 
also homered. 
</P>
<P>
                        *Mariners 10, Angels 3    	
</P>
<P>
	At Peoria, Ariz., Jay Buhner, making his first spring training  
appearance since major surgery on his right elbow, had three hits 
and drove in four runs to lead an 18-hit attack. 
</P>
<P>
                     *Rockies 6, Cubs 5, 10 innings    	
</P>
<P>
	At Tucson, Ariz., Larry Walker drove in two runs and saved two  
with sparkling defense in right field. He threw out Jose Hernandez 
at second base ahead of Mark Grace's homer in the first and made a 
running catch on what looked to be an RBI double by Robin Jennings 
in the second. 
</P>
<P>
                         *Giants 7, Padres 4    	
</P>
<P>
	At Scottsdale, Ariz., Damon Minor, who drove in six runs during  
a ``B'' game earlier in the day, hit a three-run homer in the 10th 
inning. Tony Gwynn hit a two-run homer for the Padres, who tied the 
score in the ninth off Robb Nen. 
</P>
<P>
                      *Diamondbacks 8, Brewers 2    	
</P>
<P>
	At Phoenix, Steve Finley hit a three-run homer and Damian Miller  
added a solo shot. 
</P>
<P>
                       *Athletics 9, White Sox 7    	
</P>
<P>
	At Tucson, Ariz., Mike Neill went 2-for-4 and drove in two runs,  
helping drop Chicago to 0-4. 
</P>
<P>
 *Phillies 7, Yankees 6    	
</P>
<P>
	At Tampa, Fla., Mike Lieberthal drove in the game-winning run  
with a seventh-inning double as Philadelphia beat the New York 
Yankees.

<HEADLINE> Mercedes-Benz Unveils New Coupe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- With demand for top-of-the-line luxury cars  
growing strong, Mercedes-Benz expects to double U.S. sales of its 
flagship CL coupe after the redesigned model goes on sale early 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Mercedes unveiled the sleek CL500 and CL600 to open the Geneva  
International Motor Show's press preview Monday night. With only 
about 8,000 of the big German coupes scheduled to be built a year, 
the CL is one of the world's most exclusive production cars. 
</P>
<P>
	And for good reason: Though prices haven't been set, the new CL  
is expected to sell for about the same as the current model, which 
ranges from $90,000 to $130,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very exclusive clientele who have the means and desire  
to have such a product,'' said Mike Jackson, chief executive of 
Mercedes-Benz of North America. 
</P>
<P>
	Mercedes sold about 1,500 of the current CL in the United States  
last year and expects to sell about 3,000 of the new version, 
Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The most expensive model, the CL600, features an all-new  
6-liter, V12 engine that produces 367 horsepower and automatically 
runs on six cylinders when all 12 aren't needed for acceleration. 
Mercedes officials say that results in about 20 percent less fuel 
consumption. 
</P>
<P>
	The interior is draped in top-quality leather and a choice of  
woods: walnut or chestnut. European customers who want to pay a 
premium can even order a center console with an unusual veneer of 
crushed rock on aluminum -- which has the look of polished granite. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside, the coupe has clean, flowing lines with an arched roof  
line and a low silhouette for a sportier look than its 
predecessor's. 
</P>
<P>
	The CL and S-Class sedan, with which the coupe shares its  
chassis and many parts, are the models Mercedes uses to display its 
latest high-tech features. 
</P>
<P>
	The coupe, for example, uses an unusual combination of  
lightweight body materials that resulted in significant weight 
savings. The hood, rear fenders, roof and other parts are made of 
aluminum, the front fenders and trunk lid are made of plastic and 
the inside of the doors are made of magnesium. 
</P>
<P>
	The different materials meant that conventional welds could not  
always be used to join the body panels. Mercedes instead had to use 
bonding technology developed from aviation, including flanging, 
riveting and use of high-tech adhesives, said Helmut Petri, 
production manager for the Mercedes-Benz passenger car division. 
</P>
<P>
	The coupe offers what the company calls ``active body control,''  
which uses high-pressure hydraulics and two high-performance 
microcomputers to reduce body roll and other unwanted movement 
common in large cars during hard cornering and braking. 
</P>
<P>
	The CL is scheduled to go on sale in Europe on Aug. 2, followed  
by the United States in the first quarter of 2000.

<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo stocks rebounded Tuesday, powered by consumer  
electronics giant Sony Corp.'s announcement of a major corporate 
restructuring plan. The dollar fell against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei Stock Average rose 142.96 points, or 0.96 percent, to  
14,922.01 points by the close of the morning session. On Monday, 
the average closed down 114.95 points, or 0.77 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 121.06 yen in early trading, down 0.72 yen  
from late Monday in Tokyo and also below its level of 121.66 yen in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, Sony was the rare bright spot, with  
declining issues outnumbering gainers as selling pressure from the 
unwinding of cross-shareholdings remains strong. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sony is pulling up the whole market,'' said Kazunori Jinnai,  
general manager of the equity department at Daiwa Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the market opened Tuesday, Sony unveiled a corporate  
reorganization plan to absorb Sony Music Entertainment, Sony 
Chemicals and Sony Precision Technology as wholly-owned units 
around next January. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading in the shares of the three units involved were  
temporarily suspended Tuesday morning as exchange officials 
verified the information. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section rose 4.60 points, or 0.40 percent, to 1,152.35 
points. The TOPIX closed up 1.03 points, or 0.09 percent, the day 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 132.08 yen, down  
from 132.09 yen late Monday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the yield on 10-year Japanese government bond rose to  
1.735 percent from Monday's finish of 1.625 percent, driving its 
price down to 100.51 yen from 101.41 yen.

<HEADLINE>  Hornets Coach Dave Cowens Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT MILL, S.C. (AP) -- What was already the most difficult  
season in the Charlotte Hornets' 11-year history has taken another 
downward turn, this time with the resignation of coach Dave Cowens. 
</P>
<P>
	Unable to improve his status as one of the NBA's lowest-paid  
coaches, Cowens walked into the office of general manager Bob Bass 
before the team's practice Sunday at its training center and quit. 
</P>
<P>
	Bass described the reasons as ``irreconcilable differences,''  
but refused to elaborate, and team owner George Shinn could not be 
located for comment. But Charlotte's players and assistant coaches, 
including Cowens' former Boston Celtics teammate and close friend 
Paul Silas, said the resignation stemmed from Cowens' frustration 
at Shinn's refusal to give him a raise. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess he just couldn't take it any more,'' Silas said after  
running what was described as a somber practice following Cowens' 
departure. ``It really, really hurt him, this whole situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Silas, the only one of Cowens' three assistants with previous  
NBA head coaching experience, was to be named today the Hornets' 
interim head coach. 
</P>
<P>
	He'll try to resuscitate a franchise struggling on and off the  
court. 
</P>
<P>
	Shinn has been accused of unwanted sexual conduct by three  
women, and fans are calling for him to either start paying top 
dollar to keep good talent or to sell the team. Injuries have 
sidelined Charlotte's top two players, and one of them, Glen Rice, 
reportedly is about to be traded to the Los Angeles Lakers. The 
team has struggled to a 4-11 record, and attendance has plummeted 
for a club that used to consistently be among the NBA's leader in 
sellout crowds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hate to see this once-proud franchise headed in the  
direction it's headed,'' said forward Chuck Person, a 12-year NBA 
veteran in his first season with the Hornets. ``I know that when I 
played in Indiana and even with San Antonio, when we came to 
Charlotte it was really a home court and the fans were really some 
of the best fans in the world just from being around Carolina 
basketball. And now to see how the fans respond when our product 
runs on the floor, it's definitely a different scenario.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Person and the rest of the Hornets who spoke to reporters after  
Sunday night's practice all voiced support for Cowens, voted one of 
the NBA's 50 greatest players, who found quick success in 
Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
	Cowens, the only coach to lead the Hornets to consecutive 50-win  
seasons (54-28 in 1996-97, 51-31 in 1997-98), signed a three-year, 
$1.89 million contract in May 1996. The contract called for him to 
get $575,000 his first year, $625,000 last year and $675,000 this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	When Cowens went to Shinn last season and said he felt he should  
receive the NBA average of about $1.3 million, the Hornets offered 
him a four-year, $5.2 million extension. But Shinn reportedly 
withdrew the offer in February 1998 because he didn't feel Cowens 
was being appreciative enough. 
</P>
<P>
	Cowens went public with complaints about his salary last month  
as the team struggled to get started during the lockout-shortened 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coach just decided he had to do what's best for him,'' forward  
J.R. Reid said. ``For whatever reasons, Shinn and Coach didn't get 
along and couldn't work out the contract.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Silas said he tried to talk Cowens out of resigning.  
</P>
<P>
	``I told him there's just two more months left in the season,  
but his mind was made up,'' Silas said. ``At this point in the 
season, it's just shocking. That's the only word I can use.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Silas, who joined Cowens on NBA championship teams in Boston in  
1974 and 1976, was with five other teams during his 16-year playing 
career. He coached the San Diego Clippers from 1980-83, compiling a 
78-168 mark. Silas was an assistant with New Jersey, New York and 
Phoenix before joining the Hornets in 1997. He interviewed last 
summer for head-coaching vacancies in Chicago, Sacramento and 
Seattle, but wasn't offered any of the jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a difficult position to be in,'' he said as he left  
the training center Sunday night, five hours after Cowens quit. 
``But if you're called upon, then I think you have to accept it for 
the good of the organization, for the good of the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Point guard B.J. Armstrong said the coaching change could give  
the team a fresh start. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we can rebound,'' Armstrong said. ``I think throughout  
all of this something positive will happen, because this is one 
less thing for us to be concerned about.''

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stock markets closed generally higher  
Monday on the back of last week's record rally on Wall Street, but 
the key index slumped in Tokyo on worries over the rising Japanese 
yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average sank 114.95  
points, or 0.77 percent, to close at 14,779.05 points. On Friday, 
the average jumped 710.55 points, or 5.0 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices plunged in late trading, erasing a gain of more than 1  
percent in the major index, on worries that the rise in the yen 
could erode profits for Japanese companies. 
</P>
<P>
	In the morning, the Nikkei rose to as high as 15,116.10 -- its  
first time above 15,000 since Dec. 10 -- following a 5 percent rally 
on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	But the average fell back on fears a stronger currency could rob  
Japan's giant exporters of earnings by making their products more 
expensive and less competitive overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was quoted at 121.78 yen in late-afternoon trading,  
down 1.16 yen from late Friday in Tokyo and below its New York 
level of 122.80 yen late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar rose against the yen last week after Japan's central  
bank pushed interest rates lower by flooding the short-term money 
market with funds. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korean shares surged in reaction to Friday's sharp gains  
on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average rose 268.68 
points for a new closing high of 9,736.08. 
</P>
<P>
	The ratings upgrades of three South Korean banks by Moody's  
Investors Service Inc. late last week also boosted the Seoul Stock 
Exchange, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Korea Composite Stock Price Index rose 33.65 points, or 6.3  
percent, to 571.84. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices in Hong Kong closed higher for the second  
consecutive session, helped by last week's record gains on Wall 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hang Seng Index, the market's key indicator of blue chips,  
rose 22.87 points, or 0.2 percent, closing at 10,263.99. On Friday, 
the index had surged 328.36 points, or 3.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hong Kong market was also boosted by news reports that  
Hongkong Telecom and Microsoft Corp. of the United states plan a 
venture that would let Hong Kong residents use their computers to 
quickly download movies and to play video games. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI: Share prices closed higher for the second consecutive  
session after the government announced rising exports in the first 
two months of the year. The market's key Weighted Stock Price Index 
rose 10.23 points, or 0.15 percent, to 6,431.96. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed slightly higher. The  
The benchmark NZSE-40 Capital Index rose 3.22 points, or 0.1 
percent, to 2,173.74. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine share prices closed higher, bouyed by cuts in  
key interest rates and Wall Street's huge gain on Friday. The 
Philippine Stock Exchange index of 30 selected companies rose 14.87 
points, or 0.7 percent, to 2,028.28. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: The Australian stock market closed higher, bolstered by  
a strong U.S. equities market. The All Ordinaries index closed at 
2,929.6, up 27.1 points, or 0.9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA: Indonesian shares closed lower in thin trading. The key  
Composite Index fell 4.111 points, or 1.1 percent, to 384.568.

<HEADLINE> Seinfeld Is Highest-Paid Celebrity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Comedian Jerry Seinfeld, whose TV show  
``Seinfeld'' ended a hugely successful run on NBC last May, was the 
top-earning celebrity in 1998, according to Forbes magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	Seinfeld earned $267 million, surpassing fellow ``Seinfeld''  
collaborator and second-ranked Larry David, who took in $242 
million, Forbes said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Seinfeld and David benefited from the $1.7 billion sale of  
``Seinfeld'' into syndication. While Forbes acknowledged that they 
may not see all of the money for a few years, it credited them with 
the whole amount in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Director/producer Steven Spielberg, whose movie ``Saving Private  
Ryan'' is one of this year's favorites to win an Oscar for best 
picture, is third on the list with $175 million. 
</P>
<P>
	He is followed by talk-show host Oprah Winfrey with $125 million  
and 'Titanic' director James Cameron with $115 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Rounding out the top 10 are actor Tim Allen ($77 million),  
recently retired basketball player Michael Jordan ($69 million), 
writer and director Michael Crichton ($65 million), actor Harrison 
Ford ($58 million) and the Rolling Stones ($57 million). 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes created estimates based on figures compiled from  
interviews with attorneys, managers, agents, executives and 
entertainment insiders. It counts pretax gross income when it is 
earned, not when the celebrities are paid. 
</P>
<P>
	The business magazine released the list in conjunction with its  
first-ever Forbes Celebrity 100 ranking, which combines income and 
media buzz -- a blend of prominence on the Internet, on magazine 
covers, on TV and radio and in newspaper clippings -- to come up 
with a measure of future earning power. 
</P>
<P>
	While Seinfeld was 1998's top earner, he ranked only fourth on  
the power list, behind Jordan, Winfrey and film heartthrob Leonardo 
DiCaprio (who ranked 36th on the earnings list with $37 million).

<HEADLINE> Court Considers Reno Probe of Starr </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Independent prosecutor Kenneth Starr passed up  
an opportunity to try to fend off a Justice Department 
investigation into his handling of the Monica Lewinsky probe. 
</P>
<P>
	In court papers filed Monday, Starr and the Justice Department  
offered no encouragement for three federal judges to step into the 
question of whether Attorney General Janet Reno can investigate 
Starr's conduct of the Monica Lewinsky investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The department says the three-judge panel which appointed Starr  
has no authority to intervene. Independent Counsel Starr says the 
conservative group that raised the issue with the judges has no 
standing to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr emphasized that his filing did not address the underlying  
issue of whether Reno ``acted improperly'' in moving toward an 
investigation of his office. That might leave the door ajar for 
Starr to argue later that Reno is acting improperly. 
</P>
<P>
	The judges directed Reno and Starr last month to submit written  
arguments after receiving a request from Landmark Legal Foundation 
of Herndon, Va., which wanted the court to block the Justice 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr and the Justice Department have been involved in a dispute  
over who should investigate the prosecutor's handling of the 
Lewinsky investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Among questions to be investigated are contacts Starr and his  
prosecutors had with lawyers for Paula Jones in her sexual 
harassment lawsuit against President Clinton. Also under scrutiny 
would be prosecutors' conduct at a Jan. 16, 1998, confrontation 
with Ms. Lewinsky, when they discussed a possible immunity deal for 
her without her lawyer present. Justice Department guidelines 
generally require the lawyer's presence. 
</P>
<P>
	Landmark Legal Foundation ``has no personal stake in the alleged  
dispute'' and ``no injury to Landmark is ... traceable to the 
attorney general's alleged actions,'' said Starr's office. 
</P>
<P>
	In its court papers, the Justice Department argued that the  
panel of judges ``lacks authority'' to stop the attorney general 
from investigating Starr and that the private group's application 
for a writ of prohibition against Reno should be dismissed. The 
department further argued that it seems clear the law authorizes 
Reno to police Starr's conduct because the law explicitly gives her 
power to fire him. 
</P>
<P>
	Landmark maintains only Congress can investigate Starr.  
</P>
<P>
	Nothing grants the judges ``authority to prohibit the attorney  
general from inquiring into whether `good cause' exists to remove'' 
Starr, the Justice Department said in court papers filed by 
Solicitor General Seth Waxman. 
</P>
<P>
	The department stated that the only legal provision cited by the  
private group referring to the judges' authority relates to another 
subject entirely -- the scope of the prosecutor's investigative 
jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
	Landmark president Mark Levin said the group's standing to bring  
the matter before the court was irrelevant because ``this is a case 
where the special division'' of judges ``exercises its own 
supervisory powers to ensure the integrity of the investigative 
process.''

<HEADLINE> Court Refuses 2 Deportation Cases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a pair of confusing orders, the Supreme  
Court today refused to shed new light on the validity of government 
efforts to speed up the deportations of aliens convicted of 
committing crimes in this country. 
</P>
<P>
	Handling two separate but similar cases from Massachusetts and  
California, the court denied review to one and told a lower court 
to restudy the other. 
</P>
<P>
	In both, Justice Department lawyers had argued that lower court  
rulings would ``lead to significant delays in the removal of such 
aliens ... despite Congress' clear intent that removal of criminal 
aliens be expedited.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At issue were two 1996 laws, the Antiterrorism and Effective  
Death Penalty Act and the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant 
Responsibility Act. They dramatically altered the government's 
treatment of aliens who commit crimes or for other reasons face 
deportation. 
</P>
<P>
	Each law narrowed the opportunities given to aliens facing  
deportation to seek a federal court's help. The government's two 
appeals acted on today said federal appeals courts blunted the 
effect of both laws by allowing a greater chance for judicial 
review than Congress intended to provide. 
</P>
<P>
	The government said tens of thousands of pending cases could be  
affected. Government lawyers told the justices that 23,000 
``removal aliens'' are being held in federal prisons and 54,000 
more are state prison inmates. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's highest court ruled Feb. 24 that aliens who are in  
the United States unlawfully have no right to ask federal courts to 
thwart deportation based on alleged selective enforcement of 
immigration rules. 
</P>
<P>
	That ruling gave the government a big victory in its efforts to  
deport eight aliens who support a Palestinian group the government 
considers a terrorist organization. 
</P>
<P>
	In the California case acted on today, Daniel Magana-Pizano was  
deemed to be deportable after a 1995 conviction in state court for 
being under the influence of cocaine and a methamphetamine. A 
native and citizen of Mexico, he entered the United States as a 
lawful permanent resident in 1977, when he was 5. 
</P>
<P>
	Magana-Pizano indicated he would apply for a discretionary  
waiver of deportation because he did not realize Congress had 
changed the law. 
</P>
<P>
	The 9th U.S. Circuit Court used his case to rule last November  
that the 1996 immigration reform law did not preclude aliens' 
ability to ask federal trial judges for help in such situations. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, the justices set aside the appeals court's ruling and  
sent the case back for reconsideration in light of their Feb. 24 
ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Massachusetts case, Raul Percira Goncalves was declared  
deportable after his 1992 state court conviction for knowingly 
receiving stolen property. A native and citizen of Portugal who was 
admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent alien at age 
three in 1972, Goncalves previously had been convicted in 1988 and 
1989 on various charges. 
</P>
<P>
	He sought discretionary relief from deportation in 1994 under  
provisions then provided for by immigration law, but while his 
application was pending Congress passed and President Clinton 
signed the two 1996 laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the laws could  
not be applied retroactively to Goncalves' case to deny him a 
chance for discretionary relief. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department lawyers contend both lower courts were wrong  
but the Supreme Court today allowed the 1st Circuit court's ruling 
to remain intact. 
</P>
<P>
	The cases are Reno vs. Goncalves, 98-835, and Immigration and  
Naturalization Service vs. Magana-Pizano, 98-836.

<HEADLINE> Lawyers Outline Ark. Overthrow Plot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Two men accused in a murderous campaign  
to overthrow the U.S. government and set up a whites-only nation 
drowned an Arkansas family and then joked that the victims were on 
a ``liquid diet,'' a federal prosecutor said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Chevie Kehoe, 26, of Colville, Wash., and Danny Lee, 26, of  
Yukon, Okla., are charged with murder, racketeering and conspiracy. 
They could get the death penalty if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Kehoe and Lee are accused of using a campaign of violence to set  
up a whites-only nation in the Pacific Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
	The crimes associated with their alleged plot include a 1996  
bombing at City Hall in Spokane, Wash.; shootouts with Ohio police; 
the slayings of two people in Idaho; and the drownings of a white 
Arkansas family of three. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Attorney Dan Stripling told the mostly black jury during  
opening statements Monday that Kehoe's beliefs were based on those 
of Robert Mathews, the founder of the Aryan Nations white 
supremacist group. Mathews was killed in 1984 when his hideout 
caught fire during a shootout with federal agents in Washington 
state. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutor said Kehoe and Lee robbed the Arkansas family in  
1996 and killed them by taping plastic bags over their heads, 
weighing them down with rocks and throwing them into a bayou. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, the defendants told Kehoe's parents that the family was  
on ``a liquid diet,'' Stripling said. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge has issued a gag order in the case, but Lee's mother,  
Lea Graham, said her son is innocent and no racist.

<HEADLINE>  Brand Unanimous All-America Choice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Elton Brand, who missed almost half his freshman season with a  
broken foot, became a year later the only unanimous choice on the 
1998-99 Associated Press All-America team. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke's 6-foot-8 sophomore center was joined Monday on the first  
team by junior forward Richard Hamilton of Connecticut and senior 
guards Andre Miller of Utah and Jason Terry of Arizona, and junior 
guard Mateen Cleaves of Michigan State. 
</P>
<P>
	Brand, who averaged 17.8 points and 9.8 rebounds for the  
top-ranked Blue Devils, was named on all 72 first-team ballots by 
the national media panel to become the fourth unanimous selection 
of the '90s. The others were Christian Laettner of Duke in 1992, 
Glenn Robinson of Purdue in 1994 and Tim Duncan of Wake Forest in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unbelievable. I'm just elated right now. Just to have  
been considered for a position of first-team All-America is a 
special, special honor,'' said Brand, who shot 62 percent from the 
field. ``I knew I worked hard, and the hard work paid off. Growing 
up it's one of the things you definitely dream of. I'm definitely a 
team person and the individual accolades come when the team wins.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brand was an honorable mention All-America last season despite  
missing 15 games with the injury, but he showed he was healed this 
summer when he led the U.S. team in the Goodwill Games in scoring 
and rebounding. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller was the second-leading vote-getter in the 5-3-1 process,  
getting 330 points with 60 first-team votes. The Western Athletic 
Conference player of the year averaged 15.9 points, 5.5 rebounds, 
5.7 assists and 2.5 steals, and the 6-2 guard was given more credit 
for his team leadership than statistics. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a real honor. I can't take the credit myself because we  
have a great team and they deserve the award also,'' said Miller, 
an honorable mention last season when the Utes reached the Final 
Four. ``It makes being a leader easy when you have a team like we 
have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton, who won or shared Big East player of the year honors  
the last two seasons, averaged 21.0 points and 4.8 rebounds this 
season for the Huskies who were ranked No. 1 for 10 weeks. The 6-6 
swingman, the leading vote-getter on the second team last season, 
had 48 first-team votes and 300 points this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's worked hard at expanding his total game, and has become  
one of the top collegiate players in the nation,'' Connecticut 
coach Jim Calhoun said. ``Last year, he just missed being a 
first-team selection and this year has rightfully earned his spot 
among the top five players in college basketball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Terry, 6-2, becomes the third Wildcat to earn All-America honors  
in the last two years. Former teammates Mike Bibby and Miles Simon 
were chosen last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Terry, the Pac-10 player of the year, led the league in scoring  
(22.1), assists (5.6) and steals (2.7) -- the first player to do 
that since Gary Payton of Oregon State in 1989-90. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no one more deserving for this honor because of what  
he has had to go through, in that he has had to provide leadership 
to the three freshmen in our starting lineup,'' Arizona coach Lute 
Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Terry got 48 first-team votes and 293 points, 83 more than  
Cleaves, who was on 19 first-team ballots. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleaves, 6-2, was a second-team choice last season and was named  
Big Ten player of the year by the league's coaches for the second 
straight year. He averaged 11.8 points and 7.2 assists as the 
Spartans won their second straight Big Ten regular-season title. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got to give a lot of credit to my teammates,'' he said.  
``If we wouldn't have won a championship, I wouldn't have earned 
this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The second team was senior center Evan Eschmeyer of  
Northwestern, who had one point less than Cleaves, Chris Porter of 
Auburn, Wally Szczerbiak of Miami of Ohio, Steve Francis of 
Maryland and Trajan Langdon of Duke, a third-team choice last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	The third team was Tim James of Miami, Baron Davis of UCLA,  
Scoonie Penn of Ohio State, Quincy Lewis of Minnesota and Ron 
Artest of St. John's. 
</P>
<P>
	Terry was the only first-team choice who wasn't on the preseason  
All-America team. TCU's Lee Nailon was the fifth member of the 
preseason team.

<HEADLINE>  Blackmun's Coffin Viewed at Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Harry A. Blackmun's body lay in repose Monday  
at the Supreme Court building where he spent close to a 
quarter-century influencing American law. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of family members, 88 former law clerks and seven of the  
court's current nine members gathered for a simple, solemn 
15-minute ceremony in the building's ornate Great Hall before 
members of the public began to file past the closed coffin. 
</P>
<P>
	Blackmun, author of the 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision that  
legalized abortion nationwide and more than 350 other Supreme Court 
rulings, died Thursday at 90. He had retired in 1994 after serving 
24 years on the nation's highest court. 
</P>
<P>
	He became history's fifth Supreme Court member to lie in repose,  
following Chief Justices Earl Warren and Warren Burger and fellow 
justices Thurgood Marshall and William Brennan. 
</P>
<P>
	As violinist Robert McDuffie played the hymn ``How Great Thou  
Art,'' Blackmun's widow, Dottie, listened silently from her 
wheelchair. The couple's five grandchildren, arms linked and softly 
weeping, stood to her left, the Blackmuns' three daughters to her 
right. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. William Lawrence, a Methodist minister, read from the  
Book of Psalms and led those present in prayers in memory of ``our 
brother Harry Andrew Blackmun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blackmun's casket, draped in the same 48-star flag that adorned  
his father's coffin, rested on the bier first used for Abraham 
Lincoln's funeral. Nearby, a 1978 portrait of the justice was on 
display. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist noted, ``with sadness,''  
Blackmun's death for the court's official record earlier in the 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	``He will be missed by his friends throughout the judiciary and  
the country,'' Rehnquist said. 
</P>
<P>
	Justices John Paul Stevens and Antonin Scalia, who were out of  
town, were the only current court members not present. The sole 
remaining retired justice, Byron R. White, attended, standing next 
to Mary Fowler Brennan, widow of the late Justice William Brennan. 
</P>
<P>
	Just three years ago, White was one of four retired justices but  
Brennan died in 1997 and Lewis Powell in 1998.

<HEADLINE> `Analyze This' Tops Box Office / Box Office  </HEADLINE>

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The mob comedy ``Analyze This'' opened as  
kingpin of the weekend box office, taking in $18.4 million, final 
industry figures showed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The film, starring Robert De Niro as a neurotic gang boss who  
turns to Billy Crystal for therapy, beat out another new film,

<HEADLINE> Strawberries Doing Well in Ga. / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -- Georgia's strawberry crop is looking peachy,  
but farmers are worried about this year's peach crop -- only about 
one-third of which has begun to bloom. 
</P>
<P>
	About 750 cold hours have been logged this year. And that's less  
than what farmers like to see, said James Willis, a University of 
Georgia extension agent in Taylor County. Peach trees blossom best 
with 800 to 1,000 cold hours by this time of year. 
</P>
<P>
	The lack of cold has caused the state's peach farmers to begin  
experimenting with a technique that forces their trees to bloom. 
The technique, adopted by an agriculture specialist at Auburn 
University, uses a chemical called Dormex on the trees. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just been the wrong weather at all the wrong times this  
year,'' Willis said. ``We're holding our breath.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Willis said that despite the lack of cold, farmers are hoping a  
hard freeze does not make matters worse like it has in years past. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Georgia's peach crop totaled 70 million pounds, which  
was 44 percent of the 160 million pounds produced the year before. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales from Georgia's peach crop normally total about $35  
million. Middle Georgia farmers produce about 80 percent to 85 
percent of the crop while growers in southern Georgia produce the 
remainder. 
</P>
<P>
	But while the peach crop is still a work in progress, growers  
say the state's strawberry crop is looking promising. 
</P>
<P>
	William Bell owns self-pick strawberry farms in Ward, S.C., and  
North Augusta. He says the cold has done a little bit of damage but 
amid the greenery, he has strawberries as big as quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just frustrating when you don't know what you're going to  
be up against from day to day,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell say his biggest fear is another hard frost that will ruin  
his strawberry crops, which look so promising right now. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, it wasn't frost that damaged his crops but rain and  
rot. 
</P>
<P>
	``We saved between 80 and 95 percent of our crop, but we went to  
extreme measures to do it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	For now though, Bell says his strawberry crop, which spans four  
acres in Taylor County, looks like a winner. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've seemed to escape the cold,'' Willis said. ``We should  
be picking next week.'' 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	BENTONVILLE, Ark. (AP) -- Fruit growers in Northwest Arkansas are  
keeping a nervous eye on their crops because mild weather has 
caused some blackberries, strawberries and blueberries to bloom 
early. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're on pins and needles,'' said Robert Seay, an agent of  
the Benton County Cooperative Extension Service. ``The jury will 
stay out until April 15th or 20th because that's when the last 
frost is expected. ... If you're a commercial grower, your whole 
season is determined in the next few weeks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Small plants are pretty well protected until their fruit-bud  
shoots begin to open, he said, and the recent warm weather has 
speeded the process. 
</P>
<P>
	Seay said the coldest temperature tolerated consistently by most  
small fruit plants is 26 degrees although growers usually can 
protect plants against one night of freezing weather. 
</P>
<P>
	``What it all boils down to is how far along the plant  
development has progressed,'' Seay said. 
</P>
<P>
	The strawberry crop in the area is most at risk, Seay said,  
adding that strawberries tend to bloom quickly, while blueberries 
and blackberries are heartier and slower to develop. 
</P>
<P>
	John R. Clark, assistant professor of horticulture at the  
University of Arkansas, said growers with sprinkler systems can 
protect strawberries by continually applying water to plants when 
the temperature dips into the 20s. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark said the freezing reaction gives off heat, which keeps the  
plants at around 30 degrees.

</P>
<P>
	In 1977, about a dozen armed Hanafi Muslims invaded three

</P>
<P>
	In 1997, gangsta rapper The Notorious B.I.G., whose real name  
was Christopher Wallace, was killed in a drive-by shooting in Los 
Angeles; he was 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten years ago: The Senate rejected President Bush's nomination  
of John Tower to be defense secretary by a vote of 53-47. 
</P>
<P>
	Five years ago: The U.N. Human Rights Commission condemned  
anti-Semitism, putting the world body on record for the first time 
as opposing discrimination against Jews. 
</P>
<P>
	One year ago: In a case pitting former high school sweethearts  
against each other, Brian Peterson pleaded guilty in Wilimington, 
Del., to manslaughter in the death of his newborn son in a Newark, 
N.J., motel and agreed to testify against the mother, Amy 
Grossberg. She eventually pleaded guilty to manslaughter. She 
received 2 1/2 years in prison; Peterson, two years.

<HEADLINE> Laser Drilling Relieves Chest Pain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- A laser mounted on a tube the width of a  
cocktail straw can blast tiny holes in the walls of the heart, 
triggering the growth of blood vessels that substantially relieve 
crippling chest pain. 
</P>
<P>
	Lasers are already used as a last-ditch treatment of bad chest  
pain in some people, but an experimental new approach described 
Sunday appears much safer and can be used without open-heart 
surgery.

	Experts say the promising results should help relieve many  
doctors' skepticism about laser therapy of the heart. 
</P>
<P>
	Heart lasers were approved by the U.S. Food and Drug  
Administration for routine use last year. However, the treatment 
requires opening the chest and carries a 6 percent to 10 percent 
risk of death. 
</P>
<P>
	The new approach involves threading the laser into the heart on  
a catheter, something that doctors do routinely for a variety of 
procedures, such as angioplasty. 
</P>
<P>
	If it works as well as data so far suggest, it could offer  
relief to many thousands of Americans whose heart pain cannot be 
treated with angioplasty or bypass surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is for people with no options who are miserable with  
their angina,'' said Dr. Stephen N. Oesterle of Massachusetts 
General Hospital in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Oesterly presented the results of the largest study yet with  
this approach at a meeting of the American College of Cardiology. 
</P>
<P>
	In his study, doctors at 12 hospitals in the United States and  
England randomly assigned 221 patients to have either the laser 
therapy or routine medical care. All had severe angina, resulting 
from poor circulation to their heart muscle. 
</P>
<P>
	Angina is rated on a scale of 1 to 4. Before treatment, all were  
in stage 3 or 4, meaning they had chest pain will eating, brushing 
their teeth or even sitting perfectly still. 
</P>
<P>
	After laser treatment, two-thirds had improved at least two  
grades to stage 1 or 2. This meant they could walk about their 
homes comfortably, even though climbing stairs might still trigger 
pain. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can lead a normal life with class 2 angina,'' said  
Oesterle. ``You cannot with class 4 angina.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The laser is threaded into the left ventricle, where doctors  
burn 10 to 15 tiny holes into the heart walls. None died during the 
procedure. Patients can be sent home the same day they are treated. 
</P>
<P>
	When the approach was first proposed in the 1980s, doctors  
theorized that the holes acted as substitute blood vessels, 
carrying blood to oxygen-starved muscle. However, experts now know 
that the holes themselves quickly plug up, serving no purpose. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, it now appears that the laser damage somehow triggers  
the heart to grow tiny new arteries, a process called angiogenesis. 
These arteries feed the muscle that cannot be adequately nourished 
by the heart's clogged coronary arteries. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Ben McCallister of Mid America Heart Institute in Kansas  
City said Oesterle's results will probably make physicians more 
open to the idea of using lasers to improve heart circulation. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has been a lot of skepticism about this,'' said  
McCallister. ``I think this very careful study will change the tide 
about how people think about this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oesterle tested a laser system developed by CardioGenesis Corp.,  
where he has been a consultant. Similar approaches are also being 
tested with lasers developed by Eclipse Surgical Technologies and 
Biosense, Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Patrick L. Whitlow of the Cleveland Clinic Foundation  
presented preliminary data at the meeting on patients treated with 
the Eclipse laser. Eighty percent of the patients improved at least 
two stages in their degree of angina.

<HEADLINE> SEC Makes Record NCAA Showing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Looking for a sure way to get into the NCAA women's basketball  
tournament? 
</P>
<P>
	Scheduling tough opponents certainly helps. So does winning a  
lot of games. But what really helps is playing in the Southeastern 
Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA selection committee loaded up its brackets with SEC  
teams Sunday, giving berths to defending national champion 
Tennessee and seven others from that league -- four of whom finished 
at .500 or below in the conference. 
</P>
<P>
	That's a record for one conference, and a deserved one at that,  
Georgia coach Andy Landers said. The SEC previously had as many as 
seven teams in the NCAA field. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly, we've lived for years with the idea that we play in  
the most competitive conference in the country,'' said Landers, 
whose team is seeded third in the Mideast Regional.''Eight teams is 
certainly a compliment to the players and coaches. Most years, we 
easily could have had one more team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other SEC teams chosen for the tournament were Auburn, Alabama,  
Florida, Kentucky, Louisiana State and Mississippi State. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee (28-2) was seeded No. 1 in the East. The second-ranked  
Lady Vols begin their quest for a fourth consecutive NCAA 
championship at home Saturday against Appalachian State (14-14), 
which qualified by winning the Southern Conference tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no surprises in the No. 1 seeds, with the other slots  
going to top-ranked Purdue (Midwest), third-ranked Louisiana Tech 
(West) and sixth-ranked Connecticut (Mideast). 
</P>
<P>
	The selection committee felt comfortable taking so many SEC  
teams because it was the No. 1-ranked league all season and all of 
those selected had strong power ratings, said Bernadette McGlade, 
who chairs the committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``The committee felt strongly that teams that got in from the  
top three or four conferences in the country were all teams that 
definitely were one of the best 64 in the country,'' McGlade said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That does not mean the SEC will forever get eight,'' she said.  
``I think it fluctuates by teams and conferences on an annual 
basis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two other SEC teams, Arkansas and Mississippi, were selected for  
the women's National Invitation Tournament, which was expanded from 
16 to 32 teams this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think most folks would tell you that one through those top  
eight or nine ... you go into the arena knowing you have to play 
strong basketball to win,'' Summitt said. ``When you weren't ready 
to play, you didn't come away with a win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlantic Coast Conference and Big 12 followed the SEC with  
five teams each in the NCAA field. The Big East, Big Ten, 
Conference USA and Pac-10 all had four. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee also rewarded lesser-known teams that tried to  
play competitive schedules outside their league. Maine, for 
instance, received an at-large bid out of the America East 
Conference, which usually gets only its tournament champion in the 
NCAA field. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing in our rules that says the America East can  
only have its automatic qualifier,'' McGlade said. ``They did make 
an effort to schedule. They had Tulane, Mississippi, Western 
Kentucky -- out of region games against teams that were projected to 
be tournament teams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lack of a challenging schedule left Cal Santa Barbara,  
ranked 17th and winner of 21 straight games, as a No. 10 seed in 
the West. Cal Santa Barbara plays in the Big West, the nation's 
17th-ranked conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``Scheduling out of conference becomes very important when teams  
can't rely on their conference ranking to get them in the 
tournament,'' said McGlade, who noted Santa Barbara didn't play 
anyone with an RPI in the top 25. ``I would recommend scheduling a 
handful of (strong) nonconference opponents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut claimed a No. 1 seed after bouncing back from a rash  
of injuries at midseason, when the Huskies lost three of six games. 
They've won 12 of 13 since, including an impressive three-game run 
through the Big East tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, a late-season injury to All-American Nykesha Sales  
kept Connecticut from becoming a No. 1 seed and the Huskies were 
dropped to a No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, a key injury cost Notre Dame, expected to be among  
the top 16 seeds before losing point guard Niele Ivey to a 
season-ending knee injury in the Big East tournament. The 
eighth-ranked Irish, with their best record ever at 25-4, became 
the No. 5 seed in the West. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't get it,'' said Notre Dame coach Muffet McGraw, whose  
team beat three of the tournament's No. 3 seeds this season. ``I 
think Niele is a great player, but I think with a week to practice 
we're going to be fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Final Four is in San Jose, Calif., and the national  
semifinals will match the Midwest against the West and the East vs. 
the Mideast. That creates the possibility of a Tennessee-Louisiana 
Tech rematch in the championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee beat Tech 93-75 in last year's title game in Kansas  
City, Mo., to complete a 39-0 season. And while the Lady Vols 
haven't been as dominant this season, Summitt says they're ready to 
go. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this team has been waiting for March,'' she said.  
``We're all excited that it's finally here.''

<HEADLINE> CIT Buys Newcourt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LIVINGSTON, N.J. (AP) -- CIT Group Inc. acquired Newcourt Credit  
Group Inc. in a $4.2 billion stock deal Monday, creating the 
commercial financing industry's largest publicly held company. 
</P>
<P>
	CIT, based in Livingston, will exchange 0.92 of its shares for  
each share of Newcourt. The two companies combined have more than 
$50 billion in managed assets, $2.2 billion in revenues and more 
than $500 million in after-tax earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of CIT fell 56 1/4 cents to $30.18 3/4 in trading on the New  
York Stock Exchange. Shares of Newcourt rose 81 1/4 to $26.62 1/2, also 
on the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
	CIT president and chief executive officer Albert R. Gamper Jr.  
will become chairman of the board and will remain CEO of the 
combined companies. Steven K. Hudson, Newcourt's president and CEO, 
will be The CIT Group's president and a member of the board of 
directors. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a bold and transforming transaction for CIT, combining  
our extensive management experience and `best in class' credit 
capabilities with Newcourt's innovative, entrepreneurial spirit,'' 
Gamper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hudson said the merger would streamline costs and diversify the  
businesses of Newcourt, based in Toronto and Parsippany, and 
Livingston-based CIT. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies expect to save $150 million through the merger, he  
said. CIT also hopes to capitalize on Newcourt clients like Dell 
and Lucent and expand its marketing presence in North America and 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Both companies' boards unanimously approved the merger, which is  
expected to be completed during the third quarter of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	CIT shareholders will own 54 percent of the combined company  
after the merger -- with CIT's largest shareholder, the Dai-Ichi 
Kangyo Bank, owning 24 percent of the company. Newcourt 
shareholders will own 46 percent.

<HEADLINE> Army Museums Eyed for Penn., D.C. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Pennsylvania and the Washington, D.C., area  
will be home to two new Army museums, including one that will 
chronicle the American soldier from the pre-Revolutionary period to 
the present, Army officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Army Secretary Louis Caldera did not elaborate on what  
collections or artifacts would go to each location. 
</P>
<P>
	But an Army spokesman said the museum in Carlisle, Pa., will not  
be the comprehensive national museum that has been in the works 
since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	That leaves Washington as the location for the national museum,  
although Lt. Col. Bill Wheelehan said the Army is not ready to make 
a formal announcement. But he said: ``To have an Army museum, one 
that represents the entire Army, if you put it in any one state, 
you slight the other states.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pennsylvania had lobbied long and hard to build it in Carlisle,  
near the Carlisle Barracks, the second-oldest U.S. Army post behind 
West Point, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	One site mentioned for the museum is vacant acreage at the  
Washington Navy Yard complex. Five dozen sites across the nation 
have been considered for the national Army museum, which would be 
built using private donations. 
</P>
<P>
	Army officials have envisioned a museum to house about 500,000  
artifacts, such as uniforms, insignia, muskets, cannon, tanks, 
books, photographs and paintings dating to the late 18th century. 
Some artifacts are on display at the Pentagon, but most are stored 
in warehouses in Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
	Carlisle would join 55 specialized Army museums around the  
nation that focus on specific units, such as infantry or artillery. 
Other military branches have comprehensive national museums similar 
to the one the Army plans to build. 
</P>
<P>
	Pennsylvania officials initially proposed an $80 million,  
300,000-square-foot complex to house the national museum. They 
tempered their praise for Carlisle's selection as the site of a 
museum of yet-to-be-determined scope. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most important thing is it must be first-rate,'' Rep.  
William Goodling, R-Pa., said. ``It has to have the equipment, the 
uniforms and the history and the ammunition and everything from 
every era.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Army criteria developed in early stages would locate the  
national museum in the Washington area. Army officials have been 
reluctant to change that. 
</P>
<P>
	To lure the Army to Carlisle, Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge  
offered $5 million in road improvements and other state funding. 
Carlisle's Cumberland County offered to donate 54 acres of farmland 
near the old barracks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Carlisle post was where President George Washington reviewed  
troops as they left to quell the Whiskey Rebellion in western 
Pennsylvania in 1794. It was set ablaze by Confederates during the 
Civil War. The barracks now house the Army War College and the 
Military History Institute.

<HEADLINE> SLOC Hires Bill Wagner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The man who helped Olympic organizers  
draft their budget and map out planning has been hired as senior 
vice president of operations for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Salt Lake Organizing Committee on Monday announced Bill  
Wagner's promotion from managing director of operations to senior 
vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	Wagner will take over most of the responsibilities of former  
SLOC senior vice president Dave Johnson, who was forced to resign 
Jan. 8 because of his role in Salt Lake's tainted bid effort. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm enthused and excited to be part of the 2002 Games,''  
Wagner said. 
</P>
<P>
	He has more than 20 years of experience in operations and  
project management with Bechtel Corp., which received $750,000 from 
the SLOC to help craft the committee's budget. 
</P>
<P>
	The California-based engineering and consulting firm aided  
organizers of the Summer Games in Los Angeles in 1984 and in 
Barcelona in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Wagner, who headed Bechtel's consulting project for the SLOC,  
will take a leave of absence from the firm to join the organizing 
committee full time. 
</P>
<P>
	While he was the SLOC's managing director of operations, Wagner  
had remained under contract with Bechtel.

<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Darryl Strawberry's comeback from colon  
cancer will come sooner than expected. 
</P>
<P>
	New York manager Joe Torre said Monday night that Strawberry  
will start at designated hitter when the Yankees travel to Fort 
Myers on Wednesday to face the Boston Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was thinking more toward the middle of the month, but Darryl  
said he was ready,'' Torre said. ``The sooner he gets with it, the 
better chance he has of being ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry, also slowed in recent years by knee problems,  
resumed his running program last week. He was not expected to make 
his spring training debut until next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry had colon cancer surgery last October, and will  
undergo chemotherapy through at least April. He started spring 
training as one of four candidates for what is expected to a 
left-field platoon. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even at DH, it will tell us how is knee is going to hold up  
and what his endurance is,'' Torre said.

	Joe DiMaggio Dies at 84  
</P>
<P>
	HOLLYWOOD, Fla. (AP) -- Baseball great Joe DiMaggio died today  
after a five-month battle with lung cancer. President Clinton, 
sports figures and ordinary Americans hailed the New York Yankees 
legend. Fellow Hall of Famer Ted Williams said: ``There is no one 
Ted Williams admired, respected and envied more than Joe DiMaggio. 
Because of my close relationship with the DiMaggio family, I feel a 
very deep personal loss.'' At DiMaggio's bedside when he died were 
brother Dominick, a former major-league outfielder; two 
grandchildren; attorney Morris Engelberg, a friend; and Joe 
Nacchio, a friend. A funeral will be held Thursday in California.

reconstruction aid -- $956 million -- and offered encouragement 
against any threat of political instability. ``Not so long ago, 
your country overcame a terrible war and emerged even stronger,''

<HEADLINE> Man Weeps at Sweepstakes Hearing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a Senate hearing designed to present horror  
stories about sweepstakes promotions, a Florida man began sobbing 
today as he testified about spending money he had saved to send his 
daughter to law school. 
</P>
<P>
	Eustace A. Hall, of Brandon, Fla., became so emotional that the  
daughter, Angela, had to finish reading his statement. Despite the 
financial problems encountered by her father, she completed her 
studies and is now an attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall was among six witnesses who lashed out at sweepstakes  
companies at a hearing of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on 
Investigations. The chairman, Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, has 
sponsored legislation that would impose the first national 
regulation of sweepstakes mailings and levy hefty fines for 
deceptive practices. They legislation also would prevent companies 
from telling recipients they won something when they haven't, and 
from using the smallest print to list the almost insurmountable 
odds of winning a major prize. 
</P>
<P>
	``I estimate I have spent $15,000 to $20,000 from 1992 to the  
present on sweepstake purchases,'' Hall's statement, read by his 
daughter, said. ``They always led me to believe that I had to 
purchase products to win. After all the time and money I spent I 
have nothing to show for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before a hushed hearing room filled with lobbyists and  
representatives of the major sweepstakes companies, Hall, with a 
box of tissues in front of him, broke down after telling the 
hearing that he entered the contests to provide his daughter ``with 
more financial assistance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sweepstakes industry representatives, who have been accused  
by numerous state attorneys general of preying on the elderly, will 
testify Tuesday. The companies have not yet taken a position on the 
legislation, but have hired some of Washington's major lobbying 
firms to help shape the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Hall, five other witnesses recounted the  
experiences of their parents and in-laws, who also spent much of 
their life savings to buy magazines and other products in pursuit 
of prizes that they thought they had won. 
</P>
<P>
	Patti McElligott, of Tyler, Texas, handed Collins and Sen. Carl  
Levin, D-Mich. a ``golden horseshoe watch'' that was purchased in a 
sweepstakes promotion for $20.29. ``I wouldn't give you a dime for 
it,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Levin said he would keep it to show to the industry witnesses on  
Tuesday, joking, ``This won't violate our gift rule'' that only 
allows senators to keep gifts worth less than $50.

<HEADLINE> US, EU Face Off on Banana Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- An irate European Union appealed today to members  
of the World Trade Organization to denounce U.S. sanctions in the 
trans-Atlantic banana trade row, but found many countries telling 
both trade giants to stop tying up the world agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington insists it has the right to take the step on  
sanctions because of EU reluctance to change import policies that 
American banana sellers say squeeze them out of the European 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	But many trade diplomats complain that the dispute is blocking  
the WTO from doing anything else. Some have expressed fears that 
the maneuvering by the WTO's two most powerful members threatens to 
wreck the world's rules-based trading system. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were a lot of countries which said we need to get this  
dispute settled,'' said WTO spokesman Keith Rockwell during a break 
in a closed-door gathering of the entire WTO membership this 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Rockwell quoted Canadian Ambassador John Weekes as saying the  
world was ``mesmerized'' by the dispute even though EU-US trade 
amounts to only 5 percent of the global market. The WTO should be 
focusing on the other 95 percent, Weekes added. 
</P>
<P>
	Roderick Abbott, head of the EU trade delegation in Geneva,  
claimed to have broad support against U.S. actions. ``There is a 
very wide feeling that they have done the wrong thing,'' Abbott 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the request of the EU, the WTO summoned all its 134 member  
countries to the meeting of the general council, its top 
decision-making body, to discuss U.S. sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States accuses the 15-member European Union of  
failing to carry out WTO rulings against its selective banana 
import policy, which the United States claims favors producers in 
former European colonies at the expense of U.S.-owned producers 
with huge plantations in Central and South America. 
</P>
<P>
	It has asked the WTO to approve Washington's proposal of 100  
percent tariffs on $520 million worth of European goods, which aim 
to equal the lost sales claimed by U.S.-owned banana companies. 
</P>
<P>
	After the WTO last week delayed approving the U.S. tariffs, the  
Clinton administration notified U.S. importers that they must start 
setting aside funds to cover the tariffs pending a WTO decision. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. requirement means that Washington is in effect  
implementing the sanctions without first getting WTO approval, said 
Abbott. 
</P>
<P>
	The tariffs would apply to a wide range of European products  
chosen by the Clinton administration to penalize particularly those 
EU countries that supported the banana policies. Products could 
include handbags, coffee makers and cashmere sweaters. 
</P>
<P>
	Denmark and the Netherlands are excluded, but all other  
countries are affected. Britain, one of the hardest-hit, has been 
particularly outspoken in its protest.

                           *Joe DiMaggio    	
</P>
<P>
	HOLLYWOOD, Fla. (AP) -- Joe DiMaggio, who captivated the nation  
as the elegant star of the marquee New York Yankees during 
baseball's golden era, died Monday after a five-month battle with 
lung cancer. He was 84. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio was forever the classy Yankee Clipper, who amazed  
America with The Streak and married Marilyn Monroe. He roamed 
center field and ran the basepaths for the New York Yankees for 13 
seasons, from 1936 through 1951, with three years off for military 
service in World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio played for 10 pennant winners and nine World Series  
champions. He batted .325 lifetime, with 361 home runs. He won 
three American League Most Valuable Player awards, appeared in 11 
All-Star games, and entered the Hall of Fame in 1955, his third 
year of eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the numbers don't account fully for his place on the  
American cultural landscape, the reason Ernest Hemingway wrote 
about him and Simon and Garfunkel sang about him. 
</P>
<P>
	For all his exploits, DiMaggio displayed perhaps his most magic  
in the summer of '41, when he had at least one hit in 56 
consecutive games, one of baseball's most enduring records. The 
streak riveted a country fresh from the Depression, with war just 
months away, and elevated DiMaggio from baseball star to national 
celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
	He ascended to the top rank of popular culture in 1954 when he  
wed Monroe, a storybook marriage that lasted less than a year and 
left him brokenhearted. For years after she died in 1962, DiMaggio 
sent roses to her grave but refused to talk about her. 
</P>
<P>
	Long after retiring as a player, DiMaggio served briefly as a  
vice president and coach for the Oakland A's, and as a member of 
the board of directors of the Baltimore Orioles. When he was not 
traveling, DiMaggio lived alone in his home on Florida's exclusive 
Harbour Island.

</P>
<P>
	RANCHO MIRAGE, Calif. (AP) -- Donald Goodenow, managing editor of  
the now-defunct Los Angeles Herald-Examiner who steered the 
newspaper through a decade of employee strikes, died of a heart 
attack Thursday. He was 78. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodenow started his newspaper career as a copy boy at the Los  
Angeles Examiner in 1942. He quickly moved his way up, working on 
the copy desk, as photo editor and Sunday editor. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1962 the Examiner merged with the afternoon Herald Express,  
creating one of the largest afternoon newspapers in the United 
States. Goodenow was named managing editor, then the top editorial 
job at the newly formed Herald-Examiner. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodenow became assistant to the publisher in 1978 and held that  
position until his retirement in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	He is survived by his wife Grayce, a son and a daughter.

<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Antonio Houaiss, Brazil's former  
minister of culture, died Sunday from multiple organ failure. He 
was 83. 
</P>
<P>
	Houaiss became minister of culture in 1992 under former  
President Itamar Franco. In addition to books about politics and 
poetry, he also wrote one on the pleasure of drinking beer. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, Houaiss was made president of the prestigious Brazilian  
Academy of Literature. He left the post after six months because of 
ill health but remained an academy member.

<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Carl A. Kroch, who earned the nickname ``Baron of  
Books'' as head of the Kroch's &AMP; Brentano's bookstore chain, died 
Saturday. He was 84. 
</P>
<P>
	Kroch's father, an Austrian immigrant named Adolph Kroch, set up  
his first shop in 1907 in Chicago as a German-language book store. 
After merging with the Brentano's bookstore in Chicago, the chain 
eventually grew to 19 stores in the Chicago area. 
</P>
<P>
	Kroch anticipated several trends in bookselling, including  
opening outlets in suburban malls and returning unsold books to 
publishers for credit. 
</P>
<P>
	But one practice Kroch refused to allow was to offer deep  
discounts. That decision would partly lead to the demise of Kroch's 
&AMP; Brentano's as large discount chains took over the bookselling 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, the company closed its last stores. By that time, Kroch  
had sold his share of the business.

<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Martin R. Shugrue Jr., an airline executive who  
nearly rescued doomed Eastern Airlines and Pan Am during a lifetime 
in the industry, died Sunday. He was 58. 
</P>
<P>
	Shugrue, who worked with airline consulting firm Aviation  
Management Services in the last year, joined Pan American World 
Airways in 1968 after serving as a Navy pilot. A year later he went 
into management, fast ascending within the New York-based carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	By 1983 he was elected vice chairman of Pan Am's board, but he  
left five years later to become president of Houston-based 
Continental Airlines. After serving as trustee-in-bankruptcy of 
Eastern Airlines, nearly rescuing it in the early 1990s, Shugrue 
started the new Pan Am in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the new version of Pan Am went the way of the old one,  
failing in 1998.

executive officer of the chewing gum company founded by his 
grandfather, died Monday of complications associated with 
pneumonia. He was 66. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1956, Wrigley went to work for WM. Wrigley Jr. Co., the  
company made famous by its chewing gum brands, including Juicy 
Fruit and Doublemint. He became director and vice president of the 
company in 1960 and succeeded his father as president in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
	Wrigley was named the 58th richest American last year by Forbes  
magazine, with an estimated wealth of $2.7 billion.

<HEADLINE> Diet Guidelines May Add Food Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Food safety advice should be included in the  
federal dietary guidelines, because keeping people healthy means 
teaching them to protect themselves from food-borne illnesses, a 
Clinton administration official said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe the time has come to include food safety in the  
guidelines,'' Catherine Woteki, the Agriculture Department's 
undersecretary for food safety, said Monday. ``Government has an 
obligation to help people protect themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woteki's comments came during a meeting of an advisory committee  
reviewing the ``Dietary Guidelines for Americans.'' The guidelines 
are issued every five years by USDA and the Department of Health 
and Human Services and form the cornerstone of federal nutrition 
policy. They were last published in 1995, and the advisory panel's 
report later this year will contain revisions for 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The guidelines advise choosing a diet with plenty of grain  
products, vegetables and fruits, and also low in fat, saturated fat 
and cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
	The guidelines have never included food safety information, but  
times and dangers have changed since the early 1980s when the 
guidelines began, Woteki said. She declined to recommend particular 
guidelines, but said they might include advice on appropriate 
temperatures to store food or proper food handling. 
</P>
<P>
	``Food safety is a critical factor in any discussion about diet  
and long-term health,'' she said. ``New pathogens have emerged just 
in the last decade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the last few months, numerous food products have been  
recalled because of contamination with the bacteria Listera 
monocytogenes. A large recall in December by the Bil Mar Foods 
plant in Zeeland, Mich., has been linked to an outbreak that has 
resulted in at least 14 deaths, six miscarriages and 97 illnesses 
across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration's stand has support among some nutritionists,  
including the American Dietetic Association. ``Given the scope of 
consumer concerns about food safety, ADA urges the committee to 
consider adding food safety messages in an informative but not 
alarming way,'' Kathryn M. Carroll, senior nutrition scientist for 
the ADA, told the panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Cutberto Garza, chairman of the advisory panel, said the  
committee would take the request ``very seriously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Food-borne illnesses cost society between $6.6 billion and $37  
billion annually in medical costs and lost productivity, Woteki 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are food-borne illnesses associated with virtually every  
category of food,'' she said, noting that while meat and poultry 
are the largest contributors, other foods also carry pathogens. 
</P>
<P>
	``Education is a very important component in this strategy.  
Consumers need to know what they can do to protect themselves.''

<HEADLINE> Cooke Widow Loses Court Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The wife of the late Washington Redskins owner  
Jack Kent Cooke lost a Supreme Court appeal today in her effort to 
avoid being deported over a 1986 guilty plea to a drug conspiracy 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
	The court, without comment, turned away Marlena Ramallo Cooke's  
argument that a federal judge can enforce a government promise not 
to deport her in exchange for help in prosecuting drug traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruling in an unrelated case last month, the Supreme Court  
limited aliens' access to federal courts in immigration cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite today's setback, it does not appear that Mrs. Cooke's  
deportation is imminent. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Cooke, a Bolivian native, served 5 1/2 months in prison on her  
guilty plea to conspiracy to import cocaine. In 1988, the 
Immigration and Naturalization Service issued a deportation order 
but, under an agreement with Mrs. Cooke, did not immediately seek 
to enforce it. 
</P>
<P>
	The government says it agreed to let her stay in the country  
while she was cooperating with prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	She contended the government promised to let her stay  
permanently. Her lawyers said she aided in about 30 convictions, 
and that returning her to Bolivia would put her life in danger. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, Mrs. Cooke filed a lawsuit seeking to overturn the  
deportation order and force the government to honor its agreement 
not to deport her. A federal judge in Washington ruled that the 
government was bound by the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia  
reversed that ruling in 1997, saying a 1996 law stripped federal 
trial courts of their authority to hear such claims stemming from 
deportation orders. 
</P>
<P>
	In the appeal acted on today, Mrs. Cooke's lawyers said the  
appeals court's ruling means that aliens who cooperate in 
international drug investigations can be ``deported into the arms 
of those against whom they have testified.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Government lawyers said the appeals court was correct in  
throwing out the judge's order. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Ramallo vs. Reno, 97-526.

<HEADLINE> NASA Unable To Save Star Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- With a multimillion-dollar star research  
mission over before it started, NASA is left only with an 
out-of-control satellite and resolve to figure out what went wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wide-Field Infrared Explorer cannot conduct its science  
mission because all the frozen hydrogen needed to cool the 
satellite's telescope melted and vented into space, NASA said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency spent a fruitless weekend trying to regain control of  
the spinning spacecraft. 
</P>
<P>
	Ground controllers were slowly beginning to decrease the spin by  
using the satellite's magnetic attitude control system and hoped to 
have it stabilized by the end of the week. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA spent about $73 million on the satellite's development,  
launch and operations, spokesman Don Savage said. Had the mission 
gone forward, operations and data analysis costs would have put the 
total over $80 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Ed Weiler, associate administrator for space science at NASA  
headquarters, said he was disappointed but confident upcoming 
missions could accomplish some of the goals ``so it will be science 
delayed rather than science lost.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The satellite, nicknamed Wire, was intended to study  
``starburst'' galaxies, those in which rapid star formation is 
taking place. It was also going to study infant galaxies known as 
protogalaxies. Scientist had expected to detect at least 50,000 
galaxies. 
</P>
<P>
	The satellite incorporated a variety of new technologies and it  
can still be used as an engineering ``testbed,'' said Lynn Jenner, 
a spokeswoman for Goddard Space Flight Center, where it was 
developed under the Small Explorer program. 
</P>
<P>
	Wire was launched March 4 on a Pegasus rocket dropped from an  
aircraft flying off the California coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Wire was on its second orbit when ground stations detected that  
it was spinning rather than maintaining a stable orientation, and 
that the cryostat -- the container for the hydrogen -- was warmer 
than expected. 
</P>
<P>
	The hydrogen was supposed to have lasted four months. Instead,  
it rapidly melted and vented. The force of that venting is believe 
to have caused the spin. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials believe a cover over the telescope came off  
prematurely and allowed sunlight to fall on the instrument, setting 
off that mission-wrecking chain of events. 
</P>
<P>
	An investigative board was being established to find out what  
went wrong.

<HEADLINE> Penguins' Kasparaitis Out One Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Pittsburgh Penguins defenseman Darius  
Kasparaitis will miss at least a week after tests revealed 
additional damage in his right knee, which he first hurt during the 
preseason. 
</P>
<P>
	Kasparaitis was hurt again during Friday's 2-2 tie with  
Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
	He will undergo rehabilitation for one week and then be  
re-evaluated. 
</P>
<P>
	He tore a ligament in the knee in September, but opted against  
surgery and missed only a month. He has played in 48 of the

<HEADLINE> Beekeepers Trying Out New Miticide / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YAKIMA, Wash. (AP) -- What bugs bees? An external parasite called  
the varroa mite that can weaken or kill entire honeybee hives. 
</P>
<P>
	``The mites drive them crazy,'' said Eric Olson, a beekeeper for  
nearly two decades in nearby Gleed. 
</P>
<P>
	Beekeepers in the Northwest have gotten special permission from  
the Environmental Protection Agency to try a new product in the 
fight against varroa mites, which have infested hives from one 
coast to the other. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Stump, president of the Washington Beekeepers Association,  
said the mite is to blame for the dramatic drop in the number of 
beehives in the state over the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of honeybee hives fell from 85,000 in 1992 to 54,000  
in 1997, the most recent count available from the state Department 
of Agriculture. It's the smallest number of hives since 1914. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to the problem is that varroa mites are growing resistant  
to fluvalinate, sold under the brand name Apistan, the lone 
chemical currently registered for control of the parasite in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the mites aren't controlled, the effect to the beekeepers  
and then to the crops that require pollination would be 
devastating,'' -- about $1.3 billion in crops in Washington, said 
Erik Johansen, pesticide registration specialist for the state 
Department of Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
	It's enough to give a beekeeper a headache.  
</P>
<P>
	So, this year a regional request was prepared seeking an  
emergency exemption from the EPA to let beekeepers in Washington, 
Oregon and Idaho use a new miticide on a beehive pest strip made by 
the Bayer Corp., the giant German company famous for aspirin. 
</P>
<P>
	Bayer is working on a petition for full federal registration by  
the EPA for the bee strip, a process that could take several years, 
Johansen said. The exemption expires next February. 
</P>
<P>
	The active ingredient in the Bayer Bee Strip is a chemical  
called coumaphos. 
</P>
<P>
	Bees walk on the strips, which hang inside the hives, and  
distribute the chemical. When varroa mites come into contact with 
the chemical, it kills them. 
</P>
<P>
	Olson said he's delighted to have an alternative to fluvalinate.  
Mite resistance can sneak up on beekeepers and wreck their hives, 
he said. ``We run 5,500 hives. We're not going to let that 
happen,'' said Olson, who has already ordered and received 10,000 
coumaphos strips. 
</P>
<P>
	Tolerance to fluvalinate has been documented in Florida, South  
Dakota, Minnesota and California and reported in at least five 
other states, including Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Stump said a lot of Washington beekeepers take their bees to  
California in the winter to pollinate the almond crop, then return 
to the Northwest to pollinate tree fruit and other crops, before 
moving on to the Dakotas for the honey crop. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're mixing in with beekeepers that come from all over the  
United States, and their bees get mixed up with the ones resistant 
to the current, approved `medication,''' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The migratory nature of the beekeeping industry today means that  
everyone is in this together, Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the varroa mite resistance to fluvalinate becomes  
widespread in California, it will also become widespread in the 
Pacific Northwest,'' said state apiarist Jim Bach.

<HEADLINE> Lewinsky Says She Betrayed Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Monica Lewinsky, in her latest interview, says  
she betrayed the president by talking too much about their affair. 
Separately, her former friend Linda Tripp said Ms. Lewinsky's 
version of events was ``revisionist history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't have the maturity to realize exactly how serious this  
was,'' Ms. Lewinsky said in the issue of Time magazine on 
newsstands today. ``Actually only telling 10 people was being 
pretty discreet for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I still feel horrible about how indiscreet I was. That was a  
real betrayal,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	One of her confidantes was Mrs. Tripp, whose tapes of some of  
those conversations led to Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's 
investigation and the subsequent impeachment of the president on 
perjury and obstruction of justice charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Tripp, appearing Sunday on ABC's ``This Week,'' attacked a new  
biography of Ms. Lewinsky by British author Andrew Morton as ``a 
romanticizing of a tawdry, abusive relationship.'' She added: ``I 
see it as fiction, I see it as fable, fantasy, farce and fairy 
tale.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In particular she said conversations with Ms. Lewinsky that she  
didn't tape make clear that Clinton and his friend Vernon Jordan 
helped the former White House intern look for a job in exchange for 
her silence. ``Had they been documented, Vernon Jordan would be 
facing legal consequences ... for obstruction of justice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky, in her Time interview, reasserts that she and  
Clinton did not discuss the writing of an affidavit for the Paula 
Jones sexual harassment case in which she denies having a sexual 
relationship with the president. She said she did not think Clinton 
or Jordan were helping in her job hunt to buy her silence. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Tripp, who was present when Starr's representatives and FBI  
agents first confronted Ms. Lewinsky about the affair, denied what 
she said were ``scurrilous allegations'' in the Morton book that 
Ms. Lewinsky was mistreated and denied access to an attorney. 
``They were gracious, they were polite at all times,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp worked in the Clinton White House before moving to a  
Pentagon job and at one time discussed writing an expose of the 
Clintons with Lucianne Goldberg, the literary agent who later 
suggested she tape her talks with Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	She said that if she were to write a book now, ``Monica Lewinsky  
would be the last chapter.'' She said a main focus would be first 
lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, who ``was complicit, in the time that 
I was there, in virtually every scandal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky, in her Time interview, said that while her affair  
with Clinton was wrong, ``it was a private wrong.'' She noted that 
``it didn't affect his job, it didn't affect my job, we were 
together mostly on the weekends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She spoke of the way Clinton ``looks at women he's attracted to.  
He undresses you with his eyes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She also said that at her first book-signing event, ``I felt  
cuckoo. ... This whole situation is sort of maniacal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said that in the future she might consider law school, ``if  
I could get into law school without having to take the LSAT,'' the 
aptitude test for prospective law students. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she was not trying to get rich with her book deal and  
other paid appearances. ``But I need to have the means to take care 
of myself for the next few years,'' she said. ``Therapy is not 
cheap.''

</P>
<P>
	COSTA MESA, Calif. (AP) -- J. Leland ``Lee'' Atwood, a key figure  
in the aerospace industry for more than 50 years while president 
and chief executive officer of Rockwell International Corp., died 
Friday. He was 94. 
</P>
<P>
	Atwood's work led to the development of the P-51 Mustang  
fighter, one of the main aircraft used in World War II. The fighter 
was developed for Rockwell's predecessor company, North American 
Aviation, now part of the Boeing Co. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1934, he began work at North American Aviation, becoming  
chief engineer and vice president. He was elected president in 
1948, gaining the title of CEO in 1960 and then chairman of the 
company two years later. 
</P>
<P>
	He received various aviation awards, including a Presidential  
Certificate of Merit in 1948 for his contributions to the war 
effort. In 1995, Italy gave him its Commander of Merit declaration 
for his contributions to the aerospace industry.

</P>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Mary Dalton, who with her husband donated  
200 pieces of art to the Mint Museum of Charlotte, died Thursday. 
She was 94. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dalton and her late husband built a multimillion-dollar art  
and rare book collection and gave most of it away to institutions 
around the Southeast. 
</P>
<P>
	Harry Dalton, a successful banker and textile executive, died in  
1990 at age 95. 
</P>
<P>
	Museums and universities around the Southeast bear their  
generosity. There's the Dalton Rare Book room at Duke University, 
where Harry Dalton graduated, and the Dalton Art Gallery at Agnes 
Scott College in Georgia, where Mrs. Dalton attended. 
</P>
<P>
	Voters in 1982 rejected a bond issue to pay for an expansion of  
the Mint Museum, prompting the Daltons to offer much of their 
collection to the museum if a wing could be built to house it. 
Voters passed a bond issue and the museum raised money to fund the 
wing.

                          *Antonio Houaiss    	
</P>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Antonio Houaiss, Brazil's former  
minister of culture, died Sunday from multiple organ failure. He 
was 83. 
</P>
<P>
	Houaiss became minister of culture in 1992 under former  
President Itamar Franco. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to books about politics and poetry, he also wrote  
one on the pleasure of drinking beer. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, Houaiss was made president of the prestigious Brazilian  
Academy of Literature. He left the post after six months because of 
ill health but remained an academy member.

                           *Leopold Just    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Leopold Just, a Latvian-born engineer who built  
a reputation worldwide for constructing highways and New York City 
bridges, died Feb. 25. He was 95. 
</P>
<P>
	Just helped design the George Washington Bridge, linking New  
York and New Jersey, and the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, connecting 
Staten Island and Brooklyn. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1931, he joined what was then called the Port of New York  
Authority and helped design the Lincoln Tunnel. He left in 1938 to 
build tunnels for the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Returning to New York in 1940 he became a structural engineer  
with the famed Swiss-born engineer, Othmar Ammann. 
</P>
<P>
	Just, who became a chief engineer in 1952, had a key part in  
designing the Walt Whitman Bridge in Philadelphia and the Throgs 
Neck Bridge, connecting the Bronx and Queens.

<P>
                          *Stanley Kubrick    	
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Stanley Kubrick, a visionary craftsman whose films  
-- including ``Dr. Strangelove,'' ``A Clockwork Orange'' and ``2001: 
A Space Odyssey'' -- often reflected a violent and despairing view 
of life, died Sunday. He was 70. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time of his death, the publicity-shy Kubrick was  
preparing for the midyear release of ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' his first 
film in 12 years. Starring Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, the film 
had been shrouded in the secrecy that attended all of Kubrick's 
later movies. 
</P>
<P>
	Kubrick chronicled the effects of war in ``Fear and Desire''  
(1953); ``Paths of Glory'' (1957) and Full Metal Jacket (1987); the 
suicidal logic of the Cold War in the blackly comic ``Dr. 
Strangelove: or, How I Learned To Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb'' 
(1964); and sexual obsession in ``Lolita'' (1962). 
</P>
<P>
	For ``2001: A Space Odyssey,'' Kubrick got the second of his  
four Academy Award nominations for best director. The other 
nominations were for ``Dr. Strangelove,'' ``Barry Lyndon,'' and ``A 
Clockwork Orange,'' which unlike ``2001'' were also nominated for 
best picture. 
</P>
<P>
	Other Kubrick films include ``Spartacus'' and ``The Shining.''

<P>
                        *William L. McGonagle    	
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Retired Navy Capt. William L. McGonagle, who  
received the Medal of Honor for heroism as skipper of the USS 
Liberty when Israel unleashed a deadly attack on the 
intelligence-gathering ship in 1967, died Wednesday. He was 73. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty-four crewmen were killed and 171 were wounded when the  
Liberty was attacked by Israeli air force planes and torpedo boats 
in international waters north of Sinai during the Six Day War 
between Israel and its Arab neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
	The ship was bombed with napalm, torpedoed and shelled.  
</P>
<P>
	The attack, blamed on a mistaken identification of the Liberty  
as an Egyptian ship, remains one of the most controversial events 
in U.S.-Israeli relations and led to allegations of a cover-up by 
the governments. 
</P>
<P>
	McGonagle, who was severely wounded but stayed in command on the  
bridge through the battle and for many hours afterward, broke his 
silence years later and joined former shipmates in demanding the 
two governments release all details of the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Israel apologized to the United States but claimed there had  
been a misidentification and that the ship's markings were 
inadequate. Israel paid more than $12 million in compensation.

 *Sheik Isa bin Salman Al Khalifa,    	
</P>
<P>
	MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) -- Sheik Isa bin Salman Al Khalifa, the emir  
of Bahrain, died Saturday of a heart attack shortly after a meeting 
with Defense Secretary William Cohen. He was 65. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheik Isa ruled Bahrain for 38 years. He is the second  
pro-Western Arab leader to die in two months, following the death 
of Jordan's King Hussein in February. 
</P>
<P>
	Bahrain, a nation of 35 islands covering 260 square miles, is  
home to the biggest U.S. naval presence in the region. Sheik Isa 
allowed British and American warplanes to use Bahraini airfields 
during the 1991 Persian Gulf War. Afterward, he traveled to 
Washington and signed a security pact with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	About 2,500 Americans live and work in Bahrain, including about  
1,000 in the military. U.S. warships often dock in Bahrain, home to 
the 5th Fleet, so sailors can take shore leave. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheik Isa had offered the facilities to the Navy, discreetly at  
first fearing popular resentment against a foreign military 
presence. During and after the 1990-91 Gulf crisis, he became more 
open about the U.S. presence. 
</P>
<P>
	His son, Sheik Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa, assumed the throne.

	HOLLYWOOD, Fla. (AP) -- Joe DiMaggio, the elegant Yankee Clipper  
whose 56-game hitting streak endures as one of the most remarkable 
records in baseball or any sport, died today, his lawyer said. He 
was 84. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio, who underwent lung cancer surgery in October and  
battled a series of complications for weeks afterward, died at his

<HEADLINE> Ala. Civil Rights March Remembered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SELMA, Ala. (AP) -- About 1,500 people made their way across  
Edmund Pettus Bridge in remembrance of the infamous clash between 
Alabama state troopers and civil rights marchers more than 30 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I enjoy repeating history,'' said James Armstrong, who was  
there for the original crossing on March 7, 1965 -- a day that came 
to be known as Bloody Sunday. ``I hope the young folks get 
something out of it, because we've got to motivate them to vote.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also among the marchers Sunday were a congressional delegation  
led by Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., and Coretta Scott King, the widow of 
slain civil rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Lewis who led the 1965 across the bridge, where they were  
attacked by troopers. The event sparked the historic 
Selma-to-Montgomery voting rights march led by Dr. King. 
</P>
<P>
	Amelia Boynton Robinson, who was gassed during the original  
crossing, said Sunday's march marked not only an anniversary -- but 
a celebration of the right to vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very sacred,'' Ms. Robinson said. ``When you think of why  
we marched before and why we're marching now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Robert Underwood, D-Guam, said the crossing marked a  
defining moment in America's democracy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every generation has to make their contribution, and some  
generations contributed more,'' Underwood said. ``This generation 
here in Selma certainly did.''

<HEADLINE> Dairy Producers To Get Federal Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With milk prices collapsing, the Agriculture  
Department said Monday it was releasing $200 million in assistance 
that Congress earmarked for dairy producers in its farm bailout 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Producers could get up to $5,000 each under the one-time  
program. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time Congress passed the $6 billion relief bill last  
fall, dairy prices were at record levels. But dairy-state lawmakers 
made sure that money was set aside for milk producers, and USDA 
waited to release the money until prices dropped. 
</P>
<P>
	``Smaller dairy farmers are already being hurt by conditions  
beyond their control,'' Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said in 
a speech to the National Farmers Union in Springfield, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	``More declines in the price of milk will put many of them in  
serious financial difficulties. This payment program will help many 
of them survive this decrease in prices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	USDA reported last Friday that its benchmark price indicator for  
milk dropped by more than a third, the steepest monthly decline 
ever. Economists attribute the drop to market forces. Milk 
production is up more than 3 percent from a year ago, stimulated by 
the strong market last fall, and consumption typically declines in 
the winter. 
</P>
<P>
	The payments, which will be targeted to family-size operations,  
are limited to the approximate production of a 150-cow herd. 
</P>
<P>
	``This formula ensures that diary producers across the country  
will share equitably,'' said Jerry Kozak, chief executive officer 
of the National Milk Producers Federation. The group had proposed a 
cap of 200 cows. 
</P>
<P>
	A 150-cow farm would have about $70,000 in net income at prices  
USDA projects this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``To any one dairy farmer $5,000 is probably a small factor.  
Certainly it's not irrelevant ... but it's not going to be the 
biggest item in their cash flow,'' said Rep. David Minge, D-Minn. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers may apply for the assistance starting April 12.  
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, USDA announced Monday that it was extending to April  
9 a deadline for farmers to apply for assistance for crops that 
were lost to drought and other weather disasters. The deadline had 
been this Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to make sure that everyone who's eligible has a chance  
to participate,'' Glickman said. 
</P>
<P>
	USDA has $2 billion to spend and will prorate the money after it  
gets all the applications. 
</P>
<P>
	USDA offices have been swamped with work because of the demand  
for a variety of programs this winter.

<HEADLINE> Bush Careful on Abortion Comments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- George W. Bush, stepping gingerly into the  
Republican Party's most fractious debate, said Monday he would back 
a constitutional amendment to outlaw most abortions if more voters 
supported it. But he said, ``America is not ready to ban 
abortions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Calling himself a ``pro-life person,'' the Texas governor and  
likely presidential candidate told The Associated Press, ``America 
is not ready to overturn Roe v. Wade because America's hearts are 
not right. And so, in the meantime, instead of arguing over Roe v. 
Wade, what we ought to do is promote policies that reduce 
abortions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v. Wade decision legalized  
abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush discussed abortion and a wide range of issues in his state  
Capitol office Monday, as supporters filed papers in Washington 
forming a campaign committee. Bush has made clear he intends to run 
for the Republican nomination in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The filing marks a new and tougher stage for the Texas governor,  
who has so far avoided taking sides on controversial issues. His 
GOP rivals, trailing in public opinion polls, hope Bush is hurt by 
the hashing out of his positions. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, some social conservatives criticized how he answered an  
abortion question at a Sunday news conference. Bush told reporters 
abortions should be ``rare'' and there should be a ``pro-life 
tenor'' in the GOP, but he avoided specifics by saying questions 
about first-trimester abortions are ``hypothetical.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Liberal Republicans who advocate taking either weak positions  
or no positions on the tough issues are the ones who have created 
the visionless, listless image the Republican Party suffers from,'' 
said L. Brent Bozell III, head of the Conservative Victory 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush clarified his position in a lengthy exchange Monday that  
produced his most extensive comments on abortion so far. The 
conversation reflected his desire to appease conservatives without 
using language that turns off swing voters, particularly women, 
whom he hopes to win over. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of Americans who don't view the abortion issue  
as a matter of life. I do,'' Bush said. ``That's one reason why I'm 
a pro-life person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was asked if first-term abortions are improper.  
</P>
<P>
	``I personally believe there is life, and therefore take the  
position I take,'' Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	Does that mean, if it were up to him, that all abortions would  
be constitutionally banned? 
</P>
<P>
	Yes, replied the governor, except for circumstances threatening  
the life of the mother, rape or incest. 
</P>
<P>
	That applies to all three trimesters? ``Right,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``On the other hand, I'm realistic enough person to know that  
America is not ready to ban abortions,'' he said. ``America as a 
country is not prepared to send a message to senators and House 
members that we want you do this -- we want you to amend the 
Constitution'' to ban abortions. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers should focus on more attainable goals, such as  
requiring parental notification or consent for a teen-ager's 
abortion and banning so-called ``partial-birth'' abortions, Bush 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We ought to say, `We understand that the issue has been very  
polarizing. It's been debated for 30 years. There's strong 
positions on both sides.' But, in the meantime, until America's 
hearts change, put policies in place ... that reduce abortions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though Bush has made huge inroads among conservative leaders,  
many are still trying to get a handle on his positions in light of 
their mixed feelings toward his father. Former President George 
Bush opposed abortions -- except in cases of rape, incest or threat 
to the woman's life -- but tried to mollify abortion rights 
supporters in 1992 by saying he would support a granddaughter who 
hypothetically found herself pregnant: ``Who else's decision could 
it be?'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Phyllis Schlafly, head of the conservative Eagle Forum, said the  
governor's answers won't satisfy anti-abortion voters. ``Real 
pro-lifers think the unborn baby is a life, and he admitted that. 
But he's admitting that there's some circumstances under which he's 
willing to take a life,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Conservative activist Paul Weyrich said Bush is unfortunately  
correct that America is not ready for tough anti-abortion measures. 
But he said the Texas governor should promise to sway public 
opinion. 
</P>
<P>
	``The question is whether he would use the presidency to try to  
change their hearts. We don't know that,'' Weyrich said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Miller, executive director of the centrist Republican  
Leadership Council, said Bush should be praised for trying to keep 
the party from falling apart over divisive issues, saying, ``As 
long as he's respecting other peoples' positions, other people 
should respect his.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other issues, Bush said he:  
</P>
<P>
	--Opposes same-sex marriages. ``Marriage is sanctified by the  
Almighty and it's between a man and a woman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Decided to form the exploratory committee after a minister, in  
a sermon before his Jan. 19 inauguration, made a ``call to 
service.'' Bush said: ``I heard the call.''

<HEADLINE> Hells Angels Return to Mass. Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LYNN, Mass. (AP) -- In this tough town, nicknamed the City of  
Sin, it's the Angels that strike fear in the hearts of folks. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than two years after an especially vile group of Hells  
Angels was driven from their clubhouse, the outlaw motorcycle gang 
has opened a hangout next to a peaceful, middle-class neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not happy about them being there,'' said Gerard Dwan,  
president of the Goldfish Pond Neighborhood Association. ``The 
neighbors were pretty upset.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As one homeowner, speaking on condition of anonymity, put it:  
``As soon as the Hells Angels signs went up, this property right 
here dropped 20 grand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others don't see what all the fuss is about.  
</P>
<P>
	``None of us have any problems,'' said Carol Barker, who lives  
in the Goldfish Pond neighborhood near the Angels' new building. 
``They haven't said anything, they haven't done anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	City Councilor David Ellis saids the Hells Angels never left  
Lynn, a city of about 80,000 just north of Boston that is plagued 
by drugs, gang violence and arson. Some of them have grown older 
and more interested in running legitimate businesses than raising 
hell on their Harleys, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They support Little League,'' Ellis said. ``They walk both  
sides of the fence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goldfish Pond neighbors remember the days when the Angels bought  
up several buildings in the residential Shaw Court neighborhood 
nearby. Their three-story clubhouse, guarded by pit bulls and video 
cameras mounted on poles, had a sign that read: ``Is there life 
after death? Trespass here and find out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two Hells Angels were accused of raping a woman at the compound  
during the 1997 funeral of a former chapter leader, a brawling 
ex-con named Alan ``Big Al'' Hogan. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, two members admitted they were involved in killing a  
member of a rival motorcycle gang by ramming his motorcycle with a 
Cadillac. 
</P>
<P>
	The Angels were finally driven from Shaw Court after federal  
agents used an armored personnel carrier in a raid on their 
compound that led to 16 drug-dealing arrests. As part of a series 
of plea bargains, the clubhouse was demolished last year. 
</P>
<P>
	But in December, the club paid $135,000 cash for an old  
industrial building near railroad tracks not too far from Goldfish 
Pond, where homeowners work hard to keep property values up in this 
decaying manufacturing city. 
</P>
<P>
	The Angels' lawyer, Bruce Sachar, said members had no comment.  
He said they intend to obey the law in their new home, down to 
getting zoning board and building department approvals. 
</P>
<P>
	They plan to keep operating a machine shop and to manufacture  
Hells Angels T-shirts for sale at their store, Red and White 
Fashions, on the city's waterfront boulevard, Sachar said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were good neighbors when they were on Shaw Court,''  
Sachar said. ``They did a lot of things for the neighbors that 
never made the newspapers -- plowing, cleaning, doing favors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, Dwan has done everything he could to keep them  
out. He has gone to the building department and City Hall to demand 
they qualify for every permit they need. But, he said, ``if we 
can't get them out, we'll have to play with them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to get them planting flowers,'' he said.

	Joe DiMaggio Dies  
</P>
<P>
	HOLLYWOOD, Fla. (AP) -- Baseball Hall of Famer Joe DiMaggio died  
today at age 84. The former New York Yankees star, whose 56-game 
hitting streak is one of the most enduring records in baseball, had 
lung cancer surgery last year and had several postoperative

	Clinton Visiting Central America  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton embarks today on his  
four-day, four-nation mission to Central America just as 15,000 
Guatemalans and Salvadorans illegally in the United States become 
eligible for deportation. Clinton turned down pleas for an 
extension of the halt in deportations that was instituted after the 
devastation of Hurricane Mitch last fall. Clinton will start with a 
survey of damage done by Hurricane Mitch to a Nicaraguan town. The 
president will see the spot where last October a mudslide swept 
away a pair of villages, killing about 2,000 people.

Clinton. The former White House intern will be autographing copies 
of her book at 19 stores from England to Scotland. Her first 
appearance is this morning at London's famous Harrods department 
store. British book stores have reported so far only moderate sales 
for ``Monica's Story,'' which chronicles her relationship with the 
president. But the manager of a small town bookstore where Ms. 
Lewinsky is scheduled to appear says the ``local press are going

	GENEVA (AP) -- The United States and the European Union today  
presented their arguments before the World Trade Organization about 
the growing battle over a trade dispute involving bananas. The EU 
is complaining about proposed U.S. tariffs on some imported 
European goods. But U.S. officials say the sanctions are designed 
to try and change import policies that American banana sellers say 
squeeze them out of the European market. The WTO today summoned all

	BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- Hezbollah will not accept any temporary  
truce in south Lebanon during the run-up to Israel's May 17 
elections, the Shiite Muslim group's leader was quoted today as 
saying. Sheik Hassan Nasrallah also told the leftist As-Safir 
newspaper that Hezbollah would not go along with any amendments to 
a 1996 U.S.-brokered understanding barring Israel and Lebanese 
guerrillas from attacking civilian areas or launching attacks from 
them. The hard-line Hezbollah stance came amid reports that Martin 
Indyk, a U.S. assistant secretary of state, would visit Lebanon

	Report: Birth Pain Payments Halted  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The federal government has ordered doctors and  
hospitals to stop demanding cash payments from poor women for the 
epidural injection to relieve pain in childbirth, The New York 
Times reported today. Medicaid patients may not be charged for some 
medical services related to pregnancy and Medicaid reimburses 
doctors and hospitals. But doctors say the reimbursements for pain 
relief treatment are woefully small. Patients unable to pay cash 
for the epidural injection, which blocks pain in the lower part of 
the body, often were offered weaker forms of pain relief.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Down; Dow Falls 32 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nasdaq composite was holding on to strong  
gains that began this morning on the news that Intel had settled a 
case brought against it by the Federal Trade Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Blue chip stocks, which opened stronger, dipped slightly lower.  
At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 
32.61 at 9,703.47. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq composite, however, was up 30.60 at 2,367.71, while  
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was off 1.30 at 1,274.17. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasdaq component Intel was up 3 3/4 at 118 3/8. Intel and the FTC  
announced this morning that they had agreed to a proposed 
settlement of government charges that the nation's largest computer 
chipmaker illegally bullied three other companies into handing over 
secret information about their products. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Dow came under some light selling after opening  
stronger with bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the Dow added 268.68 to close at a record 9,736.08,  
helped by strong gains in the bond market that continued this 
morning. This morning, the 30-year Treasury bond, which had been 
higher earlier, was off 3/32 point and yielding 5.59 percent, just 
under its close on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just giving back some of the gains of last Thursday and  
Friday,'' said John Shaunessy, chief investment strategist at 
Advest Inc. ``But the backdrop of this market continues to be very, 
very solid. Inflation is still contained, money supply growth very, 
very adequate, and this is a liquidity-driven market that depends 
on investors continuing to put more money in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the gains in the indexes, declining issues outnumbered  
advancers by nearly 11 to 9 on the New York Stock Exchange, where 
volume came to 315.46 million shares, down from Friday's pace of 
405.72 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The market was also helped by some takeover news. Belgian-Dutch  
financial services group Fortis agreed to pay $2.8 billion for 
American Bankers Insurance Group Inc. Fortis will pay $55 a share, 
or $2.6 billion in cash, for the Miami-based insurer, and assume 
about $200 million in debt. ABI's shares were up 5 5/8 at 52. 
</P>
<P>
	In other merger news, Allied Waste Industries Inc. is expected  
to announce today a $7.3 billion cash bid, or $45 a share, for 
larger rival Browning-Ferris Industries Inc. Allied Waste's bid 
would be 30 percent premium over Friday's closing stock price. 
Browning Ferris was up 4 7/8 at 39 5/8, while Allied Waste's shares were 
up 1 7/16 at 16 7/16.

<HEADLINE> Weakening Euro Causes Worry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- The influential chief of Germany's  
central bank warned in a newspaper interview published Monday that 
continuing political demands could harm the euro. 
</P>
<P>
	The remarks appeared aimed at Germany's left-leaning finance  
minister, Oskar Lafontaine, who has persistently called on the 
European Central Bank to lower interest rates to stimulate growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer warned that such continued  
policy demands will actually make it more difficult for the central 
bank to adjust interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	``The more intensely these discussions are led in public, the  
less scope it leaves for monetary decisions,'' Tietmeyer was quoted 
by Handelsblatt as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	The ECB decided to maintain its key interest rate, set at 3  
percent, at its regular, biweekly meeting last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Tietmeyer, who as head of the Bundesbank sits on the European  
Central Bank's advisory board, said monetary policymakers don't 
want the euro to remain weak against the dollar. The euro has 
hovered around $1.08 for the last week, down some 7 percent from 
its Jan. 1 launch. 
</P>
<P>
	A weak euro, he said, risks sinking confidence within the 11  
countries that adopted the euro and outside of the euro bloc.

 *Judge orders baby raised by prominent couple returned to birth  
mother	
</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A 3-year-old boy born with cocaine in his system  
should be taken from the politically prominent couple who have 
served as his foster parents and returned to his mother -- a 
recovering cocaine addict, a judge ruled today. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Department of Children and Family Services had  
recommended that ``Baby T'' stay with Appellate Court Judge Anne 
Burke and her husband, Alderman Edward Burke, one of the most 
powerful men in Chicago politics. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy has spent all but eight days of his life with the  
Burkes, and they had expressed interest in adopting him. 
</P>
<P>
	However, since the boy is black and the Burkes are white, Judge  
Judith M. Brawka held today that the state's recommendation did not 
give enough consideration to the value of African-American culture. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge added that Baby T needs to be with his brother, who is  
also in foster care. The judge had previously ordered the brother 
also returned to their mother, Tina Olison. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge set a goal of returning Baby T to his mother within 12  
months, but she warned Olison that both children could be taken 
away again. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just as your addiction lasted for years, I must tell you that  
this case may not close for a significant period of time,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Olison, who is in her late 30s, sat silently throughout today's  
hearing. The Burkes were not in the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Olison successfully underwent treatment for her drug addiction  
and has sued to regain custody of Baby T and her older son, who is 
being cared for by a grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
	The state failed in November to have Olison ruled an unfit  
mother.

<HEADLINE>  Will Anyone Pick Against Duke? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Analysis    	
</P>
<P>
	The question was first heard in early February. Is Duke going to  
lose a game in the Atlantic Coast Conference this season? 
</P>
<P>
	When the Blue Devils capped a first-ever 16-0 league season with  
a 20-point win at North Carolina last weekend, the question 
changed. Can anybody beat these guys? 
</P>
<P>
	After this weekend's ACC tournament, which the Blue Devils  
ripped through with three wins by an average of 25 points, the 
question was altered again. Can anybody stay close to these guys? 
</P>
<P>
	Welcome to the 1999 NCAA tournament, the 64-team competition  
with the subtitle: ``Is second place really so bad?'' 
</P>
<P>
	What makes the Blue Devils such a heavy favorite is a 32-1  
record, a 27-game wining streak, only three wins by less than 
double figures and 13 by 30 or more. Then there are all-conference 
players like Trajan Langdon, Elton Brand and William Avery. 
</P>
<P>
	Don't forget Mike Krzyzewski, the coach who has led Duke to  
seven Final Fours and two national championships. There's even a 
tinge of revenge as the Blue Devils had one of their most 
devastating losses ever last year to Kentucky in the regional final 
at St. Petersburg, Fla., the site of this year's Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	How can anybody pick against Duke?  
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Devils will cruise to the East Regionals at the  
Meadowlands, their favorite Final Four launching pad, with wins 
over Florida A&AMP;M and College of Charleston, and will be joined 
there by Wisconsin, Cincinnati and Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati, the only team to beat the Blue Devils this season,  
just won't have the last-second heroics it did in that Nov. 28 game 
in the Great Alaska Shootout. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Devils will play the Midwest Regional champion in the  
national semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Look for Kentucky to be that team as the defending national  
champion makes a Dukelike fourth straight Final Four appearance. 
The Wildcats will stave off some scares, however, as sixth-seeded 
Kansas, with its lowest seeding since 1988, makes some noise in the 
second round and Utah, the team Kentucky beat for the title last 
season, provides a regional semifinal thriller. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wildcats will make their trip to St. Petersburg after a  
regional final win over North Carolina Charlotte, the team that 
will grab the nation's attention with solid play and kiss-blowing 
3-point shooter Diego Guevara. 
</P>
<P>
	The South Regional will have the best of the second-round story  
lines when George Washington meets its former coach, Mike Jarvis, 
and St. John's. The second round will also have the first of the 
No. 1 seeds leaving when Syracuse stuns Auburn. 
</P>
<P>
	Syracuse will run out of luck against Ohio State in the regional  
semifinals and the Buckeyes' game against Maryland in the final 
will also be a former Boston College coaches reunion. 
</P>
<P>
	Maryland's Gary Williams will get his first Final Four  
appearance, carried there with a sensational tournament from guard 
Steve Francis. 
</P>
<P>
	The Terrapins' opponent in the national semifinals will be  
Connecticut, another team led by a coach, Jim Calhoun, making his 
Final Four debut. 
</P>
<P>
	The Huskies will have some fun running their way past Missouri  
in the second round and Arkansas in the third. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanford and North Carolina will get back within a game of  
returning to the Final Four for a second straight year. The Tar 
Heels will get second-year coach Bill Guthridge back there but the 
rematch of last year's regional final with Connecticut won't turn 
out as well. 
</P>
<P>
	The Final Four will have Duke getting revenge on Kentucky for  
last year's game and Connecticut prevailing in what should be an 
entertaining game that doesn't need a shot clock. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be Duke and Connecticut, the only teams to hold the No.  
1 ranking this season, playing for the whole thing. Then it's time 
to pick your question: Can anybody beat these guys? Can anybody 
stay close to these guys?

at St. Petersburg, Fla., the site of this year's Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	How can anybody pick against Duke?  
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Devils will cruise to the East Regionals at the  
Meadowlands, their favorite Final Four launching pad, with wins 
over Florida A&AMP;M and College of Charleston, and will be joined 
there by Wisconsin, Cincinnati and Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati, the only team to beat the Blue Devils this season,  
just won't have the last-second heroics it did in that Nov. 28 game 
in the Great Alaska Shootout. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Devils will play the Midwest Regional champion in the  
national semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Look for Kentucky to be that team as the defending national  
champion makes a Dukelike fourth straight Final Four appearance. 
The Wildcats will stave off some scares, however, as sixth-seeded 
Kansas, with its lowest seeding since 1988, makes some noise in the 
second round and Utah, the team Kentucky beat for the title last 
season, provides a regional semifinal thriller. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wildcats will make their trip to St. Petersburg after a  
regional final win over North Carolina Charlotte, the team that 
will grab the nation's attention with solid play and kiss-blowing 
3-point shooter Diego Guevara. 
</P>
<P>
	The South Regional will have the best of the second-round story  
lines when George Washington meets its former coach, Mike Jarvis, 
and St. John's. The second round will also have the first of the 
No. 1 seeds leaving when Syracuse stuns Auburn. 
</P>
<P>
	Syracuse will run out of luck against Ohio State in the regional  
semifinals and the Buckeyes' game against Maryland in the final 
will also be a former Boston College coaches reunion. 
</P>
<P>
	Maryland's Gary Williams will get his first Final Four  
appearance, carried there with a sensational tournament from guard 
Steve Francis. 
</P>
<P>
	The Terrapins' opponent in the national semifinals will be  
Connecticut, another team led by a coach, Jim Calhoun, making his 
Final Four debut. 
</P>
<P>
	The Huskies will have some fun running their way past Missouri  
in the second round and Arkansas in the third. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanford and North Carolina will get back within a game of  
returning to the Final Four for a second straight year. The Tar 
Heels will get second-year coach Bill Guthridge back there but the 
rematch of last year's regional final with Connecticut won't turn 
out as well. 
</P>
<P>
	The Final Four will have Duke getting revenge on Kentucky for  
last year's game and Connecticut prevailing in what should be an 
entertaining game that doesn't need a shot clock. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be Duke and Connecticut, the only teams to hold the No.  
1 ranking this season, playing for the whole thing. Then it's time 
to pick your question: Can anybody beat these guys? Can anybody 
stay close to these guys?

<HEADLINE> Joe DiMaggio Is Mourned As Hero </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	In midcentury, when baseball stood above all American sports,  
Joe DiMaggio symbolized what fans loved about the game. Fifty years 
later, he had lost little of his star quality. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was to people all over the world what a baseball player was  
supposed to be like,'' said former Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you said to God, `Create someone who was what a baseball  
player should be,' God would have created Joe DiMaggio. ... And he 
did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added Tim McCarver, who spent two decades as a catcher and is  
now one of baseball's preeminent broadcasters: ``The very mention 
of his name personifies class, dignity, elegance and 
professionalism, both on and off the field.' 
</P>
<P>
	To those who knew him and to those who only admired him from  
afar, DiMaggio was the quintessential American hero. 
</P>
<P>
	``This son of Italian immigrants gave every American something  
to believe in,'' President Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He became the very symbol of American grace, power and skill.  
... I have no doubt that when future generations look back at the 
best of America in the 20th century, they will think of the Yankee 
Clipper and all that he achieved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mark McGwire, himself a larger than life figure after hitting 70  
home runs last season, said he was saddened by DiMaggio's death. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was one of the best in the game,'' said McGwire, who never  
got a chance to meet DiMaggio. ``It's a big loss for the game and 
for life in general.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Cal Ripken, who shattered the consecutive games streak of  
Lou Gehrig, a former DiMaggio teammate, said: 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel fortunate and lucky that I had the opportunity to talk  
baseball with him. I'm a baseball fan, and his accomplishments 
speak for themselves. There were a lot of misconceptions about Joe 
because of his need for privacy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio was a precursor of the modern athlete. In 1948, he  
signed the first $100,000 contract, and the paper and pen from that 
deal went on display Monday at the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, 
N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	And like Michael Jordan a half-century later, he was the most  
credible commercial spokesman in sports. 
</P>
<P>
	Long after he retired, he was instantly recognizable in ads for  
``Mr. Coffee.'' Even today, when those who saw him play are in 
their late 50s or beyond, a bank that retained its services has a 
sign with a ``5'' in pinstripes at Grand Central Terminal in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	Few have to ask what that means.  
</P>
<P>
	He was the reason many Italian-Americans in New York rooted for  
the Yankees, just as blacks rooted for the Brooklyn Dodgers because 
they made Jackie Robinson the first black in the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this century, there have been three baseball players who  
transcended their sport to become part of American legend,'' Vice 
President Al Gore said. ``Where Babe Ruth was known for his power 
and Jackie Robinson was known for his courage, Joe DiMaggio was 
known for dignity and grace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That was evident to DiMaggio's fellow players.  
</P>
<P>
	``In 1951, while I was still in high school, I went to New York  
to play in the Hearst All-Star game,'' recalled Al Kaline, who went 
on to join DiMaggio in the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	``They took us through the locker room and Joe was sitting in  
front of his locker. I stopped and shook his hand. It was like 
meeting a god.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ted Williams, who played in the Boston outfield next to  
DiMaggio's brother, Dom, was the contemporary most often likened to 
the Yankee Clipper. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no one Ted Williams admired, respected and envied  
more than Joe DiMaggio,'' Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
	While DiMaggio seemed standoffish with strangers, he was  
charming to those who got to know him, even if they weren't 
baseball fans, like the wife of Davey Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	``My wife and I were at a table with Yogi Berra and Joe. Then  
the next week we had Ted Williams at our table,'' said Davey 
Johnson, now manager of the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
	``She got Joe's and Ted's autograph and didn't even know what  
she had. She knew Joe from his coffee commercials and thought Ted 
was a great fisherman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To his contemporaries, he was, of course, a great player. But he  
was more than that. 
</P>
<P>
	``I idolized him for what he represented, which was class,  
dignity and character. He was a winner, a champion and a true 
icon,'' said Lasorda, who was a teen-ager when DiMaggio was in his 
prime. 
</P>
<P>
	That was true even to some current players.  
</P>
<P>
	``He really lived up to his billing,'' said Yankees pitcher  
David Cone. ``He was the greatest living player. He just had such a 
dignity and an elegance about him that nobody can match in today's 
game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Toronto's David Wells, who grew up a Yankee fan and met DiMaggio  
during his two seasons with the Yankees, said he would never forget 
talking to him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anybody who has grown up a fan of baseball, especially a  
Yankee fan, and you get to sit there and talk with one of their 
legends just gives you goose bumps,'' he said. ``A lot of people 
had a difficult time getting autographs from him, but when I walked 
in there he said 'Sure, Dave what do you want signed?' Like, wow, 
that's awesome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then Wells was asked how he would have pitched to DiMaggio if he  
had faced him in his prime? 
</P>
<P>
	``High and tight,'' Wells replied.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Marks Women's Day Via Video </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Rape, wife-beating, forced prostitution  
and other violence against women must stop, activists declared 
Monday as the United Nations linked the world in a live 
videoconference for International Women's Day. 
</P>
<P>
	Celebrities like Julie Andrews and Bianca Jagger joined victims,  
activists and government leaders in focusing a global spotlight 
Monday on what U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan called ``the most 
shameful human rights violation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All agreed there has been progress combating violence against  
women. Dozens of countries have changed laws and launched education 
campaigns. But the verdict from participants in New York; Nairobi, 
Kenya; New Delhi; and Strasbourg, France was unanimous: Much more 
remains to be done -- especially by men. 
</P>
<P>
	``The pandemic of violence against women and girls can never be  
stopped without concentrated, determined activism by men,'' 
stressed Noeleen Heyzer, executive director of the U.N. Development 
Fund for Women, the driving force behind the videoconference 
broadcast on the Internet and by satellite to a global audience. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a World Bank study, one-fourth to one-half of all  
women have suffered physical abuse by an intimate partner. In the 
United States, the FBI reports that a woman is battered by a 
partner every 15 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	A Rwandan mother of four identified only as Athanasie described  
how she was gang-raped in her bedroom every day for months by Hutu 
militiamen during the 1994 genocide. But she said ``my greatest 
pain was to hear the cries of my 12-year-old daughter as she was 
raped behind our house.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Irma Rojas, a 28-year-old Mexican mother who was burned, beaten  
and raped by her husband, said her case helped changed the law on 
marital rape. 
</P>
<P>
	Alpana Chandola, a young Indian woman, said she was starved,  
abused and thrown out of her husband's home because her family 
couldn't afford a car as part of her dowry. Despite threats, she is 
pursuing legal action against her in-laws. 
</P>
<P>
	``My advice to young girls is to remain financially  
independent,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Judge P.N. Bhagwati, former chief justice of India, noted  
that as Asia's economic crisis deepens, ``the flesh trade grows.'' 
Asian girls and women sold into prostitution generate $7 billion in 
profit annually for their traffickers, speakers noted. 
</P>
<P>
	``Legislation is critical,'' said Radhika Coomaraswamy, the U.N.  
special adviser on violence against women. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlotte Bunch, executive director of the Center for Women's  
Global Leadership at Rutgers University, said allocating more 
resources and recognizing violence against women as a community 
responsibility could go a long way toward ending the abuses. 
</P>
<P>
	And Dr. Nafis Sadik, executive director of the U.N. Population  
Fund, reported progress to eliminate female circumcision in more 
than a dozen of the 28 countries where it is entrenched.

<HEADLINE> Gas Explosion in Michigan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PLAINWELL, Mich. (AP) -- An explosion caused by a ruptured  
natural gas line ignited a fire that could be seen for 20 miles in 
a rural area of southwestern Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no reports of injuries and the cause of the rupture  
Sunday evening was unknown, according to Consumers Energy, a 
utility company. 
</P>
<P>
	The glow from the fire lit up the sky north of Kalamazoo for two  
hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looked like a bomb went off,'' said Roy Livingston, who  
lives a mile from the site. ``I saw it mushroom up and everything. 
I thought it was a nuclear bomb.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Philadelphia on Sunday, investigators said a gas leak  
probably led to an early-morning explosion that destroyed three 
homes and injured eight people. Hospital spokesmen said most of the 
injured were in stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Crews used heavy machinery to remove large rubble and then dug  
through smaller debris with their hands. 
</P>
<P>
	The blast woke neighbors with a noise like thunder, scattering  
blankets, sheets and other debris into trees. Homes on the block 
were evacuated and Red Cross officials set up a shelter nearby.

<HEADLINE> Remembering DiMaggio: A Quiet Hero </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Joe DiMaggio played baseball by his own set of rules, bringing  
to the game a sense of quiet dignity and respect that is now almost 
extinct in modern sports. 
</P>
<P>
	He rarely showed emotion. He would never think of standing at  
home plate, admiring balls he hit, showing up the pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
	On home runs, there would be no showboating, no finger-pointing,  
no preening and prancing and pointing to the sky. DiMaggio would 
simply put his head down, trot around the bases, shake hands as he 
crossed the plate and head for the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	He was the quintessential professional -- dignified and gracious,  
a quiet hero. 
</P>
<P>
	On defense, he rarely made spectacular catches. He didn't have  
to. He always seemed to be positioned perfectly. He covered center 
field with classic grace, gliding after the ball with long, loping, 
artful strides. That's why they called him the Yankee Clipper. 
</P>
<P>
	None of this was a particularly big deal with him. He played  
poker-faced baseball, effortlessly and expressionless. 
</P>
<P>
	The only exception was in the 1947 World Series against the  
Brooklyn Dodgers, when he hit a ball to the deepest part of left 
field at Yankee Stadium with two men on base. 
</P>
<P>
	Al Gionfriddo, a journeyman outfielder who had just entered the  
game, ran it down and made the catch in front of the bullpen, just 
as DiMaggio was reaching second base. Joe D. kicked the dirt in 
disgust. It was a rare peek behind the public facade. 
</P>
<P>
	Near the end of his career, at a time when his body often ached  
from nagging injuries, DiMaggio was asked whether he was tempted 
occasionally to relax on the field, to coast for a couple of 
innings. His answer spoke volumes about the kind of player he was. 
</P>
<P>
	``Never,'' he said. ``Somebody might be out there, watching me  
for the first time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first time I watched DiMaggio, I was angry with him. Not  
because he didn't live up to expectations. Quite the opposite. 
</P>
<P>
	He rattled a double off the left field wall at New York's Polo  
Grounds, helping the Yankees beat my team, the New York Giants, in 
the annual Mayor's Trophy game. 
</P>
<P>
	That did not sit well with this 8-year-old, seeing his first  
major league baseball game. 
</P>
<P>
	So I booed perhaps the most elegant player of his time. Booed  
him good. 
</P>
<P>
	Years later, when I knew better, I felt guilty. Joe D. was not  
to be booed. He was to be admired, not only for his skills, which 
were plentiful, but for his style, which was special. 
</P>
<P>
	For one generation of New York fans, the debate raged over  
baseball's best center fielder -- Willie, Mickey or the Duke. For 
the generation before that one, there was no argument. It was Joe 
D. 
</P>
<P>
	His cool demeanor hid churning emotions. Years after his record  
56-game hitting streak, DiMaggio revealed the pressure he felt. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was able to control myself,'' he said. ``That doesn't mean I  
wasn't dying inside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He demanded that on Oldtimers' Day at Yankee Stadium, he always  
be the last to be introduced, as a gesture to his status. In 1968, 
the year Mickey Mantle retired, the club chose to introduce Mantle 
last. DiMaggio viewed it as a slight, and it strained his 
relationship with the front office for years. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio was a private man, on the field and off. At one  
gathering at Yankee Stadium, many of his ex-teammates were in a 
lounge near the clubhouse, telling stories. DiMaggio sat alone at a 
corner table, a solitary figure. 
</P>
<P>
	And yet, his closest friend when he played was pitcher Lefty  
Gomez, the perpetual life of the party. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish I could be like Lefty,'' he once confided to  
restaurateur Toots Shor. 
</P>
<P>
	But he couldn't. It just wasn't in him.  
</P>
<P>
	If you gained his confidence, he could be a charming  
storyteller. Once, when I asked him about his 56-game hitting 
streak, DiMaggio brightened as he told an anecdote, laughing as he 
recalled the details. 
</P>
<P>
	The only subject that was off-limits was his short, stormy  
marriage to Marilyn Monroe. 
</P>
<P>
	Years after Monroe's death, DiMaggio came to the offices of The  
Associated Press for an interview. When he arrived, he saw a 
poster-sized picture in the hall of Monroe -- the famous AP photo of 
her skirts billowing as she stood over a subway grating. Seething, 
he made an immediate U-turn and left the building. 
</P>
<P>
	For DiMaggio, privacy was always hard to maintain.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, he was flying from Miami to New York to throw out the  
first ball at the World Series. Arriving at the gate for his 
flight, he was ushered across the hall, seated out of the way at an 
empty gate, where he could remain fairly undisturbed. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio was recognizable, everywhere he went. Once, I walked  
one block with him in Manhattan, heading from his hotel to an 
appearance at Radio City Music Hall. In the streets, he must have 
been stopped a half-dozen times by vendors, cabbies, pedestrians, 
all calling to him, ``Hey, Joe D., how you doin'?'' 
</P>
<P>
	And that was more than 40 years after he played his last game.  
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio responded with a wave and a smile. He enjoyed the  
acclaim. Nobody deserved it more. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Pittsburgh Names Basketball Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Ben Howland was introduced as Pitt's  
basketball coach today, saying his philosophy will be the same in 
the Big East as it was in the Big Sky: recruit players who can 
shoot. 
</P>
<P>
	Howland leaves Northern Arizona to replace Ralph Willard, who  
resigned after never taking Pitt to the NCAA tournament in five 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Willard's last season was marred by player suspensions, arrests  
and practice altercations that left the Panthers with only seven 
scholarship players for their Big East tournament loss to Rutgers 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Howland, 41, has been coach at Northern Arizona for five years.  
His teams won two Big Sky regular season titles and went to the 
NCAA Tournament last year, losing 65-62 to Cincinnati in the first 
round. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lumberjacks (21-8) lost to Weber State in the finals of this  
year's Big Sky tournament and did not get a tournament bid, either 
from the NCAA or NIT. 
</P>
<P>
	``As much as I wanted to win that game Saturday, I am glad to be  
here today,'' Howland said. 
</P>
<P>
	He pointed to other successful coaches who have left the Big Sky  
Conference, including Chicago Bulls coach Tim Floyd, Stanford coach 
Mike Montgomery and former Michigan State coach Jud Heathcote. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lumberjacks led the nation in 3-point shooting in each of  
the last two seasons and could lead NCAA Division I in field-goal 
and 3-point shooting this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe in recruiting shooters. You can't teach kids to  
shoot once they are freshmen or sophomores in college,'' he said. 
``We also need to recruit some size. We need some athletes 6-10, 
240, 250.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pitt had a small team this year with 6-foot-9 Isaac Hawkins  
starting at center. 
</P>
<P>
	Willard finished with a 63-77 record, including 14-16 this  
season. The Panthers got into the Top 25 after early upsets of 
Xavier and Kentucky in the Puerto Rico Shootout but got into 
trouble during their Big East schedule.

<HEADLINE> Whatever Happened to Valley Girl? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Sherman Oaks Galleria, nationally  
recognized cradle of the Valley Girl, is all, like, closing. Like, 
totally going out of business. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohmigod, is the Valley Girl dead, too?  
</P>
<P>
	Probably.  
</P>
<P>
	And does anyone still talk like this?  
</P>
<P>
	Fer shure.  
</P>
<P>
	The Galleria, a cosmic bubble of gleaming escalators and 999,000  
square feet of retail space, was immortalized in the 1980s teen 
flicks ``Valley Girl'' and ``Fast Times at Ridgemont High.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1982, Frank Zappa took his teen-age daughter, Moon Unit, into  
the recording studio, where she parodied the Val Speak slang and 
monotonous cadence of her schoolmates. ``Valley Girls'' became a 
best-selling single. 
</P>
<P>
	Sample lyric:  
</P>
<P>
	``Like, ohmigod! Like totally! Girls like the Galleria. And,  
like, all these, like, really great shoe stores.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Galleria was the architectural icon of a teen-age generation  
conspicuous -- some say vacuous -- in its thirst for clothes, stereos 
and compact discs. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the mall is nearly deserted; a victim of the 1994 Northridge  
earthquake, which forced it to close for repairs; repeated 
ownership changes; and failure to keep up with the times. The few 
stores still open are plastered with signs -- ``Liquidation Sale. 
Everything must go.'' On April 1, the Galleria closes for an 
extensive overhaul. 
</P>
<P>
	It's scheduled to reopen in about two years, a reincarnation  
heavy on office space but also featuring 18 movie theaters and an 
open-air ground floor of nothing but restaurants. Not food-court, 
Hot-Dog-on-a-Stick outlets, but real, sit-down restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Western malls, the Galleria has become somewhat of a white  
elephant, an enclosed monolith whose only outside views come from 
skylights. Newer malls are more apt to feature stores with 
individual entrances, united by a street that fosters a feeling a 
community, retail experts say. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides all that, the Valley Girl has grown up.  
</P>
<P>
	``Right now she's 35 and about to be a senior partner in a  
downtown law firm. She's morphed into something much more 
important,'' says state historian Kevin Starr, a professor and 
author. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr disagrees with popular sentiment that Valley Girl equals  
vapid. He notes that presidential paramour Monica Lewinsky, once 
proclaimed a Valley Girl, was later described as savvy and composed 
after testifying at the impeachment trial of President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``Valley Girls are nobody's saps. They're not seduced and  
abandoned. They're not sitting around waiting for someone to give 
them a life,'' Starr said. ``She's done rather well for herself. 
</P>
<P>
	``She represents the triumph of the middle class,'' he added.  
</P>
<P>
	Or at least the triumph of the Chanel suit and matching  
chain-strap bag. 
</P>
<P>
	The entertainment industry, in the go-go decade of the 1980s,  
took life in the suburban San Fernando Valley and California's 
stereotype of cute-but-clueless and turned both into national 
phenomenons. 
</P>
<P>
	The etymology of ``groddy,'' ``groddy to the max,'' ``gag me  
with a spoon,'' and ``fer shure'' trace to the Zappas' 
father-and-daughter collaboration. 
</P>
<P>
	Most terms are now horribly outdated, but there remain grown men  
and women who cannot construct a sentence without the word 
``like,'' as in ``I'm, like, really mad.'' Nor can they avoid the 
double whammie of ``like'' and ``all,'' as in ``I'm all, like, 
really mad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Occidental College public policy professor Peter Dreir says the  
Valley Girl has been replaced by the superficial but sensitive Cher 
of 1995's ``Clueless,'' directed by Amy Heckerling, the woman who 
made ``Fast Times,'' and based -- no way! -- on Jane Austen's 
``Emma.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Even though she's from Beverly Hills, she's characterized as a  
Valley Girl, which means California airhead and conspicuous 
consumption,'' Dreir said of the ``Clueless'' heroine. 
</P>
<P>
	``But the 1990s are really very different from the 1980s.  
Teen-agers have to work now,'' he said. The Galleria and Valley 
Girls were the epitomes of an era in which ``selfishness was 
celebrated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Director Martha Coolidge, who made ``Valley Girl,'' said she  
took her subject very seriously, spending lots of time researching 
the Galleria and the notion of what constitutes a Valley Girl. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a way of escaping. It incorporates all the rebellion into  
consumerism,'' said Coolidge, who went on to a more auspicious 
career that peaked with 1991's Oscar-nominated ``Rambling Rose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was marked by a language that came from surfer talk, but it  
moved across the country. It became an ideal. That we are a nation 
of consumers is a fact.''

<HEADLINE> Silas Takes Over As Hornets' Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT MILL, S.C. (AP) -- Paul Silas took over as the Charlotte  
Hornets' new coach Monday, pledging to try to revive a franchise 
beset by poor play, weak leadership and injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where this thing is going, who the heck knows? Hopefully  
miracles do happen,'' Silas said after running a nearly two-hour 
practice at the team's training complex. 
</P>
<P>
	Silas was named Charlotte's interim head coach one day after the  
resignation of Dave Cowens, his close friend and former teammate 
with the Boston Celtics in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	Cowens, who led Charlotte to back-to-back 50-victory seasons in  
his first two years in Charlotte, stepped down because of mounting 
frustration with owner George Shinn's refusal to give him a raise. 
</P>
<P>
	Cowens' inability to work out a deal with Shinn was just one of  
several problems associated with a club that is off to a 4-11 start 
and has seen a significant drop in attendance. 
</P>
<P>
	Shinn is the target of a lawsuit accusing him of unwanted sexual  
advances, and some fans are calling on him to sell the team if he 
continues to refuse to pay the money needed to retain top talent. 
Injuries have sidelined the team's best two players, and one of 
them, leading scorer Glen Rice, is the subject of ongoing trade 
talks with the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Considering those circumstances, Silas acknowledged, his new job  
doesn't exactly look like the chance of a lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I've been through tougher,'' he said. ``When you coach the  
Clippers, it's much tougher.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Silas coached the Clippers when they were located in San Diego  
from 1980-83, compiling a 78-168 mark. He has been an NBA assistant 
for most of the past 12 years, including the last two seasons in 
Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
	When Cowens told him of his plans to quit Sunday, Silas tried to  
talk him out of it. But Cowens would not relent, and Silas became a 
logical successor since he is the only one of Cowens' three 
assistants with NBA head coaching experience. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that he has the job, Silas knows that some fans will view  
him as another symbol of the franchise's problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fans have to look at the team and see whether we're making  
progress or not,'' he said. ``Are we playing hard? Are we giving 
them their money's worth? Those things that have occurred, I can't 
really be concerned about. I have to be concerned about my 12 
players at this point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Silas tries to block out the distractions, some of his  
players are finding it more difficult to take a business-as-usual 
approach. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has really been a tough time for us as players and as an  
organization,'' guard Bobby Phills said. ``We still have jobs to go 
out there and compete, and we're going to try to compete and win 
games. But I just really want the fans to stick by us and believe 
in what we're doing, just take the bad times with the good times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phills and his teammates don't seem to be bothered by the fact  
that Silas, who won three NBA titles with Boston and Seattle in a 
16-year playing career that ended in 1980, hasn't been a head coach 
since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	``They still run the same plays,'' forward J.R. Reid said.  
``Plays in the league haven't changed, believe me. That doesn't 
matter at all. Paul's a people person, and that has a lot to do 
with it nowadays. 
</P>
<P>
	``The X's and O's aren't everything. Some of the best X's and  
O's coaches can't get along with their players. Paul is different 
in that we all know him, he knows the game and he knows the 
personalities of the players, having been one himself. We're 
looking forward to having him as the coach.''

<HEADLINE> FDA Recalls Frozen Mamey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A tropical fruit often used to make shakes called  
batidos in Spanish-speaking communities is the subject of a 
nationwide recall aimed at stopping typhoid fever cases. 
</P>
<P>
	The Food and Drug Administration announced the voluntary recall  
Monday after frozen mamey products were linked to 13 cases of 
typhoid fever in Florida. None were fatal. 
</P>
<P>
	The frozen mamey was sold in clear plastic bags under the ``El  
Sembrador'' and ``La Fe'' brands. A third product under the recall, 
``Mamey, Mammea americana, Product of Guatemala,'' is usually sold 
to retailers. 
</P>
<P>
	Typhoid fever can cause headaches, joint pain, sore throats,  
constipation, loss of appetite and skin spots. Prompt treatment 
with antibiotics cures more than 99 percent of cases. 
</P>
<P>
	The 13 cases between December and Feb. 18 all required  
hospitalization, according to the FDA. Those cases appeared mostly 
in Hispanic communities in south Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	The La Fe brand was distributed in Florida, California,  
Connecticut, New Jersey, New York, Georgia, Arizona, Illinois, 
Louisiana, Philadelphia, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
	The El Sembrador brand was distributed in North Carolina,  
Illinois, Georgia, Florida and New York.

	POSOLTEGA, Nicaragua (AP) -- Arriving in San Salvador Monday  
night, President Clinton declared that all Americans have an 
interest in rebuilding Central America. Clinton opened a four-day 
trip to hurricane-ravaged Nicaragua, El Salvador, Honduras and 
Guatemala promising an unprecedented amount of reconstruction aid -- 
$956 million. Across Central America, more than 9,000 people died -- 
more than 5,000 in Honduras alone. Thousands more remain missing. 
Crops and bridges were destroyed and the damage toll ranges up to 
$10 billion in the already impoverished countries.

<HEADLINE> Death Penalty Sought for Charles Ng </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) -- Prosecutors asked jurors Monday to give  
the death penalty to a convicted torture killer as the penalty 
phase began in one of the state's longest and costliest homicide 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury must choose between capital punishment or life in  
prison without chance of parole for Charles Ng, 38. 
</P>
<P>
	He was convicted Feb. 24 of 11 murder counts in a spree of  
kidnapping, bondage and sadism in Northern California in the 1980s. 
The jury reached an impasse on a 12th count. 
</P>
<P>
	Calaveras County District Attorney Peter Smith called witnesses  
to testify about Ng's propensity to violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Sean Doyle, a former security officer for the Hudson Bay Co.  
department store, testified how a shoplifting incident led to Ng's 
arrest in Calgary, Alberta, about a month after Lake's suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	Doyle said Ng bit him on the wrist and shot him in the hand  
during a scuffle after Doyle spotted him stealing canned fish and a 
two-liter bottle of soda. Doyle said he never regained use of his 
middle finger. 
</P>
<P>
	Other witnesses talked about the pain of losing their relatives  
in the killing spree. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be honest with you, I've put it out of my mind all these  
years because it's hard to even talk about it,'' said Robert 
McCourt of Philadelphia, the brother of a victim, Clifford 
Peranteau. ``It's not like he got hit by a car or something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ng fought extradition for six years in Canada, and his trial was  
moved to Orange County in 1994 because of heavy news coverage in 
Northern California.

<HEADLINE> Colo. Student Wins Science Prize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A 14-year-old who studied the elusive  
subatomic particles called neutrinos won the prestigious Intel 
Science Talent Search on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Natalia Toro, a senior at Fairview High School in Boulder,  
Colo., becomes the youngest winner in the history of the 
58-year-old event. She receives a $50,000 college scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Toro, who began taking college courses in the sixth grade,  
did her winning research last summer as part of a program at 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which she hopes to attend. 
</P>
<P>
	She studied neutrinos, elementary particles that have no  
electrical charge and are thought to have no mass when at rest, but 
which move at the speed of light. 
</P>
<P>
	In announcing the winner, the judges said Miss Toro's work may  
help explain mysterious shortages of neutrino counts. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent studies in Japan suggested that neutrinos might oscillate  
between a state that a neutrino detector can see and one that it 
cannot. Miss Toro developed an equation to predict theoretical 
neutrino counts. When compared with the data from Japan, her work 
strongly supports the oscillation theory, the judges reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The Intel Science Talent Search, formerly known as the  
Westinghouse Science Search, is now sponsored by the Intel Corp. 
and Science Service, a nonprofit Washington organization that 
publishes Science News. 
</P>
<P>
	Second place, and a $40,000 scholarship, went to David Moore,  
18, of Montgomery Blair High School in Silver Spring, Md., who 
determined the electrical properties of a newly proposed design for 
molecular electronic switches. 
</P>
<P>
	And Keith Winstein, 17, of the Illinois Science and Mathematics  
Academy in Aurora, Ill., was third. He won a $30,000 scholarship 
for work on a method to embed information in computerized data 
without making any perceptible change in the original material. 
</P>
<P>
	Rounding out the top 10 winners were:  
</P>
<P>
	--Carol Ann Fassbinder, 18, Valley Community High School, Elgin,  
Iowa, $20,000 scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
	--Rio Gabriel Benin, 17, a home-schooled senior from Berkeley,  
Calif., $20,000 scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
	--Lisa Beth Schwartz, 17, of Roslyn High School in Roslyn  
Heights, N.Y., $20,000 scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
	--Scott Alexander Fruhan, 17, of Roxbury Latin School, West  
Roxbury, Mass., $15,000 scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
	--Kurt Elliot Mitman, 16, Thomas Jefferson High School for  
Science and Technology, Fairfax County, Va., $15,000 scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
	--Diana Barnard Townsend-Butterworth, 17, of Chapin School in New  
York City, $15,000 scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
	--Alexander David Wissner-Gross, 17, of Great Neck High School,  
Great Neck, N.Y., $15,000 scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the first and second alternates, in case any of the  
top 10 cannot accept their scholarship, were Cullen Blake, 17, of 
Bethlehem Central High School in Delmar, N.Y., and David Harden, 
17, of South Miami Senior High School in Miami, Fla.

<HEADLINE> Schott Meets Partners About Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Marge Schott met with some of the Cincinnati  
Reds' limited partners Monday to brief them on the offer to buy her 
controlling interest in the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Schott and the partners declined comment as they left the  
meeting at a private club downtown. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the partners' first chance to hear from Schott about her  
intention to sell all but one of her shares to a group headed by 
the brother of Cablevision Systems Corp.'s chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	The limited partners will have the option to match the $65  
million offer. The sale process is expected to take months. 
</P>
<P>
	More uncertainty was injected into the sale process over the  
weekend. Carl A. Kroch, who owned one share of the Reds, died in 
Chicago. He was one of Schott's most outspoken critics. 
</P>
<P>
	Schott has agreed to sell her controlling interest in the Reds  
rather than accept another suspension from baseball. She has 
received an offer from a group headed by Cleveland lawyer Larry 
Dolan, whose brother Charles is chairman of Cablevision. 
</P>
<P>
	Schott, 70, owns 6 1/2 shares in the team and is the general  
partner. The limited partners own the other 8 1/2 shares. 
</P>
<P>
	The current ownership agreement expires at the end of 2000, at  
which time the limited partners may be able to oust Schott if she 
hasn't already sold he controlling interest.

<HEADLINE> Baseball Hall of Fame Lowers Flag </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. (AP) -- The Baseball Hall of Fame lowered its  
official flag in tribute to Joe DiMaggio on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The baseball shrine, where DiMaggio last appeared eight years  
ago, also placed a wreath at the Yankee Clipper's plaque in the 
inductees' room. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reverence for him was unsurpassed,'' Hall of Fame  
spokesman Jeff Idelson said. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio, who died Monday at 84 in his home in Hollywood, Fla.,  
attended the 1991 induction ceremonies in Cooperstown, marking the 
50th anniversary of his 56-game hitting streak and Ted Williams' 
.400 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Wherever DiMaggio and Williams went that weekend, people would  
stop and applaud, paying tribute to a pair of baseball greats 
linked forever by that one magical season. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though he had been ailing for several months, DiMaggio's  
death stunned visitors as word of his death spread around the Hall 
of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most were older folks who were coming with their kids or  
grandkids anyway,'' Idelson said. ``Upon learning of his death, you 
could see a certain sadness in their faces.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio was inducted into the Hall in 1955. His memorabilia on  
display includes his Yankee Stadium locker, which was later used by 
Mickey Mantle. 
</P>
<P>
	Hanging in the locker are DiMaggio's home uniform and cap from  
the 1951 season, his last, along with some gloves and bats from his 
1939 MVP season. 
</P>
<P>
	There's also the pen he used to sign baseball's first $100,000  
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Idelson said film programs featuring DiMaggio will be played in  
the museum's movie theater all month.

<HEADLINE> Court Rejects McVeigh's Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today left intact Timothy  
McVeigh's conviction and death sentence for the 1995 Oklahoma City 
bombing that killed 168 people and injured hundreds more -- the 
worst such attack on U.S. soil. 
</P>
<P>
	The court, without comment, rejected an appeal in which McVeigh  
argued his trial was tainted by jury misconduct and news reports 
that he confessed to his lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	In other action today, the court:  
</P>
<P>
	--Refused to free filmmaker Oliver Stone from a lawsuit that says  
his movie, ``Natural Born Killers,'' led a couple to shoot a woman 
during a robbery. It left intact a state appeals court ruling that 
allowed the lawsuit to go forward because it alleged the filmmakers 
intended to incite viewers to commit similar crimes shortly after 
seeing the movie. 
</P>
<P>
	--Rejected the appeal of a Missouri high school teacher who was  
fired for letting her students use large amounts of profanity in 
class while performing self-written plays. 
</P>
<P>
	--Turned away Marlena Ramallo Cooke's appeal in her effort to  
avoid being deported over a 1986 guilty plea to a drug conspiracy 
charge. She is the widow of the late Jack Kent Cooke, who owned the 
Washington Redskins professional football team. 
</P>
<P>
	--Turned away a dispute between Santa Barbara, Calif., officials  
and anti-abortion activists over the city's restrictions on how 
close pickets, sidewalk counselors and other demonstrators can get 
to abortion clinics and their patients. 
</P>
<P>
	McVeigh was convicted of first-degree murder, conspiracy and  
weapons-related charges in the April 19, 1995, bombing of the 
Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. A three-judge federal appeals 
court panel upheld his 11 convictions and death sentence last 
September in the deaths of federal employees. 
</P>
<P>
	McVeigh still can pursue a new round of appeals challenging the  
constitutionality of his prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling by the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sends a  
message that ``the rules of law may be applied on a sliding scale 
when the crime is unspeakable and public outrage is great,'' 
McVeigh's Supreme Court appeal contended. 
</P>
<P>
	The bombing could be heard miles away, and television screens  
soon were filled with stunning images of the shattered building and 
rescue workers looking for survivors. 
</P>
<P>
	At McVeigh's 1997 trial, prosecutors said he and co-defendant  
Terry Nichols carried out the bombing in revenge for the April 19, 
1993, deaths of about 80 people in the siege at the Branch Davidian 
compound near Waco, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said McVeigh, now 30, chose the Oklahoma City  
building because he believed people responsible for the Waco siege 
worked there and because the building was an easy target. Nichols 
was convicted of conspiracy in a separate trial and sentenced to 
life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	McVeigh's appeal said pretrial news reports that he had  
confessed to his lawyers created an ``extraordinary'' threat to his 
fair-trial rights. Four jurors indicated in pretrial questioning 
that they had seen the reports. 
</P>
<P>
	``No such procedure should send Mr. McVeigh to his death,'' his  
appeal said, adding that the judge's manner of instructing and 
questioning prospective jurors made it impossible to determine 
whether they were biased. 
</P>
<P>
	McVeigh's jury-misconduct allegation centered on a comment by  
one juror to others during the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	An alternate juror told a court official that jurors discussed  
which of them would decide the case and which would serve as 
alternates, and that one juror said: ``It wouldn't be very hard. I 
think we all know what the verdict should be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McVeigh's appeal said the trial judge should have questioned the  
juror or held a hearing on whether the juror was biased. 
</P>
<P>
	His lawyers also said prospective jurors should have been asked  
whether they had any opinions about what sentence should be imposed 
if he were convicted. Otherwise, the appeal said, ``we risk having 
an 'Oklahoma City bombing case' exception to the rule of law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department lawyers said the bombing ``caused  
extraordinary harm'' and that courts took ``extraordinary steps'' 
to ensure McVeigh a fair trial, including disqualifying the 
original judge and moving the trial to Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	Prospective jurors were examined thoroughly for signs of bias,  
they said, calling the juror's remark a ``passing, ambiguous 
comment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case is McVeigh vs. U.S., 98-7500.
