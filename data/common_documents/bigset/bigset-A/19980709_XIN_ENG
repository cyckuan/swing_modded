<HEADLINE> One in Three Newborns Unregistered: UNICEF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 8 (Xinhua) - One out of three children born each
year are at risk because they are not registered at birth, a UN
official said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the launch of the UNICEF's yearly report, the
Progress of Nations 1998, Carol Bellamy, the UNICEF's executive
director, said, "Lack of registration leaves an estimated 40
million babies born each year without an official name on
nationality."
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the major unreported stories of our time and
lack of a valid birth certificate threatens a child
fundamentally," she added.
</P>
<P>
The report said that whether seeking health care or
immunization, entering school or proving one is too young for
military service or to work in hazardous industries, a birth
certificate is a necessity.
</P>
<P>
"Without effective birth registration systems, governments find
it difficult to plan for the future," Bellamy said. "They may not
know how many doses of vaccine to buy or the number of classrooms
to build," she added.
</P>
<P>
The Progress of Nations 1998 also dealt with the emerging issue
of adolescence and with the growing phenomenon of homelessness in
industrialized nations.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, young people aged 10 to 19 account for
one-sixth of the world's population. Early marriage and pregnancy,
child labor, lack of schooling and widespread sexual
discrimination are among the issues that demand urgent attention
as this largest generation in history moves into the third
millennium.
</P>
<P>
"Adolescence represents a time of great potential and even
greater risk," Bellamy said. "We must listen to the problems of
the young and provide real channels for their participation and
growth."
</P>
<P>
The report warned that homelessness in the industrialized world
is evidence of increasing economic disparities within the most
wealthy nations.
</P>
<P>
In 12 of the wealthiest countries, per capita gross national
product more than doubled in the last 15 years but, at the same
time, homelessness increased, it added.

BRUSSELS, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission on
Wednesday set out conditions for approving two major transatlantic
airline mergers.
</P>
<P>
European Competition Commissioner Karel van Miert said that the
commission intends to approve the mergers between British Airways

</P>
<P>
He said that the British Airways-American Airlines alliance is
obliged to cede up to 267 slots, mostly in London, while the
Lufthansa-SAS-United Airlines alliance is obliged to cede 108
slots, mostly in Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
They also have to reduce the frequency of flights on routes on
which they are currently dominant, he added.

<HEADLINE> HK Legislative Council Meeting Adopts Motion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Legislative Council
adopted a motion on the alleviation of the hardship of people's
livelihood during its meeting here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The motion urges the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
government to adopt effective measures to alleviate hardship of
people's livelihood and formulate a long-term industrial policy to
advance Hong Kong's economic development.
</P>
<P>
The measures include the reduction of the petrol tax by 30
percent, returning 20 percent of the salaries tax and profits tax
paid for the year 1996-97 and the establishment of a Social
Welfare Services Development Fund to implement its commitments to
social welfare services, and increase employment opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Another motion on unemployment failed to earn enough votes
after long debates.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the council members had the first and second
readings of the Holidays (Amendment) Bill 1998.
</P>
<P>
The main purpose of the bill is to replace two of the general
holidays observed in 1997 and 1998, that is, Sino-Japanese War
Victory Day (the third Monday in August) and October 2 (the day
after the National Day), by Labor Day (May 1) and the Buddha's
Birthday (eighth day of the fourth lunar month) from 1999 onwards.
</P>
<P>
The meeting lasted for more than nine hours. In the course,
government officials answered nearly 20 questions on various
policy areas raised by legislators in oral or written form.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: London Links With Frankfurt for Single </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The London and Frankfurt stock
exchanges are to join forces, a historic agreement which will pave
the way for a single European stock market.
</P>
<P>
The two exchanges Tuesday signed a memorandum of understanding
and outlined details of a strategic alliance. They are to create a
50/50 joint venture, and will work together to develop a
pan-European stock market.
</P>
<P>
Details of which companies will be included have yet to be
decided. However, based on the current FTSE Eurotop 300 index, a
Stock Exchange spokesman said they would include 108 UK-based
stocks and 37 German stocks.
</P>
<P>
The move ends a bitter war between the two exchanges for
supremacy in Europe's rapidly converging financial markets and
also represents a sharp reversal of policy for the London
exchange, which has until recently rebuffed any suggestion that it
should cooperate with other markets.
</P>
<P>
It marks a watershed in relations between London and Frankfurt.
Werner Seifert, chief executive of the Deutsche Borse, said he
wanted to "end all speculation about a battle between London and
Frankfurt, which was never intended on either side."
</P>
<P>
The announcement surprised the Paris stock exchange, which had
been working on plans for cooperation with Frankfurt and appears
to be left in the cold by the London and Frankfurt alliance.
</P>
<P>
The London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Borse said they
hoped to form a "core nucleus" around which a pan-European stock
market would be based.
</P>
<P>
John Kemp-Welch, chairman of the London Stock Exchange, said
Tuesday that he had spoken to a number of chairmen and chief
executives of other European bourses and that they were all very
interested in the concept.
</P>
<P>
The two exchanges are to start work immediately on setting up a
common access package, which will allow the shares of the top 300
European companies to be traded on either exchange.
</P>
<P>
They plan to harmonize their market rules, accounting standards
and conventions and eventually build a single electronic trading
system.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was applauded by investment banks, regulators
and investors in Europe. Large fund managers have already begun to
treat Europe as a single market for investment purposes, and this
should accelerate with the euro's launch next year.
</P>
<P>
Werner Seifert said that as these forces created a global
capital market, the alliance with London was "a logical answer to
the marginalization of national and local financial centers."
</P>
<P>
At present, London is the second-largest stock market in the
world, behind the United State, while Germany is ranked second in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
Total turnover in London last year was 889 billion pounds
(1422.4 billion U.S. dollars), compared to 462 billion pounds
(739.2 billion dollars) in Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
It is commonly believed in the City that the agreement is an
important move for European markets, as well as London and
Frankfurt, and will ensure that they remain well placed to
maintain and enhance their position as one of the leading
financial centers of the world.
</P>
<P>
However, a few observers said, as the merger process will take
quite a time, some doubts will still linger among broking houses
and dealers. They want to see how it all works before they
applaud.

<HEADLINE> Widespread Violence Takes Place in N.Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 200 attacks have been made
against the security forces in Northern Ireland in the last 24
hours, the Northern Irish police said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The latest incidents take the number of attacks since the
Drumcree stand-off began Sunday to more than 430.
</P>
<P>
That figure includes 12 shootings and 25 bombings, the police
said. Dozens of cars and buses have also been hijacked and burnt.
</P>
<P>
The new wave of gun and bomb attacks undermined efforts to
resolve a crisis over a Protestant parade banned from marching
through the Garvaghy Road in Portadown, 50 km southwest of
Belfast.
</P>
<P>
The decision to ban the Orangemen was taken by the independent
Parades Commission which wanted to avoid the kind of violence that
could wreck Northern Ireland's fragile peace process.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam said Wednesday
the Orange Order was deliberately trying to stretch the security
forces.
</P>
<P>
"It is not enough to call for peaceful protest, if at the same
time you are not abiding by the law," she said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Tony Blair will meet with the Orangemen Thursday
about the stand-off between the marchers and the police, but a
breakthrough about the crisis is unlikely as Blair said the ban on
the parade was not open for discussion.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Mourns Sudden Death of Abiola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The Uganda government has received
with profound shock and sadness the news of the sudden and
untimely death of detained Nigerian politician Chief Moshood
Abiola.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued Wednesday by the President's Office
</P>
<P>
hailed Abiola as a veteran politician in Nigeria and an
eminent personality on the African continent.
</P>
<P>
He will be remembered long as a very good friend of Uganda and
an illustrious Pan-Africanist whose demise is a terrible loss not
only to the people of Nigeria but to Africa as a whole, it said.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan government conveys sincere condolence and sympathy
to the bereaved family.
</P>
<P>
Abiola, who died of cardiac arrest Tuesday afternoon at the
age of 60, is reported to be taken ill when meeting with the
visiting U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
Having been widely believed to have won the 1993 presidential
election in Nigeria, Abiola was locked up in 1994 by late
Nigerian President Sani Abacha who died less than a month ago.
</P>
<P>
Abacha's successor General Abdulsalam Abubakar who took power
on June 9 promised to United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan
that all political prisoners will be released soon.
</P>
<P>
Abiola's impending release is expected to help stabilize the
uncertain situation in the west African country and his sudden
death is regarded as the latest twist in Nigeria's rocky
political road.

<HEADLINE> Jordan, South Africa Discuss Trade, Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 8 (Xinhua) -- South African Deputy Foreign Minister
Aziz Pahad held talks with Jordanian officials here Wednesday on
ways of boosting bilateral trade as well as their coordination in
reviving the stalled Arab-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is Pahad' first leg of a Mideast tour, which will also
include trips to Egypt, Israel and Palestinian self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival here Wednesday, Pahad met Jordanian Minister
of Industry and Trade Hani Mulki to discuss how to promote the
bilateral ties in trade, tourism and agricultural fields, Jordan's
official news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Pahad and Mulki also discussed the possibility of conducting
cooperation between the two countries within the framework of the
international non-aligned movement.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is to host a summit of The Non-Aligned Movement
in late August.
</P>
<P>
During his six-day stay in Jordan, Pahad is also expected to
meet more Jordanian officials to discuss other bilateral issues
and their roles in reviving the stalled Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued by the South African Embassy here said
Pahad would also discuss with Egyptian leaders the upcoming summit
in his country and find ways to overcome differences over the
faltering peace process.
</P>
<P>
The release stated that South Africa hoped to play "a potential
role to bridge the gap between the Palestinians and Israelis."
</P>
<P>
It added that Pahad's visit was conducted after South Africa
received a number of appeals from various participants in the Oslo
process to help advance the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
</P>
<P>
Israel maintained close ties with South Africa's former
apartheid government before the present President Nelson Mandela
came to power in the country's first all-race elections in 1994,
the semi-official Jordan Times reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
But the current South African government identifies with the
Palestinian struggle for liberation, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Pak Minister Stresses Need of Education for Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Minister of State for Women
Development and Social Welfare and Special Education Tehmina
Daultana Wednesday emphasized the need to educate the mothers "if
we want to build better and literate society to meet the
challenges of the next century."
</P>
<P>
Tehmina was speaking here at the launching of a U.N. report --
"The Progress of Nations 1998" -- with special emphasis on the
registration of child at the time of birth.
</P>
<P>
She said that ignoring a girl child means that half of the
population is being ignored. How can a country make progress while
ignoring half of its population, she added.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF (U.N. Children's Fund) has described the world's
children as the "forgotten quarter" of the Earth's people.
</P>
<P>
The convention on the rights of the child has provided a
standard benchmark against which the behavior of the nation is
measured and improved, she said.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani government has made certain laws to curb child
labor according to its commitment. But the implementation of these
laws is the most important thing. It can only be done with the
help of the people, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
She said it is the responsibility of all Pakistani people to
make sure the implementation of these laws.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the idea of registration of newly born baby with
the registration office, she appreciated the efforts of UNICEF,
saying that "it is something which every one of us should take
care of."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, different presentations were made to highlight the
child immunization program, condition of girl child and the
tendency to register the child at the time of birth.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of the Ministry of Women Development Muzaffar Mehmood
Qureshi placed special emphasis on the registration of child.
</P>
<P>
"For this purpose, it is necessary to instruct the registration
officers and to guide the parents and apprise them of the
advantages of registration of child," said Qureshi.
</P>
<P>
He said that UNICEF has done a lot in this regard and
particularly this organization is helping Pakistan in many ways.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF Representative to Pakistan Stephen H. Umemoto said on
the occasion that the report will be launched across the world and
in the next few days it will be launched in 145 countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that according to the report almost 40 million children
every year are not registered, despite the fact that Article 7 of
the Convention on the Rights of Child clearly says, "the child
shall be registered immediately after birth."
</P>
<P>
He said despite almost universal ratification of this human
rights treaty, one third of all births go un-registered.
</P>
<P>
In Pakistan, the birth certificate is only needed by the school
administration if one intends to get his/her child admitted to
school.

KAMPALA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni

<HEADLINE> Pak Population at 130.58 Million: Census </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Finance Minister Sartaj Aziz
announced here Wednesday that Pakistan's total population has
reached 130.58 million, showing an average annual growth rate of
2.61 percent since 1981.
</P>
<P>
"I can claim it as the most authentic, fair and transparent
Census in the history of Pakistan," Aziz said at a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
The Fifth Population and Housing Census 1998 was undertaken
from March 2 to 18 throughout the country. About 150,000 field
staff were hired from the provincial government departments and
imparted thorough training before the census operations.
</P>
<P>
The provisional result showed that the total population of
130.58 million in this South Asian nation was 46.326 million more
than that of the last Population and Housing Census conducted in
1981.
</P>
<P>
This shows an overall percentage increase of 54.98 over the
last census, recording an average growth rate of 2.61 percent as
against 3.06 observed during 1971-81.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said the population is well below 138 million as was being
assumed before, adding it is a welcome decline in the rate of
population growth in all areas except Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
This was an understandable increase due to in-migration of
population since becoming the capital of Pakistan, the minister
added.
</P>
<P>
He said though the annual average growth rate during 1981- 98
is 2.61 percent, it is lower in the recent years.
</P>
<P>
According to the results, the population of Pakistan's largest
province of Punjab has been placed at 72.585 million as against
47.292 million. This shows an annual growth rate of 2.55 percent
as against the 2.74 observed during 1971-81.
</P>
<P>
Sindh's population, under the new Census, is 29.991 million
which shows an annual growth rate of 2.71 percent. In the last
Census, Sindh's population was 19.029 million with an annual
growth rate of 3.56 percent.

his discussion in European capitals last month, the diplomats
confirmed, are access to dual-use technology and an exemption to
the imposition of fullscope safeguards on India's nuclear
facilities.
</P>
<P>
"India has become very practical now by not asking to be
recognized as a nuclear weapon state," the diplomats said,
implying that this crucial concession had been responsible for
bettering the atmospherics with the P-5.
</P>
<P>
"What India was saying the early days after it tested, that the
nuclear-five had now become the nuclear-six is no longer true.
India is saying it doesn't want to do that now," the diplomats
said.
</P>
<P>
One view in diplomatic circles here is that India will be ready
to sign the CTBT "by the winter", thereby paving the way for a
visit by U.S. President Bill Clinton to the country.
</P>
<P>
That is why the scheduled meeting between Jaswant Singh, deputy
chairman of India's Planning Commission and a key aide to
Vajpayee, and U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott in
Frankfurt Thursday would be "crucial, but very tough".
</P>
<P>
The encounter would signal how the rest of the negotiations
between India and the P-5 unfolds, according to the diplomats.
</P>
<P>
Amid contradictory reports on India's position towards CTBT
lately, some intense and complex negotiations are now under way to
cut a deal with the United States.
</P>
<P>
Press reports here have indicated that the government's
position on the CTBT is shifting from criticism toward
consideration of joining if certain concessions in technology
transfer are secured.
</P>
<P>
However, official sources said Sunday that there was no change
in India's basic position on what they called the discriminatory
nature of the CTBT.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's 1st Lady Launches UNICEF's Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Nearly four in five Zimbabwean
infants have been vaccinated against the major child-killing
diseases, First Lady Grace Mugabe said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during the launch of United Nations Children's Fund
UNICEF's 1998 Progress of Nations report in Harare, Mrs. Mugabe
said that at independence the ratio had been one in 10 infants
who were vaccinated, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The diseases are measles, tetanus, whooping cough,
tuberculosis, polio and diphtheria.
</P>
<P>
"Zimbabwe can and should still do better," said Mrs. Mugabe,
adding that "we should not be satisfied until all children are
vaccinated against the killer diseases."
</P>
<P>
She said: "We must work hard to maintain and expand basic
immunization levels because every child has a right to be
protected from the vaccine-preventable diseases."
</P>
<P>
A way should be found to include vaccines in the basic
immunization package which treat diseases like hepatitis B, said
Mrs. Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
The first lady said this year's Progress of Nations report
focuses on four themes which include child immunization,
adolescence birth registration and homelessness.
</P>
<P>
The report, she said, is an appropriate reminder to everyone
of their responsibility toward children.
</P>
<P>
She said that out of the 12.5 million Zimbabweans, about three
million are children between the ages of 10 and 19.
</P>
<P>
One in five girls aged from 15 to 19 years is either married
or cohabiting, almost always with an older man who has more power
in making decisions, Mrs. Mugabe said.
</P>
<P>
She added that one in 10 births in Zimbabwe is to a teenage
mother.
</P>
<P>
The first lady noted that the AIDS scourge is a serious
problem for the youth aged between 15 and 24 years globally,
accounting for more than 50 percent of new HIV infections. And
teenage girls face the greatest risk.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe on Top List of Immunization: UN Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 8 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Children's Fund
(UNICEF) representative in Harare Justin Maeda said Wednesday
that Zimbabwe has the fourth best record in the world on measles
immunization.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the launch of this year's the "Progress of
Nations" report, Maeda described the record as a reasonable proxy
for immunization in general.
</P>
<P>
A total of 40 sub-Sahara African countries were examined by
this report.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe managed to bring child immunization against the six
vaccine-preventable diseases from 10 percent at independence in
1980 to about 80 percent today.
</P>
<P>
The diseases are measles, tetanus, whooping cough,
tuberculosis, polio and diphtheria.
</P>
<P>
Maeda said this was a legacy the country could be proud of
although the struggle is not yet over.
</P>
<P>
"A total of 500,000 children are born in Zimbabwe every year,
and this new generation of children must also be immunized," the
U.N. official added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that "we need to make special efforts" to reach the
goal that the great majority of the new born infants are
immunized.

<HEADLINE> Iran, Pakistan Urge Efforts to Solve Afghan Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Iran and Pakistan on Wednesday
urged intensified cooperation among the United Nations, the
Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) and regional
countries to solve the Afghan crisis.
</P>
<P>
The two countries issued the appeal during a meeting here
between Pakistan's special envoy on Afghan affairs Iftekhar
Murshid and his Iranian counterpart Alaeddin Boroujerdi.
</P>
<P>
Murshid said the resolution of the Afghan crisis required
serious cooperation among Afghanistan's neighbors, such as
Pakistan and Iran which are major players in the peace-making
efforts.
</P>
<P>
Murshid, who arrived here Wednesday morning, expressed
Islamabad's satisfaction with its cooperation with Iran on finding
a solution to the Afghan crisis, including the recent dispatch of
joint delegations to Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
He noted that besides the efforts by Pakistan and Iran, the
U.N., the OIC and other regional countries are also actively
seeking a solution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
But he said that the Afghan peace would not materialize without
the determination by Afghan leaders to make peace.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Boroujerdi cautioned that the road to Afghan peace
was "rocky and harsh" and intensified international efforts were
needed to solve the issue.
</P>
<P>
He voiced Iran's deep concern about the increasing drug
production in the war-torn Afghanistan due to long years of civil
war. He said Iran believed that the war against drug should be
fought in parallel with the peace-making efforts exerted by the
U.N., the OIC and other countries.
</P>
<P>
A civil war has erupted in Afghanistan since former Soviet
Union's army pulled out the country in early 1989. In 1992, the
alliance of guerrilla forces led by Burhanuddin Rabbani captured
the capital of Kabul following years of war with then
Soviet-backed regime.
</P>
<P>
But a new civil war ensued between the Rabbani-led government
and the pro-Islamic Taliban forces, which in September 1996 took
over Kabul and ousted the Rabbani government.
</P>
<P>
Iran, which reportedly supported the deposed Rabbani government,
hosted the first Afghan Peace Conference in January 1997, which
was attended by all Afghan factions except the Taliban. Pakistan,
which reportedly supported the Taliban, boycotted the meeting.
</P>
<P>
In April this year, under the mediation of the U.S., the
U.N. and the OIC, Taliban and its rival Northern Alliance held the
first face-to-face peace talks in Pakistan. But the peace talks
quickly broke down due to huge differences between the two sides.

<HEADLINE> WTO Pleased With Hungary's Reforms, Preparations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Hungary has largely resisted
protectionist pressures to move ahead with major macroeconomic and
structural adjustment in its transition to a market economy, said
the World Trade Organization (WTO) here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Even in the face of large twin fiscal and trade deficits in
1995 and high levels of government debt (internal and external),
the WTO said, Hungary has pursued new trade opportunities,
especially with the European Union (EU), the European Free Trade
Association and partners in the Central European Free Trade
Agreement (CEFTA).
</P>
<P>
"Hungary's preparations for accession to the EU will lead to
more structural and institutional adjustment," said the WTO
report. "Some of the reforms, particularly in the areas of
intellectual property rights and competition policy, go beyond
Hungary's WTO obligations."
</P>
<P>
Based on the WTO secretariat's report and a policy statement by
the Hungarian government, WTO members met on July 7-8 to examine
Hungary's trade policies.
</P>
<P>
The WTO report said that the most dramatic feature of Hungary's
structural adjustment has been the re-orientation of its trade
towards the EU and CEFTA members.
</P>
<P>
The Europe agreement removed most tariff and quantitative
restrictions on trade between Hungary and the EU, with the
exception of agricultural products, textiles and steel.
</P>
<P>
The WTO said that average tariffs remain relatively high for
imports of agricultural products and prepared food, textiles,
clothing and footwear, and automobiles.
</P>
<P>
Hungary's imports rose from nearly 34 percent of GDP in 1991 to
41 percent in 1996, while exports increased from almost 33 percent
of GDP to about 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
Foreign direct investment (FDI) in 1997 amounted to 2 billion
U.S. dollars, or nearly 5 percent of GDP. Since 1990, Hungary has
attracted 18 billion dollars and now FDI accounts for roughly 40
percent of the total investment stock in Central and Eastern
Europe.
</P>
<P>
The WTO said that foreign investors have been attracted to
Hungary mainly because of its skilled labor force, relatively low
wage costs and growing orientation towards European markets.
</P>
<P>
The WTO report concluded that Hungary will face new trade
policy challenges as it intensifies its efforts to join the EU
while still participating in the WTO and engaging in regional
trade agreements with other CEFTA member countries.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Mbeki to Visit Nigeria After Abiola's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 8 (Xinhua) -- South African Deputy
President Thabo Mbeki is to visit Nigeria Thursday after the
death of detained Nigerian opposition leader Moshood Abiola, the
government said in a statement Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the South African government had
learned with great shock and sadness of Abiola's untimely death.
</P>
<P>
"The government is conscious of the fact that this completely
unexpected news has created a very complicated situation for the
government and people of Nigeria," it said.
</P>
<P>
"This is particularly so in the light of the courageous steps
that the new head of state, General Abdulsalam Abubakar, had
taken to advance the process toward Nigeria's return to
democracy," it said.
</P>
<P>
"Accordingly, the governments of the two countries have been
in urgent contact to address this new and grave situation."
</P>
<P>
The statement said the South African government was reassured
that the Nigerian government will take all necessary steps to
assure the Nigerian people and the international community of its
determination to promote the process of genuine democratization.
</P>
<P>
South Africa also appealed to the Nigerian people to respond
to the death of Abiola with restraint.
</P>
<P>
The statement said South Africa decided to mourn Abiola by
flying its national flag at half mast for seven days from July 9
to 15 at the Union Buildings in Pretoria, the seat of government.
</P>
<P>
It said that the move was taken as a token of the deep respect
of the South African government and its people for Abiola and as
an expression of its solidarity with the people of Nigeria at
this critical moment.
</P>
<P>
The statement said, as earlier agreed with the Nigerian
government, Mbeki Thursday would visit Nigeria where he would
also convey the condolences of the president, the government and
people of South Africa to the bereaved family.
</P>
<P>
The relations between South Africa and Nigeria have been
strained since 1995 when South African President Nelson Mandela
led the call for sanctions against the west African country
following the execution of activist Ken Saro Wiwa and a number of
other political prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Abiola died in custody Monday shortly before he was expected
to be released along with other political prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Abiola, who was believed to have won the 1993 presidential
election, was detained after late General Sani Abacha declared
the results of the election invalid.

<HEADLINE> French Leftwing Coalition Divided Over Fortune </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The French leftwing coalition is
divided over the reform of France's fortune tax, or ISF, as the
Communist Party has asked Prime Minister Lionel Jospin not to
yield to the pressure of the employers.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party has proposed extending the ISF to
professional properties, also called "labor tools," which cover
nearly all private enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The ISF is the abbreviation for Tax of Solidarity on Fortune.
But French employers said such a measure would harm France's
already heavily-taxed private enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The daily Le Monde said that the Socialist-led government is
expected not to extend the ISF to professional properties and has
made the promise to the country's employers' group, the CNPF.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Jospin also has hinted that he would not extend
the ISF to professional properties because France was experiencing
a period of economic growth and needed investment.
</P>
<P>
But the government is considering other measures, including
extending the tax to owners of art objects and forests, to
increase the income from the ISF to 15 billion francs (2.466
billion U.S. dollars) each year instead of the present 10 billion
francs (1.644 billion dollars), said Le Monde.
</P>
<P>
In a communique issued Wednesday, Communist Party National
Secretary Robert Hue called on Jospin not to yield to the pressure
of the CNPF.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Vehicles to Get New Plates: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- New plates will be installed to
all vehicles plying within the borders of Uganda and public
service vans will have special marks for identification, a
minister said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
John Nasasira, minister of works, housing and communication,
announced the changes at a function held at the Grand Imperial
Hotel here, Uganda News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The new changes are designed in order to identify thieves,
discourage molesting of passengers and to maximize revenue
collection, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The report said all vehicles will have their owners
identification numbers and the new regulations require vehicles
to be registered in one of the eight categories: central
government, local government and municipalities, private,
diplomatic, statutory corporations, duty free/tax exempt,
personalized and dealers plate.
</P>
<P>
Each of the eight categories will have a unique registration
plate with different background colors for the initials/letters
and a different arrangement of digits.
</P>
<P>
The minister also said there will be additional special round
plates for official vehicles of the vice president, the speaker,
the chief justice, the prime minister, cabinet ministers and some
of the members of parliament.
</P>
<P>
The new number plates will run concurrently with the old ones,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Taxis in Kampala had been ordered to have special marks
painted on the sides of the car for easy identification. This
time, they are ordered to put up special roof signs by the end of
the year.
</P>
<P>
The special marks on taxis had been protested by some of the
taxi owners who said the marks affect their business, while the
authorities said the marks are for the sake of management and
security of passengers.

<HEADLINE> PNA Asks Israel to Hand Over Palestinian Remains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The palestinian National
Authority (PNA) Wednesday asked Israel to hand over the remains of
hundreds of Palestinians who died in battles with Israel since the
1967 Middle East War.
</P>
<P>
The request was made in a letter sent Wednesday by Chief
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat to Israeli Cabinet Secretary
Danny Naveh, according to the Jerusalem Media and Communication
Center (JMCC), a Palestinian news service based in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of Palestinian families are seeking an end to their
long sufferings by demanding Israel return the bodies of their
beloved ones, the letter said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians claimed that Israeli army had buried the
bodies of the Palestinian victims and covered the their names
since 1967.
</P>
<P>
The letter said that the PNA decided to send the letter
because it was within the framework of the Article 28 of the
Interim Agreement, under which Israel pledged to help find the
missing Palestinians or their bodies.
</P>
<P>
Copies of the letter were also sent to the International
Committee of the Red Cross, the U.S. and European Union peace
envoys for the Middle East, the JMCC added.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique to Begin Recruitment Registration in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, July 8 (Xinhua) -- the Mozambican government will
start recruitment registration betweem August 1 and September 30
in a bid to "fill up the army to its full strength," Defense
Minister Aguiar Mazula announced here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Mazula said that the
registration will cost 500 million Metical (some 420,000 U.S.
Dollars) and all the youth aged between 18 and 23 years will be
registered without exception.
</P>
<P>
According to the statistics from the Mozambican Defense
Ministry, there are about 200,000 Mozambican youths at the ages
of military service.
</P>
<P>
Mazula reiterated that Mozambique needs a small-scale force
with high mobility and capability. Though small-sized, the troops
should be educated and able to use the modern technologies and
equipment, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that the size of the force would be decided by the
Mozambican Council of Ministers.
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are 12,000 troops in the Mozambican armed
forces. Under the peace agreement reached in 1992 by the
Mozambican government and the opposition Mozambican National
Resistance (Renamo), the government army should have a force of
30,000 troops.
</P>
<P>
He promised to provide proper payments for the new recruits
and to improve logistics and training conditions for them.
</P>
<P>
According to the Mozambique's military service law, the country's
military service system includes compulsory service of two years,
voluntary service of six years and over six years service to
train permanent carders.
</P>
<P>
The last recruitment registration was made six years ago.

MARSEILLE, France, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Soccer legend Pele said he

<HEADLINE> Contact Group Urges Immediate Cease-Fire in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Members of the six-nation Contact
Group Wednesday called for an immediate cease-fire in Kosovo to
pave the way for continuous dialogue on the future status of the
Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued after a meeting in Bonn which was held at
political-director level, the group said they would pursue the
cease-fire through immediate talks with both Belgrade and the
Kosovo Albanians.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed to seek a resolution of the U.N. Security
Council to press for this demand and others made by them,
including the call for safety guarantee for international
observers operating in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Should the required steps not be taken, the Contact Group would
consider further action under the United Nations Charter,
including military options, to bring about compliance by those who
block the process, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the Contact Group, comprising Britain, France,
Germany, Italy, Russia and the United States, also agreed to
recommend "basic elements" for a resolution of the question of
future status of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The plan, which is said to be an initiative of Germany and
France, would be worked out to suggest what sort of autonomy
Kosovo should enjoy and would be presented in a secret paper to
Belgrade and leaders of Kosovo Albanians, German Foreign Minister
Klaus Kinkel told a news conference after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of the population in
the Serbian province of Kosovo, are seeking independence from
Belgrade which stripped Kosovo of its autonomy in 1991. Hundreds
of people have died since last February, when armed conflicts
escalated tensions there into a crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Contact Group reiterated Wednesday that it supported
neither the maintenance of the status quo in Kosovo nor the Kosovo
Albanians' claims for independence.
</P>
<P>
However, a deep worry was clearly reflected in the group's
statement about the rising influence of the Kosovo Liberation Army
(KLA), a loosely-structured ethnic Albanian rebel group which is
fighting for Kosovo's independence.
</P>
<P>
"Whether we like or not, the KLA is now a factor on the ground,
apparently controlling at least 30 percent of the territory of
Kosovo. Therefore, it is our view that they have to be taken into
account either directly or indirectly," said U.S. envoy Richard
Gelbard at the news conference.
</P>
<P>
He also noted Washington was trying to involve KLA leaders in
the Kosovo peace process. "If they do not cooperate in the
process, it would be necessary to try to interrupt their ability
to sustain themselves through the full chain of supply," Gelbard
said.
</P>
<P>
Similar view was also voiced in the Contact Group statement,
which stressed that the Kosovo Albanian team to peace dialogues
must be fully representative of their community in order to speak
authoritatively.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the statement requested all countries to prevent the
supply of financial support, weapons or training for armed Kosovo
Albanian groups.

<HEADLINE> Khatami Phones Arafat to Show Support for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
Wednesday phoned Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to condemn
Israel's policy of judaizing Jerusalem and reiterate Tehran's
support for the Palestinian cause.
</P>
<P>
Khatami reaffirmed that Iran would continue its "unequivocal"
support for the Palestinian nation and their fight to establish
Jerusalem as its eternal capital, the official news agency IRNA
reported.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian leader wished the Palestinians success in their
struggles against Israel through the support of hundreds of
millions of Muslims worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Undersoring the importance of Islamic solidarity in solving the
Palestinian problem, Khatami renewed his call on the Organization
of the Islamic Conference (OIC) to hold an meeting of foreign
ministers to discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Arafat thanked Khatami for his efforts in
proposing the convention of OIC foreign ministers to address the
ministers to discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
On June 23, Khatami first called for holding a special meeting
of OIC foreign ministers to adopt a united stand against the
recent Israeli decision to expand the municipal boundaries of the
disputed holy city of Jerusalem by annexing several settlements in
the Palestinian territories of West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Soon after Israel approved the plan on June 21, Iran condemned
the decision as a measure to judaize Jerusalem, which is holy to
Muslims, Christians and Jews alike.
</P>
<P>
Khatami's phone call was made following the United Nations
General Assembly voted overwhelmingly Tuesday to upgrade the U.N.
status of the Palestine Liberation Organization from an observer
to that of virtual statehood.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian PM Meets OAU Ambassadors on Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles
Zenawi Wednesday held talks here with the Organization of African
Unity (OAU) ambassadors committee on the country's border dispute
with neighboring Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the Ethiopian Foreign Ministry said that in an
explanation that lasted for three and a half hours, Meles gave
"detailed and comprehensive" account of the genesis of the crisis
and relations between Ethiopia and Eritrea since 1991 when
Eritrea won its independence.
</P>
<P>
Meles said: "This country wishes to peacefully settle the crisis."
the Ethiopian News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He said, contrary to the claim by the Eritrean government, the
cause for the stand off between the two countries is not a
question of border demarcation and delimitation but that of an
invasion by the government in Asmara.
</P>
<P>
The ambassadors committee was set up with a fact finding
mission immediately after the peace initiative by the presidents
of Burkina Faso, Zimbabwe and Rwanda and the foreign minister of
Djibouti who shuttled between Addis Ababa and Asmara in June.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda announced last week to pull out of the ambassadors
committee.
</P>
<P>
The committee, chaired by Burkinese ambassador to Ethiopia,
has been to Asmara and will present a report to African leaders.
</P>
<P>
The border dispute between the two Horn of Africa countries
centered on a 400-square-kilometer triangle of rocky land which
both countries claim. The dispute turned violent early in May
when either side accused the other of invasion.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Calls for Foreign Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Zambia Wednesday called for foreign
assistance to enable it to achieve sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
Zambian Deputy Finance Minister Godfrey Simasiku made the
appeal at the Zambia-Netherlands annual consultative meeting held
here.
</P>
<P>
He said Zambia will not achieve a sustainable development with
the heavy debt burden, which now stands at seven billion U.S.
Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Sustainable growth and poverty reduction can only be achieved
in Zambia with a manageable debt burden, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Zambia's currency, Kwacha, depreciated dramatically in the
past several months due to the poor performance of the country's
mining industry and declining balance of payment support from
donors, said Simasiku.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands Ambassador to Zambia Karel de Beer called for
partnership between his country and Zambia in trade and
investment.
</P>
<P>
He said people in the Netherlands are willing to invest in
Zambia, depending on the way the Zambian economy moves forward.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said that the Netherlands is impressed with
Zambia's economic policies and pledged its continued assistance
to Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Inflation rate of Zambia has risen to 25.7 percent compared
with the annual 18.6 percent of last year.
</P>
<P>
The projected inflation rate of nine percent for this year has
suffered a setback with the high inflation rate.
</P>
<P>
The exchange rate of the country's currency has continued to
be low with Kwacha now standing at 1,952 against the U.S. Dollar
compared with 1,200 against the Dollar at the beginning of this
year.
</P>
<P>
Germany said last month it will not release its aid to Zambia
as it pledged until the Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM)
is privatized.
</P>
<P>
In May the donors pledged Zambia an aid of 530 million
Dollars.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Opens 5th Century Church to Tourists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's Queen Noor Wednesday
inaugurated the Petra Church which dated back to the 5th century,
in the ancient Nabataean city of Petra, some 262 kilometers
southwest of Amman.
</P>
<P>
The Petra city was used as a temporary fortress by some
nomadic Nabataean Arabs more than 2,000 years ago. Nabataean is
another name for the Bedouins who are an important part of the
Arabic people.
</P>
<P>
The official news agency quoted an archaeologist from the
United States as saying that the church was converted from a house
in the 5th century, some two centuries younger than the oldest
church in the world which is now widely believed to be at the
Dura-Europas area in Syria.
</P>
<P>
"Style and quality of the temple's elaborate floral friezes
and acanthus-laden limestone capitals suggest that the sanctuary
was constructed (as a house) by the end of the 1st century BC by
the Nabataeans and was (changed into church in the 5th century and
still) in use until the late Byzantine period," said Martha Sharp
Joukowsky from the Brown University in the U.S..
</P>
<P>
Other ancient materials found in the building contain a rich
cache of papyrus scrolls, a beautiful mosaic pavement and a
baptistery.
</P>
<P>
Altogether 152 papyrus scrolls were uncovered at the site in
1993. The scrolls constitute the largest group of written
material of antiquities ever found in Jordan. They are currently
being deciphered and have yielded a wealth of information
concerning the Byzantine period in this area, the agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The church's mosaic pavement includes depictions of native,
exotic animals as well as panels containing personifications of
four seasons, ocean and earth.
</P>
<P>
The church's baptistery, which was constructed in the middle
5th century, is also one of the largest and best preserved
baptisteries in the Near East region, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) began to
sponsor the excavation project of the Petra Church in October 1991
with an injection of 1 million U.S. dollars for the Jordanian
Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities. The ministry then trusted a
group of archaeologists from the Brown University with the job and
they started the excavation in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the Petra Church excavation project is to
enhance tourism in the Petra city, which is one of the most
popular sightseeing venues in the region.

<HEADLINE> 15 Puerto Rican Students Arrested During General </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Some 15 Puerto Rican students
were arrested early Wednesday as they ran through city streets,
shattering shop windows during a general strike against the sale
of the island telephone company.
</P>
<P>
About 500,000 workers, half of Puerto Rico's workforce, began
to strike on Tuesday in protesting Governor Pedro Rossello's 1.75
billion U.S. dollars deal to sell the state-owned Puerto Rico
Telephone Co. to a consortium led by U.S.-based GTE Corp, reports
from San Juan said.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of people rallied, singing, chanting and
waving the Puerto Rican flag. The strikers also tried to block
traffic in key areas. But they said they had no ties to the
arrested students.
</P>
<P>
Protesters tried to block workers from entering an Eli Lilly
and Co. pharmaceutical manufacturing plant in the eastern San Juan
suburb of Carolina early Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Strikers also blocked the entrance to Isla Grande Airport in
San Juan and set up barricades to try to block the entrance to the
Minillas center, a complex in central San Juan that is home to
several government agencies.
</P>
<P>
The telephone company sale is the centerpiece of a
privatization program by Rossello. The phone company lost its
monopoly on local telephone service with the passage of the 1996
Telecommunications Act and cannot compete with the private sector.
</P>
<P>
But the company's 6,000 workers, who began strike on June 18,
said the sale would endanger their jobs.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Exploring Possibility of No-fly Zone over Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The United States is
discussing with Cyprus the possibility of creating a "no-fly"
zone over the divided island as a way to reduce tensions between
the Greek and Turkish communities, U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The no-fly zone is one possibility that could be explored
but we have not made any determination on what the results
should be in terms of how we achieve this reduction in
tensions," Cohen told a joint news conference with visiting
Greek Defense Minister Akis Tsohatzopoulos.
</P>
<P>
He said the creation of a no-fly zone was one of various
mechanisms that he had discussed with his Greek counterpart
Tsohatzopoulos to reduce tensions between Greek Cypriots and
Turkish Cypriots, who have lived apart sine 1974 when Turkey
invaded and occupied the northern third of the island after a
Greece-backed coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The two parties have recently scrambled for control of the
island's air space and the Greek Cypriot government has planned
to deploy the Russian-built S-300 ground-to-air missiles with a
range of 145 km.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said he believed it would be "a mistake" for the Greek
Cypriots to deploy the S-300 air defense system, adding "that
would only add to tensions, rather than decrease them."
</P>
<P>
Tsohatzopoulos told the joint news conference that the
Greek Cypriot government had proposed demilitarizing the island,
including a phased Turkish withdrawal. If Turkey agreed,
"possibly one could envisage the non-installation of the S-300
system," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said if Turkey refused to accept a no-fly zone as part of
even a partial demilitarization, "it's very, very difficult for
the Cypriot government thereby to unilaterally move to
disarmament."
</P>
<P>
The Greek Cypriot government has planned to deploy the S-300
air defense system this Summer, but has postponed the delivery
from Russia until November, so that there would be more time for
a solution of the tensions.
</P>
<P>
The proposed no-fly zone is designed to deny control of
Byprus's air space to both Greece and Turkey without
introduction of the S-300 system.
</P>
<P>
Greece, which favors the idea of a no-fly zone, proposed that
NATO or the United Nations provide guarantees for some form of
radar or other monitoring to keep Turkish warplanes from
achieving air superiority.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Greece Urge Peaceful Solution for Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary William
Cohen and his Greek counterpart Akis Tsohatzopoulos Wednesday
urged a diplomatic rather than military solution to the crisis in
the Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"We think a diplomatic solution is the only viable solution for
the long-term stability of the region," Cohen said at a news
conference after meeting Tsohatzopoulos.
</P>
<P>
"We think a military option is the very last option," Cohen
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Cohen and Tsohatzopoulos met in Washington as diplomats from
six countries held talks in Bonn, Germany, to discuss efforts to
resolve the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
Members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), which
has threatened military intervention in Kosovo, agreed that they
would review a series of military options of "what might be
required in the most extreme case," said Cohen.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that any action taken by NATO should not be
construed as lending either "moral or military support" for those
ethnic Albanians who are seeking independence.
</P>
<P>
Tsohatzopoulos said his country does not support the principle
that minorities "in the name of human rights, through violent
action, dissolve existing borders or call into question existing
borders."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the two defense ministers also discussed several
options that might be explored to reduce tensions on the divided
island of Greece, including enforcing a no-fly zone over Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
However, Cohen indicated that they "have not made any
determination on what the results should be in terms of how we
achieve this reduction in tensions."

<HEADLINE> AIDZ Drug Could Slow Hepatitis Virus Damage of Liver </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 8 (Xinhua) -- A standard AIDZ drug 3TC
appears to slow liver damage caused by hepatitis B, according to
a study in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
The study, by the University of Hong Kong and involving 358
patients, found that after a year of treatment, signs of
inflammatory injury fell significantly in just over half of
those getting the medicine, compared with one-quarter of those
on dummy medication.
</P>
<P>
The drug, manufactured by Glaxo Wellcome and also known as
Lamivudine or Epivir, is one of several that block production of
an essential viral protein known as reverse transcriptase. Both
the AIDZ virus and hepatitis B use this enzyme.
</P>
<P>
The only established treatment, currently is interferon
alpha, which can cause flu-like side effects, but 3TC is easier
to take and may work better.
</P>
<P>
However a scientist from the University of Tokyo noted that
one year of treatment is sufficient enough to suggest that this
drug is effective, further study is needed.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Many of the environmental
programs agreed to by China and the U.S. recently in Beijing
reflect U.N. Environment Program's new areas of focus, UNEP
Executive Director Klaus Topfer said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It is also an important step forward for UNEP which stands
ready to assist in any way it can, he was quoted by a U.N.
spokesman here.
</P>
<P>
"I hope the two countries further share their experience with
UNEP to enable us to pass on this valuable information and
practices to other countries," Trofer said, adding that "other
countries should follow their example".
</P>
<P>
Trofer welcomes three of the initiatives which have particular
relevance to UNEP's work -- those covering issues related to
energy and cleaner production, freshwater and emergency
preparedness.
</P>
<P>
During U.S. President Bill Clinton's state visit to China from
June 25-July 3, the two countries agreed on joint programs to
address environmental degradation, cleaner use of energy and
climate change.
</P>
<P>
In addition, they agreed to expand cooperation in the areas of
health sciences and natural resource management, air quality and
land-use, preserving endangered species and natural disaster
reduction.

MAPUTO, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Salim Ahmed Salim, Secretary
General of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), arrived here
Wednesday evening for a three-day visit in Mozambique at the
invitation of Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano.
</P>
<P>
Salim told the reporters upon his arrival at the Maputo
Airport that he hopes to meet Chissano on the changes on the
African continent as well as conflict solution.
</P>
<P>
He will also exchange views with Mozambican officials on how
to implement the resolutions adopted by the 34th OAU summit held
in Burkina Faso, on the challenges facing Africa and their
solutions.
</P>
<P>
The OAU chief felt regretful that seeking solutions to
conflicts in Africa still remain to be priority.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, we still have to discuss these issues instead
of the development issues which I'd rather discuss," he said.
</P>
<P>
Salim is accompanied by his wife and Daniel Antonio, assistant
secretary general for OAU who is a Mozambican.

<P>
CAIRO, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- Jordan's shortage of potable water is expected to
reach about 107 million cubic meters, sources at the Jordanian
Ministry of Water and Irrigation said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Arabic-language daily Alam Al Yom reported Thursday that
Jordan actually needs 388 million cubic meters of potable water
while only 281 million cubic meters are available.
</P>
<P>
The paper added deficit of water for industrial purposes will
reach some 16 million cubic meters by the year 2000 when the
actual needs are estimated at 58 million cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Defense expenditures of the Gulf states constitute
a heavy burden on their budgets which largely depend on petroleum
exports, obstructing their economic development.
</P>
<P>
Economic and military experts were quoted as saying that member
states of the Gulf Cooperation Council have spent over 150 billion
U.S. dollars on defense since the 1990 Gulf crisis set off by
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The elite predicted that defense expenditures will remain high
in the coming years due to the instability in the region, which
has prompted an arms race.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- The Palestinian undersecretary of state for labor,
Hisham Antabawi, said that all arrangements were finalized for the
signing of an agreement with the international rehabilitation
center to dispatch 8,000 Palestinians to work in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
RAMALLAH -- Palestinians working in Israel so far this year
have risen to 55,000 from last year's 48,000, a survey released
Wednesday by the Palestinian Central Statistics Department said.
</P>
<P>
The number of those working in Israel this year accounted for
20.5 percent of Palestine's total labor force, up 4.4 percentage
points from last year, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
The survey said Palestinian workers are mainly engaged in
agriculture, mining, trade, services and construction.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Exports of Egypt's free trade zone have risen to 194
million dollars in the first six months of this year, with exports
to American markets increasing by 48 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Arabic-language newspaper Al Akhbar said Thursday the
exports of the free zone in June increased by 14 percent as
compared with the same month last year.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt is aiming to produce an average of 830,000
barrels per day of crude oil in the 1998-1999 fiscal year starting
July as output from mature fields is supplemented by new
discoveries, the Egyptian Gazette reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Oil ministry officials said that an initial daily output target
of 850,000 was lowered in line with a policy of reservoir
management or maintenance.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egyptian economy grew by 5.3-5.4 percent in the
1997-1998 fiscal year ending June, failing to meet the 5.7 percent
target, the Egyptian Gazette reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
But Economy Minister Youssef Boutros-Ghali said Wednesday that
earnings from tourism, which made up 4 percent of the gross
domestic product and 7 percent if economic activities indirectly
linked to it were taken into account, proved more "resilient" than
expected, with hotel occupancy has been now back to an average of
60 percent.

<HEADLINE> Pak Urges International Financial Institutions to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Thursday urged the
international financial institutions to activate their program and
project financing as it has met all its commitments with the
multilateral financial agencies.
</P>
<P>
The international financial institutions should honor their
commitments for program and project financing, irrespective of the
sanctions as the Pakistani government has met all its commitments
as per the program and its discussions with the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) mission in may 1998.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Sartaj Aziz made these remarks Thursday during
a joint press conference with IMF director Paul Chabrier, who is
here as head of an IMF fact-finding mission after the sanctions
against Pakistan for its detonation of nuclear devices at the end
of May.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said the IMF mission has come to consult with the
Pakistani government on the emerging scenario following the
imposition of sanctions and to determine the extent to which the
projections of balance of payments for 1998-99 fiscal year had
changed in light of these developments.
</P>
<P>
The government has informed the IMF mission that despite the
difficulties experienced more recently in June, and due to the
lack of programmed inflows, "we have met all the key quantitative
performance targets for end of the fiscal year 1997-98, except
that of foreign exchange reserves," Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
He said the mission has completed its analysis of the outlook
for the balance of payments on a monthly and quarterly basis for
1998-99 in the presence of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Aziz, however, said that due to lack of inflow of new program
assistance and the negative impact on private sector inflows, the
balance of payments position is expected to deteriorate
significantly in relation to the projections made in May by the
IMF mission.
</P>
<P>
"The government has strongly emphasized that this deterioration
is not due to any change in underlying fundamentals of the economy
which had, in fact, improved substantially in 1997-98, but due
primarily to 'exogenous'," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that suspension of inflow from the IMF as part of
the ESAF/EFF (Extended Structural Adjustment Facility/Extended
Fund Facility) will affect the balance of payments both directly
and indirectly as other multilateral agencies like the World Bank
and the Asian Development Bank have also linked their support to
the resumption of the program.
</P>
<P>
The IMF mission met with Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif Wednesday
in Lahore. They were informed of the circumstances that forced
Pakistan to conduct the nuclear blasts following the nuclear tests
by India which altered the balance of power in the region and
created a deep sense of insecurity in the Pakistani people.
</P>
<P>
According to Aziz, Sharif emphasized that "since Pakistan had
more than successfully implemented the program, it would only be
fair for donors to continue with the program."
</P>
<P>
Sharif noted that Pakistan acted in response to the action by
India and it was wrong that sanctions should be uniformly applied
on both countries which are likely to have an even greater adverse
impact on Pakistan in the short run.
</P>
<P>
According to Aziz, Sharif has written letters to heads of the
G-7 countries highlighting these concerns and emphasizing the need
for immediate restoration of support from the international
financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said the IMF mission led by Paul Chabrier has noted
Pakistan's concerns and has assured that it will fully inform the
representatives of the G-7 countries in the IMF Board of the major
financial crisis that is likely to occur in Pakistan due to the
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
"Unless the ESAF/EFF program is activated quickly, Pakistan
will be left with few options," said Aziz.
</P>
<P>
Chabrier is expected to brief the executive directors of the
G-7 countries next Monday in Washington.

<HEADLINE> Yangtze River Flood Peak Hits Chongqing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The southwestern city of
Chongqing has been put on alert against flooding since high water
levels on the Yangtze River hit it early this morning.
</P>
<P>
Water levels were the highest in 6 years, at 181.75 meters,
which was 1.75 meters above the danger line, at about 5:00
a.m. (Beijing time), according to the Hydrology Bureau of the
Upper Reaches of the Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
The flooding was caused by repeated torrential rains on
tributaries of the Yangtze along its upper reaches.
</P>
<P>
Flood control departments in Chongqing mobilized 66,000 people
to fight the flooding, using nearly 300 lifeboats, 660 trucks, and

ISLAMABAD, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's trade deficit stood at
1.53 billion U.S. dollars during the fiscal year of 1997-98 as

<HEADLINE> HK to Make Continued efforts to Tackle Unemployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The government of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region has called for sustained, concerted
and collective efforts in tackling unemployment and creating jobs.
</P>
<P>
This message came from the second meeting of the Task Force on
Employment convened here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Financial Secretary Donald Tsang said after chairing the
meeting that members of the task force are aware that as Hong Kong
is going through a difficult economic adjustment period,
unemployment will remain at a relatively high level for some time.
</P>
<P>
The current unemployment rate in Hong Kong is 4.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
There are no quick fixes to the problem short of the onset of
an economic recovery, the financial secretary said.
</P>
<P>
The task force members noted that the government had already
been implementing a number of proposals which tally with the major
views expressed such as bringing forward infrastructure projects,
strengthening employment services, improving training and
retraining services, creating jobs to clean up the environment,
and stepping up enforcement efforts against illegal employment,
according to Tsang.
</P>
<P>
The SAR government also informed the meeting that the
Vocational Training Council and the Employees Retraining Board
would launch in September a special seafarers training program for
 the unemployed which comprises 14 weeks' classroom training,
followed by an in-service training program on board a vessel, and
another nine weeks' in-service training.
</P>
<P>
The task force meeting also noted two other job creation areas,
one in a new tourism site and another in major repair and
maintenance works for non-estate aided schools.

</P>
<P>
Steps should be taken to prepare for even bigger floods in
northern China, and in coastal areas, preparations should be made

<HEADLINE> U.S. Agrees to Clean Up Toxic Wastes in Former Bases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The United States has reportedly
agreed to act and clean up the alleged toxic wastes its military
has left in the former bases in the Philippines, the official
Philippine News Agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A ranking official of the Philippine Department of Foreign
Affairs was quoted as saying the U.S. will shortly hire private
American companies with technical capabilities in toxic wastes
management to undertake the clean-up.
</P>
<P>
Focus of the toxic wastes issue involves the former U.S. Naval
Base in Subic, Zambales province, and the former Clark Airbase in
nearby Pampanga province.
</P>
<P>
Both Subic and Clark are now bustling economic zones to which
they have been converted since the U.S. military left in 1991 and
1992 respectively.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has never formally admitted it left toxic wastes
dumped in its former military bases in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Militant Filipino non-governmental organizations, however,
insisted the U.S. did and even got the services of two U.S.
environmental firms to undertake studies and determine the
existence of the toxic wastes.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. agreement to undertake the clean-up, the foreign
department official said, could have been based on the idea of
showcasing U.S. technology and capability in cleaning up toxic
wastes, and complying with the Rio Declaration calling for
military organizations to leave their abandoned bases as
environmentally friendly as possible.
</P>
<P>
The toxic wastes issue is expected to figure prominently in the
now ongoing annual meeting of the Philippine-U.S. Mutual Defense
Board in Manila.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Foreign Affairs Secretary Domingo Siazon earlier
admitted the Philippine panel to the talks, which includes him,
will raise the issue during their meetings.
</P>
<P>
The board meeting is likewise expected to discuss updates on
the pending Visiting Forces Agreement signed last year between the
two countries. The Philippine Senate has yet to ratify the
agreement.

by his Pakistani counterpart Iftakhar Murshid to Iran, Boroujerdi
said the teams will assess the situation in the war-torn country
and request the World Health Organization (WHO) and other states
to help.
</P>
<P>
The two countries' representatives to Afghanistan had listened
to views of Afghans in northern and southern parts of the country,
Boroujerdi said. He said that since both the Taliban and the
Northern United Front welcomed the peace efforts, Iran and
Pakistan decided to take further steps in this direction.
</P>
<P>
The pro-Islamic Taliban regime came to power after its militia
captured the capital Kabul in September 1996, and now controls
most parts of the country. Its first direct talks with the
guerrilla alliance which controls the north broke down in April in
Islamabad due to wide differences.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban is said to be backed by Pakistan while the ousted
government of President Burhanuddin Rabbani retains Iran's support
and recognition.
</P>
<P>
For his part, the Pakistani official said both sides put
emphasis on continued joint efforts to resolve the Afghan crisis,
adding it is a sign of encouragement to see that the warring
factions are interested in restoring a just peace to the country.
</P>
<P>
Murshid said it is in the interests of both Iran and Pakistan,
and is also their common strategy, to bring various Afghan
factions to the negotiating table and forge a lasting peace.
</P>
<P>
Terming his talks with Iranians officials "constructive,"
Murshid said that what Iran and Pakistan are doing is not
intervention in affairs of a third country, but rather in harmony
with those of the United Nations and the Organization of the
Islamic Conference.
</P>
<P>
Murshid arrived here Wednesday morning and held talks with
Boroujerdi and Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi on
continuing joint efforts to advance the stalled Afghan peace
process.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Discusses Civil Service Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's heads of ministries
Thursday held a one-day workshop to discuss the framework for the
second phase of the public service reform program (1998-2000) in
Harare.
</P>
<P>
Public Service, Labor and Welfare Minister Florence Chitauro
made a key address on the reform.
</P>
<P>
She said, ''it now remains your duty and function to mobilize
all resources at your disposal and focus on the three reform
components, namely, focusing on core business, ensuring
efficiency and effectiveness throughout the service and capacity
building.''
</P>
<P>
Chitauro said focusing the public service on its core business
was a prerequisite for the reduction of government expenditure.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the second phase of the reforms at least 33,000
civil service posts would have been abolished, she said.
</P>
<P>
the restructuring of the public service started with the
voluntary retirement exercise that ended in 1995 and saw over
23,000 posts abolished.
</P>
<P>
Chitauro said restructuring was ''necessary'' and
''imperative'' as the role of the government in the provision and
delivery of services continued to be reduced.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are about 170,000 civil service posts in
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The minister said, ''the restructuring of the public service
and its focus on core business will lead to acceleration of
growth and investment, economic empowerment through
indigenization, reducing levels of unemployment and ensuring
sustainable growth.''
</P>
<P>
She urged the heads of ministries to be conversant with the
objectives of the second phase of the public service reforms so
as to map out the reform process.

<HEADLINE> Yangtze River's Water Levels to Remain High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Water levels in the middle and
lower reaches of the Yangtze River will remain high for some time
to come because of flooding in the upper reaches, China's State
Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters reports.
</P>
<P>
It says that dyke patrols along the Yangtze River need to be
increased and rescue crews need to be ready for possible breaches.
</P>
<P>
Water in the middle and lower reaches reached warning levels
after torrential rainfall hit southern and eastern China from June
12 on.
</P>
<P>
Almost 2 million people have been mobilized to fight the
flooding, which has not yet caused major damage to the
dykes. Water levels in the middle and upper reaches started going
down a couple of days ago, but the rate is slowing down because of
more flooding in the upper reaches of the Yangtze, which is now
flowing at a rate of 48,600 cubic meters per second.
</P>
<P>
Flooding in the upper reaches will not add to the flooding in
the middle and lower reaches now, but it will slow the decline in
floodwaters later, the headquarters says.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Govt Policies Passed in Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Prime Minister Girija
Prasad Koirala comfortably won the first battle against his rivals
Thursday when the Lower House of Parliament voted 95-64 for the
programs and policies presented by his government for the 1998/99
fiscal year which begins in mid-July.
</P>
<P>
For the passage of the programs and policies, a simple majority
over the negative votes is needed in the house.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition Communist Party of Nepal (United
Marxism-Leninism, CPN-UML), which helped the government win the
vote of confidence in April, voted against the programs and
policies.
</P>
<P>
It accused the government of failing to solve the problems of
the people at the opening session on June 28 and indicated that it
might withdraw its support.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party of Nepal (Marxism-Leninism, CPN-ML), the
second largest opposition in parliament, boycotted the house
session as per the understanding it reached with the ruling Nepali
Congress (NC) Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Kathmandu Post said Thursday that under the understanding,
the CPN-ML should boycott the house proceedings Thursday to clear
the way for the NC government to obtain a majority of votes for
its programs and policies.
</P>
<P>
And the CPN-ML will join the government after the passage of
the budget for the coming fiscal year to be presented to
parliament Friday.
</P>
<P>
Both the CPN-UML and the CPN-ML have criticized the government
programs, saying that they fail to initiate any new measures of
national development.
</P>
<P>
The programs and policies, presented to parliament on July 1
through King Birendra, give priority to human resource development
and poverty eradication by attaining a high rate of economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
Koirala resigned on July 10, 1994 after failing to get his
government programs and policies passed in parliament.
</P>
<P>
In reply to queries by MPs prior to the voting, Prime Minister
Koirala said that Nepal's border with India will be systematized
and even one inch of land will not be lost to India.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties have been demanding the government to
initiate measures for the immediate withdrawal of Indian army from
Kalapani in far-western Nepal.
</P>
<P>
Koirala said that he will talk with Bhutanese King Jigme Singye
Wangchuck and Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee over the
refugee issue on the sidelines of the 10th Summit of the South
Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) to be held late
this month in Colombo, Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
He said that if India again refuses to mediate in the issue,
his country will internationalize it.
</P>
<P>
About 100,000 Bhutanese refugees are staying in eastern Nepal
in eight U.N.-run camps after being forced to flee Bhutan in 1989
and early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Seven rounds of ministerial talks between the two Himalayan
kingdoms have failed to produce any result. And India has refused
to get involved in the matter, saying it is a bilateral issue.
</P>
<P>
More grave challenges lie ahead for Koirala as a simple
majority of 103 votes is needed in the 205-seat Lower House for
the passage of the new budget.
</P>
<P>
But there will be no problem if the CPN-ML, which has 40 seats
in the house, throws its weight behind Koirala, whose NC party
holds 88 seats in the house.
</P>
<P>
At press time, the Upper House is still debating on the
policies and programs. But there is no doubt that they will get
passed as the Nepali Congress dominates the Upper House.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Team Leaves for Talks in Washington </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 9 (Xinhua) -- A Palestinian delegation left
Thursday for Washington for talks with U.S. officials on the
stalled Middle East peace process, according to the Voice of
Palestine (VOP).
</P>
<P>
The delegation was led by care-taker ministers of the Local
Government Saeb Erekat and Planning and International Cooperation
Nabil Sha'ath. They will talk with U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, VOP added.
</P>
<P>
The delegation's visit came upon a request from Albright, who
made a telephone call Wednesday night to Yasser Arafat, chairman
of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA), it said.
</P>
<P>
During her phone call, Albright promised to Arafat that the
U.S. Administration is sticking to its initiative of peace, the
radio added.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. initiative calls for Israeli withdrawal from 13.1
percent more of the West Bank during its second stage
redeployment. The PNA has in principle accepted this formula,
which has so far been kept secret by Washington.
</P>
<P>
Israel, which still refuses to accept this proposal, repeated
on Wednesday that it could decide on this matter only after the
PNA fulfills its obligations under the signed peace accords.
</P>
<P>
Israel's demands include annulment of the anti-Israel articles
of the Palestinian Covenant by the Palestinian National Council,
handover of suspected Palestinian assailants for trial in Israel
and a halt to anti-Israeli incitement in the Palestinian
media.

<HEADLINE> Blair Fails to Resolve Orange March Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Talks between British Prime Minister
Tony Blair and senior Northern Ireland Orangemen failed Thursday
to achieve a breakthrough in a tense five-day stand-off in
Portadown, west of Belfast.
</P>
<P>
Protestant leaders refused to back down from their insistence
that Orange Order members be allowed to parade their traditional
route through a Roman Catholic housing estate in the town.
</P>
<P>
The growing sectarian tension has prompted concern that the
implementation of the April 10 peace pact could be jeopardized as
political aspirations for peace are clouded by the continuing
unrest.
</P>
<P>
Calling it a "very difficult situation", a Downing Street
spokesman, however, said after the meeting that the prime minister
welcomed the efforts of the Orange leaders to "keep the
temperature down".
</P>
<P>
"The prime minister is determined to keep talking and promote a
dialogue in a very difficult situation, but we are not in a
position to reverse the decision," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
For their part, the Orangemen representatives said they would
go back to Northern Ireland and inform their "brethren" of the
talks.
</P>
<P>
The Orangemen said they would keep up their protest near
Garvaghy Road until they were allowed to complete their march
along the route they have used for nearly 200 years.
</P>
<P>
The parade traditionally uses the route of Garvaghy Road area
but was banned this year by the independent Parades Commission,
and the security forces have mounted a massive operation to keep
protesters out, leading to a stand-off with the Orangemen.
</P>
<P>
The stand-off has sparked widespread street violence in
Northern Ireland for the past four nights, especially in Belfast.
Already there have been 437 attacks on police including 12
shootings and 25 bomb attacks.
</P>
<P>
Police has warned people not to travel unless it was
essential.

<HEADLINE> China Opens More Sectors for Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 9 (Xinhua) -- In the wake of the Asian financial
crisis, China has decided to allow foreign businesses to invest
in some sectors that were traditionally restricted like internal
trade and telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
China needs to adapt its foreign capital utilization to changes
both inside and outside the country, He Ju, vice-minister of
the State Development Planning Commission's foreign capital
utilization department, told a conference on China's foreign
investment policies for development zones.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government will develop measures to encourage
foreign investment in the following areas:
</P>
<P>
- The service sector, which is expected to be a new attraction
to foreign investors in internal trade, tourism, accounting, legal
affairs, air transportation, finance, and telecommunications;
</P>
<P>
- Large and medium-sized state enterprises and private
businesses;
</P>
<P>
- Large state enterprises for investment by multinationals and
Sino-foreign projects involving advanced technology where a larger
market share may be given to foreign partners;
</P>
<P>
- Central and western parts of China are places for more
foreign investment, where the central government's policy is to
give priority to foreign capital especially in backbone industries
and state projects; for restricted projects, the proportion of
foreign ownership can be larger than in coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation, by the end of May, China had approved 312,174
foreign-funded businesses, with 236.7 billion U.S. dollars worth
of actual foreign investment. Most of the over 100,000
foreign-funded enterprises that have started doing business are in
good shape and showing a profit.

<HEADLINE> SADC Members Agree to Implement Trade Protocol </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The 12th meeting of ministers of
trade and industry of the Southern African Development Community
(SADC) has worked out a plan of implementing the trade protocol
among member nations.
</P>
<P>
At the two-day meeting closed in Luanda Wednesday, the
ministers discussed issues concerning the implementation of the
protocol in a bid to facilitate their bilateral trade.
</P>
<P>
Under the trade protocol, tariff barriers will be gradually
removed within eight years in SADC so as to increase trade among
its members.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government asked to be granted another four years
of grace for the total removal of tariff barriers on the ground
that it is disadvantaged in trade competitiveness because of the
prolonged civil war in the country.
</P>
<P>
The proposal made by Angola has been agreed upon by the
representatives of other SADC member states.
</P>
<P>
It was decided at the meeting that Angola should, with the
assistance of the SADC Executive Secretariat, look into the
impact of the implementation of the trade protocol upon the
war-ravaged country and submit a list of products qualified for
trade liberalization. Angola can only sign on the protocol when
all these have been done.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that all the SADC members but Angola have
signed on the trade pact.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, it was also agreed that all the member state
should do more to train their own trade personnel and improve
their negotiating skills in the international trade.
</P>
<P>
SADC has 13 members -- Angola, Namibia, Lesotho, Mauritius,
Mozambique, Swaziland, Malawi, South Africa, Zambia, Zimbabwe,
Tanzania, Botswana and the Democratic Republic of Congo.

<HEADLINE> COMESA Looking for $300M to Build Telecom Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The Common Market of Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA) is scouting for 300 million U.S. Dollars
to build a telecommunications network that will link all member
states via digital terrestrial network and satellite system.
</P>
<P>
The private liability company to be known as Comtel will be
established with the national telecommunications operators as
shareholders and private sector including institutional investors
on a build-operate-transfer basis, the Times of Zambia paper
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The need to invite private sector financiers within and
outside the project countries will help in mobilizing the
required investment funds through either equity or debt
financing, according to a final communique of the recent COMESA
meeting of the Council of Ministers held in late June in
Kinshasa, capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
The investment initially estimated at 273 million U.S. Dollars
over a period of five years is billed as profitable as it is
expected to raise at least 59 percent internal rate of returns
and net present value of 660 million U.S. Dollars at 10 percent
for the initial five years.
</P>
<P>
In the design of the project, the network will be built on
existing infrastructure through new transmission routes and the
transit centers have been specified for Zambian capital of
Lusaka, Kenyan capital of Nairobi, Ethiopian capital of Addis
Ababa and Johannesburg in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
These centers will be modified to accommodate the volume of
traffic expected as the interconnectivity project will mainly use
the Asynchronous Transfer Mode technology.
</P>
<P>
The realization of Comtel will provide a reliable and
homogeneous network across the region and this will eliminate the
current practice of transmitting through third countries (in most
cases Europe and the United States), resulting in substantial
reduction in communication cost, said the paper.

WASHINGTON, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Thursday:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times
</P>
<P>
-- Nigeria's military ruler agreed to allow outside experts
to take part in the autopsy on the opposition leader Moshood K.
O. Abiola and spoke in vague terms of moving the country toward
democracy. His statements were intended to soothe public anger
after Abiola's sudden death.
</P>
<P>
-- Japan's Prime Minister Hashimoto promised long-term tax cuts
beginning next year, but he gave no details about how the move
might help Japan's sagging economy. Hashimoto's promise seemed
aimed at winning support from Washington and Japanese voters, who
go to the polls on Sunday to choose members of the upper house of
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post
</P>
<P>
-- In the 100 years since the United States claimed Puerto Rico
as spoils of the Spanish-American War, islanders have wrestled
with the ambiguity of their political status -- adrift between two
cultures, not entirely comfortable with either. Nowhere has this
identity crisis been more starkly drawn than in a general strike
Tuesday and today to protest the sale of the state-owned Puerto
Rico Telephone Co.
</P>
<P>
-- Dow Corning Corp. has agreed to pay 3.2 billion U.S. dollars
to settle claims of about 170,000 women who say their silicone
breast implants made them sick. If the proposed settlement is
approved, individual women could receive from 12,000 dollars to
60,000 dollars apiece. In addition, the company would pay 5,000
dollars to women demanding surgery to remove their implants, and
25,000 dollars to compensate women whose implants had ruptured.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. and five allies demanded an immediate cease-fire
in Kosovo and called on governments to stop the flow of funds to
ethnic Albanian rebels. Meanwhile, Serb forces mounted an offensive
on the Albanian border near the village of Morina, killing six.
Four NATO warships visited Albania's port of Durres in a fresh
show of strength.

<HEADLINE> UNEP Praises Environ. Progress at Sino-U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The Nairobi-based United Nations
Environment Program (UNEP) Thursday spoke highly of the
achievements made at last week's historic Sino-U.S. summit on the
global environment.
</P>
<P>
"The agreements reached in Beijing should send a positive
signal of environmental cooperation around the world... This is
the direction to go, and other countries should follow their
example," UNEP Executive Director Klaus Topfer told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
China and the U.S. have reached agreements on fighting
environmental degradation, preserving endangered species,
emergency preparedness, fresh water and marine resources
conservation and natural disaster reduction.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have also decided to expand cooperation in
the areas of health sciences and natural resources management and
signed special pacts on air quality and land use, said the UNEP
executive director.
</P>
<P>
Many of the programs agreed to by Chinese President Jiang
Zemin and his U.S. counterpart Bill Clinton "reflect UNEP's new
areas of concentration," said Topfer.
</P>
<P>
He said that UNEP is strengthening its work related to cleaner
production and its capacity to deal with the
environmentally-sound management of fresh water resources.
</P>
<P>
"These two issues are clearly a high priority for China and
the U.S., and also for UNEP," he said.
</P>
<P>
The UNEP boss made the remarks after holding talks with Xia
Kunbao, Chinese Deputy Permanent Representative to UNEP, and U.S.
Permanent Representative Allen Latimer respectively at the UNEP
headquarters here earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
"Combining economic growth with environmental caution is our
main responsibility, and in this regard, UNEP welcomes the
positive steps in this direction announced (in Beijing) last
week," he said.
</P>
<P>
UNEP plays a leading role worldwide in monitoring and
assessing existing and emerging environmental problems, alerting
policy makers and the public and coordinating efforts to tackle
them.

of large state-owned enterprises and state-controlled
share-holding enterprises directly under the State Council's

<HEADLINE> Mozambican Minister on Intervention in G. Bissau </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, July 9 (Xinhua) -- It is too early for Mozambique to
send intervention troops to Guinea Bissau before the
international diplomatic mediation comes to an end, Mozambican
Defense Minister Aguiar Mazula has said.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's Noticias newspaper quoted the defense minister as
saying that "we are not in position to send a contingent in
response to the call for resolving the regional conflict" because
registration of recruits has just started in Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
Under the peace agreement reached by the parties concerned in
1992, the Mozambican armed forces should have a total number of
30,000 troops. For various reasons, they currently have only
12,000 soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Mazula was referring to the remarks made by Guinean Bissau
President Joao Vieira who blamed Portuguese-speaking countries in
Africa for failure to send troops to intervene in his nation.
</P>
<P>
"It may not be fit for Mozambique to intervene without the
support of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the United
Nations before the efforts by the countries neighboring Guinea
Bissau comes to an end," Mazula said in Maputo Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The defense minister disclosed that the issue must be
addressed at the summit of the Portuguese-speaking nations to be
held in Cape Verde next week.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the OAU has discussed the Guinea Bissau crisis
and decided that the issue should be resolved through talks by
the nations of that region as the crisis is still within regional
scale.
</P>
<P>
Guinea and Senegal have sent some 2,000 troops to help the
Vieira Government's efforts to end the revolt led by former Army
Chief of Staff Amsumane Mane which broke out a month ago.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the pro-government Noticias said in an editorial
Wednesday that it is inappropriate for President Vieira to blame
the five Portuguese-speaking nations in Africa for their failure
to act to end the conflict in the tiny west African country.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Starts Listing People to Be Resettled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government has
started identifying the first batch of people to be resettled
soon on 12 farms now serviced for resettlement while another 14
are in the pipeline.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Land Acquisition Committee Joseph Msika told
the daily Herald paper Wednesday that the process to identify
the people follows a government order last month to chiefs,
head men and provincial administrators.
</P>
<P>
The decree demanded they should immediately start compiling
lists of those who required to be resettled in their areas.
</P>
<P>
Although the number of people identified so far is not
immediately available, about 183 families are expected to be
resettled on the 12 farms, which cover a combined area of 16,035
hectares, Msika said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the ongoing exercise to identify the people
would see more villagers being resettled on 14 other farms that
would soon be ready.
</P>
<P>
The exercise was being speeded up following the invasion of
commercial farms last month by the angry landless peasants bitter
about government's delay in resettling them.
</P>
<P>
These peasants had threatened to grab the farms if they were
not resettled by September.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean government has frequently said only full-time
skilled farmers will be resettled to ensure that agricultural
production is enhanced.
</P>
<P>
During the first resettlement exercise in the 1980s, the
government was criticized for resettling farmers without skills
on the farms which the villagers could not use fully, the paper
said.

<HEADLINE> China's Busy Hotline For Complaints Against Prosecutors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 9 (Xinhua) - A complaint hotline to handle
citizen's complaints about prosecutors that was opened by China's
Supreme People's Procuratorate on May 28 has been receiving over
50 calls a day.
</P>
<P>
China's procurators have been criticised by delegates to the
National People's Congress and the new Procurator-General Han
Zhubin has been making an effort to improve methods at the
thousands of offices, and the hotline to handle the public's
reports of misconduct by prosecutors has been a part of this.
</P>
<P>
According to Yao Shigen, an official at the hotline center,
nearly 600 of the complaints have concerned prosecutors' and
procuratorates' misdeeds like failing to return illegally obtained
assets, seeking personal profit from official duties and detaining
suspects for long periods of time.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme People's Procuratorate has ordered provincial
procuratorates to respond to each case and to deal with the
problems, Yao says.
</P>
<P>
The other complaints are against law enforcement offices and
administrative agencies and some have given evidence of
corruption, while others have sought advise on legal matters.
</P>
<P>
"All calls will be handled properly and considered for further
investigation by related departments," Yao promises.

<HEADLINE> EU Needs Stronger Anti-Hooligan Measures in Euro 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 9 (Xinhua) -- European Union countries should take
stronger measure to curb the spread of hooliganism in the two years
leading to the European championship in 2000, a FIFA security
specialist said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"It is absolutely true that we may face the same problems as here
in France," said Horst Schmidt of Germany, who is in charge of
security in FIFA's World Cup organizing committee.
</P>
<P>
"European Union should be involved in this matter more than ever in
the past, not only in ticketing affairs, but also in security
affairs," he added.
</P>
<P>
"We have to find new solutions, new ways of co-operation," Schmidt
told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
The European championship in 2000 will be co-hosted by the
Netherlands and Belgium.
</P>
<P>
Two months ago, European Union had exerted pressures on the French
World Cup Organizing Committee, forcing the latter to open ticket sale
hotlines for distribution of match tickets.
</P>
<P>
Schmidt, who has years of experiences in the security relating to
soccer, said there is a tendency of the internationalization of the
hooliganism.
</P>
<P>
"Looking into future, I believe hooliganism will become an
international movement. I have signals that hooligans try to organize
themselves not only on a national basis," said Schimidt.
</P>
<P>
But he said the riots in Marseille and in Lens had totally
different origins.
</P>
<P>
In Marseille the ticketless English fans rioted against rival
supporters while in Lens, it was the neo-Nazist German hooligans
taking on the French police, he said.
</P>
<P>
"These German hooligans have nothing to do with football," said
Schmidt, who was also General Secretary of the German Football
Federation.
</P>
<P>
"In the past ten years we have tried to fight this problem but
without success," he said.
</P>
<P>
French gendarme was beaten into coma by iron bar-wielding German
hooligans in Lens on June 21.
</P>
<P>
Schmidt insisted despite these troubles security in the stada was
generally good.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Provide Sudan Credit Facilities for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia has agreed in
principal to provide credit facilities to Sudan to buy Malaysian
palm oil under the Palm Oil Credit Payment Arrangement (POCPA),
Malaysian Primary Industries Minister Lim Keng Yaik said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The amount of credit has yet to be determined, but it could be
between 50 million to 70 million U.S. dollars either in Sudanese
currency or in Malaysian ringgit, he told reporters after meeting
Sudanese Foreign Minister Mustafa Osman Ismail at his office here.
</P>
<P>
A final agreement will be signed soon, after approval from the
cabinet, Lim said. Under the agreement, Malaysia will grant Sudan
a two-year period of deferred payment for all palm oil imported
from Malaysia, and this meant that Sudan will make the first
payment after two years of the first import (of palm oil) as
agreed under the new arrangement.
</P>
<P>
Lim hoped the credit facility would take effect within the next
two to three months.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia and Sudan have already agreed on the bilateral payment
arrangement between the two countries' central banks.
</P>
<P>
Sudan is one of the net importer of Malaysian palm oil,
importing about 40,000 to 50,000 tons of palm oil per annum.
</P>
<P>
With the new arrangement, Lim said he hoped the republic would
buy more Malaysian palm oil.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia has already provided POCPA credit facilities to six
countries -- Pakistan, Algeria, Iran, Myanmar, Iraq and Cuba --
with credit facilities worth almost 300 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the cash term payment, Lim said he also raised
another method of credit payment which is via counter-trade with
Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Sudan, as a producer of groundnut oil and sesame seeds oil,
could make payment to Malaysia with the commodities and Malaysia
in turn could export the commodities to third countries, Lim said.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese foreign minister arrived here Monday for a
five-day visit to Malaysia.

BEIJING, July 9 (Xinhua) -- China Central Television (CCTV)
plans to begin broadcasting live coverage of civil lawsuits on
July 11 with a court case involving a suit over an alleged film
copyright violation.
</P>
<P>
It will be broadcast Saturday morning from Beijing's No.1
Intermediate People's Court.
</P>
<P>
Ten major Chinese film studios are suing the Beijing Tiandu
Film Copyright Agency Center, the Tianjin Taida Audio and Video
Distribution Center, and the Zhongying Audio and Visual Publishing
House for 27 instances of copyright violation.
</P>
<P>
The open trial is considered a basic part of China's legal
system and citizens are allowed to be present at cases that do not
involve confidential state matters and certain other cases.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing No.1 Intermediate People's Court became the first
intermediate court in China to allow Chinese citizens 18 or older
to be present at open trials when it began the practice on June 10.
</P>
<P>
CCTV will invite experts and scholars to its studio to discuss
laws on intellectual property rights protection with the audience

<P>
Experts say that the broadcast will help increase people's
awareness of the law and and will put the nation's courts under
greater media scrutiny.

<P>
BRUSSELS, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The European Union has pledged 3.5
million ECUs (3.86 million U.S. dollars) in funding to facilitate
technical innovations in European small and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs).
</P>
<P>
The money will be channelled into the enterprises in the form of
the I-TEC2 extension program, the European Commission, executive
arm of the 15-member bloc, announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The body has promised 250 million ECUs (275 million dollars)
since last July for early stage investment in the SMEs via a
program, known as I-TEC, or Innovation and Technology Equity
Capital.
</P>
<P>
Edith Cresson, European Commissioner responsible for research
and innovation, said the funding is expected to encourage venture
capital investment into technologically-innovative enterprises
which lack private capital.
</P>
<P>
The I-TEC2 extension, like I-TEC, is run by the European
Commission in collaboration with the European Investment Fund and
is expected to entice more venture capital operators into the
programs.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh and Thailand signed here
Thursday an extradition treaty to enable the handover of criminals
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The treaty was signed by Bangladeshi State Minister for Foreign
Affairs Abul Hasan Chowdhury and Thai Deputy Foreign Minister
Sukhumbhand Paribatra, who arrived here Wednesday on a three-day
visit.
</P>
<P>
This is the first treaty of its kind this South Asian nation
has signed with a foreign country.
</P>
<P>
Under the treaty, Thailand would extradite Major Bazlul Huda,
one of the accused in the murder case of Sheikh Mujib Rahman --
Bangladesh's first prime minister after independence in 1971, who
was assassinated in 1975. Huda has been detained in a Thai jail.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the treaty was a "historic event," said
Bangladeshi Foreign Minister Abdus Samad Azad. "We would look
forward" to further cooperation with Thailand in other fields for
mutual benefit, he added.
</P>
<P>
For his part, the Thai deputy foreign minister said, "This is
the beginning of cooperation between Thailand and Bangladesh in
combating certain criminal activities like narcotics and child
prostitution."
</P>
<P>
Bangladeshi would try to negotiate similar treaties with other
countries, Home Minister Rafiqul Islam said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also exchanged notes on the avoidance of double
taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion regarding taxes on
income between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Mozambican Minister on Intervention in G. Bissau </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, July 9 (Xinhua) -- It is too early for Mozambique to
send intervention troops to Guinea Bissau before the
international diplomatic mediation comes to an end, Mozambican
Defense Minister Aguiar Mazula has said.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's Noticias newspaper quoted the defense minister as
saying that "we are not in position to send a contingent in
response to the call for resolving the regional conflict" because
registration of recruits has just started in Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
Under the peace agreement reached by the parties concerned in
1992, the Mozambican armed forces should have a total number of
30,000 troops. For various reasons, they currently have only
12,000 soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Mazula was referring to the remarks made by Guinean Bissau
President Joao Vieira who blamed Portuguese-speaking countries in
Africa for failure to send troops to intervene in his nation.
</P>
<P>
"It may not be fit for Mozambique to intervene without the
support of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the United
Nations before the efforts by the countries neighboring Guinea
Bissau comes to an end," Mazula said in Maputo Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The defense minister disclosed that the issue must be
addressed at the summit of the Portuguese-speaking nations to be
held in Cape Verde next week.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the OAU has discussed the Guinea Bissau crisis
and decided that the issue should be resolved through talks by
the nations of that region as the crisis is still within regional
scale.
</P>
<P>
Guinea and Senegal have sent some 2,000 troops to help the
Vieira Government's efforts to end the revolt led by former Army
Chief of Staff Amsumane Mane which broke out a month ago.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the pro-government Noticias said in an editorial
Wednesday that it is inappropriate for President Vieira to blame
the five Portuguese-speaking nations in Africa for their failure
to act to end the conflict in the tiny west African country.

<HEADLINE> No Security Threat to Warrant India's Nuclear Tests: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 9 (Xinhua) -- There was "nothing extraordinary"
in the security environment in South Asia to warrant India's
nuclear tests in May, said Russian Ambassador to India Albert S.
Chernyshev.
</P>
<P>
"all countries have security concerns but we should take into
consideration whether these concerns are to be defended by a
nuclear weapon or not," said Chernyshev said in an exclusive
interview with the Pioneer daily Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We can imagine that the moon will fall on the earth tomorrow.
But that is not the reality. The concerns should be balanced and
correspond to reality," added Chernyshev.
</P>
<P>
While Indian politicians were talking about a China threat,
"the situation was never like China preparing to attack India,"
the Russian diplomat pointed out in the interview published here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He described the so-called China's assistance to Pakistan in
the areas of nuclear and missile technology as rumors, saying that
there were similar "rumors" about Western powers helping India to
develop its nuclear technology.
</P>
<P>
Chernyshev called on India to immediately begin negotiations on
the question of entering the non-proliferation regimes and sign
the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT).
</P>
<P>
"You can criticize the NPT and the CTBT, but it is the maximum
as 150 countries have agreed to it," Chernyshev said.
</P>
<P>
Russia has consistently avoided a harsh criticism of India's
nuclear tests and defense cooperation between the two traditional
allies seemed to have been enhanced amid condemnations and
sanctions by the international community against India for the
nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have finalized a new 10-year defense
cooperation pact which will add punch to India's air and sea
defenses and give India its first anti-missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Ambassador confirmed that Russian President Boris
Yeltsin is scheduled to visit New Delhi in December this year,
during which the two countries are expected to sign a declaration
of strategic partnership.

HARARE, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's second cellular
telephone network, Telecel Zimbabwe, went into operation
Wednesday, benefiting people of the capital Harare, the media
here reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Telecel Zimbabwe declared it would invest about 60 million
U.S. Dollars over the next 10 years in a bid to make
communication in the country cheaper and more affordable.
</P>
<P>
Telecel Zimbabwe, as an indigenous community-driven company,
intends to take advantage of the technological revolution to bring
telecommunication services to some of the remote areas, thereby
enhancing both economic and social development of communities.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the company has set up five base stations and
subscribers can enjoy coverage in the Harare city center and its
peripherals, with eight more under construction and expected to
go live before late July to ensure a complete coverage of harare.
</P>
<P>
Launching the network's operations, Minister of Information,
Posts and Telecommunications Chen Chimutengwende said it was
pleasant to note that indigenous people were beginning to take an
active part in communications, a field in which the state-run
Post and Telecommunication Company has had a monopoly for a long
time.

<HEADLINE> China to Enforce Anti-Dumping Measures on Newsprint From Canada, ROK, U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) announced here today that China will
take temporary anti-dumping measures against newsprint originated
from Canada, the Republic of Korea and the United States beginning
on July 10.
</P>
<P>
MOFTEC officially began investigating cases involving the
alleged dumping of newsprint from these countries on December 10,
1997, in accordance with China's anti-dumping and anti-subsidy
regulations.
</P>
<P>
MOFTEC and the General Administration of Customs has been
investigating dumping and the extent of dumping activities since
then, while the State Economic and Trade Commission (SETC), in
conjunction with related ministries, has been investigating the
extent of damages incurred.
</P>
<P>
The investigation showed that there was dumping of 17.11 to
78.93 percent of all newsprint imported from these countries, a
practice which has caused substantial damage to China's newsprint
industry.
</P>
<P>
MOFTEC spokesman said today that according to investigation
results and the anti-dumping and anti-subsidy regulations, MOFTEC
decided to take the anti-dumping measures and that importers
should pay cash deposit in accordance with anti-dumping rulings.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that within 37 days of MOFTEC's
announcement, concerned parties could forward written comments and
demands to MOFTEC and SETC for the consideration of investigating
departments according to the law.
</P>
<P>
MOFTEC and SETC will then continue to investigate and render a
final arbitration ruling in due time.

PARIS, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The operation of the police spotters
system has been successful despite the fact that a French gendarme was
beaten into a coma by German hooligans, World Cup organizers said on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Dominique Spinosi, head of security in the French Organizing

She said these hooligans could have gained access to the stadium
and caused more problems if they had not been identified by the
spotters.

<P>
The system also proved its value after scores of so-called
"Category C" English hooigans were recognized by British police
spotters and sent back home.
</P>

French gendarme Daniel Nivel remained in coma in hospital but
organizers said he was recovering "slightly day by day."

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Lift Sanction on Nigeria Only After </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The United States government may not
lift existing sanctions on Nigeria as early as expected unless
democracy is restored in the west African country.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is pegging the lifting on the release of all
political detainees and the rapid and transparent conclusion of
the transition to civil rule program.
</P>
<P>
This is the key information a high-powered U.S. delegation
tried to let Nigerians know Wednesday at the end of its three-day
visit to the country.
</P>
<P>
The leader of the delegation, U.S. Under-Secretary of State
for Political Affairs, Thomas Pickering, said in the Nigerian
capital Abuja that the early and unconditional release of
political detainees and prisoners, coupled with an evidence of
genuine democratization process, will open the doors for the
lifting of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. delegation arrived in Nigeria Monday night for talks
with the new leader General Abdulsalam Abubakar on the current
political crisis in Nigeria and bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Pickering emphasized that although the Abubakar government
expressed interest on the lifting of sanctions, the U.S. insisted
on "an early and unconditional release of political prisoners and
a rapid movement towards a smooth, open, free and fair transition
to a civilian democratic government."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. imposed limited sanctions on Nigeria in 1993 after
the then military government annulled the June 13 presidential
elections, which businessman-politician, late Moshood Abiola, was
believed to have won.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions, including suspension of U.S. aid and visa ban
on senior officers of the military regime, became a comprehensive
ban on cooperation in the military field in 1995 when nine
minority activists were executed by the Nigerian government.
</P>
<P>
Abiola died of apparent heart attack after taken ill at a
meeting with government officials and Pickering's delegation
Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was said to be one of a series for making
arrangements for the release of Abiola, who was detained four
years ago for declaring himself president of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The sudden death of Abiola has triggered off violent
demonstrations in southwestern Nigeria, where about 30 people
were feared dead.
</P>
<P>
A full postmortem is expected later Thursday to find the exact
cause of Abiola's death, at the request of his relatives and with
the help of a group of foreign pathologists.
</P>
<P>
The report of the autopsy will be very important to the
stability at the critical moment of Nigeria's political process,
which is to end with the military returning to where they came to
power years ago.

<P>
NANJING, July 9 (Xinhua) -- A complete map of the "Greater East
Asia Co-prosperity Sphere" has been discovered recently in east
China's Jiangsu Province, offering new proof of the Japanese
invasion of China during World War II.
</P>
<P>
An old gentleman named Pan, living in Huaiyin city in Jiangsu,
made the map public. It was one of the 32 maps that were seized from
the Japanese command by his father during a battle in Changchun
city in northeast China in 1945.
</P>
<P>
The map, 50 cm long and 30 cm wide, includes China, Mongolia,
Nepal, Thailand, Vietnam, Laos, the Phillippines, Malaysia and
Indonesia in the so-called "co-prosperity sphere."

<HEADLINE> Iran, Pakistan Call for Joint Efforts to Solve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Iran and Pakistan have called for
joint efforts to help solve the Afghan crisis, the Iranian
official news agency IRNA reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In his meeting with Pakistani envoy for Afghan affairs Iftikhar
Murshid here Wednesday night, Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi underlined the need for continuing the efforts and
initiatives to restore peace and stability in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The belligerent sides in the war-ridden country should be
encouraged to hold sincere talks for the sake of understanding and
lasting peace, Kharrazi said.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian foreign minister called for joint measures by the
United Nations, the Organization of the Islamic Conference and
regional states to help solve the Afghan crisis.
</P>
<P>
He welcomed Iran-Pakistan cooperation aimed at improving
medical and living standard of the Afghans.
</P>

recent Islamabad-Tehran efforts to send a joint delegation to
Afghanistan for seeking solutions to the crisis.

<HEADLINE> IBM Slips in Customer-Satisfaction Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 8 (Xinhua) -- IBM fell from the top position
in a market-research firm's customer-satisfaction survey on
notebooks.
</P>
<P>
In Technology Business Research's second quarter survey,
conducted between May and June, IBM, previously a perennial winner
of the quarterly survey, lost out to Texas-based Dell Computer.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time in the past six quarters IBM has not
finished first in the survey. A total of 243 large corporations
were polled.
</P>
<P>
While Dell posted a customer-satisfaction score of 10.15 out of
12, IBM scored 9.95 compared to 10.31 in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
The biggest complaint about the Big Blue was its slow repair
response time, said the survey. Customers expressed frustration
that IBM employees could not fix its product ThinkPads on site and
had to take them to an IBM repair center or to a reseller.
</P>
<P>
The survey also showed customer problems with IBM's
pricing. But IBM said that the company's prices and warranty
service were on par with the rest of the notebook industry.
</P>
<P>
In the past six months, IBM started offering an upgrade to
on-site service in major metropolitan areas for 49 U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Emergency Aid Workers Need Proper Training: WHO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Emergency aid workers often receive
little training and warning about the living and working
conditions awaiting them in the field, and the recruitment
procedures used by many relief agencies are often less than
professional, said the World Health Organization (WHO) here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Many staff are recruited hurriedly and casually with little
time for references or checking of references," the WHO said in a
press release based on the findings of a study on the relief work
in Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda early this year.
</P>
<P>
"Briefing on security issues and political matters appears to
be especially deficient and staff sometimes feel they are placed
at unnecessary risk as a result," the study said.
</P>
<P>
Of the more than 200 relief workers questioned, 53 percent had
not received any personal medical briefing prior to departure and
20 percent of those surveyed had not had, or were not aware of,
whether their vaccination status had been verified.
</P>
<P>
Psychosocial health is also a concern to come out of the
study. Only half of the sample felt that they were able to
function well on the day they were interviewed and a high
proportion of respondents reported general fatigue (59 percent)
and headaches (50 percent).
</P>
<P>
"We are convinced that much can be improved and hope the
experience of well-established agencies can be brought to bear,"
said Dr Harald Siem, chief of WHO's Inter-Agency Cooperation Unit
for Emergency and Humanitarian Action.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that our work will be a spur to the international
community as a whole," Siem said. "There is evidently a need to
protect humanitarian aid workers more effectively."

<HEADLINE> afgamAJD*B-jj~U.S. to Lift Sanction on Nigeria Only After </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The United States government may not
lift existing sanctions on Nigeria as early as expected unless
democracy is restored in the west African country.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is pegging the lifting on the release of all
political detainees and the rapid and transparent conclusion of
the transition to civil rule program.
</P>
<P>
This is the key information a high-powered U.S. delegation
tried to let Nigerians know Wednesday at the end of its three-day
visit to the country.
</P>
<P>
The leader of the delegation, U.S. Under-Secretary of State
for Political Affairs, Thomas Pickering, said in the Nigerian
capital Abuja that the early and unconditional release of
political detainees and prisoners, coupled with an evidence of
genuine democratization process, will open the doors for the
lifting of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. delegation arrived in Nigeria Monday night for talks
with the new leader General Abdulsalam Abubakar on the current
political crisis in Nigeria and bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Pickering emphasized that although the Abubakar government
expressed interest on the lifting of sanctions, the U.S. insisted
on "an early and unconditional release of political prisoners and
a rapid movement towards a smooth, open, free and fair transition
to a civilian democratic government."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. imposed limited sanctions on Nigeria in 1993 after
the then military government annulled the June 13 presidential
elections, which businessman-politician, late Moshood Abiola, was
believed to have won.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions, including suspension of U.S. aid and visa ban
on senior officers of the military regime, became a comprehensive
ban on cooperation in the military field in 1995 when nine
minority activists were executed by the Nigerian government.
</P>
<P>
Abiola died of apparent heart attack after taken ill at a
meeting with government officials and Pickering's delegation
Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was said to be one of a series for making
arrangements for the release of Abiola, who was detained four
years ago for declaring himself president of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The sudden death of Abiola has triggered off violent
demonstrations in southwestern Nigeria, where about 30 people
were feared dead.
</P>
<P>
A full postmortem is expected later Thursday to find the exact
cause of Abiola's death, at the request of his relatives and with
the help of a group of foreign pathologists.
</P>
<P>
The report of the autopsy will be very important to the
stability at the critical moment of Nigeria's political process,
which is to end with the military returning to where they came to
power years ago.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Flooding caused by torrential rains
since late June has killed 170 people in southwest China's Sichuan
Province. Total property losses were estimated at 2.5 billion yuan
(about 312.5 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The province was hit by torrential rains beginning on June 27,
as six counties received total rainfall of between 20 to 50
centimeters. More than 1,750 people were injured and another 12
were reported missing in the flood waters following the heavy
downpours.
</P>
<P>
Figures from the Provincial Natural Disaster Relief Office show
that flooding toppled about 60,000 houses and destroyed 58,000
hectares of crops, paralyzing roads and public utilities in many
areas.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has sent 10 work groups to coordinate
resue operations in the hard-hit areas which, according to local
whether forecasts, are expected to be pelted by heavy rains again
during next few weeks.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Doctors Expected in Lagos for Abiola's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 9 (Xinhua) -- A team of foreign pathologists are
expected to arrive here Thursday to help find the real cause of
the death of Nigeria's number one political detainee Moshood
Abiola.
</P>
<P>
The pathologists are from Britain, the United States and
Canada at the invitation of the Nigerian government to involve in
the examination of the corpse of Abiola, who died apparently of
heart attack Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The government made the invitation at the request of some of
Abiola's relatives who disbelieved the reported cause of his
death.
</P>
<P>
The autopsy, originally planned to be conducted in the capital
Abuja, is expected to be carried out in Lagos where Abiola's
personal physician Dr. Ore Falomo insisted there are better
medical facilities.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government Tuesday announced the sudden death of
Abiola after he was taken ill during a meeting "which was being
held by Nigerian and United States officials with him".
</P>
<P>
According to Thomas Pickering, the head of a high-powered U.S.
government delegation to Nigeria, the seemingly "clear and lucid"
Abiola had trouble in breathing in the middle of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Cough medicine and pain killer, as well as other temporary
measures, did not help improve his situation. Abiola was then
hurried to the presidential clinic where one and a half hours'
emergency treatment failed to save his life, Pickering told
reporters Wednesday at the end of his visit.
</P>
<P>
The death of Abiola on the brink of his release from four
years in detention has given rise to uncertainty to the political
crisis of the country.
</P>
<P>
Violation broke out Tuesday night after the news of his death
was spread to the south, the stronghold of supporters and
sympathizers of the presumed winner of the June 12, 1993
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 30 persons were feared dead during demonstrations to
protest Abiola's death.
</P>
<P>
To secure exactly what killed Abiola then has become a very
important thing that will have a big impact on the stability of
the west African country.
</P>
<P>
According to Falomo, arrangements had been concluded to give
the foreign medical experts "free hand to operate".
</P>
<P>
But he said he would not participate in the exercise because
he was not allowed access to Abiola in his life time, the Daily
Times quoted the physician as saying Wednesday, without giving
further details.
</P>
<P>
Falomo also declined to disclose the venue of the autopsy,
saying "it is only the people concerned with it that would know."

<P>
HONG KONG, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's index of industrial
production in the first quarter of 1998 decreased by 4 percent
over the same period of 1997, according to a government survey
released here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by the Census and Statistics Department,
showed that the output of chemical, rubber, plastic and
non-metallic products fell by 9.5 percent. The output of plastic
products shrank markedly by 18.2 percent due to the weakening in
import demand from the United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
The output of electrical and electronic products, machinery,
professional equipment and optical goods also declined by 8
percent. Within the group, the output of consumer electrical and
electronic products plunged by 18 percent, partly because of the
relocation of manufacturing processes to the mainland.
</P>
<P>
During the first quarter, the output of paper and printing
products increased slightly by 1.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> South African Currency Sees 2nd Day of Calm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 9 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's strained
financial markets enjoyed a second day of calm Wednesday, as an
eight-week speculative assault remained on hold.
</P>
<P>
With the relative calm in the currency market spilling over to
the bond and equities markets, analysts are hoping the worst is
over and that the Rand is in consolidation mode, South Africa
newspapers reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said currency stability was the key to attracting new
foreign investment in South Africa's bond market, which was
looking cheap. However, Wednesday's stillness could just be the
silence before the next storm.
</P>
<P>
The Rand closed in Johannesburg on Wednesday at 6.14 Rand to
the Dollar, well up from its recent low of 6.75, but still over
20 percent beneath its value against the Dollar in late May.
</P>
<P>
The Rand held its own despite rumors that Reserve Bank deputy
governor James Cross was set to resign over the appointment of
Labor Minister Tito Mboweni to lead the bank next year.
</P>
<P>
Cross flatly denied the rumors, saying he would see out his
full term which ends in December, 2001, and that Mboweni had his
full support.
</P>
<P>
The Rand and bonds were also helped by the assurance of
Mboweni that he would not interfere with the bank's independence,
nor hesitate to dish out stiff monetary medicine if the economy
sickened.
</P>
<P>
The Rand, which has been hammered by foreign speculators since
late May, hit an all-time low of 6.75 Rand against the Dollar on
Monday, as investors reacted with shock to the news that Mboweni
would replace governor Chris Stals after the latter's retirement
in August 1999.
</P>
<P>
Mboweni on Wednesday dismissed fears that the African National
Congress (ANC) would change the constitution ensuring the central
bank's independence if it won a two-thirds majority in next
year's general election, a requirement for alteration of the
constitution.
</P>
<P>
He also said he was prepared to make harsh choices in the face
of possible financial turmoil, such as raising interest rates.
The Reserve Bank's recent interest rate hikes have drawn scathing
criticism from labor unions.
</P>
<P>
"I know that when interest rates bite at some point, some
people will complain... but if we have to dish out that kind of
medicine from time to time, we will have to do it," Mboweni said.
</P>
<P>
But analysts remained wary of forecasting an end to the
currency's misery and warned confidence had been badly shaken and
would not speedily return.
</P>
<P>
South African Finance Minister Trevor Manuel on Wednesday also
showed his support for Mboweni, saying that media criticism of
Mboweni's appointment stemmed from "the racism deep within" some
individuals.

BRUSSELS, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The seasonally-adjusted
unemployment rate for the 15-nation European Union remained at
10.2 percent in May, Eurostat reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It was the third month running at this level whereas in May
last year the jobless rate was at 10.7 percent and in May 1996 it

The euro countries include Belgium, Germany, Spain, France,
Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal and
Finland.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Egyptian President Pays Surprise Visit to Libya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
arrived in northeastern Libya Thursday on a surprise visit to meet
with Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi who is recovering from a
fractured hip bone, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
There was no announcement of the purpose of the visit.
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi broke a hip bone after he fell during exercising on
Monday. Doctors said they had succeeded in fixing the fracture
with a platinum nail and that they were able to adjust the hip
bone to its normal position.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak Wednesday offered to send a medical team to help Libyan
doctors treat Gaddafi's fractured hip bone.
</P>
<P>
The news agency did not mention what kind of transportation
Mubarak used Thursday morning to reach Baida, about 770 kilometers
east of the capital Tripoli.
</P>
<P>
In previous trips to Libya in the past six years, the president
flew from Cairo to somewhere near the Egyptian-Libyan border and
then drove across it, bowing to a U.N. air embargo on Libya.
</P>
<P>
The air embargo was imposed in 1992 after Gaddafi refused to
hand over two Libyans suspected of bombing an American airliner
over Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988. A total of 270 people were
killed in the incident.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the Organization of African Unity urged member
states to ignore the air embargo starting October. The Arab League
said it is considering following suit.
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi has scuttled his week-long visit to Egypt slated early
in June, without giving reasons. But Mubarak told reporters that
Gaddafi has a mild tonsil and was expected to make the trip in 10
to 15 days. The second date for the trip was also missed.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian and Libyan officials denied a report that Gaddafi had
postponed the visit because of a failed attempt to kill him.
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi reportedly came under an attack in the Mediterranean
city of Benghazi in which he was slightly wounded and many of his
bodyguards were hurt. Libya said it was "sheer lies."

SHENYANG, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Liaoning, a coastal province in
northeast China, now leads the country in deep-sea fishing.
</P>
<P>
The province, with 3,000 kilometers of coastline, has 18

PARIS, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Leading French sports newspaper
L'Equipe admitted that they were wrong in a dispute with French team
manager Aime Jacquet.
</P>
<P>
L'Equipe has fiercely criticised Jacquet's team choices, tactics
and decisions of dropping certain players and cast doubts on Jacquet's
ability of leading the French team in top level tournament like the

</P>
<P>
But Jacquet has proved he was right by taking the French team
into the final, the first time ever for France in World Cup history.
</P>
<P>
In a front page editorial, L'Equipe admitted:"The result is that
Jacquet and his men have done what nobody had managed to do before
them, following their own path without flinching."
</P>
<P>
But the newspaper insisted:"We continue not to share his basic
tactical options and to regret deeply certain choices."

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Embattled Ugandan Mayor Faces Uncertain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- When Kampala Mayor Hajji Nasser
Sebaggala is still fighting for his freedom in the United States,
there is report here saying Interpol Uganda will question him on
his return, which adds more uncertainty to the future of the
embattled mayor.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Internal Affairs Tom Butime told parliament
Wednesday that the case is by no means over. Instead, it's just
beginning. The Interpol will quiz the mayor as soon as he returns
home.
</P>
<P>
The mayor's accomplices in Uganda who made the altered checks
are already questioned by the police, he added.
</P>
<P>
Sebaggala was arrested in New York on June 13 for making false
statements to U.S. customs officers when he was about to board a
Brussels-bound Sabena flight en route to Entebbe.
</P>
<P>
Reports said he did not declare that he was carrying 100,800
U.S. Dollars in cash, which is well over the allowed maximum
amount of 10,000 Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, a Boston grand jury placed in another six counts of
check frauds involving four transactions totalling 191,000
Dollars.
</P>
<P>
These charges against Sebaggala date back to February, 1997
when he allegedly deposited two altered checks for a total of
138,000 Dollars into his account in Bank Boston.
</P>
<P>
The mayor is thus charged with both Federal and State
offences. Making a false customs declaration is a federal offence
but depositing fraudulent checks is an offence under the
jurisdiction of the State of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
If convicted, the mayor may be sentenced to a prison term of
no less than 30 years not including a colossal sum of fine.
</P>
<P>
After his arraignment in June, Sebaggala was released from
jail and put under the custody of Uganda's Ambassador to the
United Nations, Prof. Semakula Kiwanuka on condition that he
doesn't leave New York.
</P>
<P>
With the defense lawyers' paying 50,000 Dollar bond to a
federal court in Brooklyn, New York, the case of Sebaggala was
shifted from New York to Boston where the offences were allegedly
committed.
</P>
<P>
Sebaggala's lawyer said earlier this month:"This is a special
kind of bond. It is not a bond in the sense of a bail bond. It is
simply to ensure his (Sebaggala's) presence in Boston."
</P>
<P>
Reports revealed that the mayor needs some 100,000 Dollars to
be bailed out and his staunch supporters back home tried to raise
money for his freedom and already sent it to the needy mayor.
</P>
<P>
His supporters are quite unsatisfied with the government's
stance on the matter.
</P>
<P>
They accused the government of being reluctant to help the
democratically elected mayor, saying that now President Yoweri
Museveni who they believe is closer to the U.S. should help the
mayor out.
</P>
<P>
The government should not step back from the case, leaving the
mayor to fend for himself, they argued.
</P>
<P>
The minister of internal affairs told the parliament on
Wednesday that the mayor in trouble is getting help from Uganda's
Ambassadors to the United Nations and the United States. He is
fed and housed in the ambassador's residence free of charge.
</P>
<P>
The authorities held that the mayor had committed all these
offences in his private capacity and the government is not in a
position to meddle in the matter.
</P>
<P>
As soon as the mayor got into trouble, his main opponents
demanded the city council to remove him from the top post of the
capital city, citing his bad reputation produced from the
offences and his poor qualifications required of the post.
</P>
<P>
They said the mayor, who was elected in April this year,
cannot speak good English and is short of an A level certificate
the mayorship demands.
</P>
<P>
As the mayor is still struggling for his freedom in the United
States, the Interpol back home has already designed the
questionnaire against him, making his position as Kampala mayor
extremely shaky.
</P>
<P>
Although he called to his supporters here the other day saying
he is okay and confident in winning his freedom at last, nobody
knows what is to await him when he steps back on Ugandan soil.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Dips on Weak Japanese Yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The negative impact of a weak
Japanese yen drove the Australian dollar more than half a U.S.
cent lower Thursday.
</P>
<P>
At the close in Sydney Thursday, the local currency was buying
61.53 U.S. cents from Wednesday's close of 62.09 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
"It is reacting quite a lot to Asian weakness and weakness in
the Japanese yen," a dealer said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. dollar was trading at 140.16 Japanese yen, from 139.57
yen Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The main focus for the Australian dollar continued to be Asia,
the dealer said.
</P>
<P>
Overnight the Australian unit followed the yen down after
Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto indicated that any tax
cuts would not be forthcoming this year.
</P>
<P>
The expected tax package had been seen as a major component of
Japan's recovery from recession.
</P>
<P>
At the close, the Australian dollar was trading at 86.18
Japanese yen from 86.15 yen and 1.1207 German marks from 1.1281
marks.

<HEADLINE> Stock Prices Close Lower in Tokyo on Profit-Taking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices closed lower in Tokyo
Thursday on profit taking by institutions amid slow trading.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange lost 84.02 points, or 0.51
percent, from Wednesday's close to finish at 16,446.95.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, dropped 6.12 points or 0.48 percent to
1,262.28.
</P>
<P>
Volume on the major section decreased to an estimated 400
million shares from 517.51 million shares traded Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Yuasa, a battery maker, was the day's most heavily traded issue.
</P>
<P>
A wide variety of domestic demand-sensitive issues, including
steel, bank and construction stocks, fell after seeing big gains
last week when the Nikkei leapt more than 1,300 points on growing
expectations of future permanent tax cuts to boost the flagging
economy, traders said.
</P>
<P>
More selling of cross-held shares among Japanese corporations
also contributed to the decline, they said.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's slide, however, was slowed somewhat by a heavy dose
of buying-backs among foreign brokerages who had been net sellers
of Japanese stocks from March through the end of May.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,332 issues listed on the First Section, losers
outpaced gainers 786 to 353, with 134 issues remaining unchanged.

AMMAN, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Jordan has denied reports that it has
asked the United Nations Sanctions Committee to allow it to
maintain Iraqi planes, saying that Iraq itself made the request,
the Jordan Times daily reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq submitted this request to the U.N. Sanctions Committee,

maintained," Jordanian Minister of Transport, Post and

Gammo did not say when Iraq made the request and whether the
committee has agreed to it.

Press reports have said that Jordan made the request which was
rejected by the Sanctions Committee several days ago.

The reports said that Jordan has the intention to maintain six
Iraqi commercial planes left in the kingdom after the 1990 Gulf

The planes have been staying at the Queen Alia International

DAR ES SALAAM, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Some 80 Tanzanian students
have attended a training course to learn about Internet since
January this year.
</P>
<P>
The students have been able to gain knowledge concerning
computer, chemistry and engineering at the Computing Center of
the University of Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
According to a report by The Guardian on Thursday, the course
is under a program of the African Virtual University (AVU), a

The AVU mission is to take advantage of modern information
technology to make more people in sub-Saharan Africa to gain
access to education resources in the world.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania is among six countries in sub-Saharan Africa being
covered by the program which has links with the University of New

<HEADLINE> Blair Meets with Protestant Orangemen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 9 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
was holding talks Thursday morning in Downing Street with four
senior Orangemen involved in the Portadown stand-off to discuss
the parade crisis.
</P>
<P>
A Downing Street spokesman said the prime minister did not
intend to drop a ban on Orangemen marching along the Garvaghy Road
in Portadown, 50 kilometers southwest of Provincial capital
Belfast.
</P>
<P>
The meeting followed another night of violence and
demonstration in the province during which police warned people
not to travel unless the journey was essential.
</P>
<P>
The parade traditionally uses the route of Garvaghy Road area
but was banned this year by the independent Parades Commission,
and the security forces have mounted a massive operation to keep
protesters out, leading to a stand-off with the Orangemen.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party leader
Ian Paisley urged Blair to "see sense" and reverse the parade
ban. Paisley is a well-known figure in Northern Ireland who is
opposed to the peace agreement reached in April and endorsed in
May in a referendum.
</P>
<P>
The Protestant Orangemen also warned they could paralyse the
province "within hours" if the parade was not allowed to continue
through the Catholic area.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Bank Chief Criticizes Price Controls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Issac Takawira, chief executive of
Barclays Bank of Zimbabwe has warned that government plans to
re-introduce price controls will create market distortions and
fuel shortages which can lead to smuggling and parallel markets.
</P>
<P>
He told a Zimbabwe Economic Society meeting that price
controls prolonged monopolies through discouraging new entrants
to the industry because of perceived limited profit
opportunities, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The answer does not lie in controlling the end price alone
without controlling prices of inputs in the production process,"
but "lies in prudent management of the economy, downsizing the
public sector to a level sustainable by reasonable rates of taxes
and borrowings," he said.
</P>
<P>
In a move described by analysts as a negation of donor-backed
economic reforms, the government gazetted last month the price of
mealie-meal and other basic food commodities saying it was
protecting citizens from unjustified hikes by manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
"It is unfortunate that the government is undoing some of the
major achievements made in the past few years," Takawira said.
</P>
<P>
He said the country's problems emanated from the high public
debt which needed to be reduced to a sustainable level.
</P>
<P>
This could be achieved through accelerating the privatization
of parastatals proceeds of which would be used :5 reduce the
fiscal deficit, inflation and interest rates, according to
Takawira.
</P>
<P>
The resulting stable macro economic environment will encourage
savings and new investment which will generate growth and
employment, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We all need to understand that there are no quick fixes,
there is no substitute for sound economic management," he added.

SHANGHAI, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Fewer overseas buyers than

Previously, according to general manager Zhu Junbo, the ratio

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Golkar Opens Extraordinary Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J. Habibie
opened here Thursday the ruling Golkar's extraordinary congress,
calling on the people to sustain the momentum of the reform
movement.
</P>
<P>
"Our efforts have brought us advantages. Let us not render them
useless," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Habibie told the congress that Indonesia needs to earn more
foreign exchange to restart the economy, considering that not all
aspects of the economy have been paralyzed by the crisis.
</P>
<P>
"I understand that many people are still not satisfied with all
the improvements we have made. But I believe we are making
significant improvements," he said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the economic crisis, he said, Golkar has to brace
itself for the future through self-introspection and a better
vision of the future.
</P>
<P>
On the election of Golkar's new chairman, the president said
Golkar leaders should be chosen by "those at the bottom" of the
party and not by "those at the top."
</P>
<P>
Its future leaders should be able to make their own decisions
without seeking the approval of other groups in efforts to
revitalize the party, Habibie said.
</P>
<P>
Several candidates have been proposed by various sections of
the organization to replace the current chairman, Harmoko.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that former Defense Minister Edi Sudradjat and
Minister/Secretary of State Akbar Tanjung are the strongest
candidates. While retired Armed Forces officials are behind Edi's
nomination, Akbar is reportedly supported by the Armed Forces
Headquarters. For most of the country's nearly 53 years of
independence, the military has played an important role in
political life.
</P>
<P>
According to local press reports, the congress will discuss new
Golkar statutes including the abolition of the board of patrons,
board of advisors and board of councilors.
</P>
<P>
Based on current Golkar rules and regulations, the board of
patrons headed by former President Soeharto has extensive
authority and the right to annul policies adopted by the head of
the Golkar executive board.
</P>
<P>
Touching on the general elections in May or June next year,
Habibie said Golkar will compete not only against the United
Development Party and the Indonesian Democratic Party but also
against new parties that have recently been set up.
</P>
<P>
Under Soeharto's rule, only Golkar and two minority parties
were allowed to contest elections. Golkar, established in 1964 as
an amalgamation of seven organizations which include the armed
forces, labor organizations and cooperative movements, has won all
the seven general elections in the past.
</P>
<P>
The three-day congress i not attended by the chairman of its
Board of Patrons, Soeharto. The former president resigned on May
21 amid strong public pressure calling for political reforms.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the extraordinary congress organizing committee
Waskito Reksosoedirdjo said Soeharto had been invited to the
congress.

<HEADLINE> NATO Threatens Actions on Kosovo Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) will act over the Kosovo issue unless Belgrade
accepts the Contact Group's ceasefire demand, German Foreign
Minister Klaus Kinkel said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel made the remarks after arriving at the Rinas airport in
Tirana.
</P>
<P>
He said Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic would and should
accept the Contact Group's ceasefire demand, made at the Bonn
conference Wednesday, as a first step toward the settlement of the
Kosovo issue.
</P>
<P>
If Belgrade turns a deaf ear to the demand, then NATO will take
actions, the visiting foreign minister added.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday night, Kinkel briefed Albanian President Rexhap
Mejdani on the Contact Group's Bonn meeting.
</P>
<P>
In response, Mejdani was regretful for the long-delayed
settlement of the Kosovo issue, and in a statement, issued by his
press and information office, expressed doubts on the possibility
of resolving the Kosovo issue through political and diplomatic
means.
</P>
<P>
He urged the international community to send more forces to
Kosovo in a bid to increase the international diplomatic efforts
in the troubled region.
</P>
<P>
The Contact Group grouping Britain, France, Germany, Italy,
Russia and the United States has called for an immediate cessation
of hostilities in Kosovo to pave way for continuous talks between
Belgrade and the Kosovo Albanian leadership on additional
confidence-building measures and the future status of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel began his trip to Albania and Macedonia on Wednesday to
discuss the Kosovo crisis, and is scheduled to inspect the
refugees Thursday in the border area between Albania and
Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Australian Bank to Introduce Internet Banking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Australia's leading bank National
Australia Bank Ltd. (NAB) announced Thursday that it would
introduce an online banking service with unprecedented levels of
security.
</P>
<P>
The service, known as National Internet Banking, would be based
on Java software and feature the use of digital certificates, the
first in the Australian banking market, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The use of digital certificates is equivalent to an electronic
signature and is assigned to each customer's personal computer.
</P>
<P>
It is encrypted and held on the customer's personal computer,
preventing unauthorized access from any other location.
</P>
<P>
The service would feature online registration, so NAB clients
would not need to visit a branch before using it.
</P>
<P>
It would offer users account balances, 100 days of statement
information with search and sort functions, transfer of funds
between NAB accounts and other banks, secure E-mail to and from
the bank, set up and change periodic payments and bill payments.
</P>
<P>
Glenn Barnes, NAB executive general manager of business and
personal financial services, said national Internet banking would
be made available progressively to NAB staff and selected
customers from this week, with a general release later in the
year.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading French Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items in
 leading French newspapers on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- On the following day of the death in prison of Moshood
Abiola, the principal opponent of the military regime in Nigeria,
the chief of state of Nigeria General Abdusalam Abubakar
addressed the nation Wednesday evening to express his
condolences. He also appealed for calm and reiterated his
intention to bring back to the barracks the army, which has been
in power since 1986.
</P>
<P>
-- Socialist government of Prime Minister Lionel Jospin will
not extend the tax on private fortune, or the ISF, to professional
 properties which are also called ``working tools,'' according to
sources of the government. Lionel prefers to reject a proposal by
the Communist Party to impose ISF upon professional properties
than offend the country's employers, who have been already
angered by his plan to impose 35 hour work week.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Some political activists in the Berber-speaking region of
Kabylie in Algeria said that the appearance of a mysterious Berber
 armed group called ``Armed Berber Movement'' was the outcome of a
 manipulation by some people who want to justify measures of
suppression upon the Berber activists by inciting violence in
Kabylie, a mountainous region east of Algiers which opposes the
law by the government to impose Arabic as the only official
language in Algeria.
</P>
<P>
-- For the first time since the appearance of a great scale
armed struggle in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo, Western powers
showed on Wednesday their growing worry over the rising of
irredentism among the ethnic Albanians of Kosovo. The six-nation
Contact Group on former Yugoslavia Wednesday issued an appeal in
Bonn for an immediate stop to hostility in Kosovo to prepare for
the field of talks between the Yugoslav government and ethnic
Albanians.

HOHHOT, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archeologists working in the
eastern part of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region recently
unearthed extensive Xinglongwa Culture ruins dating back some
8,000 years.
</P>
<P>
The archaeological team unearthed numerous pieces of pottery,
stone objects and more than 200 foundations of houses
characteristic of the primitive society from an over 60,000
sq.m. site.
</P>
<P>
Beichengzi, the Chinese name for the site, is twice as large
as the Xinglongwa ruins which were discovered nearby in the early
1980s.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists say the ruins will provide valuable
clues for further research of ancient civilizations and social
development in Inner Mongolia and northeast China's Liaoning
Province.

<HEADLINE> China Will Need Master Academicians in 21st Century  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 9 (Xinhua) -- China will need a great number of
men of letter, scholars and master academicians to restore its
cultural glory, sources from the prestigious Chinese Academy of
Social Sciences (CASS) said here today.
</P>
<P>
At the academy's graduation ceremony for graduate students,
Prof. Fang Keli urged that first-rate scholars must be nurtured
and cultivated in this era when knowledge is vital for China's
development.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Fang, president of the academy's graduate college, said
this must be done quickly as it will affect the image of China, a
country which has a 2,000-year-old tradition of academia and has
produced tens of thousands of outstanding scholars who have
contributed to world civilization.
</P>
<P>
However, this tradition was suspended during the chaotic
Cultural Revolution (1966-76) when intellectuals, who were defined
as bad elements compared to workers and farmers, were persecuted
and even killed.
</P>
<P>
The CASS has been home to many of the country's most
influential scholars, including Guo Moruo, the famous writer and
historian, and Hu Qiaomu, former secretary to the late Chairman
Mao Zedong, and many other eminent philosophers, archeologists and
economists.
</P>
<P>
But most of these authoritative geniuses have passed away or
are now living their final days, and 80 percent of the academy's
leading scholars will retire by the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Fang went on to say that the academy has been carring out
a program to cultivate future scholars, and 200 bright youngsters
have been selected to inherit this academic legacy.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the Academy is also working to attract established
scholars from outside its walls, vowing to provide better housing,
higher salaries and more opportunities to visit abroad.

<HEADLINE> Australian Stocks End Slightly Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The Australian sharemarket
Thursday closed marginally up but off its highs as the weaker
currency market dampened sentiment, brokers said.
</P>
<P>
The All Ordinaries Index closed up 14.8 points, or 0.53
percent, at 2788.9, off a high of 2799.9 and a low of 2774.1.
</P>
<P>
The market opened stronger on a positive lead from Wall Street
overnight, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 89.93
points to 9174.97.
</P>
<P>
But weakness on Japanese and Hong Kong markets coupled with the
fall in the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar kept the local
bourse from gaining more ground, brokers said.
</P>
<P>
The All Industrials Index closed up 25.4 points at 4898.6 and
the All Resources Index gained 6.3 points to 1086.
</P>
<P>
National turnover was 289.68 million valued at 651.9 million
U.S. dollars, with rises outnumbering falls by 576 to 484.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed local trade at 61.5 U.S. cents
after closing at 62.09 U.S. cents Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Commonwealth Bank of Australia shares continued to surge
Thursday, peaking at a new intra-day record high of 20.33
Australian dollars after strong institutional buying and settling
at a record close of 20.13 Australian dollars, up 16 cents.
</P>
<P>
National Australia Bank gained 24 cents to 22.6 Australian
dollars, Westpac Banking Corp. gained 10 cents to 10.67 Australian
dollars and ANZ Banking Group dipped 7 cents to 11.73 Australian
dollars.
</P>
<P>
In the resources sector, BHP climbed 16 cents to 14.36
Australian dollars and Rio Tinto rose 15 cents to 19.20 Australian
dollars.
</P>
<P>
A fall in New York gold bullion prices overnight after the
European Central Bank said it would hold only 15 percent of its
exchange reserves in gold pushed the gold index down 6.3 points,
or 0.56 percent, to 1118.2.
</P>
<P>
Sydney trade in gold bullion closed 2.8 U.S. dollars lower at
292.75 U.S. dollars an ounce, following the European announcement
on gold reserves.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Doctors in Lagos for Abiola's Autopsy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 9 (Xinhua) -- A team of foreign pathologists have
arrived here to help find the real cause of the death of
Nigeria's number one political detainee Moshood Abiola.
</P>
<P>
The pathologists come from Britain, the United States and
Canada at the invitation of the Nigerian government to involve in
the examination of the corpse of Abiola, who died apparently of
heart attack Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The government made the invitation at the request of some of
Abiola's relatives who disbelieved the reported cause of his
death.
</P>
<P>
The autopsy, originally planned to be conducted in the capital
Abuja, is expected to be carried out Thursday here in Lagos where
Abiola's personal physician Dr. Ore Falomo insisted there are
better medical facilities.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government Tuesday announced the sudden death of
Abiola after he was taken ill during a meeting "which was being
held by Nigerian and United States officials with him".
</P>
<P>
According to Thomas Pickering, the head of a high-powered U.S.
government delegation to Nigeria, the seemingly "clear and lucid"
Abiola had trouble in breathing in the middle of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Cough medicine and pain killer, as well as other temporary
measures, did not help improve his situation. Abiola was then
hurried to the presidential clinic where one and a half hours'
emergency treatment failed to save his life, Pickering told
reporters Wednesday at the end of his visit.
</P>
<P>
The death of Abiola on the brink of his release from four
years in detention has given rise to uncertainty to the political
crisis of the country.
</P>
<P>
Violation broke out Tuesday night after the news of his death
was spread to the south, the stronghold of supporters and
sympathizers of the presumed June 12, 1993 presidential election
winner.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 30 persons were feared dead during demonstrations to
protest Abiola's death.
</P>
<P>
To secure exactly what killed Abiola then has become a very
important thing that will have a big impact on the stability of
the west African country.
</P>
<P>
According to Falomo, arrangements had been concluded to give
the foreign medical experts "free hand to operate" and an autopsy
report may be out later Thursday.
</P>
<P>
But he said he would not participate in the exercise because
he was not allowed access to Abiola in his life time, the Daily
Times quoted the physician as saying, without giving further
details.
</P>
<P>
Falomo also declined to disclose the venue of the autopsy,
saying "it is only the people concerned with it that would know."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Rates S. Africa as Attractive Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The United States State
Department has rated South Africa as an "attractive" destination
for U.S. business, with "significant growth potential."
</P>
<P>
However, delays in privatization in South Africa may slow the
pace of capital inflows this year, the department said in its
latest annual survey of South Africa's investment climate,
Business Day paper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Among the few new problem areas cited is South Africa's draft
competition bill, which is seen as giving the trade and industry
minister too much discretion to block business mergers and
acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
Also of concern are "reported" plans to bar companies in South
Africa from complying with "extraterritorial" laws such the U.S.
Helms-Burton act, which seeks to penalize firms that invest in
Cuba, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
It notes that U.S. firms "do experience some problems" in
South Africa with intellectual property protection, even though
South African laws and practices are "generally in conformity"
with those of industrialized nations.
</P>
<P>
However, efforts to crack down on software piracy "have borne
fruit." Just less than half the software installed in South
Africa is now said to be illegally copied, which is comparable to
European levels.
</P>
<P>
Although South Africa's highly developed capital markets are
seen as a plus for direct investors, the report warns that
insider trading is "poorly" regulated and seldom investigated.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's labor costs are low relative to Western
industrialized countries but productivity is also lower, the
report notes.
</P>
<P>
The labor-management relationship is described as being amid a
"challenging" process of change. "Reaching common ground on a set
of policies to foster job creation remains one of the most
pressing challenges," it says.
</P>
<P>
South Africa has investment agreements with Canada and most
European countries, but not the United States.
</P>
<P>
"Formal negotiations have proved unproductive," although a
bilateral tax treaty is now in effect, the survey says.
</P>
<P>
While crime is a serious problem, the statistics may be
"misleading" because incidents are being reported and recorded
more efficiently than in the apartheid era, it says.
</P>
<P>
The United States was the largest single source of foreign
direct investment last year.
</P>
<P>
However, flows "are expected to taper off in 1998, given
delays in privatization efforts".

<P>
Moreover, sources at the academy said that young scholars have
shown greater interest in academic work than several years ago
when many of them quit for more lucrative jobs. These students are
also more acquainted with modern technology, methods and thought
than the retiring scholars.
</P>
<P>
It is very possible that today's graduates will become masters
whose learning includes that of both East and West, Prof. Fang
said.
</P>
<P>
Teng Teng, vice-president of the CASS, said that the central
government is paying close attention to developing social sciences
and implementing the policy of respecting intellectuals. "As long
as China's comprehensive national strength increases, the research
and living conditions of Chinese scholars will become better, and
the time to produce a great many cultural masters will arrive," he
said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 162 graduate students graduated today, and among
these, 118 obtained doctorate degree, 31 more than last year.
</P>
<P>
Li Tieying, president of the CASS and a member of the Political
Bureau of Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee,
presented the diplomas to the new graduates.

JERUSALEM, July 9 (Xinhua) -- General Shaul Mofaz was appointed
as the 16th chief of general staff of the Israeli army on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
At a ceremony in the Prime Minister's office here, Mofaz was

chief of general staff.
</P>
<P>
Mofaz, 50, immigrated to Israel from Iran with his family when
he was nine years old. In 1966, he enlisted in the paratrooper

<HEADLINE> NATO Threatens Actions on Kosovo Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) will act over the Kosovo issue unless Belgrade
accepts the Contact Group's ceasefire demand, German Foreign
Minister Klaus Kinkel said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel made the remarks after arriving at the Rinas airport in
Tirana.
</P>
<P>
He said Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic would and should
accept the Contact Group's ceasefire demand, made at the Bonn
conference Wednesday, as a first step toward the settlement of the
Kosovo issue.
</P>
<P>
If Belgrade turns a deaf ear to the demand, then NATO will take
actions, the visiting foreign minister added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Kinkel also briefed Albanian President Rexhap Mejdani
on the Contact Group's Bonn meeting.
</P>
<P>
In response, Mejdani was regretful for the long-delayed
settlement of the Kosovo issue, and in a statement, issued by his
press and information office, expressed doubts on the possibility
of resolving the Kosovo issue through political and diplomatic
means.
</P>
<P>
He urged the international community to send more forces to
Kosovo in a bid to increase the international diplomatic efforts
in the troubled region.
</P>
<P>
The Contact Group grouping Britain, France, Germany, Italy,
Russia and the United States has called for an immediate cessation
of hostilities in Kosovo to pave way for continuous talks between
Belgrade and the Kosovo Albanian leadership on additional
confidence-building measures and the future status of Kosovo.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Government troops, backed by heavy
artillery and attack helicopters, Thursday continued pounding on
two village strongholds held by some 200 Moro Islamic Liberation
Front (MILF) rebels in Pigcawayan, Cotabato, the southern
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
As of 2 p.m. Thursday, government forces persisted in
delivering heavy blows to the rebels, who were reportedly
resisting with heavy machine-gun fire, mortar shelling and rocket
propelled grenades, the Philippine News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Pigcawayan Mayor Jun Garcesa as saying the
intense fighting, which started around 5:00 a.m. Thursday, was
still going on at two remote villages.
</P>
<P>
Casualties from both sides are yet to be determined, Garcesa
said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the fighting occurred following a series of
reported harassment and cattle-rustling activities in the vicinity
by MILF men during the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the clashes, some 1,000 local residents from
four villages have been reportedly evacuated to safer grounds to
avoid being caught in the crossfire.
</P>
<P>
Major Rosque Garingalao, spokesman of the army's Sixth Infantry
Division, denied that the army started the fight with the MILF,
saying they just retaliated after the rebels ambushed patrol
elements of the military.

<HEADLINE> China Improves Engineering Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 9 (Xinhua) -- China has achieved great success in
improving the quality of various engineering and housing projects
thanks to the highly effective nationwide supervision and
monitoring system.
</P>
<P>
Ye Rutang, vice-minister of construction, said today that a
large number of key projects and numerous urban infrastructure
projects, as well as nearly one billion sq.m., have either reached
advance international standards or government quality standards.
</P>
<P>
In addition, breakthroughs have been made in the planning,
design and construction of the country's engineering and housing
projects, and substantial progress has been made in environmental
protection and more infrastructure facilities have been completed.
</P>
<P>
One senior official pointed out that more than 90 percent of
China's cities and counties have set up engineering quality
supervision stations, with related departments covering over 88
percent of the nation's construction projects.
</P>
<P>
China has also established engineering monitoring institutes
which handled or prevented over 60,000 construction hazards
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
However, many problems remain in spite of the progress, with
particular problems centered on residential housing, according to
Ye. The vice-minister reiterated that a great deal of work must
still be carried out in related activities.

<HEADLINE> 75 Lebanese Charged for Spying for Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese military prosecutor Nasri
Lahoud has charged 75 members of an underground ring for handing
over information on Lebanese and Syrian troops movement and the
activities of anti-occupation guerrillas to Israeli intelligence.
</P>
<P>
Local newspaper the Daily Star Thursday quoted Lahoud's
indictment as saying that the suspects, only 17 members of whom
have been taken into custody so far, are also accused of "entering
enemy territory."
</P>
<P>
The group was formed in 1995 to monitor military movements in
areas outside the Israeli-occupied zone and Syrian military bases
near Mazzeh, east of Syrian capital Damascus, the indictment said.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a 1,200-square-kilometer border strip in south
Lebanon in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
Lebanese guerrillas cross-border attack.
</P>
<P>
The suspects were said to have sent letters written in
invisible ink to contacts in Athens. One of them allegedly
received 7,300 U.S. dollars for the 11 letters sent to the Greek
capital.
</P>
<P>
The ring was dismantled after Raja Ward, deputy head of the
South Lebanon Army (SLA) militia's intelligence services in the
eastern sector of the occupied zone, surrendered to the Lebanese
army a fortnight ago, the paper quoted a judicial source as saying.
</P>
<P>
The 2,500-member SLA has been helping Israeli forces to patrol
its occupied south Lebanon and policing Lebanon's central
Christian town of Jezzine, just north to the zone.
</P>
<P>
Ward, a 37-year-old Lebanese Druze, gave information to the
authorities about a network of 22 Lebanese Druze and Shiite
Muslims who fed information to the Israeli army on the activities
of Hezbollah fighters, the Lebanese army and the Syrian army, the
source said.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, or Party of God, backed by Iran, is leading a
guerrilla war to oust Israeli occupying forces from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Syria has deployed a 40,000-strong troops in Lebanon to help
maintain the security of the country which is recovering from the
1975-1990 civil war.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said the indictments are required to undergo a
review by a military investigating magistrate after further
investigations into the matter before a trial can begin at the
military tribunal.

<HEADLINE> FM Spokesman on U.S.-Taiwan Relations after Clinton's China Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The key to ensuring the healthy and
stable growth of Sino-U.S. relations lies in properly handling the
Taiwan issue, the most important and sensative part of the
bilateral ties, Foreign Ministry spokesman Tang Guoqiang stated
today.
</P>
<P>
Tang made the statement in response to a question on
U.S.-Taiwan relations after U.S. President Bill Clinton's state
visit to China, which ended on July 3.
</P>
<P>
"There is only one China and Taiwan is part of China. The
government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legitimate
government representing the whole of China," Tang said, adding
that this is a fact accepted universally by the United Nations and
the international community.
</P>
<P>
He said, "The leaders of the United States have time and again
explicitly made the commitment to pursue the 'One China' policy
and abide by the principles set forth in the three Sino-U.S. joint
communiques on different occasions. The United States has
committed itself not to support the independence of Taiwan; not to
support the concept of 'One China, One Taiwan' or 'Two Chinas';
and not to support Taiwan's entry into the United Nations and all
other international organizations composed of sovereign states."
</P>
<P>
Tang indicated that President Clinton reiterated the above
commitments of the United States in his recent China visit.
</P>
<P>
"We attach great importance to these commitments made by
the U.S. side," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"History of the development of Sino-U.S. relations has shown
that whenever the Taiwan issue is handled correctly,
Sino-U.S. ties will grow smoothly. Otherwise, Sino-U.S. relations
will suffer from setbacks, and even retrogression," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tang indicated that China resolutely opposes the Taiwan
Relations Act, which runs counter to the commitments made by the
U.S. government in the three joint communiques.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the improvement and development of
Sino-U.S. relationship are not only in the common interests of the
two countries, but also conducive to world peace, stability and
development.
</P>
<P>
The mutual visits paid by the two heads of state will advance
bilateral ties into a new stage and the improvement of bilateral
relations will surely have a positive impact on improving
relations across the Taiwan Straits, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the Taiwan authorities will have a clear
understanding of the current situation, face realities, bear the
just national cause in mind, return to the 'One China' stand as
soon as possible and respond promptly to our call on holding
political negotiations. They should no longer do what damages
national interests and dignity," he said.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Accepts in Principle Israeli Request for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Jordan has accepted "in principle" an
Israeli request for maintenance of its civilian planes by the
Jordanian Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), the Jordan Times daily
reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"In principle, we accepted the request but we informed them
that technical details should be discussed before reaching an
agreement," CAA head Jasser Ziyad told the semi-official daily.
</P>
<P>
Meetings are expected to be held in weeks by a technical
committee of the two countries in a bid to reach a memorandum of
understanding on the issue, Ziyad said.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that Israel put forward the request for Jordan's
help to maintain its commercial planes during a recent bilateral
meeting held under the framework of a peace treaty signed by the
two countries in 1994.
</P>
<P>
"Apparently, the Israelis believe that maintaining their planes
in Jordan will cost them less than any other places," Ziyad said.
</P>
<P>
Israel has contracts with Turkey and Chile to repair its
commercial planes and jet fighters.
</P>
<P>
Jordan and Israel began to carry out civil aviation cooperation
after signing the peace treaty. Commercial flights started to
shuttle between Amman and Tel Aviv in 1996. The two sides have
also agreed to jointly use the airport in Jordan's Red Sea port
city of Aqaba.

<HEADLINE> Palestine Wishes for Full U.N. Membership by 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Envoy to the United
Nations Nasser al-Kodwa Thursday expressed the hope that the world
organization would accept Palestine as a member state by next year.
</P>
<P>
Kodwa made the remarks to the Cairo-based Voice of Arabs Radio
two days after the U.N. General Assembly adopted the
Arab-sponsored resolution to upgrade Palestine's status from
observer to nonvoting member, which is near statehood.
</P>
<P>
The voting was 124 for, four against, with 10 abstentions.
</P>
<P>
The resolution reflects the international community's
acceptance of Palestine as a political entity and as a future
independent state, said Kodwa.
</P>
<P>
"It mirrors a strong global support for the Palestinians,"
Kodwa told the radio over telephone from New York.
</P>
<P>
The decision grants rights and additional privileges to
Palestinians so that they can participate in General Assembly
debates and submit draft proposals on Palestine, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said he expects his country would be granted a full member
status in the near future, maybe by next year.
</P>
<P>
"I hope the General Assembly would accept Palestine as a
U.N. member state at its upcoming 53rd session," which runs from
September 1998 to September 1999.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's resolution was voted against by Israel, the United
States and two Pacific island countries, the Marshall Islands and
Micronesia.
</P>
<P>
With new powers at hand, Palestinian representatives can raise
issues of the peace process in the assembly and co-sponsor draft
resolutions on Middle East peace.
</P>
<P>
But the representatives can not vote or put forward candidates
for U.N. committees, such as the Security Council.

Association statistics show that the number of housing

An association spokesman pointed out that the rising number of

He noted that the concern will continue to rise as more Chinese
citizens purchase homes as part of market reform which is
replacing the traditional welfare allocation system for public

<HEADLINE> Egyptian FM Flies to Washington for Strategic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
left for Washington Thursday morning on a week-long visit to meet
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to initiate the
strategic dialog between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The meetings of the first strategic dialog between Egypt and
the U.S. will start on Friday, with a meeting between Moussa and
Albright before a plenary meeting of their two delegations,
Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Sessions at experts' level will start later to discuss all
issues relating to Egyptian-American relations in various fields.
</P>
<P>
The strategic dialog between Egypt and the U.S. covers various
regional and international issues of joint interest, especially
Arab and African problems like the peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Washington, Moussa will meet with a number
of senior American officials, Congressmen and media men.
</P>
<P>
Moussa told reporters here Wednesday that points of agreement
between Egypt and the U.S. are more than those of difference.
</P>
<P>
"The points of difference will be discussed during the upcoming
strategic dialog in Washington in a manner that helps open new
channels to forge greater understanding of the considerations
guiding the moves of each side," he said.
</P>
<P>
Moussa noted that Cairo and Washington see eye to eye on the
American initiative on reviving the Palestinian-Israeli peace
talks. The U.S. has proposed a 13.1 percent Israeli troops
withdrawal from the West Bank. It was rejected by Israel but
accepted by the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will also discuss the unstable situation in a
number of African countries.
</P>
<P>
Moussa told an Egyptian Television program Wednesday that the
dialog would tackle not only the current bilateral economic
relationship, but also various spheres of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
"It is not right for the dialog to be limited to the next five
or ten years of U.S. assistance to Egypt," he said.
</P>
<P>
But the foreign minister, like several other Egyptian ministers
who have visited Washington in the past few weeks, is most likely
to discuss how to use the U.S. economic aid to serve Egypt's
transformation into a market economy. The U.S. is considering
cutting this aid according to its policy of reducing foreign
economic aid.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, as the first Arab country to seal peace with Israel,
gets a total of 815 million U.S. dollars of economic aid every
year and 1.3 billion dollars military aid from the United States.

KAMPALA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Mayor of Uganda's capital city
Kampala Hajji Nasser Sebaggala will be questioned by Interpol
even if he wins the case in the United States and returns home, a
minister said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Tom Butime, the minister of internal affairs, was quoted by
Thursday's New Vision as making the remarks in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
"When Sebaggala comes back he will tell us how, where and with
whom he has been dealing in Bicupuli (fake checks). Interpol will
be interested," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
"So it's not yet over. It's just the beginning," he told the
House roaring with laughter.
</P>
<P>
Sebaggala, arrested on June 13, has been detained in the
United States pending his trial on alleged financial fraud
charges and making false statements to the U.S. customs officers
there.
</P>
<P>
Some members of parliament blamed the Ugandan government for
refusing to help the democratically elected mayor who is now in
trouble.
</P>
<P>
Butime said: "Government has provided normal consular services
like it does with other national...Now this is a matter for
Sebaggala to handle within the U.S. legal system."

Uganda's Ambassador to the United States free of charge, he
added.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Recover Soon From Crisis: Governor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Philippine central bank governor
Gabriel Singson Thursday predicted that the country will be among
the first to recover from the onslaught of the Asian financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
He said the business sector's confidence in the present
government indicated that the country will be among the first to
bounce back from the financial crisis currently gripping the
region.
</P>
<P>
He said the business sector's confidence was shown by the
outcome of a dinner hosted by Metrobank Chairman George Ty
Wednesday night for President Joseph Estrada and some 350 leaders
of the local and foreign investment community.
</P>
<P>
"This is the opinion of many banks and analysts -- the
Philippines will be one of the, probably, two or three countries
that will get out of this turmoil ahead of the others," Singson
said.
</P>
<P>
Singson's forecast was shared by some economists working with
the Asian Development Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
The economists believed that the Philippines is the least affected
and has handled the financial crisis very well.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Singson said the favorable outlook shared by
financial analysts and local and foreign businessmen about the
Philippine economy will mean more investments and eventually the
rebound of the peso.
</P>
<P>
"If investments will come in, dollars will come in, then there
will be more dollars. And therefore, the peso will appreciate," he
said.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey conducted among chief executives of
multinational companies in the Philippines showed that investors
were confident of the Estrada administration and the country's
economy.
</P>
<P>
Estrada, who assumed the presidency on June 30 this year, has
vowed to create an economic environment conducive to free
competition and free from violence, crime and corruption.

Shanghai, China's leading economic and financial center, are
attending summer camps designed to promote endurance.

The Island Summer Endurance Camp, organized by Shanghai
Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League of China (CYLC),
attracted more than 100 students on the first half day of
registration. with the number of applicants far exceeding the
expected figure.
</P>
<P>
Experts stress that nurturing a child in favorable conditions
which enable them to experience hardships promotes their sense of
independence and fosters their spirit of mutual assistance under
difficult conditions.
</P>
<P>
The summer camp's program agenda includes cleaning facilities,
camping, field exercises, reclaiming and cultivating Changdao
Island of east China's Shandong Province.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Youth Travel Service, and organization which
caters to the needs of the market, joined the Shanghai Municipal
Committee of the CYLC in sponsoring summer camps in Beijing and
Jinggang Mountains, a strategic revolutionary base in east China's
Jiangxi Province.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the camps attract substantially more boys
willing to endure hardships.

Experts pointed out that arranging summer camps still falls far
short of the needs in a city with hundreds of thousands of

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
Thursday approved a package of 300 million U.S. dollars in loans
and nearly 3 million dollars in technical assistance grants to
help the poor in Indonesia who are hit by the Asian financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Manila-based bank said in a press release that the
Indonesian government will use the money to develop a social
protection program to help school dropouts, poor pregnant women
and malnourished infants in the financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
"The crisis has pushed the cost of attending school and
obtaining essential health care beyond the reach of Indonesia's
poorest people. This jeopardizes their future productivity -- a
cost that Indonesia will have to bear for many years," said
Charles Currin, an ADB senior education specialist working on the
program.
</P>
<P>
The program aims to maintain the quality of social services for
the poor and reform the delivery of social services. It will also
promote decentralized management of social services, reduce
education costs for the poor and develop incentives for schools to
maintain enrollments and for village midwives to better assist
poor families.
</P>
<P>
The program will also provide scholarships for junior secondary
school students, support the rapidly increasing number of street
children and provide additional nutritious feeding for infants,
children and pregnant women, the press release said.

<HEADLINE> More American Women Have Infertility Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 8 (Xinhua) -- As many as 7.7 million American
women may be infertile in the year 2025, according to a study
released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The study, conducted by Elizabeth Hervey Stephen and Anjani
Chandr, and published in the July issue of Fertility and
Sterility, found there was a tendency of an increase in
infertility in the United States for the past 16 years.
</P>
<P>
There were 4.5 million U.S. women with infertility in 1982, and
the number grew to 4.9 million in 1988, and 6.2 million in 1995,
said the study, adding that infertility rates among American women
aged 15 to 44 increased to 10.2 percent in 1995 from 8 percent in
the earlier 1980s.
</P>
<P>
In addition to delayed childbearing, the increase in
infertility may be also due to "a larger percentage of women with
gonorrhea or chlamydial infection who have unrecognized and
presumably more serious cases of pelvic inflammatory disease,"
said the researchers.

<HEADLINE> Croatia Defender Says Blanc Gets What He Deserves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
PARIS, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Croatia defender Slaven Bilic said
that Laurent Blanc of France got what he deserved by missing the
World Cup final match.
</P>
<P>
Blanc pushed Bilic on the face in the semi-final match between
France and Croatia and that earned him a red card and automatically
missed the final.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't get him sent off. He touched me. Technically that's
an offence and the referee saw it," said Bilic, "I'm not happy that
he's going to miss the final but if you do something like that
you're going to get punished."
</P>
<P>
Blanc said:"I admit I made a mistake and lost control but even
when the referee came towards me I thought it would only be a yellow
card, not a red."
</P>
<P>
"For me it is a personal catastrophe, but it wasn't for the
team, because they won. My thoughts are for them now." said Blanc.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Ba People Relics Discovered in Three Gorges Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeologists from a
Northwest China university have recently discovered relics of the
ancient Ba people at Zhongbazi in the Three Gorges region of the
Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
The ancient Ba people are believed to have lived around the
Three Gorges and present-day Chongqing City about 3,000 to 4,000
years ago.
</P>
<P>
Archeological experts have known very little about the Ba
State.
</P>
<P>
The recently discovered site at Zhongbazi includes 20 pits and
two tombs.
</P>
<P>
According to experts, the pits dug by the Ba people were in
round and ellipse shapes and were used as rubbish heaps.
</P>
<P>
The tombs were built vertically, and many pots, spoons in the
shape of bird heads and earthen ware have been excavated from them.
</P>
<P>
Most of the pottery is red and grey with blue veins and designs
on them.
</P>
<P>
At this Ba site more than 1,000 pieces of stoneware have been
unearthed along with some bronze pieces.
</P>
<P>
According to experts, the excavated relics indicate that the
culture of the early Ba people was related to the culture of
western Sichuan Province and to the culture on the plain of the
Yangtze River and Hanjiang River in ancient times.
</P>
<P>
Scholars have said that the Ba people enjoyed a diversity of
primitive activities involving fishing, hunting, farming and
animal husbandry.
</P>
<P>
They added that this is the first large excavation of a Ba site
that promises to tell them more about the Ba people's living
conditions, agriculture and handicrafts.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Announce New Transition Program Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government is expected
to announce a new transition program soon as the country's ruling
body, the Provisional Ruling Council (PRC), may have completed a
meeting late Wednesday night to take a final decision.
</P>
<P>
PRC members and state administrators held a joint meeting in
the day time Wednesday in the capital Abuja, to discuss important
issues on the current political situation in the country,
according to Yobe State Administrator, Group Captain John
Benkanliu.
</P>
<P>
Benkanliu, spokesman for PRC, disclosed this at the end of
Wednesday's day-time meeting, which apparently did not reach
agreement on the expected new transition program.
</P>
<P>
The administrator was quoted by the state TV, the Nigerian
Television Authority (NTA), as saying that the meeting discussed
the consultations held by new leader General Abdulsalam Abubakar
on the way forward for the country's transition to civil rule
program.
</P>
<P>
He said the PRC was expected to meet later into the night to
take the final decision, adding that a statement will be issued
after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The country's new Chief of General Staff, Rear Admiral Ikahai
Mike Akhigbe and new Chief of Defense Staff, Air-Vice Marshal
Alami Dagash were sworn in by Abubakar at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Akhigbe was appointed last Saturday to replace Lt.-Gen.
Oladipo Diya now in jail for alleged involvement in a coup plot
last December.
</P>
<P>
Dagash was named the same day to fill the gap left by Abubakar
after he became head of state immediately after late leader Sani
Abacha's death on June 8.
</P>
<P>
Also on Wednesday, Abubakar ordered the dissolution of the
cabinet known as the Federal Executive Council, demanding that
all the ministries' work be in the charge of their permanent
secretaries until further notice.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria now has come to a crossroads as the sudden death of
Abacha has left the transition program with no presidential
candidate less than two months before the election begins on
August 1 as originally planned.
</P>
<P>
Abacha was adopted by the country's five political parties in
April as their sole consensus presidential candidate not long
before his death.
</P>
<P>
The opposition groups had been demanding the cancellation of
the transition program and the establishment of a national unity
government to be headed by Abiola.
</P>
<P>
However, as the Abubakar government is holding a wide
consultation on the way to save Nigeria from its political
crisis, Abiola died Tuesday at the negotiation table, in the very
presence of a high-powered U.S. delegation who had come to secure
his release.
</P>
<P>
His death has sparked violence Tuesday night in such southern
cities as Lagos and Ibadan, where most of Abiola's supporters and
sympathizers live.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe that the only option now open to the
government is an extension of the transition program, by a period
of one year at the most, as indicated by views forwarded during
the consultations.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear at the moment whether the government will
merely shift the presidential election or start a whole new
transition program, which means all the parties will be dissolved
and previous elections canceled, as have been suggested by some
sectors of the society.
</P>
<P>
Analysts, however, do believe that in either case, the
transition period will not last longer than one year, which seems
to be a deadline acceptable to both Nigerians and the
international society.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's Population Grows Fastest in Arab </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's population is increasing at
the highest rate in the Arab world, expected to reach 7.1 million
by 2010, the Jordan Times daily reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's annual population growth rate stands at 4.4 percent,
Jordanian Minister of Labor Mohammed Mehdi Farhan Wednesday told a
press conference marking the World Population Day.
</P>
<P>
The kingdom's population has increased by eight folds since
1952, which is an "extraordinary and forced growth" related to
political, economic and demographic changes, Farhan, who also
heads the National Population Commission, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that the Jordanians are more aware of the need to
control population growth naturally in order to improve the
standard of living," he added.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's high population growth rate is caused by forced
migration due to the 1990 Gulf crisis, long life expectancy,
reduced infant mortality, lack of contraception and high fertility
rate, according to a recent government press release.
</P>
<P>
Due to Jordan's support for Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait,
tens of thousands of Jordanian workers in Gulf Arab countries were
forced to return home.

<HEADLINE> French Press Cool after France Enters Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The French press was cool on Thursday
in reacting to the entry for the first time by France into the
final of the World Cup by beating Croatia 2-1 Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
The daily Liberation said that Sunday, the day when France
faces Brazil, will not be like Wednesday, because Brazil is not
Croatia.
</P>
<P>
"Ronaldo, Rivaldo, Bebeto and company play great football.
Attack, defense and pleasure. The champions of the world in title
are the last obstacle to the French Valhalla," said the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The daily Parisien-Aujourd'hui paid hommage to the defenser of
the French team Thuram who scored twice on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Last night, he is great. His double pushed France to the final
of the World Cup, for the first time of her history. She will be
the 11th country to know this honor since the creation of the
competition in 1930," it said.
</P>
<P>
The France Soir said half jokingly that the "anti-football
martyrs" only have four days to suffer before the frenzy of the
World Cup ends.
</P>
<P>
"You will have no more cries, enthusiasm, and the happy crowd
on the Champs-Elysee from the whole world," it said.
</P>
<P>
The Marseille-based daily Provence said that football has gone
beyond sports and has become a phenomenon of society.
</P>
<P>
"We think about the children of Castellane, the popular city in
the northern part of Marseille, where a certain Zinedine Zidane
grew up. Today, the children of the district all have their eyes
on him," said the daily in reference to an immigrants' district of
the Mediterranean metropolis.
</P>
<P>
The Berry Republicain said that the World Cup shows that sports
can be the "ferment of solidarity" of all societies, because when
people watch the game, they forget things like unemployment and
social exclusion.
</P>
<P>
The daily Nouvelle Republique du Centre-Ouest said that the
game with Croatia was a trap, because it was unfair for the French
to show such great fighting emotion toward Croatia which has never
done any harm to France in history.

BEIJING, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The key to break the deadlock in

<HEADLINE> Compaq Introduces Fingerprint Identification Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Compaq Computer Corp., the
world's largest personal computer-maker, has unveiled its
Fingerprint Identification Technology, a way to use a person's
fingerprint instead of a password to log into a computer network,
reports from the company said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The product is expected to become available next month and
widespread in three or five years, according to Tim Bajarin,
president of the Creative Strategies, an industry research firm.
</P>
<P>
Industry sources said the new technology uses a device, about
the size of a deck of cards, which plugs into the office
computer. A camera takes a picture of a person's fingerprint, and
the software transforms the fingerprint into a point map that is
stored for future reference, they explained.
</P>
<P>
Later, a user holds a finger to the camera, and the computer
matches the stored print map to the fingerprint.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts noted that products similar to Compaq's have
already been on the market. What is new is that Compaq's product
will sale for 99 U.S. dollars, compared with 199 dollars paid for
the similar product from Biometric Access Corp, they added.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Myanmar Strives to Develop Power Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar's power sector grew by 6.4
percent in output value in the 1997-98 fiscal year over the
previous one.
</P>
<P>
The installed generating capacity of the state-owned Myanmar
Electric Power Enterprise (MEPE), the main electricity supplier in
the country, was 1,207 megawatts (mw) in the fiscal year ending
March, compared with 1,031 mw in the previous year, according to
an official report on the country's financial, economic and social
conditions.
</P>
<P>
The MEPE thus accounted for 77 percent of the country's total
installed generating capacity and it generated 4.2 billion
kilowatt-hours (kwh) of electricity in fiscal 1997-98, 260 million
kwh more than the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Of the total generated power, 2.3 billion kwh or 55 percent was
produced by natural gas and 1.6 billion kwh or 39 percent by
hydropower, indicating that natural gas dominates power
generation.
</P>
<P>
The power consumption of the country increased to 2.5 billion
kwh, a rise of 130 million kwh over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Of the total consumption, 1.1 billion kwh or 45 percent was for
domestic use, 919 million kwh or 37 percent for industrial
utilization and the rest 18 percent for public buildings and
others.
</P>
<P>
The MEPE also extended power transmission and distribution
lines to 21,458 kilometers in the 1997-98 fiscal year, 552
kilometers longer than the previous year, bringing electricity to
323 towns and 1,087 villages.
</P>
<P>
Despite the increase in power generation, electricity supply is
still far from meeting the country's demand as the economy is
developing with more involvement of the private sector and foreign
 investors.
</P>
<P>
In the face of the power shortage, especially in the capital of
Yangon where industry is under development, the authorities have
urged the public to cut down the use of electricity. They said
some power stations in the country have to reduce their production
in view of two consecutive years of scarcity of rain in northern
Myanmar and the falling water level of dams.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the authorities are expected to take measures to
meet the power demand such as exploring hydroelectric power
potentials to increase installed capacity, expanding natural-gas
power generating plants and setting up power distribution joint

<P>
LUANDA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Angola's opposition party, the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) still
wishes for the realization of peace in the country, a United
Nations official said.
</P>
<P>
Kofi Obeng, the UN official who is temporarily taking the
place of UN representative to Angola, Blondin Beye, who died in a
plane crash, said that his talks with UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi
was "positive".
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Wimhewst said that the joint committee of Angola peace process

<P>
Meanwhile, Paul Hare, U.S. President Bill Clinton's special

<HEADLINE> 40 Million Babies Born Unregistered Annually in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 9 (Xinhua) -- About 40 million babies, or one third
of the births in the world, are born unregistered annually due to
national and regional turmoils, leaving them in unfavorable
conditions, according to a U.N. report released here.
</P>
<P>
"Every day, the right to nationality is jeopardized for
millions of children born in countries undergoing political
turmoil," Jordanian Queen Noor told the closing ceremony of the
18th Arab Children's Congress on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Noor was commissioned to deliver the report of the United
Nations Children's Fund on progress of nations in 1998 at the
conference, the semi-official Jordan Times Daily said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In many countries, a child without proof of birth can not be
vaccinated, treated at a health center or enrolled in school, the
Jordanian queen said.
</P>
<P>
Each year, 2 million children die from vaccine-preventable
diseases and the sustainability of immunization is now threatened
by the increase of the unregistered babies, though child
immunization rate in developing countries has increased from 5
percent in 1980 to nearly 80 percent these days, Noor said.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's birth registration rate stands at 90 percent, primary
school enrollment rate reaches 92 percent and the immunization
rates for polio and measles are both over 90 percent, she added.

BEIJING, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Government at various levels and
various trade sectors throughout China are introducing effective
measures to create new job opportunities for laid-off workers,
according to today's People's Daily, China's leading national
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Northwest China's Shaanxi Province had helped 140,000

<HEADLINE> Liaoning Neighborhood Committees Assist Laid-Off Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Some 150,000 laid-off workers in
northeast China's Liaoning Province are expected to find new jobs
this year with the help of the province's urban neighborhood
committees,
</P>
<P>
The province recently issued a circular introducing an
extensive campaign of select advanced urban neighborhood
committees which are responsible for helping laid-off workers find
new jobs.
</P>
<P>
Chinese workers declared redundant by enterprises are paying
increasing attention to economic efficiency required by the market
economy.
</P>
<P>
The central government and various social organizations such as
trade unions, women's federations and the Communist Youth League
organizations have spared no effort to help laid-off workers find
new jobs.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning, an old heavy industrial base established under the
planned economy, is home to 10 percent of China's medium to large
state enterprises. Some 1.2 million workers, including 800,000
workers currently employed by state-owned enterprises, will loose
their jobs over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning helped 1.236 million unemployed people, including
workers laid off by enterprises, find new jobs between
1994-1997. The province plans to help an additional 400,000
unemployed people find new jobs in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Urban neighborhood committees maintain close contacts with
Chinese urbanites and their efforts to help unemployed workers
find new jobs as quickly as possible will undoubtedly contribute
to ensuring a stable society, according to an official from the
Liaoning Labor Bureau.
</P>
<P>
He cited the Tiexi District in Shenyang, the provincial
capital, as a prime example. He pointed out that the district's
445 neighborhood committees have opened 4,628 service centers
which have created over 8,000 new job opportunities.

<P>
SHANGHAI, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The turnover on the Shanghai

the first half of the year, according to statistics released by
the China Foreign Exchange Trading System.
</P>
<P>
The volume represented a daily trade volume of 252 million US
dollars during the January-June period. A further breakdown reveals
that trade involved 29.2 billion US dollars, 13.1 billion Hong
Kong dollars, and 43 billion Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
US dollars accounted for 94 percent of the period transaction
volume, with the Hong Kong dollar accounting for five percent and
Japanese currency one percent.
</P>
<P>
US dollar exchange rates during the period ranged from 8.779 to
8.2800 yuan Renminbi. The rate on June 30, the final trading day for
the first half of the year, closed at 8.2797 yuan, a level which

<HEADLINE> Inter-Bank Interest Rates Drop in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The average inter-bank interest
rates in the money market dropped last week to 20,66 percent from
29.10 percent in the previous week, the Central Bank of Kenya
(CBK) says.
</P>
<P>
The CBK data issued Wednesday showed that the rate moved from
25.67 percent at the beginning of the week on June 29 to 18.30
percent last week, an indication of increased liquidity in the
market.
</P>
<P>
Interest rate for the 91-day Treasury bill fell further to
24.92 percent last week, compared to 25.12 percent in the
previous auction.
</P>
<P>
The CBK Chief Economist, Maurice Kanga, said that as a result
of a general decline in interest rates, a number of commercial
banks had lowered their base lending rates resulting in a
reduction in the overall average rate to 27.8 percent from 27.97
percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Shilling remained strong against the hard
currencies.
</P>
<P>
The average exchange rate against the U.S. Dollars was 59.43
while against the Sterling Pound, the Shilling traded a 98.34
Shillings compared to 59.50 Shillings and 99.26 Shillings
respectively in the previous week.
</P>
<P>
Banking sources said the market was expected to remain at
about the same levels throughout the week as market players look
for new factors to influence the level of the exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
"However, dividend payments from corporates towards the end of
the month (July) may ignite some reaction and put pressure on the
local unit," dealers said.
</P>
<P>
A weekend report by Loita Asset Management said the onset of
the new cash ratio requirement saw interest rates fall to around
20 percent.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the reduction of the cash ratio from 15
percent to 14 percent which commences on July 15 should see
increased liquidity for banks and also ease interbank rates.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Army Blames MILF Rebels for Skirmishes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine army has blamed the
Moro Islamic Liberation Front's (MILF) "loose control" over its
men as the reason behind the clashes between the two sides in
Buldon of Maguindanao Province, the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Major Rosque Garingalao, spokesman of the army's Sixth Infantry
Division in the south, said Thursday that the MILF usually starts
"trouble" in Buldon by launching small-scale harassment on
military detachments which later would balloon to intense levels.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that despite the continuous sporadic
skirmishes, the army remains optimistic that ongoing talks between
the government and the MILF will eventually succeed.
</P>
<P>
He said for its part, the national government has continuously
been implementing development projects in Camp Abubakar, the
MILF's biggest base in Mindanao, "for confidence-building
measures."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Garingalao said, all the soldiers have been ordered
to strictly abide by the ground rules of a cease-fire agreement
both parties signed in April last year.
</P>
<P>
"Every soldier has been ordered to strictly respect the
cease-fire agreement." he said.
</P>
<P>
Al Haj Murad, MILF vice-military chief meanwhile expressed joy
over the army's announcement to obey the truce agreement, but
denied that the MILF forces started animosities in Buldon in the
past.
</P>
<P>
"Not one, I could not remember of a case where our men started
any trouble," he said. He urged the military to monitor whether or
not the cessation order is really being implemented by its men in
the field.
</P>
<P>
The MILF is currently the largest rebel group in the
Philippines. The 12,000-strong insurgency group has been engaged
in low-level talks with the government during the past few years,
but has made little progress in reaching a final peace agreement.

LOS ANGELES, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Hewlett-Packard(HP), a computer
maker based in California, hired 1,000 people from Web
applications last year.
</P>
<P>
The number was a significant portion of HP's total hires, said
the Internet hiring leader which employs 123,000 people worldwide.
</P>
<P>
HP is not alone in using Internet as a recruiting tool. In
fact, the information superhighway is becoming the American way to
employment. Hiring advertisements, resumes, job listings, training
sessions and notices of career fairs and workshops are
continuously shooting through cyberspace. On-line observers
estimate Internet job postings more than doubled this year in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Many companies and organizations offer on-line application
forms on their Web sites, usually under the entry of "employment."
</P>
<P>
HP's home page offers detailed job description, minimum and
desired qualifications for a certain job, so that applicants can
measure themselves in terms of their interest, background and
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
Under R&AMP;D, for instance, hardware design engineer, software
design engineer and firmware design engineer are listed as job
titles, and each has a digital code seemingly for relevant
managers to easily pickup their needed applicants.
</P>
<P>
The Internet is the only way to get some jobs, such as soft
ware and network engineering positions. A great variety of job
seekers uses CareerMosaic to access the site's 70,000 job
listings. Apart from high-tech and tech-oriented jobs, the site
places short-order cooks, health care workers, financial planners
and box packers. The site averages 450,000 hits a day.
</P>
<P>
A month-long CareerMosaic ad cost only 160 U.S. dollars, while
other forms of advertising might run as high as 8,000 dollars a
day.
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, even people without PCs use the Internet to search
for jobs. The growth of terminals at libraries, cybercafes and
schools encourages public access.

<HEADLINE> Beijing's Laid-off Women Find New Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 9 (Xinhua) -- About three quarters of Beijing's
laid-off women have obtained new jobs in the past two years,
according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Latest survey conducted by the Beijing Women's Federation found
that 67,000 recently laid-off women -- 76 percent of the total --
and 22,000 previously unemployed women -- about two thirds of the
total -- have found new jobs. Those who had worked for the State
received unemployment benefits.
</P>
<P>
More than half of the 197,000 employees laid-off or sacked in
the capital last years were women.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Yarong, director of the Women's Right Department of
Beijing Women's Federation, is quoted as saying that China's women
wokers had a harder time than men under the country's economic
restructuring and the reform of State-owned enterprises because
they often held low-skill jobs in hard-hit industries such as
textiles.
</P>
<P>
To tackle the problem, the department set up a service center
for unemployed women two years ago. Since then, the center and
district branches throughout the city have provided vocational
training and job information to more than 20,000 women. Over 3,000
found new jobs with their help.
</P>
<P>
Most found jobs in their communities, including working as
domestics.
</P>
<P>
"Most laid-off women workers have changed their mentality,
which has made our work much easier than before," Zhou said. But
there is a new problem, protecting women's rights at their new
jobs.
</P>
<P>
Many of them are assigned to short-term jobs with little job
security, and more and more contract disputes have appeared
recently, Zhou added.

COLOMBO, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's first wind power
project will be launched Thursday in Hambantota, about 130 km
south of Colombo, according to the Power and Energy Ministry.
</P>
<P>
A total of 3.9 million U.S. dollars will be spent on the
project which is expected to add a generation capacity of three
megawatts to the national electricity grid by April next year.
</P>

The foreign cost of the project will be financed by a soft loan
from the International Development Association of the World Bank
and a grant from the Global Environment Facility, the ministry
said.
</P>
<P>
There is a potential for wind power in Sri Lanka's south
eastern coastal belt to supply over 200 megawatt-hours of
electricity.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said the government, while looking seriously into
the possibility of creating a feasible balance between the hydro
and thermal generation capacity in the country, also hopes to
speed up the development of wind power.

Thursday, quoting a statement from the central bank.

The country's total overseas obligations were composed of 54.4

U.S. dollars in debt belonging to the private sector and
state-owned companies, Bank Indonesia (BI) said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
The growing foreign debt was mainly due to a 6.8 billion U.S.
dollar rise in non-bank private corporate debt, the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
Noted economist Mohammad Sadli told reporters Wednesday that
the country's huge foreign debt burden would make Indonesia more
dependent on foreign aid to lift it out of the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia would also be under the "treatment" of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank for more than
five years, meaning that the country would have to embrace the
international agencies' liberal economic paradigm, he added.
</P>
<P>
BI also announced that the country's net foreign exchange
reserves totaled 14.74 billion U.S. dollars as of July 3.
</P>

The amount is 132.9 million U.S. dollars higher than that of

If the La Nina phenomenon would last longer than one to two
months, there are reasons for concern because a large
precipitation could be expected to occur in the August-December
period and eventually cause floods, he said.
</P>
<P>
La Nina is the reverse of the El Nino effect and is associated
with colder-than-normal surface temperatures in the eastern
Pacific Ocean. The El Nino effect, which is said to be the most
severe in 50 years, aggravated forest fires in Indonesia's Sumatra
and Kalimantan Islands last year. Over 5 million hectares of
forest were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
According to the July 1998 weather evaluation and forecast,
since early last month there has been a shift in the global
weather from the El Nino phenomenon to the La Nina phenomenon in
the form of a decline in temperature which would last until March
1999, Haryanto said.

<HEADLINE> More Public Telephone Sets in Lhasa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The increase of public telephone sets
in Lhasa, capital of the Tibet Autonomous Region, offers local
residents more access to modern communications and opens a market
potential for businessmen, according to officials with the Lhasa
Bureau of Posts and Telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
In the streets of Lhasa, whenever a pedestrian receives a
beeper call, a nearby telephone booth will be available, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
A businessman named Jiang said after he opened his telephone
booth, a dozen neighboring shopkeepers gave up their plan of
telephone subscription.
</P>
<P>
"My telephone booth gets even more business on weekends or on
public holidays, and more than 100 telephone calls can be made on
a Sunday," he said.
</P>
<P>
With a population of 130,000, Lhasa has 950 public telephone
sets, and there is a public telephone available every 100 meters
in the downtown area.
</P>
<P>
Public telephone booths began to appear in Lhasa in 1992. In
the following three years, the local telecommunications bureau
adopted preferential policies such as free telephone installation
to encourage urban residents to have public telephone booths.
</P>
<P>
The increased living standard also has boosted the expansion of
telephone service. The local government has poured several billion
yuan into telecommunications construction in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show there are 2.41 telephone sets for every 100
people in the region, and 23.56 telephone sets for every 100
people in Lhasa city.

<HEADLINE> Hungary's New Cabinet Sworn in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, July 8 (Xinhua) -- In just two days after the
swearing in oath taken by Prime Minister Orban Viktor, the
18-member new cabinet was sworn in Wednesday afternoon at the
parliamentary building.
</P>
<P>
President Goencz Arpad issued the letter of appointment for all
the cabinet members and presided over the inaugural ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The new cabinet was the third government and the youngest one
since 1990. The average age of the members is only 49.6 years old.
</P>
<P>
The Fidesz-MPP party, headed by Orban, won 148 seats in the
386-seat National Assembly during legislative elections in May.
</P>
<P>
It has forged a coalition with the rural-based Independent
Smallholder's Party, with 48 seats, and the conservative Hungarian
Democratic Forum with 17 seats.
</P>
<P>
Born in Szekesfehervar, a city 50 kilometers southwest of
Budapest, Orban became a founding member of the Fidesz-MPP in
1988, at the age of 25.
</P>
<P>
He was elected into the National Assembly in 1990, rose to the
chair of the Fidesz-MPP in 1993 and became a parliamentary member
again in 1994, heading the commission for European integration
affairs.

<HEADLINE> Workers Need Updated Skills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Technicians laid off from
state-owned firms are ready to take on new jobs after acquiring
updated, higher-level skills, a senior scientific official said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Association for Science and Technology (CAST) will
serve as the link helping technicians to find new jobs, Zhou
Guangzhao, president of the association and also vice-chairman of
the Standing Committee of the Ninth National People's Congress,
was cited by today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
CAST, the largest non-governmental organization focusing on the
dissemination of science and technology, is well known as "the
home of scientists and technicians".
</P>
<P>
"Laid-off technicians are still an important component part of
the country's scientific teams. Science and technology
associations across the country will provide them with more
employment information," said Zhou.
</P>
<P>
Some of dozens of regional science and technology associations
from all over the country have taken steps to give higher-level
professional training to those laid-off.
</P>
<P>
For example, in Hebei Province, Haiyan Secondary Technical
School provides free training for laid-off workers. The school has
trained 6,800 unemployment workers in maintenance skills for
household electrical appliances, who provide useful services for
local residents.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent CAST survey, the 403 State-owned firms
surveyed employ 223,000 technicians. Some 11,000, or 4.9 percent
of them, have been laid off. And 90 percent of those laid-off are
workers with low technical skills, the survey has indicated.

<HEADLINE> Five Ethnic Albanians Killed in Conflict in Border Village </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRISTINA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Five ethnic Albanians were killed
and several other wounded Wednesday as a result of a heaviest
attack launched by Serb police against a long-besieged separatist
enclave on the Albanian border, the Associated Press quoted ethnic
Albanian sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The ethnic Albanian Kosovo Information Center was quoted as
saying the escalation of fighting around the mountainous border
village of Morina was accompanied by Serb shelling of at least
four other area villages.
</P>
<P>
The assault appears to be an attempt to cut off Kosovo Albanian
militants from Albania, which believed to be the main source of
weapons for ethnic Albanian separatists in the breakaway
province. The report has not been confirmed by the Yugoslav
government.
</P>
<P>
More than 300 people have been killed in Kosovo since ethnic
Albanian separatists intensified their separatist campaign in
February. Kosovo is a province in northern Serbia with 90 percent
of its 1.8 million population ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
The fighting came amid international efforts to resume talks
between the Yugoslav federal government and ethnic Albanian
separatists.
</P>
<P>
The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation has threatened to use
military action to restore peace in the troubled area if peace
talks fail.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Sells Life Insurance Policy for Mortgage Borrowers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, China's largest
metropolis, has begun selling a special life insurance policy for
home buyers who take out mortgage loans.
</P>
<P>
The policy, available to people between 18 and 55 years old, is
designed to prevent insolvency due to the death or injury of the
borrower.
</P>
<P>
The policy is for the same term as the mortgage, according to
the Shanghai branch of the Life Insurance Company under the
People's Insurance Company of China (PICC) Group.
</P>
<P>
This policy has been welcomed by both borrowers and local
banks, as the first half of this year saw a rapid growth in the
number of mortgage borrowers in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai branch of the China Construction Bank, which
accounts for 90 percent of the local mortgage market, recorded
3.42 billion yuan (about 412 million US dollars) in mortgage loans
for housing in the first half of the year, an increase of more

<HEADLINE> Chongqing Enhances Int'l Cooperation in Environment Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Chongqing
Municipality has increased international cooperation in
environmental protection and the effort is beginning to pay off.
</P>
<P>
Beginning in the early 1990s, Chongqing arranged coorperation
with foreign environmental businesses and research institutions by
way of importing their technologies and expertise.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the city launched a project to treat industrial
pollution and reorganize businesses with the aid of a World Bank
loan of 170 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing environmental experts, World Bank officials and
scientists from the United States and Britain have now begun to
study air quality, solid waste and industrial waste water in the
city.
</P>
<P>
The city was also granted a 250 million US dollar loan from the
World Bank for improving the urban environment. This includes
building a sewage treatment plant, a running water plant and
underground water network and garbage treatment facilities.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing's air pollution and acid rain problems are among the
most serious in the world. Five years ago, the Japanese city of
Hiroshima set up a research center to monitor acid rain. As a
result, Chongqing will receive 100 million US dollars in loans
from Japan for air pollution control over the next several years.
</P>
<P>
In addition,Chongqing has signed contracts with foreign cities
on environment-related training programs, desulphurization, noise
control and water pollution control for sections of the Yangtze
and Jialing rivers.
</P>
<P>
Experts predict that the city's air quality will meet state-set
standards sometime early in the next century.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Pakistan Govt Faces Uphill Task of Ending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government is
facing an uphill task of restoring peace and harmony in the
southern port city of Karachi where people have been living in a
nightmare of murders and bomb blasts for a long time.
</P>
<P>
According to figures in the Pakistani press, as many as 3,598
people have been killed in the past three years as a result of
violence in Karachi, the commercial and industrial center of this
South Asian nation.
</P>
<P>
In June this year alone, a renewed wave of violence claimed 178
lives, an average of six killings each day.
</P>
<P>
"The deteriorating law and order has stifled the economic
growth of the country," said Muhammad Hanif Janoo, president of
the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industries, shortly after
former minister Zuhair Akram Nadeem was shot dead by a group of
unidentified gunmen on July 4 in the violence-plagued city.
</P>
<P>
Contributing about 20 percent of the national gross domestic
product, 40 percent of the federal tax revenues and 80 percent of
the provincial tax revenues, the Sindh provincial capital with a
population of 12 million is the economic engine and commercial
lifeline of Pakistan, which is striving for its economic revival.
</P>
<P>
However, violence has paralyzed the city. People keep staying
at home as much as possible and many shops, markets and commercial
centers frequently shut down because of terrorist acts, causing
huge losses to businessmen and damaging the trade and investment
environment of the whole country.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here noted that the economic price Pakistan is paying
for Karachi's uncontrollable drift will rise as time passes. The
government should take swift action before it is too late, they
warned.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that much of the unrest in Karachi is attributed
to the growing feud between the two rival factions within the
Muhajir Qaumi Movement (MQM) led respectively by Altaf Hussain
(MQM-A) and Afaq Ahmed (MQM-H), although differences among
political, religious, sectarian and ethnic groups in the city also
result in various kinds of violence.
</P>
<P>
According to police, many of the deaths as a result of the
violence in Karachi were linked to the lingering conflict between
the two MQM factions.
</P>
<P>
Occupying 28 seats in the 109-member Sindh Assembly in contrast
to the 14 held by the ruling Pakistan Muslim League (PML-N) led by
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, the MQM is now a major partner of the
PML-N in the provincial coalition government.
</P>
<P>
Since the PML-N government took power in February, 1997, the
MQM has asked for withdrawal of cases against "innocent" MQM
workers, and demanded punishment of those involved in judicial
killings of MQM workers and compensation to the families of the
victims.
</P>
<P>
Trying to keep its alliance with the MQM in the Sindh
government, the PML-N government has vowed to take steps to end
terrorist activities in Karachi and bring peace back to the city.
</P>
<P>
Following a series of official meetings for charting a strategy
to counter the growing violence, the Sindh government was given a
free hand to deal with the deteriorating law and order situation
and a six-member committee headed by Sindh Chief Minister Liaquat
Ali Jatoi was set up.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the government announced sweeping powers for
the 5,800 paramilitary rangers deployed in the mega city.
</P>
<P>
Under the powers, the paramilitary troops will carry out raids
and arrest suspects jointly with police in troubled areas of the
city.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that with the reinforcement and augmentation of
the police and by posting out good officers, the situation in the
city would improve.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the government has moved to resolve some
matters relating to the MQM. In January this year, for example,
the government withdrew non-bailable arrest warrants issued in
1995 against Altaf Hussain in connection with the murder of two
Americans.
</P>
<P>
All cases against 500 MQM activists have also been withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a Cases Review Committee with the MQM representation
has been set up which meets regularly to review cases filed
against the MQM.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe that the government's political will and
determination play a key role in restoring peace and harmony in
Karachi.
</P>
<P>
While firm and effective administrative measures are needed to
crush terrorists in the city, comprehensive talks should also be
undertaken to find a political solution to the festering problem,
they said.

<HEADLINE> INTERPOL Calls Conference on Car Theft Insurance Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- More than 30 countries will join an
international conference on insurance fraud and car theft in
Sofia, Bulgaria in September, a representative of the
International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL) said here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Hans Faleneger, of the General Secretariat of INTERPOL, said
the European Union, the United States and Canada will attend the
conference organized by INTERPOL and the Bulgarian government.
</P>
<P>
Leading world insurance agencies and insurers' associations are
also expected to attend, Faleneger said.
</P>
<P>
He said every year about 1.5 million to 1.6 million automobiles
are stolen in the EU, half of them just disappearing forever.
</P>
<P>
It is very difficult to detect stolen cars subject to insurance
fraud, he said. This was because an owner may sell a car to
traffickers and then report the "theft" to the local police.
</P>
<P>
In some countries such an owner is paid the insurance indemnity
within one month, he said.
</P>
<P>
Large insurance agencies have smoothly running machinery for
tracing such cars. Problems still exist, however, as the domestic
legislation of certain countries recognizes the status of an
innocent purchaser.
</P>
<P>
Faleneger said INTERPOL decided to hold the conference in Sofia
because it appreciated the government's efforts and cooperation
with the organization to counter car theft.
</P>
<P>
Since December 1 last year, all used cars imported into
Bulgaria have been mandatorily checked against the wanted list,
and INTERPOL gives positive marks to the action by Sofia,
Faleneger said.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria also is one of 22 countries which have given
INTERPOL access to its data base on stolen automobiles, he said.

<HEADLINE> Inner Mongolia's Yellow River Area Producing More Grain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The irrigated area at the great bend
of the Yellow River in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous
Region has become a "three-high" agricultural demonstration zone
as a result of the implementation of a comprehensive agricultural
development program.
</P>
<P>
Three-high agriculture features high output, high quality and
high efficiency, qualities which have been heralded as the future
of China's agricultural development.
</P>
<P>
Some 73,000 hectares of land have been upgraded or reclaimed
for farming since the comprehensive agricultural development
program was first launched in 1992, according to the Comprehensive
Agricultural Development Office of the Bayannur League, the
organization responsible for the irrigated area at the great bend
of the Yellow River, commonly known as the Hetao Area.
</P>
<P>
According to authorities, the output of grain, oil and sugar
for consumption of one cu m of water has gone up from 0.0175 kg
six years ago to the present 0.56 kg.  The total output of grain
and legumes has also increased from 71 million kg six years ago to
the present 1.5 billion kg.
</P>
<P>
Under the comprehensive agricultural development program, more
irrigation and drainage works have been built along 330,000
hectares of farmland to facilitate efficient irrigation.
</P>
<P>
Some 66 million U.S. dollars worth of loans from the World Bank
have been used to finance a project designed to build
supporting facilities in the Hetao area. This investment has helped
construct irrigation systems and drainage works along 200,000
hectares of farmland, improved 39,000 hectares of alkaline land
and upgraded 54,000 hectares of low-yield land.
</P>
<P>
While intensifying water management, the Hetao area has also
utilized many advanced water-efficient technologies over 27,000
hectares of farmland.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The east China provinces of
Zhejiang and Jiangsu have announced plans to jointly construct an
expressway linking Jiaxing's Zhapu Port in the former with Suzhou
in the latter.
</P>
<P>
Construction will begin in April 1999 and the project will be
completed at a projected cost of 1.93 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
An official from Zhapu Development Zone said the expressway
will promote construction of the port and provide a convenient
transportation channel for areas in southern Jiangsu.
</P>
<P>
The Nanjing-Shanghai Expressway has opened traffic in the
Yangtze River Delta and construction on the
Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Expressway is proceeding smoothly.
</P>
<P>
Zhapu Port is located on the northern shores of Hangzhou Bay in
the Yangtze Delta some 100 km distant from Shanghai, Hangzhou,
Suzhou and Ningbo.
</P>
<P>
The port has seven berths in operation and plans to increase
its annual handling capacity to 50 million tons by the year
2010. Zhapu is expected to become a major component of the

<HEADLINE> Forbidden City Opera to Resound Worldwide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The sounds of Puccini's opera
"Turandot", recounting the spell-binding story of a Chinese
princess, will resound in her legendary home of Beijing's
Forbidden City in September.
</P>
<P>
Famous Chinese film director Zhang Yimou and one of the world's
leading opera conductors Zubin Mehta will join forces to create
one of the century's last major operatic events, according to
today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The combination of these two talents will attract 15,000 to
20,000 opera fans from all over the world to the Imperial
Ancestral Temple, according to Michael Ecker, the opera's
executive producer, at a press conference yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Ecker is representing Opera On Original Site Inc From
Switzerland, which has worked closely with the China Performing
Arts Agency to make the project come to fruition.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 1 billion viewers worldwide will watch the show
live on television, he said.
</P>
<P>
The performance will also help realize the long-cherished dream
of many artists and opera fans to see Turandot in her own home.
</P>
<P>
"Turandot", one of the most popular and frequently performed of
Puccini's operas, was developed from what Westerners believe to
be a Chinese fairy tale. It tells how a Persian prince thaws the
revenge and hatred of Chinese princess Turandot, and wins her heart
with his love in the Forbidden City.
</P>
<P>
"I am extremely excited that my dream performance of "Turandot'
in its original setting is coming true," said Zubin Mehta in
Munich via videophone.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that the staging of "Turandot' in Beijing will
further demonstrate that the arts, whether opera or film, are the
best media for people of different cultures and histories to
communicate with each other and to share their feelings and
emotions," said Zhang Yimou, the director of the production.
</P>
<P>
Total investment in the project is estimated at 15 million US
dollars (or 124.5 million Renminbi yuan).

<HEADLINE> HK Mobile Hospital Helps Poor People Regain Eyesight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Maomao had lived in darkness since
he was born two years ago. That was when a train equipped with
state-of-the-art medical equipment arrived in his hometown in east
China's Fujian Province and he underwent eye surgery free of
charge.
</P>
<P>
When Maomao gained his sight, the first thing he saw was the
bright rainbow painted on the train -- the Lifeline Express from
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The mobile eye hospital, which was made possible by donations
from Hong Kong residents, became operational on July 1, 1997. Its
doctors have performed cataract removal operations for 2,000
people in poor areas of the Chinese inland provinces of Anhui,
Sichuan, Hubei and Fujian.
</P>
<P>
Apart from eye surgery, doctors on the Lifeline Express also
provide treatment to people with polio, give health advice to
local people and help train local medical personnel, according to
sources with the Ministry of Health.
</P>
<P>
Some social groups and charity funds in Hong Kong are
considering donating a second mobile hospital to give more poor
people access to free medical treatment, the sources said.

<HEADLINE> China Takes Measures to Ensure Grain Harvest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government has taken
a series of measures to maintain farmers' enthusiasm in growing
grain though the country has achieved grain harvest goals for
three consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
This is important for an agricultural state which has to feed a
population of 1.2 billion, 22 percent of the world's total, with
its one-seventh of the farmland on earth, said an agricultural
expert.
</P>
<P>
The government has set a minimum purchase price for summer
grain this year in a bid to prevent farmers' losses in the wake of
successive harvests. It will bring an additional income of 2-to-3
billion yuan to farmers in central China's Henan Province, a major
wheat producer in China.
</P>
<P>
Leading grain-producing areas including Shandong, Henan and
Hebei provinces have encouraged farmers to adopt intercropping and
apply more modern agro-techniques, which have been proved to
increase the multiple-crop area by 170-to-260 percent.
</P>
<P>
The central government has encouraged grain-producing areas to
export highly finished products such as instant noodles instead of
food grain. In this way, farmers would be able to yield a higher
profit from growing grain crops.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan May Consider Moratorium on Debt Repayment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Finance Minister Sirtaj Aziz said
Wednesday that Pakistan might consider placing a moratorium on
debt repayment if the sanctions against it were prolonged and
applied to international financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
"First of all it depends if the sanctions last more than three
months and whether they apply to international financial
institutions," he told journalists here after announcing the
results of Census '98.
</P>
<P>
If the sanctions are prolonged and are applied to the
international institutions, "then we will seriously consider a
moratorium on debt repayment," said the finance minister.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said: "We are trying to avoid it but if we don't get new
money, we can not go servicing the debt."
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question, Aziz said Pakistan gets 3 billion
U.S. dollars in aid every year and pays the same amount on annual
debt repayment.
</P>
<P>
"So if you get 1.5 billion dollars (as a result of sanctions
over the nuclear tests) how can you pay back 3 billion dollars on
annual debt. Nothing net has been left with us. All the assistance
we receive we pay back as debt servicing," said Aziz.
</P>
<P>
He said Pakistan has met every conditionality set by the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) on June 30, 1998.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday's meeting with IMF officials in Lahore, Aziz
declined to comment but said they wanted to help but they had been
prevented.
</P>
<P>
"Our stand is that the sanctions should not apply to
international institutions," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are persuading them that if you do this to a country which
has performed well, whose program was on track which was forced to
go for nuclear option as we did not initiate the whole thing, so
why create another crisis. You virtually (are) engineering the
crisis," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the IMF officials have been told that international
sanctions against Pakistan should not apply to the IMF. While they
substantially agree with it, they are subject to their own major
creditor countries.

<HEADLINE> China Ready to Open up Telecommunications Market (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 9 (Xinhua) -- China's new Ministry of Information
Industry (MII) plans to open up gradually the country's
telecommunications market to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent re-organization plan, MII will have 13
departments and one of their major functions will be to make
China's telecommunications industry more international.
</P>
<P>
One way to do that will be to separate the telecommunications
sector from the postal sector, a move that is expected to allow
China to open up its postal market first.
</P>
<P>
"China will open up all kinds of its postal services, except
for letters, in the next few years," director of the State
Postal Service Bureau Liu Liqing said, adding that China has
made express mail and other services competitive and open to
overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
The Minister of the Information Industry Wu Jichuan said that
the telecommunications equipment business has already become one of
the most open and competitive markets in China. A tenth of the
American company Motorola's global sales are in China, and
Germany's Siemens is expected to have annual sales of 1.5 billion
Mark in China by the year 2000.

China spent 124.5 billion yuan (about 15 billion U.S. dollars)
on posts and telecommunications infrastructure in 1997 and, MOFTEC
says, the country imported nearly 6 billion U.S. dollars worth of
electronic and telecommunications equipment.
</P>
<P>
The market is still growing and Chinese spending is expected to
exceed 150 billion yuan this year, while business in these sectors
is expected to grow 28 percent over last year.
</P>
<P>
Chinese officials said at a telecommunications forum in Geneva
in March that, as China continues its re-organization of
government institutions and industry and its infrastructure
development, it will open up its telecommunications when
conditions are ripe.
</P>
<P>
Bell Atlantic, the world's largest telephone directory
publisher, has become the first foreign company in China's
telecommunications market. The U.S. giant became the sole agent of
yellow page advertisements in Shanghai by setting up a joint
venture with the local telecommunications administration in May.
</P>
<P>
Wu told an APEC ministerial meeting on telecommunications and
the information industry in Singapore in June that China is ready
to increase international cooperation in these fields and proposed
that APEC members jointly develop standards for wide-band
multi-media communications and e-commerce and study tariff and
settlement arrangements on the basis of equality and mutual
benefits.
</P>
<P>
A China Telecom official said earlier that at present, the
Chinese government still has remarkable influence on
telecommunications fees and expressed the hope that, as the
country's telecommunications market opens wider, a more flexible
fee system will come into being and allow China to use
telecommunications as a major lever in trade with other
countries.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Forum Gives Priority to Developing Countries' Woes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Economic
and Social Council (ECOSOC) said Wednesday that it was deeply
concerned about the continued marginalization of the least developed
countries in the globalization process.
</P>
<P>
"Arresting and reversing their marginalization and promoting
their expeditious integration into the world economy constitute an
ethical imperative for the international community," it said in a
ministerial communique at the end of a 3-day high-level dialogue.
</P>
<P>
The forum dealt with "market access: developments since the
Uruguay Round, implications, opportunities and challenges, in
particular for the developing countries, the least developed among
them, in the context of globalization and liberalization".
</P>
<P>
The council stressed the importance of effective application by
all members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) of the
provisions of the Final Act Embodying the Results of the Uruguay
Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations, by taking into account
the specific interests of developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The Generalized System of preferences (GSP) remains a major
instrument for further improving market access of developing
countries and there is scope and need for further improvement of
the GSP, the communique said.
</P>
<P>
The dialogue participants noted that multilateral trade
agreements have contributed to security of market access for WTO
members, but "such security is not enjoyed by non-members".
</P>
<P>
They emphasized the importance of attainment of the universality
of the multilateral trading system and the need for WTO member
governments and international organizations to provide assistance
to non-members of WTO to facilitate their efforts to be acceded to
the body.

<HEADLINE> Census Bureau Reports Successful Dress Rehearsal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Administration officials
Wednesday proclaimed a number of dress rehearsals for Census 2000
successful.
</P>
<P>
"I am pleased to report that we have met or exceeded our
expectations at each site," Acting Census Director James F. Holmes
said Wednesday at a press briefing here.
</P>
<P>
But Secretary William M. Daley of the Commerce Department, the
bureau's parent agency, warned that while the three practice
counts went well, congressional delays in funding the agency could
jeopardize the main event, scheduled to start for April 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
A dispute over methods to be used in the count among
legislators could stall action on the bureau's budget.
</P>
<P>
"They ought to separate out the political fight from the actual
running and operation of the census," Daley said. "If Congress is
going to have a fight and vote on what method should be used, they
should do that and not hold the Census Bureau hostage."
</P>
<P>
In the dress rehearsals the bureau used the traditional system
in one area and its proposed sampling technology in others. The
initial work is the same for both methods, sending out
questionnaires and contacting people who fail to respond.
</P>
<P>
Congressional Republicans are concerned that sampling will
increase the count of groups that tend to vote Democratic. Since
the Census results are used to distribute seats in the House of
Representatives and draw congressional district lines, they fear
this could lead to a loss of seats in the House.
</P>
<P>
Sampling involves the use of a sample of people missed in the
original count to estimate the number and characteristics of
others who have not been counted.
</P>
<P>
Contending that this doesn't meet the Constitutional
requirement for an enumeration, Republicans have filed suit to
block that method.
</P>
<P>
Because the Census is a massive undertaking that requires much
planning and preparation, Daley is pressing for prompt approval of
the agency's spending plans so it can be ready, regardless of
which method is finally chosen.
</P>
<P>
The overall cost of Census 2000 is expected to be about four
billion dollars if sampling is used and 4.7 billion dollars if the
traditional head count is taken.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls for Gun-Safety Measures in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton on
Wednesday called on states and the U.S. Congress to impose stiffer
penalties against gun owners who let their weapons fall into the
hands of children and prevent handgun sales to minors.
</P>
<P>
Clinton make the call following a series of school shootings in
various states in the country that resulted in 15 deaths and
dozens of injuries.
</P>
<P>
The president also pledged federal assistance to a Maryland
program aimed at tracing every gun seized by police.
</P>
<P>
"As parents, public officials, citizens, we simply cannot allow
easy access to weapons that kill," Clinton said at a ceremony that
put a human face on the problem of gun violence in schools.
</P>
<P>
"This recent series of killings in our schools has seared the
heart of America about as much as anything I can remember in a
long, long time," Clinton said. "It is still too easy for deadly
weapons to wind up in the hands of children... and then, to lead
to tragedy."
</P>
<P>
In addition, the U.S. Treasury Department, through its Bureau
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, will join with the state of
Maryland in the gun-tracing program.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also highlighted the warning-sign regulations,
developed in response to an order by the president in June 1997
and released by the Treasury Department on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Albright Steps up Pressure on Israel over Withdrawal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The United States has
intensified its effort to revive the deadlocked Middle East
peace process, the State Department said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman James Rubin told reporters that Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright had called Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu four times over the weekend, twice on Tuesday and once
on Wednesday, each time for a half-hour to an hour.
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, we are in an intensified effort," he said. But he
cautioned that "We have no knowledge that this will yield
success."
</P>
<P>
Analysts said Albright had stepped up pressure on Israel to
accept a U.S. proposal, turning an additional 13 percent of the
West Bank over to the Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has so far rejected the proposal on the pretext
that it would jeopardize Israeli security.
</P>
<P>
This week he indicated, however, that he was close to
accepting the U.S. proposal provided the Palestinian Authority
commits itself to combat terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Albright also talked once to Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat
on Wednesday in her "intensive end-game negotiations" to seek
stronger Palestinian measures against terrorism, Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
Albright hoped that Israel and the Palestinians would
immediately enter into the final status negotiations once the
two parties reach agreement over Israel's withdrawal and
Palestinians' measures against terrorism, Rubin said.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Baltic States to Strengthen Military Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The United States and the three
Baltic states agreed Wednesday to strengthen their military
cooperation at the first session of the U.S.-Baltic Partnership
Commission in Riga, Latvia.
</P>
<P>
In a joint communique available here, the United States,
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania "stressed the importance of
continued U.S. military assistance for improving self-defense
capabilities" of the three states.
</P>
<P>
They also vowed to continue efforts of integrating the Baltic
states into European and trans-Atlantic institutions such as the
European Community, NATO and the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
The Partnership Commission was established under the Charter of
Partnership among Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania and the United
States, which was signed on January 16, to review annually the
activities of their military and economic working groups.
</P>
<P>
All three Baltic states are eager to join NATO, a move
staunchly opposed by Russia.
</P>
<P>
In an apparent effort to placate Moscow's concerns, the
communique stated that the partners "agreed to intensify efforts
to promote the security, prosperity and stability of the region,
including the participation of Russia in regional cooperation".
</P>
<P>
The January charter noted the United States has a "real,
profound, and enduring" interest in the security and independence
of the three Baltic states.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Leader Says Abiola's Death "Tragedy" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's new leader General
Abdulsalam Abubakar Wednesday night expressed condolence to the
death of detained opposition leader Moshood Abiola who died on
the brink of his release, describing Abiola's death as a
"national tragedy".
</P>
<P>
In a national broadcast on the state TV, the Nigerian
Television Authority, at 7:00 p.m., Abubakar said the death of
Abiola is "a national tragedy and "one of the saddest moment of
our life."
</P>
<P>
Abubakar stressed the need of peace and stability in the
nation's transition to democracy. He reiterated his
determination to re-establish the professional image of the
Nigerian army and to have it play its traditional role in the
coming democratic order.
</P>
<P>
According to Abubakar, the country's supreme ruling body, the
Provisional Ruling Council, was scheduled to meet Wednesday to
decide on Abiola's release as a result of consultations between
Abiola and the government on one hand, and those between Abiola
and representatives of the international community as well as
members of his family on the other hand.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar said the government has ordered an autopsy to
establish the actual cause of Abiola's death, and the result will
be known in due course.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the autopsy is being undertaken with the
cooperation of Abiola's family and the participation of
pathologists from Britain, the United States and Canada, as
requested by his family.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar has appealed to Nigerians to remain calm to shun
violences, saying that the national grief of Abiola's death
should not be the cause of unlawfulness and wide destruction of
innocent people's property.
</P>
<P>
Extending condolences to the Abiola family, friends and
associates, the general promised he will address the nation again
on the general character of his government in due course.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar, however, failed to address the nation on his
dissolution of cabinet, the Federal Executive Council, at a
meeting of the Provisional Ruling Council early Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Abiola, the believed winner of the annulled June 12, 1993
presidential election, reportedly died of heart attack Tuesday
afternoon during a meeting with Abubakar and a U.S. delegation
headed by Under-Secretary of State Thomas Pickering.
</P>
<P>
Abiola's sudden death on the eve of his anticipated release
has raised suspicions of foul play among his family and the
opposition. His daughter Wura Abiola, who is living the United
State, said she believed her father was murdered.
</P>
<P>
His death has sparked violence in Lagos, and Ibadan in the
southwest, the strongholds of his supporters. Unconfirmed reports
said at least 10 people have died, with many others injured.

<HEADLINE> Addis Ababa City Administration Warns Striking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The Addis Ababa city
administration Wednesday warned that it would take legal measures
against taxi service providers if they do not resume service by
Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
The warning was given by the city administration after taxi
service providers went on strike Wednesday in protest of the new
traffic regulation which is effective from July 8, 1998, first
day of 1998/99 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The Addis Ababa city administration was quoted by the
Ethiopian News Agency as saying that the strike is "illegal" and
any problems that might arise in the implementation of the
regulation could be resolved through discussion.
</P>
<P>
The administration said the strike that lasted throughout the
day has not won the recognition of two taxi owners associations
namely Nib and Segon.
</P>
<P>
It said it would take legal actions on the individuals who
organized and took part in the strike.
</P>
<P>
The administration announced last Friday a new road safety
regulation which will be implemented Wednesday. However, the new
regulation has been described by the two taxi owners associations
as "too stiff" and "punitive rather than preventive," according
to press reports.

<HEADLINE> European Central Bank Demands Continued Fiscal Discipline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FRANKFURT, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Wim Duisenberg, president of the
European Central Bank (ECB), Wednesday warned that the 11
countries that will start the single European currency euro next
January must do more to reduce their budget deficits and national
debts.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference in Frankfurt, Duisenberg said he
was watching with concern how some countries were not using
"growth dividend" generated from their current economic upturn to
help lower budget deficits and debts.
</P>
<P>
Most euro member states must still make considerable efforts to
put their finance in order so as to ensure a stable euro,
Duisenberg said.
</P>
<P>
The new ECB leader's warning came as some European Union
countries appear to be slackening their efforts to rein in
deficits and debts, while an upturn in economic growth has eased
the pressure on budgets.
</P>
<P>
Officials from some countries have reportedly argued that the
increased revenues from economic growth should be used to finance
investment or job creation.
</P>
<P>
Duisenberg, however, stressed that in the long run, a stable
common currency was the best precondition for growth and
employment.
</P>
<P>
Under EU criteria for joining the euro, countries are supposed
to run up budget deficit of no more than three percent of gross
domestic product (GDP), and have long-term debts of no more than
60 percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
A stability pact linked to the monetary union accord also
stipulates that participants in the euro club that fail to adhere
to the criteria will face heavy financial penalties unless they
take immediate correction action.

<HEADLINE> Lagos Calms down Temporarily </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Disturbances characterized by
bonfires and vehicle-attacking along major streets in parts of
Nigeria's commercial capital Lagos seem to have calmed down
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Violence began Tuesday night shortly after the news of the
sudden death of Nigeria's prominent political detainee Moshood
Abiola spread from the capital Abuja.
</P>
<P>
Many of Abiola's angry and shocked supporters, mainly youths,
took to the streets, attacking cars, shops and burning tyres, in
protest against the death of the businessman/politician who was
expected to be freed very soon.
</P>
<P>
Abiola was detained in June 1994 after declaring himself
president of Nigeria. He was widely believed to have won the
presidential elections in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
A Yoruba from western Nigeria, Abiola had numerous supporters
in Lagos, a city with a population of some eight million.
</P>
<P>
The violence in the metropolis overnight was reported to leave
some ten persons dead and many others injured.
</P>
<P>
According to sources at the Defense Headquarters, all the
police in the state and anti-riot soldiers at the Lagos Garrison
Command have been deployed to strategic points of the city.
</P>
<P>
Armoured personnel carriers are also seen in some major bus
stops.
</P>
<P>
All the efforts were made to stop unnecessary loss of lives
and the destruction, looting and vandalization of property, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
So far on Wednesday, most streets which are usually bustling
have remained desert, while the majority of shops, banks and
other businesses are closed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Col. Mohammed Marwa, the military administrator of
Lagos state, has urged protesting youths to be calm and accept
the death of Abiola as "an act of God".
</P>
<P>
"Please don't engage in disturbances as nothing will be
achieved by it. I also wish to appeal to parents and guardians
not to allow their children and wards to be used by unscrupulous
elements to ferment trouble," Marwa told Lagos citizens in a
broadcast earlier Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Marwa said he was informed of Abiola's death by the head of
state General Abdulsalam Abubakar at 6:00 p.m. Tuesday afternoon,
when he was at a meeting of the National Council of States to
discuss the military government's transition to civil rule
program in Abuja.
</P>
<P>
He said the head of state ordered him to go back to Lagos
immediately to prepare for possible social disorder in the city,
believed to be the stronghold of Abiola's supporters and
sympathizers.
</P>
<P>
Extending his condolence to Abiola's sudden death, Marwa said
the state government was in contact with members of Abiola's
family on burial plans, pledging that it would fully participate
in all the arrangements.
</P>
<P>
Some family members of Abiola met him in Abuja Monday and the
private meeting lasted some 90 minutes, Marwa disclosed, adding
that he attended a meeting the same day which was chaired by
Abubakar to discuss the release of Abiola and other political
detainees.
</P>
<P>
To add weight to the state government's action, Marwa has
ordered the closure of schools in Lagos until Friday in honor of
Abiola.
</P>
<P>
However, observers believe the current calmness in Lagos is
fragile because the exact cause of Abiola's death is not yet
known until the end of an autopsy now going on with the help of
experts from Britain, the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the contradictions between Nigerians in the south
and north, which is the fundamental cause of the country's power
struggle, is far from being settled.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar announced Wednesday afternoon the dissolution of the
country's cabinet. Observers noted it may be a step taken by the
northerner-dominated military to show good relations with the
people in the south.
</P>
<P>
The new head of state may want to create room for southerners
to enter the government as representatives of the people in those
areas, one analyst said.

<TEXT>

<P>
SAINT-DENIS, July 8 (Xinhua) -- France scored a 2-1 victory to
advance into the final of the France'98 on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The French team played more aggressively than in the first half
than their Croatia opponents.
</P>
<P>
But it was the Croatia who opened the scoring 26 seconds into
the second half as Aljosa Asanovic put Davor Suker clear and the
latter beat the French goal-keeper Fabien Barthez to take a 1-0 lead
for his team.
</P>
<P>
Only one minute later, Lilian Thuram levelled the score and the
host team were greatly boosted by the equaliser.
</P>
<P>
At the 70th minute, Thuram scored again as he capitalized a
mistake by the Croatia defenders and netted an powerful right-foot shot.
</P>
<P>
But the French team's lead was almost blown off by defender
Laurent Blanc who was sent off at the 75th minute.
</P>
<P>
Blanc punched Croatia defender Slaven Bilic on the face and then
argued with the referee. That earned him a red card immediately.
</P>
<P>
Playing with 10 men, the French team still stick to attack and
could have scored more goals. But Zidane's shots were just wide.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time the French team enter the World Cup final.
They will take on defending champions Brazil on Sunday.
