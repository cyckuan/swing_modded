<HEADLINE> Strange Paralysis Spreads in Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- A strange paralysis named Acute
flaccid, a disease which is deadly dangerous to children, is
spreading quickly in Angola, with 20 having reportedly been killed
among the 320 cases registered, local health officials said here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The disease firstly spotted in March in Luanda Province, where
most of the victims are found, but the disease have also cropped
up in the neighboring Bengo Province, Benguela Province in central
Angola and the remote Cuando Cubango Province.
</P>
<P>
Victims of the disease are often children under six of age. The
first symptoms of the disease look like that of flu, but patients
will most likely suffer paralysis in their limbs and internal
organs, with some losing their ability to stand up or walk a few
days after the fever is disappeared,

and some even die from lung paralysis.
</P>
<P>
The disease is temporarily named as "acute flaccid paralysis".
</P>
<P>
Doctors in South Africa have discovered, through excrement
test, an infantile paralysis virus that is often found in some
remote areas in Africa. It is believed that the virus must have
been brought into the cities by people displaced from the
prevailing war.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Prepares Guild to Attract Foreign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Investment
Authority said Wednesday that an investment guild which contains
objective and up-to-date information on Ethiopia's investment
opportunities and business climate is under preparation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a workshop on investment guild and capacity
building here, Abi Woldemeskel, deputy manager of the authority,
said the guild will be a promotional tool that may enable the
country to attract foreign investment, the Ethiopian News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The deputy manager said the amount of foreign direct investment
Ethiopia has received so far is small compared to the foreign
direct investment received by many developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"There is far less information available to foreign investors
on investment opportunities and conducive business conditions in
Ethiopia than there is for other developing countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 4,667 investment projects worth of 4.8 billion U.S.
dollars have been approved throughout Ethiopia between May 1992
and September 1998, according to an earlier announcement made by
the authority. However, the majority of the projects were invested
by local investors.
</P>
<P>
Abi said Ethiopia has taken measures to encourage and attract
foreign direct investment.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Immunize Children Against Measles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania will hold the
National Immunization Day against Measles in September this year
following increased incidence of the disease in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The Manager of the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI),
Carolyne Akim, said in here Wednesday that measles cases have
increased threefold in the past four years.
</P>
<P>
Measles is one of the six children-killing diseases, together
with polio, tuberculosis, tetanus, whooping cough and diphtheria.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, there were 3,000 measle cases reported in the east
African country, while the figure rose to 10,080 by the end of
last year, statistics indicated.
</P>
<P>
No region in the country was spared from the measles outbreak
last year, she said.
</P>
<P>
"We are still receiving reports from various regions and the
number might now be higher due to high rate of outbreaks," Akim
said.
</P>
<P>
She said the EPI program officers are still soliciting funds
for the September exercise which involves vaccination of all
children under five years old, regardless of their immunization
status.
</P>
<P>
Exact date for the exercise will be announced later, she said,
adding that more than one million children under five will be
immunized.
</P>
<P>
Akim said they have started to mobilize people, medication and
equipment, but they still lack in vaccines and human resources.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Akim told a meeting for EPI managers and
surveillance officers from east and southern Africa that some
districts in Tanzania have been unable to control the outbreak of
measles due to poor refrigeration systems for the preservation of
vaccines.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which started Friday in Dar es Salaam, is attended
by participants from Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, Zambia,
Burundi, Rwanda, Zimbabwe, Malawi, South Africa and Tanzania. It
will end Friday.

<HEADLINE> EU Leaders Agree on Diplomatic Offer on Future of Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brussels, April 14 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU) leaders put
forward a diplomatic offer here on Wednesday about the future of
Kosovo, saying they shall initiate their offer into a resolution
to be adopted by the UN Security Council under Chapter VII.
</P>
<P>
After their brief summit meeting with the United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan in Brussels, current EU president,
German Chancellor Gerhard Shreoder told reporters that the EU
heads of state and government recall their support for a political
settlement of the Kosovo crisis, based on the Rambouillet
agreement.
</P>
<P>
He said all the leaders agreed on the main elements of an
interim arrangement for Kosovo, to be established directly after
the end of the conflict.
</P>
<P>
The EU president said they consider the following elements to
be essential:
</P>
<P>
-- establishment of an international interim administration
which the European Union could take over,
</P>
<P>
-- creation of a police force that reflects the composition of
the population of Kosovo,
</P>
<P>
-- holding of free and fair elections,
</P>
<P>
-- deployment of international military forces that will
guarantee protection for the whole population of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The EU leaders also stressed the necessity of an active role
for the EU in overcoming the crisis.
</P>
<P>
They also emphasized the importance they attach to close
cooperation with the Russian Federation, whose contribution they
said is indispensable to finding a solution to the Kosovo problem.
</P>
<P>
However, the prerequisite for these conditions is that
Yugoslavia accept all demands of "international community". The
demands include an immediate halt to the use of force, withdrawal
of all military and special police forces as well as irregular
units, deployment of an international military force and the
return of all refugees and displaced persons, the leaders said in
a summary of the summit.
</P>
<P>
The UN chief said he listened to and discussed Kosovo situation
with the EU leaders. He also met NATO Secretary-General Javier
Solana after arriving in Brussels to exchange views with the NATO
head on future of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, NATO intensified its air campaign during the last 24
hours, hitting two bridges, more command and control and
communications installations, NATO spokesman Jamie Shea told a
news briefing earlier.
</P>
<P>
Shea said that some NATO member countries had promised to
provide more aircraft for intensified air strikes to press further
presure on Yugoslav forces.

</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press, Council President for the current month

Lusaka Protocol.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Council further demanded that UNITA comply with
it obligations to demilitarize and to permit the extension of
states administration to areas under its control.
</P>
<P>
Members of the the Council called on both the Government of
Angola and UNITA to cooperated in improving the humanitarian
situation by guaranteeing access to humanitarian aid.

violation of sanctions against UNITA imposed by the Security
Council and welcomed the intended visit to the region in May by
the chairman of the sanctions committee for Angola.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Iraq Reiterates Rejection to U.N. panels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin
Ramadan on Wednesday reiterated Iraq's rejection to three U.N. panels
commissioned with reviewing Iraq's relations with the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Ramadan stressed that Iraq is not concerned with those panels their
reports submitted to the U.N. Security Council because Iraq was not
consulted on their establishment in the first place.
</P>
<P>
Ramadan made the remarks while touring a industrial products
fair sponsored by the Ministry of Industry and Minerals.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq demands total lifting of the sanctions and condemnation of
the military aggressions waged against it, "said Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
"Implementing the essence of U.N. Resolution 687...is the only
solution" for ending the deadlock between Iraq and the U.N., said
the vice president.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council decided on January 30 to set up three panels
to assess Iraq's disarmamemt progress, its humanitarian situation and
Kuwaiti prisoners of war allegedly detained by Iraq.
</P>
<P>
These three panels are required to make recommendations to the
Security Council before April 15 on what more should be done to
close all those files.
</P>
<P>
The panel in charge of Iraq's disarmament field submitted its
report to the Council early this month in which it recommended that
monitroing,inspection and investigation of Iraq's weapons programs
should continue.
</P>
<P>
U.N. weapons inspections in Iraq have been suspended since the
U.S. and Britain launched four-night airstrikes against Iraq last
December.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council since then has been sharply divided on its
policy toward Iraq.
</P>
<P>
While the U.S. and Britain oppose any easing of U.N. sanctions
on Iraq, Russia, China and France want them to be reduced or totally
lifted as an alternative to resuming long-term monitoring of Iraq's
weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
U.N.imposed crippling economic sanctions on Iraq follwoing its
1990 invasion of Kuwait.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 14 (Xinhua) -- A prominent Rwandan cleric Bishop
Augustin Misago of southwestern Gikongoro Diocese, about 100 kms
south of the capital, has been arrested for his alleged role in
the 1994 genocide.
</P>
<P>
Judicial sources in the capital Kigali said that the arrest was
made Wednesday morning at Nuncio's residence where he had gone
for refuge, Rwanda News Agency (RNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
''The Bishop is now detained at Muhima police station'' in
Kigali, sources from the Kigali Prosecutor's office said.
</P>
<P>
Early this week, the local media had talked of a plot involving
the French Ambassador to Rwanda, the Pope's Envoy, and the
Archbishop of Kigali, aimed at helping Misago escape from the long
arm of the law.
</P>
<P>
The French Ambassador had denied the reports and explained that
the alleged meeting at his residence was nothing else but a party
organized to welcome the new Pope's Envoy to Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
During the fifth commemoration of the genocide at Kibeho, 100
kms south of the capital, genocide survivors have called for the
arrest of the cleric for his role as a planner and instigator of
the massacres of over 150,000 Tutsis.
</P>
<P>
Rwandan President, Pasteur Bizimungu, in his public address had
attacked the Catholic Church regretting that despite the fact for
the last five years accusations against the cleric had been
leveled in various testimonies, it did not take any action
against Misago.
</P>
<P>
He said that even Misago himself had never reacted against
those charges and preferred silence.
</P>
<P>
Bizimungu had threatened that the government would act if the
Catholic Church was not willing to do so, saying that Misago was
not above the law.
</P>
<P>
The Rwandan Minister of Justice, Jean de Dieu Mucyo on his part
told reporters that Misago's case file was complete.

Diaspora, to be in vain, the Ghana News Agency (GNA) reported.

the misery and oppression behind us, and harness the tremendous
wealth of the continent to our benefit and sustenance."

This year's Emancipation Day under the theme "Emancipation:
our heritage, our strength - building Africa's civilization for

Africans to be exploited. "It is now time to weave the broken
threads together."

is to prepare the ground for the economic, social, political and
spiritual development of Africa and to forge solidarity among all

democracy and peaceful co-existence among different peoples, to
rid the humanity of war and other conflicts and promote steady
development.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation among Portuguese speaking countries in higher

BUCHAREST, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia's possible adhesion
to the Russia-Belarus Union "must not affect" Romania's objective
of integration with NATO and EU structures, said on Wednesday the
Romanian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Simona Miculescu.
</P>
<P>
The working mechanism of the respective union "is not in a
state of institutionalization advanced enough in order to be able
to speak of this structure in terms of an efficient operation'',
stressed the spokeswoman, adding that by this unilateral decision
of the Belgrade parliament one cannot anticipate yet all
political, economic or military implications.
</P>
<P>
If such a political union had a finality, the Romanian Foreign
Ministry thinks its forms of action "must not affect" the
fundamental objective of the Romanian foreign policy, meaning the
integration with the European and Euro-Atlantic structures, Simona
Miculescu said.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian Foreign Ministry will carefully watch the future
political developments, she concluded.

Invincible, which carries seven Sea Harrier jet fighter-bombers and
10 Sea King helicopters, is expected to reach the Adriatic on

<HEADLINE> NATO Strikes Inflict Huge Damage on Yugoslavia: Ambassador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav ambassador to Ukraine Gojko
Dapcevich said here Wednesday that NATO air strikes against
Yugoslavia over the past three weeks have killed about 500
civilians and injured more than 4,000 people.
</P>
<P>
He said that during the air campaign, NATO forces carried out
about 1,000 air sorties against Yugoslavia and destroyed more than
1,000 economic installations and over 10,000 apartment buildings.
</P>
<P>
NATO forces also launched about 1,000 cruise missiles and
dropped more than 3,500 tons of bombs at 180 targets.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the NATO air campaign primarily targeted at
civilian installations which aimed to inflict as much damage as
possible to the Yugoslav economy and intimidate the residents.
</P>
<P>
He cited estimates by foreign experts as saying that NATO's
bombings have cost Yugoslavia more than 200 billion U.S. dollars
in damage. He said the destruction of economic installations have
thrown more than 500,000 people out of work. About two million
people have lost their sources of living.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav ambassador also pointed out that during the NATO's
aggression against Yugoslavia, the ethnic terrorists in the
restive Serbian province of Kosovo intensified their attacks
against Serb policemen and civilians, killing 76 people, most of
them civilians.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Reserves Likely to Be Called to Active Duty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of military reserves
may be called up by U.S. President Bill Clinton to support a major
buildup of NATO air power against Yugoslavia, U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said Wednesday that several
thousand reservists likely would be ordered to active duty.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration, preparing for an extended air
campaign now that three weeks of bombing has failed to halt the
Serb war on ethnic Albanians, also will seek emergency money from
Congress for the NATO operation.
</P>
<P>
Clinton Tuesday asked members of Congress to give the NATO
attack more time to smash Serb forces instead of pushing for
consideration of sending U.S. ground troops into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The extra air power likely would require calling up military
reservists, Bacon said, although he didn't know how many would be
needed or when it might happen.
</P>
<P>
Several hundred Air National Guard members already are
participating as volunteers in addition to about 22,000
active-duty U.S. forces involved in NATO operations.
</P>
<P>
The biggest recent mobilization of reserves was for the 1991
Gulf War, when about 230,000 from the Army, Air Force, Navy and
Marine Corps were called to active duty.
</P>
<P>
The Army also may need to mobilize National Guard and Reserve
members as part of Task Force Hawk, the contingent of Apache
attack helicopters and surface-to-surface missiles being assembled
in Albania to hit Serb tanks and armored forces in Kosovo.

<P>
MOSCOW, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Russia feels uneasy over
Pakistan's test-firing of a Ghauri-II (HAFT-V) ballistic missile
Wednesday morning, a tit-for-tat response to India's Agni-II
ballistic missile test-firing on Sunday, the Russian Foreign
Ministry said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A statement by the ministry said Russia believes that Pakistan
and other parties concerned should stop developing ballistic
missiles that are capable of carrying nuclear warheads.
</P>
<P>
The fact that countries in the South Asian Sub-Continent began
to own intermediate-range missiles runs counter to the interest of
nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament, as well as to
the positive development of the situation in the region, the
ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry issued a similar statement on Tuesday to condemn
India's test-firing of a ballistic missile on Sunday, calling
India's move detrimental to the stability of the region.

LONDON, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The so-called Mardi Gra bomber,
Edgar Pearce, was jailed in London on Wednesday for 224 years for
his reign of terro and blackmail over the past four years.
</P>
<P>
But the 61-year-old man will actually only serve 21 years in
jail after Judge Michael Hyam at London's Old Bailey criminal
court ruled the sentences should run concurrently.
</P>
<P>
The judge said Pearce had been motivated by "greed and an
insatiable appetite for notoriety".
</P>
<P>
Pearce had admitted 23 offenses of blackmail, wounding,
possessing firearms and causing an explosion.
</P>
<P>
More than 30 bombs were left at Barclay's branches and
Sainsbury stores in London beginning in 1994. Several exploded but
no one was badly injured.
</P>
<P>
The devices were cobbled together from shotgun cartridges,
rifle bullets, springs, metal tubes and timers. They were usually
concealed in books, magazines and video cassette boxes. All
carried the signature "Mardi Gra".

<P>
GENEVA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Members of the World Trade
Organization (WTO) failed again to decide who will lead the
organization into the new century after a last-minute meeting here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Trade officials said that delegations of WTO's 134 members
faced difficulties in choosing a new director-general from two
candidates by consensus.
</P>
<P>
"We have not yet reached the point where we could appoint the
next Director-Genreal today," said Ambassador Ali Said Mchumo,
Chairman of WTO' governing body, the General Council.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot afford to miss the inevitable deadline of April 30,
1999 when the incumbent Director-General leaves office," he told
the ambassadors of the 134 WTO members at the General Council
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Supachai Panitchpakdi of Thailand has been in the lead since
WTO began to choose its new director-general in the fourth quarter
of 1998. The other candidate, Michael Moore of New Zealand, is
believed to have the support from the United States and majority
support from Latin America and much of the sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
The WTO members have missed several deadlines before to agree
on their new leader.
</P>

The incumbent WTO director-general, Renato Ruggiero, has said
that he would leave his post on April 30 at the end of a four-year
term in office.

HARARE, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean Armed riot police
Wednesday fired tear gas to students of Zimbabwe University who
wanted to march in the city center of Harare to protest against a
five-month vacation from May 22 to October.
</P>
<P>
The police who fought running battles on the campus with the
students who numbered more than 2,000 threatened to shoot live
bullets if the situation worsened, the Zimbabwe News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Police also used dogs to guard all entrances to the campus to
prevent stone-throwing students from marching into the city
center.
</P>
<P>
Takura Zhangazha, president of the Students Representative
Council, told the news agency that he feared the demonstration at
the campus would turn "nasty" if students were not allowed to the
city center.
</P>
<P>
It was possible that the students would vent their anger on
destroying property at the campus, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The university students have in the past been involved in
violent demonstrations which have resulted in property damage
worth thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
The last violent demonstration ended with the closure of the
university in June last year, only to reopen in February this
year.
</P>
<P>
Besides objecting to the five-month vacation, the students also
want the government to increase their vocational loans by about 50
percent.

The Ministry of Higher Education and Technology has already
said it had no money to increase the students' grants.

<P>
NAIROBI, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The United States and Kenya
Wednesday launched a month-long joint military exercise named
"Noble Piper" in Isiolo district of Kenya's Eastern Province.
</P>
<P>
Information officer N. M. Simani of the Kenyan Department of
Defense told Xinhua that the aim of the exercise is to strengthen
Kenyan troops and sharpen their skills.
</P>
<P>
He denied the local media report that the U.S. government has
"developed a tremendous military interest in Kenya following last
August's bombing blast at its embassy in Nairobi."
</P>
<P>
The annual exercise since 1996 is being held in Isiolo town,
home to three military schools and the 78th Armored Brigade, said
the information officer.
</P>
<P>
Simani also dismissed the report which said the exercise will
extend to the Kenyan border with Ethiopia as "completely wrong",
saying the area of the exercise is in the middle of Kenya and far
from borders.
</P>
<P>
The main activities of the exercise are focused on civic
assistance to local communities and medical service to the Kenyan
army, said Simani.
</P>
<P>
About 11 American doctors joined the exercise in Isiolo town,
according to the press office of the Department of Defense.
</P>
<P>
The Eastern African newspaper said earlier that an official at
the U. S. embassy in Nairobi believed the U.S. troops would gain
valuable experience from the joint exercise.
</P>
<P>
The official was quoted as saying that North Eastern Kenya and
the adjacent areas were "very useful to the (U.S.) military since
we do not have such terrain in our country."

During the talks, Chinese Assistant Foreign Minister Wang

in Moscow by Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev and U.S. President

</P>
<P>
The two officials noted that the U.S. plan to develop anti-
missile systems contravenes the basic obligations specified by the
treaty, constitutes a new factor destabilizing the world situation,
provides an excuse for resuming arms race, and creates new
obstacles to the process of disarmament.
</P>
<P>
In particular, the officials said that the U.S. plan poses a
serious threat to the ABM treaty and that both China and Russia
are deeply concerned about the plan.

The tests are obviously a tit-for-tat response to India's
test-firing of its Agni-II missile last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
India successfully conducted a flight test of Agni-II, an
intermediate-range ballistic missile with a planned range of
around 2,200 kilometers, on Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
India said Sunday that it had informed Pakistan's High
Commissioner in New Delhi Ashraf Jehangir Qazi prior to the
test-firing of its Agni-II missile.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 14 (Xinhua) -- UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan met
here Wednesday with NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana and European
Union (EU) leaders to discuss Kosovo crisis as NATO intensified its
air strikes against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Annan met Solana first after arriving in Brussels to exchange views
with the NATO head on future of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
NATO intensified its air campaign during the last 24 hours,
hitting two bridges, more command and control and communications
installations, NATO spokesman Jamie Shea told a news briefing
earlier.
</P>
<P>
Shea said that some NATO member countries had promised to provide
more aircraft for intensified air strikes to press further presure on
Yugoslav forces.
</P>
<P>
The UN chief and EU leaders are discussing a possible diplomatic
solution to Kosovo crisis, in particular the German peace proposal
that offers Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic a 24-hour ceasefire
of NATO air strikes if he withdraw his forces from Kosovo, the Serbian
province.

<HEADLINE> S. Africans Travelling Abroad to Be Able to Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 14 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Independent
Electoral Commission (IEC) Wednesday announced that voters, if out
of the country on June 2, will be able to vote provided that they
have already registered.
</P>
<P>
The IEC hopes that the move would reduce the number of court
cases against it.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, President Nelson Mandela Wednesday signed the
proclamation confirming June 2 as the election date.
</P>
<P>
The IEC's concession, however, was not enough to stop the New
National Party and the Federal Alliance (FA) to continue their
court cases against the IEC.
</P>
<P>
The two parties want South Africans who are living abroad to be
able to vote as well. The majority of those people had not been
able to add their names to the voters' roll during the
registration period from November last year to March this year.
</P>
<P>
The legal challenges came after the Constitutional Court ruled
that prisoners would be able to vote.

<HEADLINE> Crude Oil Prices Lower With Inventory Data </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Crude oil prices fell Wednesday as
data on U.S. and European petroleum inventories proved less
supportive to the market than expected.
</P>
<P>
Benchmark Brent blend crude oil last closed 28 cents lower at
14.92 dollars a barrel in London.
</P>
<P>
Weekly figures from the American Petroleum Institute (API)
showed a rise in U.S. inventories of gasoline, diesel and heating
oil and higher crude stocks.
</P>
<P>
The API report followed data Tuesday from 16 European nations
showing crude stocks rose 3.8 percent or 17 million barrels from
February to 466 million barrels. Europe's year-on-year surplus of
crude stocks rose to 60 million barrels at the end of March from
50 million barrels at the end of February.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said a rise in exports from Russia in recent weeks
might be to blame with sales from former Soviet territories
running at post-Soviet record highs, according to a Reuters
report.
</P>
<P>
The International Energy Agency said last Friday that March
exports from the territories were estimated at 3.3 million barrels
a day despite Russia's pledge to OPEC that it would cut supplies.
</P>
<P>
Russia's rouble devaluation last year encouraged crude
producers and refiners to maximize export sales while domestic
Russian demand is still waning because of economic collapse,
Reuters said.

<HEADLINE> Greece Urges Yugoslavia to Release Captured Australians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Greece Wednesday urged Belgrade to
release the two Australians now facing espionage charges in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
While recognizing the seriousness of the charges filed against
the two Australian aid workers and the conflict in which
Yugoslavia found itself, Greece respectfully encouraged Yugoslavia
to allow Australian Consular access to the workers and to consider
releasing the two as a humanitarian gesture, said a Greek Foreign
Ministry statement Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The appeal came following Mike Wran, leader of the South
Australian Labor Party, wrote to Greek Prime Minister Costas
Simitis asking him to intercede with Belgrade to release the two
men, Steve Pratt and Peter Wallace, both were charged of
intelligence gathering activities for the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
Greece has voiced its opposition to the military actions by
NATO against Yugoslavia, and hoped to play a role of mediation
between Belgrade and NATO.

<HEADLINE> Russian Warships to Pass Turkish Straits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The General Staff of the Turkish Armed Forces said in a statement
that three Russian warships in the first batch will pass the Canakkale
and Bosphorus Straits into the Adriatic Sea between April 15 and 16,
other three in the second batch will pass through April 18 and 19 and
the last three in the third batch will pass through between April 21
and 22.
</P>
<P>
A Russian reconnaissance warship passed through the Turkish
straits into the Adriatic Sea early this month with a mission to
monitor air strikes by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO) against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The Russian embassy in Ankara presented two requests for the
passage of the Russian warships through the Turkish straits and the
Turkish government has given the green light.
</P>
<P>
The passage of foreign warships through the Turkish straits is
overseen by the 1936 Treaty of Montreux.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the Black Sea littoral states can sail their
ships through the straits when they inform Turkish authorities of
their intentions at least eight days in advance.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the Russian warships would be carrying out
"reconnaissance tasks" in the war zone of the NATO air strikes against
Yugoslavia, which have been going on for more than 20 days.

<HEADLINE> Blair, Ahern to Meet on N.Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The British and Irish prime
ministers will hold urgent talks in London Thursday to try to
break a stalemate over guerrilla disarmament which is paralyzing
Northern Ireland's peace process.
</P>
<P>
A senior politician in Northern Ireland made the announcement
Wednesday after two days of talks between local Protestant and
Roman Catholic politicians failed to make headway, according to a
Reuters report.
</P>
<P>
The parties were discussing a blueprint for progress issued by
Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern and British Prime Minister Tony
Blair when the last round of talks adjourned on April 1.
</P>
<P>
Rejected by the Irish Republican Army (IRA), its Sinn Fein
political wing and their hardline Protestant rivals, the paper's
survival seems in doubt, at least in its present form, Reuters
said.
</P>
<P>
Irish Deputy Foreign Minister Liz O'Donnell was quoted as
saying that progress would not be made on the basis of the
Hillsborough Declaration alone.
</P>
<P>
An Irish government briefing paper shown to reporters said
there was no consensus on the declaration.
</P>
<P>
"We have serious difficulties in moving forward to the
establishment of the institutions in the immediate future. This is
undoubtedly a disappointment and a setback," it said.
</P>
<P>
The shift in venue for Blair and Ahern, who had been expected
in Belfast Thursday, was further proof that no early breakthrough
was expected in the row between Catholic-backed Sinn Fein and
Protestant Ulster Unionists led by David Trimble.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Gives $39m to Kenyan Blast Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The United States government gave
a 39 million U.S. dollars aid to the Kenyan government Wednesday
to reimburse the survivors of the August 7 bomb blast in the
Kenyan capital Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador Prudence Bushnell and Kenya Finance Minister
Francis Masakhalia signed the latest deal on behalf of the two
governments.
</P>
<P>
Masakhalia noted that while Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi's
earlier appeal for help had received a favorable response from
the international community, meeting the victims' long-term needs
still required a more coordinated approach.
</P>
<P>
He also reiterated the Kenyan government's distaste for
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Bushnell said the money would be used to provide medical,
social service and rehabilitation assistance to bomb survivors and
their families and to help the owners of businesses who suffered
economic losses in the terrorist attack.
</P>
<P>
Bushnell hoped that the package, though inadequate compared to
the massive losses incurred, would go a long way to "erase pain
and ease anger" of the victims.
</P>
<P>
She said that the aid would improve Kenya's
disaster-preparedness through training and the establishment of
blood banks.

KUWAIT CITY, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of the Islamic
Conference (OIC) announced Wednesday it has allocated 150,000 U.S.
dollars in relief aid to the Kosovo refugees.
</P>
<P>
A statement by the Jeddah-based OIC said OIC Secretary
General Esseldin Laraki has ordered the aid from the organization's
Islamic Solidarity fund, the Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
It said the money will be delivered to relief supplies officials in
Tirana, Albania, where about half a million ethnic Albanian refugees
from the Serbian province of Kosovo are taking shelter.
</P>
<P>
Since the North Atlantic Treaty Organization launched massive air
strikes against Yugoslavia on March 24 in retaliation for what they
termed as Serb's ethnic cleansing of Kosovo Albanians, hundreds of
thousands of Kosovars have fled their home to neighboring Albania and
Macedonia.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The industrial exports of Egypt's free
zones rised by 32 percent in the first quarter this year over
the same period last year, an official in charge of free zone
issues said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's free zones exported 120 million U.S. dollars worth of
industrial goods from January to March in 1999, 2 9 million dollars
more than those in the same period in 1998, Chairman of the General
Authority and Free Zones Ibrahim Fawzi told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Fawzi made the remarks after a visit to the free zone in the town
of Nasr near Cairo, where he placed a foundation stone for expansions
of an industrial project producing ingredients for soft drinks.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has set up several free zones and industrial parks in
Cairo, Alexandria, Ismailia, Suez, Port Said and Dumyat. Investors
enjoy preferential conditions for investing in the free zones.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian official said the exports in March alone increased by
34 percent to 48.7 percent compared to the same month last year.
</P>
<P>
The imports from the local markets by investors in the free zones
soared by 12 percent to 28.3 million dollars in the first quarter of
1999 from the same period of 1998, he added.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Winds Up U.S. Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOSTON, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji
Wednesday afternoon concluded his eight-day official visit to the
United States, which Zhu described as "very constructive and
fruitful."
</P>
<P>
Before his departure from Boston, the last stop of his U.S.
tour, Zhu was present at a luncheon given in his honor by the
China Forum, a collaboration of Boston-area organizations that
sponsors an ongoing series of discussions for the region's
business community on issues relating to doing business in China.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier was given a standing ovation when he was
stepping to the podium in the banquet hall, which was decorated by
huge Chinese and U.S. national flags. His speech was frequently
punctuated by applause and his humorous remarks aroused pleasant
laughters from his audience of some 500 American business leaders,
academic leaders and members of the Chinese community in Boston
and the State of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
Premier Zhu said that he and the Chinese government delegation
were warmly received in his visit to Los Angeles, Washington D.C.,
Denver, Chicago, New York and Boston. He voiced his heartfelt
thanks to the U.S. government and the American people as a whole
for their hospitality and friendship.
</P>
<P>
Zhu, who started his official visit on April 6 at the
invitation of U.S. President Bill Clinton, is the first Chinese
premier to visit the country in 15 years.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Premier Zhu made extensive contacts with
American business leaders, government officials and
representatives of U.S. commercial and financial circles.
</P>
<P>
"My talks with them are very friendly, frank, constructive and
fruitful," he said. "Therefore, I would like to convey my
heartfelt thanks to President Clinton, the U.S. government and the
American people."
</P>
<P>
In return, both Governor Paul Cellucci of the State of
Massachusetts and Thomas Menino, mayor of Boston, said that the
United States also benefits from advancing its friendship and
cooperation with China.
</P>
<P>
Over recent years, Massachusetts has made rapid progress in
developing economic and trade cooperation with China, thus
creating many job opportunities for the people in the state,
Cellucci said.
</P>
<P>
The American people were profoundly impressed by the Chinese
premier during his visit, Menino said. He voiced his hope to see
closer ties of friendship and cooperation between the City of
Boston and China.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier fielded all the questions from his audience
after his speech. In answering a question, Zhu said that China
welcomes investment from American businesses.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Boston, Zhu also met with representatives of
the local Chinese community.
</P>
<P>
Zhu left here for Ottawa to kick off his official visit to
Canada at the invitation of Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien.

<HEADLINE> Donors Meeting to Be Held for G. Bissau </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- A donors conference is to be held
on April 20 in New York to raise funds for the deployment of 850
additional troops in Guinea Bissau before legislative and
presidential elections, an official of the Economic Community of
West African States (ECOWAS) said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Adrienne Diop, ECOWAS director of information, said here that
friends of Guinea Bissau are expected to contribute an amount for
the deployment of the troops to be contributed by countries with
troops in that country.
</P>
<P>
Benin Republic, Gambia and Togo deployed 712 troops already in
the country under the November peace deal in Abuja with the
assistance of France in February this year.
</P>
<P>
The troops are to be deployed along the border with Senegal,
which accused elements of the country's military of supporting
rebels in its Casamance region as well as used to monitor the
elections.
</P>
<P>
The elections are meant to produce a new national assembly and
a replacement for President Joao Vieira, one of the conditions
listed by the rebels before their cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
The troops replaced the 3,000 Senegalese and Guinean soldiers
who entered the country at the invitation of President Vieira
after the June 7 rebellion by sacked army chief General Ansumane
Mane.
</P>
<P>
The rebellion was sparked after General Mane was sacked by the
president for being behind the support for the Casamance rebels.
</P>
<P>
Diop said the donors conference was being held to ensure the
timely deployment of the additional troops since those on the
ground were not adequate to monitor the elections.

<HEADLINE> Activists Protest Confiscation of Palestinian Residency Status in Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Dozens of Palestinian and Israeli
civil rights activists, joined by legislators from both sides,
protested Wednesday against what they called Israel's discriminatory
policy of confiscating residency status of Palestinians in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Confined at a park outside the Old City by barriers set up by
Israeli police, the protesters chanted slogans and waved stickers
calling for an immediate end to a three-year-old Israeli policy under
which 2,083 Palestinian families have been stripped of their residency
status in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
They said this "discriminatory and unjust" policy violated
the international law and is "nothing less than a policy of ethnic
cleansing."
</P>
<P>
The demonstration was held to put pressure on Israel's High Court
of Justice as it prepares to hear next week a petition filed by
lawyers and civil rights groups about one year ago questioning the
legality of Jerusalem ID card confiscation.
</P>
<P>
Under Israeli laws and regulations, Palestinian residents in East
Jerusalem, which was seized by Israel from Jordan in the 1967 Middle
East War, can retain their permanent residency status as long as they
did not live outside the city for more than seven years and returned
periodically.
</P>
<P>
However, the Israeli Interior Ministry in 1996 adopted a new policy
under which the residency status of Palestinians born in East
Jerusalem but living abroad or in the city's suburb was subject to
confiscation because the "center of life" of these people had been
changed.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three years, the so-called "center of life" policy
has lead to a dramatic 600 percent increase in the number of ID card
confiscation cases.
</P>
<P>
During this period, about 8,332 Palestinian individuals have lost
their rights to live in East Jerusalem and as a result, the rights to
welfare and social security. Some of them were forced to move out of
the city because it was too hard for them to get permits from the
Israeli authority to build new houses there to accommodate the
expansion of their family.
</P>
<P>
They said the policy was discriminatory against the 215,000
Palestinian residents in East Jerusalem because Jewish residents there
can retain their permanent residency status without restrictions.
</P>
<P>
The protesters raised a sticker depicting a forged ID Card of Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with the red-colored word "expired" on it.
On top of the sticker was a line which said, "Bibi, you were abroad
for 12 years. Now it's your turn," referring to the fact that
Netanyahu had stayed in the United States for a dozen of years before
returning to Israel in 1988.
</P>
<P>
Several members of the Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC) and
the Israeli Parliament, or Knesset, took part in the demonstration to
show their support and solidarity for the Palestinians who have lost
their Jerusalem ID cards.
</P>
<P>
PLC member Hanan Ashrawi, former cabinet minister of the
Palestinian National Authority, said Jerusalem is the "heart of peace"
and Israel's discriminatory policy "will destroy any possibility of
peace."
</P>
<P>
According to Israeli-Palestinians accords, the status of Jerusalem
should be determined in the final-status talks, which have yet to
start. Before the talks end, both sides are banned from taking
unilateral actions to change the status quo of the city, including its
demographic structure.

<HEADLINE> International Aid Agency Sends Water in Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The International Committee of
the Red Cross (ICRC) has embarked on an emergency water trucking
operation in a bid to ease the plight of Somali nomads who are
suffering a severe water shortage, the ICRC Nairobi office said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In order to save lives, the ICRC has mobilized hundreds of
trucks carrying water to some 70, 000 of the most vulnerable
pastoralists in 205 locations in central Somalia, that are worst
hit by the draught.
</P>
<P>
Rains due in April were delayed in some regions of Somalia and
 traditional water storage holes have been depleted.
</P>
<P>
Already in early March, ICRC teams assessing the humanitarian
needs with local water authorities came across some dead animals.
This week ICRC Somali field officers will report the loss of
human lives.
</P>
<P>
If the rains do not come in the next few weeks, the situation
will become extremely alarming, said the ICRC head of delegation
in Nairobi, Michel Dufour.
</P>
<P>
Dufour said that people in central Somalia have been caught in
a vicious cycle that they cannot break on their own.

<HEADLINE> Commuters Affected in Nationwide Bus Strike in S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Tens of thousands of
commuters throughout South Africa, including school children, have
been stranded due to the disruption of a nation-wide bus strike
which began in the morning.
</P>
<P>
People worst affected by the bus strike were those in areas
where there was no alternatives to bus transport, such as trains
or taxis, Labor Department officials said.
</P>
<P>
The bus strike started following a deadlock in wage
negotiations between four major transport unions and the South
African Bus Employers' Association (SABEA).
</P>
<P>
About 18,000 transport employees have been involved in the
countrywide strike, the South African Broadcasting Corporation
reported.
</P>
<P>
The workers are demanding an 11-percent wage increase, whereas
management is offering only six percent, the strike organizers
said.
</P>
<P>
The SABEA officials said they would not resume wage talks with
the striking workers until they agreed to compromise.
</P>
<P>
So far, the strike has not seriously affected municipal bus
services in the country, as the municipal drivers do not belong to
any of the four unions involved in the dispute.
</P>
<P>
Bus transport in and around Durban, the biggest port city in
South Africa, was reportedly operating normally and the Durban
city police had received no reports of any problems.

<P>
KUNMING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Fire engines have been racing
around the streets of Kunming in southwest China's Yunnan Province
recently, but they're not busy putting out fires - they're trying
to save hundreds of thousands of flowers and trees from 94
countries and international organizations.
</P>
<P>
Kunming is where the International Horticulture Exposition is
expected to open on May 1, but it has been suffering from a
drought since January. Temperatures have climbed to near 30
degrees centigrade in the daytime, making the situation worse.
</P>
<P>
Normally, Kunming has 40 mm of rainfall in April, but this year,
the forecast is for 15 mm, according to a provincial government
official. And the sprayers that are supposed to alleviate the
problems don't work well at the exhibition site because of a lack
of water pressure, even though there are three ponds with nearly
12,000 cu.m. in all nearby.

In his report to the Security Council, covering the

limited return of international U.N. personnel to the country
would be closely monitored.

The Secretary-General warned that unless there was clear

Annan said that he expected, in particular, the Taleban
authorities to complete their investigation into the murder of
Lieutenant Colonel Carmine Calo of Italy.
</P>
<P>
The killing of the Lieutenant Colonel, who was military
adviser to the U.N. Special Mission in Afghanistan, led to the

<HEADLINE> Annan Says UN Mission in Prevlaka Peninsula Helps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 15 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Thursday urged Croatia and the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia to show restraint and maintain their resolve to
negotiate constructively towards a peaceful resolution of their
dispute over the Prevlaka peninsula.
</P>
<P>
In his latest report on the work of the United Nations Mission
of Observers in Prevlaka (UNMOP), Annan said the mission's
presence on the ground had played a key role in creating an
environment for a negotiated settlement, and during the present
time, it had also helped minimize tensions that could develop as a
result of events in the region.
</P>
<P>
Annan said it was extremely disappointing that substantial
progress had not been made even though six months had elapsed
since negotiations were initiated and four rounds of talks have
taken place.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief noted the current events in the Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia should not be used by one party or the other to
achieve an objection outside the framework of bilateral
negotiations as specified in their Agreement on Normalization of
Relations.
</P>
<P>
UNMOP monitors the demilitarization of the Prevlaka peninsula
and neighboring areas in Croatia and the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia. The mission, which consists of 27 military
observers, conducts vehicle and foot patrols on both sides of
the border and also meets regularly with local authorities to
reduce tensions, improve safety and security, and promote
confidence between the parties.

WASHINGTON, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The number of Americans filing
applications for unemployment checks jumped last week, for the
second consecutive week, to the highest level in three months, the
Labor Department said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A seasonally adjusted 316,000 unemployed people claimed
benefits, the highest since mid January and up from 302,000 the
week before, the department said.
</P>
<P>
Through nine weeks during late January, February and March, the
number of initial claims had hovered just under 300,000, the
longest stretch below that threshold since 1973.
</P>
<P>
The latest increase wasn't expected by analysts, but weekly
claims data are volatile and it's too soon to tell if it presages
any weakening in the very strong labor market, which in March cut
the nation's unemployment rate to a 29-year low of 4.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
A four-week moving average of claims, which evens out weekly
fluctuations, rose by 4,250 to 300,500.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Urges New Delhi to Return to Jute Organization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh on Thursday requested
India to reconsider its decision of pulling out the International
Jute Organization (IJO).
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Shah A.M.S. Kibria made the appeal to India,
once an important member of the Dhaka-based organization, at the
inaugural session of a three-day "Jute Investors' Forum," jointly
organized by the Ministry of Jute, the Board of Investment, the
IJO and others.
</P>
<P>
India withdrew its membership from the IJO in January this
year. The IJO, an inter-governmental agency with 26 member states,
was established in 1984 to implement the provisions of the 1982
International Agreement on Jute and Jute Products.
</P>
<P>
Believing that jute has the economic strength to survive the
tough competition with synthetics, the finance minister stressed
the need for more research and timely entrepreneurial initiatives
to make jute viable and regain its lost glory.
</P>
<P>
Commerce and Industries Minister Tofail Ahmed said the
ministries of jute and commerce and industries would launch a
comprehensive plan of action soon to produce and export more jute,
calling on jute producing countries to work together to invigorate
the struggling jute industry.
</P>
<P>
The government has decided to give cash incentive to exporters
of jute and jute goods to help strengthen the jute economy, but
the jute industry can survive and regain its lost glory only
through diversification of products, he said.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh's raw jute export has fallen sharply in both volume
and value in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The export of raw jute fell by more than 50 percent during the
first half of the current fiscal year (July 1998-June 1999) to
about 613,000 bales from 1.277 million bales in the corresponding
period of the previous fiscal, reports said.
</P>
<P>
And the export earnings from the jute sector also declined by
over 50 percent, coming down to about 1.13 billion taka (about
23.3 million U.S. dollars) in the period from nearly 2.37 billion
taka (about 48.9 million dollars) in the same period of the last
fiscal year.

WASHINGTON, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Scores of ethnic Albanian refugees were reported killed
Wednesday when NATO warplanes struck tractors and wagons at two
sites in southwestern Kosovo. Yugoslavia said the attacks were the
most deadly assault on civilians in the three-week conflict.
</P>
<P>
-- There are two wars going on in Yugoslavia, said a senior
politician, lowering his voice. One is the war against the "
foreign aggressor". The other is "a war within the country" over
what kind of Yugoslavia will emerge from the debris of NATO bombs
and cruise missiles.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The European Union offered a plan for Kosovo to be placed
under temporary European administration if Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic agreed to withdraw forces and allow the return
of refugees.
</P>
<P>
-- The House, voting 220 to 208, approved a 1.74 trillion
dollars budget for the 2000 fiscal year, setting the stage for a
year of battles with President Bill Clinton over tax cuts and
spending.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- President Bill Clinton won't put off Congress's vote on
China's bid to join the WTO until after the 2000 elections. The
administration may seek a vote this summer.
</P>
<P>
-- Pakistan test-fired a missile capable of carrying a nuclear
warhead, responding as expected to India's launch of a similar
missile Sunday. The Ghauri II renews fears of an arms race between
the neighbors that have fought three wars in 51 years.

<HEADLINE> German Left-wing Leader Defends Belgrade Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 15 (Xinhua) -- German left-wing opposition leader
Gregor Gysi Thursday defended his Belgrade visit which was sharply
lambasted by cabinet members.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer criticized Gysi, who visited
Belgrade and met with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic this
week, had ignored the rights of the Kosovar victims.
</P>
<P>
"I also assume that bad things are happening (in Kosovo) even
if there is no evidence. However, nobody is asking about the
suffering in Serbia caused by NATO," Gysi argued.
</P>
<P>
Gysi accused the German cabinet of waging an aggressive war by
taking part in the NATO air campaigns against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Gysi, the parliamentary fraction leader of the Democratic
Socialism Party (PDS), on Tuesday visited Belgrade to promote
peace proposals for the Kosovo crisis. He met with Milosevic on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav President did not appear intimidated by three
weeks of NATO air strikes, Gysi said after his talks with
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
Gysi's PDS, formerly the communist party in East Germany, is
the only political party in the German Parliament that opposes the
NATO air raids.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Employment Rises by 2.4 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Labor Secretary
Bienvenido Laguesma said Thursday that results of the January 1999
Labor Force Survey indicate some improvements in employment, a
sign that some sectors of the economy are on the road to recovery.
</P>
<P>
According to Laguesma, data from the Department of Labor and
Employment's (DOLE) Bureau of Labor and Employment Statistics
(BLES) showed a 2.4-percent growth in the number of employed
persons in January 1999 compared with the same month last year.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that employed persons rose from 27.69 million
in January 1998 to 28.37 million in January 1999. This means that
about 679,000 more workers were employed in the first month of
this year compared with a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The increase in employment is about twice the 357,000
employment increment registered in the same month last year,
Laguesma said.
</P>
<P>
The labor secretary said the higher employment growth could be
attributed to improvements in the agricultural and financial
sectors which are badly hit by a prolonged drought and the Asian
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
However, DOLE noted a slight increase in unemployment of 9
percent in January 1999 from 8.4 percent in January 1998. This was
due partly to higher labor force participation rates observed
among women, young and urban workers for the first quarter this
year.
</P>
<P>
The higher participation rates could mean that more persons are
finding the need to work or more of them have become more
optimistic that they could now get a job.

<HEADLINE> British Home Secretary Blocks Freedom for Pinochet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
British Home Secretary Jack Straw has ruled that the legal
action, extradition hearing against the retired general, should go
ahead.
</P>
<P>
Straw said he made the decision with an "open mind" and that
the Spanish request was well founded.
</P>
<P>
The Home Secretary, who had once ruled late last year that the
extradition hearing should go ahead, has been asked to reconsider
his approval by the Lords after they adjudged that Pinochet should
not take responsibilities to all the crimes the Spanish judge
charged on him.
</P>
<P>
Since that rule effectively reduced 32 draft charges against
Pinochet to three, the Law Lords also asked Straw to review his
December's ruling that extradition proceeding could begin.
</P>
<P>
Most of Spain's allegations were from the earlier part of
Pinochet's 1973-1990 rule.
</P>
<P>
Straw's decision on Thursday did not mean extradition hearings
will start right away or they would result in his extradition.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet's lawyers could force a delay by appealing Straw's new
ruling to London's High Court.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet was house arrested last October in a London's hospital
where he was recovering from a back surgery. A Spanish judge
accused him of being responsible for the deaths and disappearances
of 3,000 people during his reign, and wanted him be extradited to
Spain to face trials.

JERUSALEM, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Aryeh Deri, leader of Israel's
powerful rightwing Shas Party, Thursday was sentenced to four years in
prison by Jerusalem District Court for bribe-taking.
</P>
<P>
Deri was also fined 250,000 shekels (about 60,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Deri, a close associate of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, was

<P>
Judge Yaacov Tzemach said Thursday that the tough sentence
reflected the gravity of the crime.
</P>
<P>
He said that it was not a one-time mistake made by Deri, noting
that taking bribe has been part of his life style during a period of
over five years.
</P>
<P>
Tzemach stressed that Deri was the first sitting minister in
Israel who took bribes, and the bribe-taking "presented an extreme
danger to the nation and the people."
</P>
<P>
Deri has the right to appeal to the High Court within 45 days
following the sentencing. His attorney asked the court to delay
implementing the sentence until the High Court rules on the appeal.

But the prosecutor insisted that Deri be jailed immediately. The
court is now discussing the delay.

Shas Party, which currently has 10 seats in the 120-member Knesset

<P>
Followers of Shas regarded the conviction as a ruling against the

Since it is only about one month before the general elections in

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Cambodia Celebrates First Peaceful New Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, April 15 (Xinhua) -- With the Khmer New Year coming
in, you can feel the festivity everywhere in Cambodia which is
celebrating the first peaceful New Year in nearly 30 years.
</P>
<P>
All over Phnom Penh, people are celebrating and greeting the
Year of the Rabbit which began Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
People, old and young, are wearing their best colorful
traditional clothes. Many people are busy with shopping in the
markets which have an ample supply of commodities. And many
families drove a long way to visit historic sites or have an
excursion.
</P>
<P>
At night, young people gather in circles in the streets or in
parks for a mixture of traditional dance and pop music.
</P>
<P>
The government and authorities concerned also organized varied
and colorful festival activities, such as movies, traditional
dance performance and traditional Khmer games.
</P>
<P>
Among the Buddhist ceremonies performed is the mountain of
sand, meant to show that each mountain is composed of individual
grains of sand or dirt and so life can be changed little by
little. Another popular ceremony is the watering of the Buddha, in
which people throw water on a Buddha statue.
</P>
<P>
Many families invited monks to perform ceremonies to rid their
houses of negative spirits left over from the old year.
</P>
<P>
People have all the reason to celebrate this year. Just as a
foreigner who has been here for seven years noted that it is the
first year when a really good feeling exists around town.
Everybody knows there is no trouble out there.
</P>
<P>
It is true that for the first time in nearly 30 years, Cambodia
finally enjoys a true, comprehensive peace. There is no Khmer
Rouge fighting force in the jungle and a new coalition government
was formed with former warring factions now working together.
</P>
<P>
The celebrations represent a contrast to those of last New
Year, which came immediately after the return of Prince Norodom
Ranariddh on March 30, who left the country following the July
1997 factional fighting. Tensions were high, and some feared new
violence would erupt. At the same time, Royal Cambodian Armed
Forces (RCAF) were battling Khmer Rouge near Anlong Veng.
</P>
<P>
And New Year's Day in 1997 came less than three weeks after
four grenades exploded outside the National Assembly, shattering
the dream of stability. At least 17 people were killed and more
than 100 injured. Weeks later the fragile coalition government
fell apart and factions took up arms against each other.
</P>
<P>
However, the situation is totally different this year. All the
people seem to be happy together. Some boys and girls, playing
games at park, said, "Cambodia suffered too much for too long a
time, but from now on we'll have no more fighting and we will live
in peace, so we should take the chance to enjoy ourselves."
</P>
<P>
In order to let the people have a peaceful and happy New Year,
police and military police increased their patrol along the
streets day and night.
</P>
<P>
Senate President Chea Sim, National Assembly President Prince
Norodom Ranariddh and Prime Minister Hun Sen all gave to the
people their New Year blessing Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Hun Sen said, "With the 21st century coming,
Cambodia already has achieved complete peace. And this is the good
fortune for our people as after the July 26 elections we have
ended the political and military organization of the Khmer Rouge."
</P>
<P>
They all appealed to the whole country to make every effort to
achieve prosperity and development in Cambodia.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Kwong Hon-sang, the secretary for
works of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, said here
today that he hopes there will be more cooperation in the
construction sector with the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Better use could be made of Hong Kong's management experience
and the mainland's manpower, Kwong told a seminar on the
construction industry and urban-rural planning.
</P>
<P>
He said that people in the construction industry in Hong Kong
have shown great enthusiasm and hope to bid for projects in a just
and open way.
</P>
<P>
Although the mainland and Hong Kong have different controls on
engineering and construction, the mainland has improved a great
deal in recent years by studying management techniques in foreign
countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
Kwong led a 97-member delegation to Beijing for the '99
Mainland and Hong Kong Seminar on Management in the Engineering
and Construction Industry and Urban-Rural Planning, which is
scheduled for April 14-16.
</P>
<P>
Delegation members include SAR officials, education and
institute professionals, and people from private construction
companies in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The seminar was organized by China's Construction Ministry, the
Works Bureau, and the Planning, Environment and Lands Bureau of
Hong Kong to provide an arena for discussing management of the
engineering and construction industry and urban and rural planning.
</P>
<P>
After the seminar, some delegation members will visit Hebei
Province for discussions with the Provincial Construction
Commission about sewage treatment and residential housing
construction and will visit some infrastructure facilities.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh will host a conference
of the Global Tiger Forum in November this year, the official BSS
news agency reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting of the forum, comprising 14 countries, is part of
extending international cooperation for preserving wild lives.
</P>
<P>
The decision of hosting the conference came at an
inter-ministerial meeting held here on Thursday at the Ministry of
Forest and Environment, which also decided to constitute a
five-member working committee to arrange the conference.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also discussed the scope for international
cooperation in preserving the sanctuary of tigers in the
Sundarbans in southwestern Bangladesh and other areas of the
country, and the development of its management aspect, the BSS
said.
</P>
<P>
The population of Bengal tigers is decreasing rapidly following
poaching and shrinking of livable spaces inside the Sundarbans,
their major sanctuaries in the country.
</P>
<P>
Since the turn of this century, the habitat and number of
Bengal tigers have been reduced by some 95 percent, experts said.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Proposes Three-Stage Peace Plan for Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma
has outlined a three-stage peace plan for settling the Kosovo
crisis, which called for a simultaneous stop of NATO bombardment
and deployment of peace-keepers from neutral nations.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma's plan appeared to be a compromise taking into account
both NATO and Yugoslav demands, said a report carried by the
government newspaper Uriadovyi Kur'er on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In the interview with the newspaper, Kuchma said the first
stage involves a simultaneous cease-fire by Yugoslav forces in the
Kosovo province, by Albanian separatists and by NATO units bombing
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Peace-keepers acting under the auspices of the United Nations
or the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe would
then enter Kosovo simultaneously with a Yugoslav withdrawal, and
provide for the return of refugees.
</P>
<P>
The second stage involves the return and resettlement of
refugees and the third -- a peace conference in a neutral capital.
In the meantime, the United Nations, the Red Cross and other
international bodies would take care of the refugees in Yugoslavia
and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine is prepared to participate in the peace-keeping
contingent, Kuchma said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the peace-keeping force must be acceptable for
all sides to the conflict and not be a NATO force, as earlier
proposed by the alliance.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma said he was prepared to immediately start talks with
NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana, Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic and the leaders of Kosovo Albanians, send his Foreign
Minister Boris Tarasiuk to Belgrade or Washington or host peace
talks in the Ukrainian capital of Kiev.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Says Missile Tests for Security Needs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan said Thursday that its
latest missile tests have been conducted basically for "a security
need and to maintain credible, efficacious and technically sound
deterrence."
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference here Thursday, Foreign Office
spokesman Tariq Altaf said the South Asian region is faced with "a
precariously instable situation."
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan must always remains, as it always does, mindful of
its security needs," he said, adding that "our security needs
require that we maintain a minimum, credible deterrence."
</P>
<P>
Altaf's remarks came after Pakistan launched a Shaheen-I
surface-to-surface ballistic missile Thursday one day after
Wednesday's test fire of Ghauri-II as a response to India's
test-fire of Agni-II last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"We have to make sure that our deterrence is efficacious,
technically sound, dependable and credible," Altaf said.
</P>
<P>
"We conducted (missile) tests in view of our technical
requirements to maintain our minimum deterrence capability," the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He said Pakistan is engaged in a dialogue process with
neighboring India. In this dialogue process and at the foreign
secretary-level meetings, Pakistan has already offered to enter
into "a strategic restraint regime for nuclear and conventional
stabilization."
</P>
<P>
"It is our earnest wish that the two countries should reach an
agreement on a restraint regime," said Altaf, adding that "this
restraint regime will promote peace and security in the region
along with resolution of disputes."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Pakistan's proposals for a strategic restraint
regime should be looked into even more seriously and more
urgently.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, the Ghauri-II missile test,
conducted Wednesday, was in the range of around 1,160 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The maximum range of overland test within Pakistan's
territorial limits is around 1,500 kilometers, he said, adding
that the capability of Ghauri-II is higher and in the range of
2,000 to 2,300 kilometers depending on the weight of the payload.
</P>
<P>
Asked about more possible missile tests by Pakistan, Altaf
quoted a Foreign Office press release issued Thursday as saying
that "this test (of Shaheen-I Thursday) concludes, for now, the
series of SSM (surface-to-surface missile) flight tests involving
solid and liquid fuel rocket motor technologies, which started
yesterday."
</P>
<P>
Answering another question, the spokesman stressed that the
latest missile program is indigenous, and the successful tests are
the result of scientific research by Pakistan's scientists and
technicians.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the spirit of the memorandum of
understanding reached by Pakistan and India in February this year,
the Pakistani side had informed the Indian side about its missile
launching plan beforehand, he said.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Demands Withdrawal of Eritrean Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian government
spokesperson Selome Taddesse said Thursday that Eritrea must
formally agree "to withdraw from the Ethiopian territories it
currently occupies" before a ceasefire can take place.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here Thursday afternoon on Prime Minister
Meles Zenawi's interview with Voice of America this week, the
spokesperson quoted him as saying that as soon as the Eritrean
government accedes to this requirement, a ceasefire can be
implemented, followed by demilitarization and demarcation of the
common border.
</P>
<P>
To date, said the statement, "Eritrea has only agreed to a
ceasefire without accepting the entire package deal."
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesperson, Prime Minister Meles stressed
that as soon as Eritrea formally signs a package deal that very
clearly indicates that they will withdraw from all Ethiopian
territories within a specified time frame, a ceasefire can take
place.
</P>
<P>
The statement quoted Meles as saying that "the Ethiopian
government does not accept new ceasefire proposals that are meant
simply to facilitate negotiations without including the key
element of Eritrean withdrawal."
</P>
<P>
"Only when the Asmara government agrees to this requirement, as
embodied in the Organization of African Unity (OAU) plan, can a
ceasefire be implemented, followed by peaceful negotiation of the
border issue," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Both Ethiopia and Eritrean have accepted the OAU framework
agreement which calls for both sides to pull back their troops and
allow intonational monitors into the disputed areas while a border
commission establishes a mutually recognized international
boundary.
</P>
<P>
The 11-month Ethio-Eritrean border dispute escalated into
fierce fighting in June 1998 and renewed in February and March
this year.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-four supporters of
Malaysia's former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, will be
remanded for violent street demonstrations in the capital
Wednesday, the official news agency Bernama reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Magistrate Kamarulzaman Abdul Rahman Thursday gave the police
an order to detain them until April 20 to facilitate
investigations under Section 148 of the Penal Code, Bernama said.
</P>
<P>
The suspects include Parti Keadilan Nasional (National Justice

private college students who were arrested Wednesday following
violent protests in areas around the High Court building after
Anwar was sentenced to six years in jail on four counts of corrupt
practice.
</P>
<P>
Anyone convicted under Section 148 is liable to be jailed for
up to five years or fined or both.

vehicles and burned garbage cans along the roads.
</P>
<P>
Police fired tear gas and used water canons to disperse the

<HEADLINE> Clan Fighting Raging in S. Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Clannish and political clashes
continued raging in southern Somalia, devastating the already poor
 humanitarian situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Somali extreme southern border with Kenya
indicated that there has been armed clashes between militiamen
form the Islamic fundamentalist group of Al-Itihad Al-Islam and
others loyal to General Mohamed Saeed Hirsi Morgan in Rascamboni
town on the border.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here in Mogadishu, four battle
wagons and nearly 100 heavily armed militiamen loyal to General
Morgan have attacked the Islamists militia bases in Rascamboni
town early Wednesday morning. The VHF radio reports said the
fighting has left over ten people dead and more than 20 others
wounded.
</P>
<P>
A VHF radio owner in the region told Xinhua that the
perpetrators of the attack have lost the battle but had managed to
escape with their battle wagons back to the port town of Kismaio,
500 km south of the capital, from where they had launched their
attack.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the attack is not officially known. However,
sources close to the militiamen of Colonel Ahmed Hashi said the
attack was meant to dislodge the Islamic fundamentalists
militiamen of Abdusalam Turki from the town.
</P>
<P>
The reason why General Morgan's men are trying to dislodge the
 fundamentalists from the region is also said to have related to
the killing of an American woman aid worker in the area about a
month ago. Even though the Al-Itihad men have denied the killing,
speculations are that Al- Itihad militiamen from the area have
killed her as she crossed the border to Somali side.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the armed confrontations between rival sides among
Somalis and those of the Ethiopian forces along the border of Gedo
region are seriously worsening the humanitarian situation by
creating new streams of internally displaced people.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of families who recently fled the towns of Bulo Hawo
and Dolow of Gedo region still remain stranded in the region
without food or shelter.
</P>
<P>
The humanitarian crises are not confined to the border towns.
There are also serious reports of humanitarian difficulties in
other towns of the region. Yussuf Hassan Eyow, governor of the
region, said at least four people die everyday in Galhareri town
while three others also die in Dhusamareb due to water scarcity
and severe diarrhea.

<HEADLINE> Swazi King Rules out Abolition of Death Penalty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 15 (Xinhua) -- King Mswati III of Swaziland
Thursday ruled out the abolition of the death penalty in the tiny
southern African country, saying the threat that necessitates
capital punishment in the country still exists.
</P>
<P>
Although no hangings have taken place in the country in the
past 18 years, the sentence has acted as an effective deterrent to
crime, South African Press Association quoted Mswati as saying in
Mbabane, the capital.
</P>
<P>
Serious crimes such as ritual killings would soar once the
death sentence is abolished, he said.
</P>
<P>
The country should concentrate more on fighting crime than
lobbying for the abolition of capital punishment, said the king.
</P>
<P>
While the death penalty still remains in place in Swaziland,
Mswati said this is cushioned by his prerogative of mercy.

<HEADLINE> Donors Resume Financial Aid to Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Donors have released a total of 36
million U.S. dollars to Zambia so far this year, the Bank of
Zambia said.
</P>
<P>
Kabinga Pande, spokesman of Zambia's central bank, said here
Wednesday that of the 36 million dollars, 22.4 million of which
was from the European Union and the remaining came from the
International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia newspaper Thursday quoted the spokesman as
saying that the bank expects more inflows from other multilateral
and bilateral partners.
</P>
<P>
The donors withheld their promised balance-of-payment support
to Zambia last year because of the delayed privatization of the
country's copper mines.
</P>
<P>
IMF Executive Director Dinah Guti said when he visited Zambia
last year that the donors did not wish to see a large chunk of the
pledged aid go to a loss-making program like the Zambia
Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM).
</P>
<P>
In December, 1998, Anglo-American Corporation and Zambia signed
a memorandum of understanding over the sale of ZCCM's Nchanga,
Nkana and Konkola mines, paving the way for the resumption of the
aid.

<HEADLINE> China to Tighten Control over Environmental Pollution by New Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese experts are to improve
the official assessment techniques for checking on the pollution a
new project can pose to the environment.
</P>
<P>
Wu Bo, head of the Division of Development Management and
Monitoring under the State Environmental Protection Administration
(SEPA), promised that the assessment system, one of the country's
three major environmental systems, will be strictly implemented
immediately.
</P>
<P>
The administration has revoked the licenses of two state-level
environmental inspection organizations, including the State
Environmental Analysis and Measuring Center, for providing wrong
results.
</P>
<P>
China has used the system since the 1970s. Projects failing to
meet certain standards for environmental protection cannot be
carried out according to state regulations.
</P>
<P>
"The system has played an important role in preventing the
emergence of new polluting sources," Wu said, adding that 95
percent of all the construction projects have been assessed as to
whether they would cause serious pollution before work begin.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the two revoked licenses, another eight
organizations including the China Architectural Research Institute,
have ordered to cease work for using unqualified personnel.
</P>
<P>
China currently has more than 260 organizations with state-
level licenses and nearly 6,000 people involved in the business.
</P>
<P>
Wu said, "The bulk of these organizations are running well and
have contributed greatly to pollution control. However, some
organizations have serious problems and even practice fraud in
assessment.
</P>
<P>
"The state will tighten control over these organizations and
will revoke the licenses of those that employ trickery."
</P>
<P>
The SEPA has promulgated a new regulation, withdrawing the
authority to issue licenses by the administration and making
higher demands on the assessment of personnel.
</P>
<P>
The administration has begun issuing new licenses according to
the new regulation and all the old ones will expire beginning from
January 1, 2000. Sources say that fewer new licenses will be
issued this time.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji's
visit to the United States is constructive, fruitful and conducive
to furthering a sustained, healthy and steady progress of the
China-US relations, a foreign ministry spokesman said here today.
</P>
<P>
At a regular press conference, the spokesman, Sun Yuxi, said
that the official visit to the US by Premier Zhu at the invitation
of President Bill Clinton is another major event in the China-US
relations, following the successful exchange of visits by the
heads of state of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Premier Zhu had a wide-range and in-depth
exchange of views with President Clinton and other American
leaders on China-US relations and major international and regional
issues, and the two sides expressed their continued commitment to
build a constructive China-US strategic partnership, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the question of Taiwan, Sun said, Premier Zhu expounded
China's consistent position, and President Clinton reaffirmed the
US adherence to a one China and relevant commitments.
</P>
<P>
Premier Zhu and President Clinton issued a joint statement on
China's accession to the WTO, and the US side undertook to support
China's accession to the WTO in 1999. Premier Zhu also elaborated
on the principled position of the Chinese side on the Kosovo issue,
Sun said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Premier Zhu and Vice-President Gore co-chaired
the Second Session of the China-US Environment and Development
Forum, and the two sides also signed a series of agreements and
letters of intent on agriculture, civil aviation, customs, energy
and environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
Premier Zhu had extensive contacts with people from all walks
of life in the US, thus promoting the mutual understanding and
friendship between the Chinese and American people, he said.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question on China's reaction toward the recent
assassination of an Iranian army leader, Sun denied any knowledge
of the assassination, but reiterated that "China always opposes
international terrorism".
</P>
<P>
China also expresses its deep concern and regret over the
civilian casualties caused by NATO's air strikes against
Yugoslavia, Sun said.
</P>
<P>
China has always held that NATO should stop the air strikes in
order to avoid the situation there from being complicated and
deteriorated, and turn the Kosovo issue back to the track of
political settlement, Sun added.
</P>
<P>
On Pakistan's test-fire of a mid-range missile Wednesday, Sun
said that China hopes India and Pakistan to concretely observe the
United Nations Resolution No.1172 in a bid to ensure regional
peace and stability in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's missile launch came after the test-launching of a
mid-range missile by India on April 11, and "the situation is
detrimental to the peace and stability in South Asia," he added.
</P>
<P>
All relevant sides are urged to take measures with responsible
attitude in order to prevent arms race acceleration in the region,
Sun said.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak's UAE Trip Reflects Close Ties: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's
visit to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) comes within the context of
the "special" and "close" relations between the two countries and
their leaders, a senior Egyptian official said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to Egypt's Voice of Arab radio, Information Minister
Sawat el-Sherif termed Mubarak's trip to the UAE as well as his
Asian tour as "successful" at both political and economic levels.
</P>
<P>
El-Sherif accepted the interview over telephone from Abu Dhabi,
where he was accompanying Mubarak in a three-day visit to the UAE
after wrapping up on Tuesday the nine-day Asian tour to China, South
Korea and Japan.
</P>
<P>
The talks between Mubarak and UAE President Sheikh Zayed Bin
Sultan Al-Nahyan dealt with several key issues including ways of
restoring Arab solidarity, the proposed Arab common market, the
Middle East peace process and the Iraqi issue, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders reiterated support for the Palestinians'
declaration of an independent state at a time when the Palestinian
leadership deems appropriate, el-Sherif said.

<P>
When it comes to the current situation in Malaysia, Sun said
that as a friendly neighbor of Malaysia, China hopes that "
Malaysia could maintain political stability and develop its
economy as fast as possible."
</P>
<P>
Sun made the remarks when asked to comment on the sentence of
ousted Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim to six years
in prison Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
China also demanded seriously that the US Government express
explicitly its opposition to resolutions concerning Taiwan that
were passed recently in the US Senate and House of Representatives,
according to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"We demand that the US government strictly adhere to the
principles laid down in the three Sino-US joint communiques and
the relevant commitments made by the US side, so as to prevent the
Taiwan issue from disturbing the development of Sino-US relations,
" said Sun.
</P>
<P>
The US Senate and House of representatives have recently passed
a resolution commemorating the 20th anniversary of the so-called "
Taiwan Relations Act". The Senate also passed "the Resolution
Relating to Taiwan's Participation in the World Health
Organization."
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan is a province of China," Sun said. "As an internal
affair of China, the Taiwan question brooks no interference of any
foreign country," he reiterated.
</P>
<P>
In 1979, the US side violated the principles of "the Joint
Communique on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relation Between
China and the US" by cooking up a so-called "Taiwan Relations Act"
in an attempt to legalize its action in using the Taiwan question
to interfere in China's internal affairs through a US domestic
legislature, he said.
</P>
<P>
Sun emphasized that "the Chinese Government has always stood
firmly opposed to this erroneous practice on the US side."
</P>
<P>
Not long ago, the US congress passed a resolution commemorating
the 20th anniversary of the so-called "Taiwan Relations Act,"
which constitutes a grave violation of the three joint communiques
between China and the US, and a flagrant interference in China's
internal affairs, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese side hereby expresses its strong resentment and
firm opposition to it," Sun stressed.
</P>
<P>
As known to all, he said, the World Health Organization is an
inter-governmental organization composed only of sovereign states.
As part of China, "Taiwan has no right whatsoever to accede to it.
"
</P>
<P>
Acting in disregard of the basic norms governing international
relations and the principles enshrined in the three joint
communiques between China and the US, the US Senate passed the so-
called "Resolution Relating to Taiwan's Participation in the World
Health Organization."
</P>
<P>
Talking about Yasser Arafat's current visit, Sun voiced his
belief here that "the visit will help promote bilateral friendship
and cooperation in various fields."
</P>
<P>
Arafat, president of the Palestine state and chairman of the
executive committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization, has
arrived in China, he said, and that meetings between Arafat and
Chinese leaders have been arranged.
</P>
<P>
Both sides will exchange views on issues of common concern,
such as bilateral relations and situation in the Middle East,
especially the Middle East peace process, according to Sun.
</P>
<P>
Sun refused to give a definite answer when asked here to
confirm if Vice-Premier Qian Qichen will visit Macao on April 20.
</P>
<P>
"Qian is mainly in charge of China's foreign relations, as well
as Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao affairs, "Sun said. "Qian paid a
visit to Macao recently, and will visit Macao in the future."
</P>
<P>
Sun added that Qian's visit to Macao will be announced if
decided.
</P>
<P>
He said that China supports the process of the ASEM meeting and
will actively take part in its follow-up actions.
</P>
<P>
Relevant countries, in the spirit of mutual respect, equality
and reciprocity, have pushed forward a cooperative momentum
between Asian and European nations since the first ASEM summit
meeting was held in Bangkok in 1996, according to Sun.
</P>
<P>
The follow-up actions set at the meeting have been proceeding
well, he said, adding that this demonstrates the common aspiration
of Asian and European nations to focus their attention on economic,
scientific and technological cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan announced,
at the just-concluded second ASEM Foreign Ministers' Meeting,
China's decision to donate 500,000 US dollars to the ASEM Trust
Fund and to host the third ASEM Foreign Ministers' Meeting in the
year 2001.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, the ASEM meeting for ministers of
science and technology will be held in Beijing next October.
</P>
<P>
He said China hopes that ASEM members would strictly abide by
the common grounds reached at the two ASEM summit meetings and
promote the ASEM meeting in a healthy way.

<HEADLINE> Death Sentence for Buddha Statue Thief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- A death sentence was handed down
today on a thief who stole and later, accidentally, destroyed
Beijing's oldest statue of Buddha.
</P>
<P>
Chen Mengxing, a farmer from north China's Hebei province, was
also found guilty of stealing another rare relic from a temple in
Shouyang County in Shanxi Province dating back somewhere in the
Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), according to the verdict handed down by
the Beijing No.1 Intermediate People's Court.
</P>
<P>
His accomplices Liu Xueru and Wang Liqiang were given life
imprisonment by the same court ruling.
</P>
<P>
The 165-cm-high stone Buddha statue, weighing two tons, dates
back to 499 A.D. and had been kept safe and intact in a house in
the village of Dong'erying in the western part of Beijing for the
past 1,500 years.
</P>
<P>
Because of its rare historical and aesthetic value, the local
government has listed the statue as a rare relic since 1957.
</P>
<P>
However, the house was not equipped with any automatic warning
device despite a fact that police had previously advised local
people to use better anti-theft measures after they decided to
open the house to the public.
</P>
<P>
On the night of March 25, 1998, the gang stole the statue but
it was badly damaged as they tried to move it. They later hid the
remains of the statue in the backyard of Liu Xueru's home.
</P>
<P>
The three were arrested last October. The shattered statue of
Buddha was later found and has been carefully repaired by a group
of experts organized by Beijing Cultural Relics Administration.
The repaired statue is said to have regained its past glamor and
is now safely located in the Beijing Carved Stone Art Museum.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Says to Observe Cease-fire Without </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia has said that it was
prepared to observe a cease-fire in the northern border without
demanding prior withdrawal of the Eritrean troops.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with foreign media in Addis Ababa Wednesday,
Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi said that "we are not saying
they have to withdraw first before there is a cease-fire."
</P>
<P>
Without a cease-fire, Eritrea cannot withdraw its troops, the
prime minister noted.
</P>
<P>
Meles said that Ethiopia's new position was part of a package
which would allow Ethiopia to honor a cease-fire if Eritrea would
promise to withdraw its troops from territories Ethiopia
administered along the 1,000- kilometer common border until last
May.
</P>
<P>
"If the Eritreans were to sign on the dotted line of package
that very clearly indicated that they would withdraw from our
territories in a certain specific time, as soon as they sign on
that package, on that dotted line, there is a cease-fire as far as
we are concerned," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the Ethiopian state-run media have not released any
information so far about the new government position on the
11-month border dispute with Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
And there was no immediate comment from the Eritrean side on
Ethiopia's new position on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Both Ethiopia and Eritrean have accepted the framework
agreement put forward by the Organization of African Unity (OAU).
The proposals contained in the framework agreement call for both
sides to pull back their troops and allow international monitors
into the disputed areas while a border commission establishes a
mutually recognized international boundary.
</P>
<P>
An OAU team, which was scheduled to leave for Asmara Tuesday,
is expected to Eritrea later this week to continue its peace
mission there.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan Tuesday announced
that he would send his special envoy for Africa, Mohamed Sahnoun,
back to the Horn of Africa.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council Tuesday also made a new call for an
immediate halt to the fighting between Ethiopia and Eritrea.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Offers Support to China's Access to WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The US aircraft manufacturer
Boeing said today that it has intensified its efforts to convince
the US Congress and the Clinton Administration to support China's
admission to World Trade Organization (WTO) and granting China
permanent extension of Most Favored Nation (MFN) status.
</P>
<P>
Ray Bracy, President of Boeing China Inc., today disclosed that
Philip M. Condit, chairman of the Business Round Table and
chairman and CEO of Boeing, recently wrote to President Clinton
and said, "It is now extremely important for the Clinton
Administration to press forward to resolve the remaining US-China
trade issues so that we can achieve the important objective of WTO
membership for China. Congress also will need to extend permanent
normal trade status to China as WTO rules require."
</P>
<P>
In the past 20 years, China has been expanding 2.5 times faster
than the economies of North America and Europe and it is predicted
by Boeing to be the world's largest in the next 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Bracy said, "Obviously, with a population of more than 1.2
billion, there is substantial business opportunity over the long
term in China, however, instability in US-China trade relations is
one of the biggest hurdles American companies face when they come
to do business in China."
</P>
<P>
That is why the Boeing Company, as one of the leaders of the
American business community, was dedicated to the effort to
accelerate the development of Sino-US relations, added Bracy.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that Boeing had a China work team made up of 200
persons, who were engaged in explaining the necessity of
maintaining normalized trade relations with China through various
ways.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the team had contacted more than 3,000 suppliers
in the US to advocate the benefits of improved Sino-US relations.
</P>
<P>
Bracy pointed out that the admission for China in the WTO would
help bring China's trade regime into compliance with international
norms, improve market access for foreign investments and help
China continue the economic reform.

<HEADLINE> Namibia to Develop Its Own Diamond Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Namibia is planning to open
up its diamond trade, thus ending the 50-year monopoly of rough
diamond by foreign developers and traders, the Business Day
newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Namibia's Standing Parliamentary Committee on Natural Resources
 reportedly submitted a report to the National Assembly early this
week, recommending that the diamond trade be deregulated and
decriminalized by the new Diamond Act.
</P>
<P>
The committee said the diamond trade was over-regulated and
overprotected, and ran contrary to stated government policy of
economic empowerment.
</P>
<P>
It recommended that Mines and Energy Minister Andima Toiva ya
Toiva be allowed to license diamond dealers to trade in uncut and
unpolished diamonds.
</P>
<P>
The committee recommended that the new law should apply to
Namibia's 200- kilometer exclusive economic zone, which would
bring the country's lucrative offshore diamond deposits under
direct state control.
</P>
<P>
It would also provide for the licensing of independent diamond
traders, as well as for the setting up of independent cutting and
polishing enterprises, a long cherished goal of the Namibian
government.
</P>
<P>
The bill tabled by the committee could be passed into law
before the end of the year, sources of parliament said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Namibia produced 1.3 million carats of diamonds. It
was estimated that Namibia's diamond output this year will come to
1.2 million carats.
</P>
<P>
The Namibian diamond trade has been monopolized by the South
African diamond giant De Beers and its London-based Central
Selling Organization.
</P>
<P>
The Namibian diamonds accounted for 10 percent of the total
sales of De Beers' selling branch in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Indian Parliament Debates on Motion of Confidence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The Lower House of the Indian
Parliament began debating on a motion moved by Prime Minister Atal
Behari Vajpayee to seek a vote of confidence for his government
here Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
The crucial voting on the motion of confidence in the
13-month-old Vajpayee government will take place at noon on
Saturday after a reply to the debate by the prime minister,
parliament sources said here.
</P>
<P>
Initiating the debate, leader of the opposition in the house
Sharad Pawar made a severe attack on the Vajpayee government,
saying it had no achievement to its credit in its 13-month tenure
and lost the right to remain in office even for a minute.
</P>
<P>
He said the Vajpayee administration became a minority
government after All-India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam
(AIADMK), one of its major allies, withdrew its support to the
government on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The economic situation had worsened, industrial production
slowed down and there was an increase in unemployment and poverty,
he charged.
</P>
<P>
Questioning the timing of test-firing Agni-11 ballistic missile
last Sunday, Pawar wondered whether the step was conducive to the
improvement of relations with Pakistan. It could trigger an arms
race in the region, he said.
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties were determined to vote out the Bharatiya
Janata Party (BJP)-led coalition and give the country a strong
secular alternative which could take it to the 21st century, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Another opposition party leader Laloo Prasad Yadav in his
debate asked Vajpayee to submit his resignation to the president
before the voting takes place on the confidence motion. The prime
minister should realize that the "ground is slipping from under
his feet," he said.
</P>
<P>
Home Minister L. K. Advani in the debate accused Congress of
trying to push the country to another mid-term poll and cautioned
other parties and groups not to fall into its trap.
</P>
<P>
"Congress wants this government to go so that fresh elections
could be held. All should understand this and have a rethinking on
the whole issue," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also criticized Left parties for joining hands with
Congress, saying it went against their ideology and election
manifestoes.

MANILA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The death toll of the bomb
explosion in a crowded dancing hall in Philippines' Southeastern
Albay province early Thursday increased to 12 and the wounded are
about 50, the Philippine News Agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The blast, believed to be coming from a home-made molotov type
bomb rocked the otherwise peaceful and gay celebration for the
patron of Barangay Ligwan, an interior village of Rapurapu town,
sending slivers of irons and glass shrapnells, and splatters of
flesh and blood in pandemonium.
</P>
<P>
Ten of those seriously wounded were either declared dead on
arrival or have expired while undergoing treatment at various
clinics in Albay, majority of whom were brought to the Bicol
Regional Training and Teaching Hospital in Legazpi City, three or
four hours travel by sea and land from the spot.
</P>
<P>
At least five more victims are in serious condition at the
hospital.
</P>

massacre.

MANILA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The death toll of the bomb
explosion in a crowded dancing hall in Philippines' Southeastern
Albay province early Thursday increased to 12 and the wounded are
about 50, the Philippine News Agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The blast, believed to be coming from a home-made molotov type

flesh and blood in pandemonium.

<P>
Ten of those seriously wounded were either declared dead on
arrival or have expired while undergoing treatment at various
clinics in Albay, majority of whom were brought to the Bicol

four hours travel by sea and land from the spot.
</P>
<P>
At least five more victims are in serious condition at the
hospital.

<HEADLINE> FM Spokesman: China Opposes US Resolution on Taiwan (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- China demanded today that the US
Government express explicitly its opposition to resolutions
concerning Taiwan that were passed recently in the US Senate and
House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
"We demand that the US government strictly adhere to the
principles laid down in the three Sino-US joint communiques and
the relevant commitments made by the US side, so as to prevent the
Taiwan issue from disturbing the development of Sino-US relations,
" said Foreign Ministry Spokesman Sun Yuxi at a routine press
conference here today.
</P>
<P>
The US Senate and House of representatives have recently passed
a resolution commemorating the 20th anniversary of the so-called "
Taiwan Relations Act". The Senate also passed "the Resolution
Relating to Taiwan's Participation in the World Health
Organization."
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan is a province of China," Sun said. "As an internal
affair of China, the Taiwan question brooks no interference of any
foreign country," the spokesman reiterated.
</P>
<P>
In 1979, the US side violated the principles of "the Joint
Communique on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relation Between
China and the US" by cooking up a so-called "Taiwan Relations Act"
in an attempt to legalize its action in using the Taiwan question
to interfere in China's internal affairs through a US domestic
legislature, he said.

Sun emphasized that "the Chinese Government has always stood
firmly opposed to this erroneous practice on the US side."
</P>
<P>
Not long ago, the US congress passed a resolution commemorating
the 20th anniversary of the so-called "Taiwan Relations Act,"
which constitutes a grave violation of the three joint communiques
between China and the US, and a flagrant interference in China's
internal affairs, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese side hereby expresses its strong resentment and
firm opposition to it," Sun stressed.
</P>
<P>
As known to all, he said, the World Health Organization is an
inter-governmental organization composed only of sovereign states.
As part of China, "Taiwan has no right whatsoever to accede to it.
"
</P>
<P>
Acting in disregard of the basic norms governing international
relations and the principles enshrined in the three joint
communiques between China and the US, the US Senate passed the so-
called "Resolution Relating to Taiwan's Participation in the World
Health Organization."
</P>
<P>
Sun noted that "the Chinese side is firmly opposed to it."

<HEADLINE> Explosion Occurs in Indonesian Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- A big explosion rocked a crowded
shopping complex in Jakarta, capital of Indonesia, Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman of the Jakarta Police, Zainuri Lubis, said the
explosion hit Hayam Wuruk Plaza in Central Jakarta at about 11:00
a.m. local time.
</P>
<P>
However, the explosion did not leave any casualty but damaged
the building's plasterboards and glass walls and attracted a lot
of people, creating a traffic jam in the area, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the explosion though, robbers attacked a branch
of Bank Central Asia (BCA) in nearby Gajah Mada street, killing a
security guard and wounding the branch's manager, he said.
</P>
<P>
The robbers consist of 6 persons with sharp weapons. Two of the
robbers were arrested on spot along with about 53 million rupiah
(about 7,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Lubis said the police is looking into the possible links
between the explosion and the robbery.

<HEADLINE> Turkish PM Larger Conflict May Flare in Balkans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit
has warned against the start of a larger conflict in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
Local Daily News Thursday quoted Ecevit as saying that "this is a
dangerous development. It might spark a huge fire in the whole
region," Ecevit said.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia has been under heavy NATO air strikes in the past three
weeks for its rejection of a peace deal with separatist ethnic
Albanians that would allow NATO troops in Kosovo to enforce the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo is a Serbian province in Yugoslavia, and 90 percent of its
population are ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit denied the report that the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization has officially asked Turkey to fully participate in the
bombardment of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
As a member state of NATO, Turkey has been supporting the military
alliance's air strikes against Yugoslavia since march 24.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has 11 F-16 fighters stationed at the Ghedy air base in
northern Italy for defensive missions to protect the large bombers of
NATO in air strikes against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit said that as a Balkan Country, it would be risky for Turkey
to participate in NATO bombardment of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Ministry deputy spokesman Sermet Atacanli also
ruled out such a request for Turkey to fully participate in NATO
bombardment.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Plans to Maintain Ancient Temples </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has planned to maintain 12
ancient temples in the area of Aswan, 700 kilometers south of Cairo,
the Egyptian Gazette newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The restoration of the rock-cut temples in southern Egypt will be
finished this year in three phases, Minister of Culture Farouk Hosni
said during a visit to Aswan last week.
</P>
<P>
Local companies will assume the maintenance work, which is
estimated to cost 45 million Egyptian pounds (13.24 million U.S.
dollars), Hosni said.
</P>
<P>
Areas surrounding the temples are also to be upgraded by installing
light and sound system and paving roads leading to the archaeological
sites, he added.
</P>
<P>
The restoration of the temples is part of a project to develop
tourism as well as economy in southern Egypt, the minister stressed.
</P>
<P>
The temples include the Philae, Amada, Al Daka and Al Mahraka,
which date back to the Ptolemaic age about 300 BC, and Al Dor, Abu
Simble and Al Sobu, which belong to the 19th dynasty ruled by Ramsis
II (1223-1290 BC).
</P>
<P>
Some of the temples were rescued from the rising water of Lake
Nasser after the construction of the High Dam on the Nile, under a
campaign launched by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization in the 1960s. The monuments were moved to higher
places for preservation.

Spokesman of the provincial government, Jafete Mabote, said in
Maputo Wednesday that it was time for the Mozambican central
government and the non-governmental organizations to seek for
necessary supports for the replacement of the repatriated.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the central government to coordinate with the
South African authorities so that the later will not deal with the
issue unilaterally.
</P>
<P>
The southern Maputo province was angry with the South Africa's
unilateral action of repatriating Mozambican citizens, Mabote
said, noting that recently, the number of the repatriated
Mozambicans has increased from 500 per week to 1,500.
</P>
<P>
The Noticias newspaper Thursday quoted the spokesman as saying
that the provincial government does not have the money to
rehabilitate the repatriated who returned Mozambique and could not
afford the bus tickets for home.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that last year some 60,000 Mozambicans who had
been living and working illegally in South Africa were repatriated
without any notice to the Mozambican side.

JOHANNESBURG, April 15 (Xinhua) -- A nation-wide bus strike
began in South Africa Thursday following a deadlock in wage
negotiations between four major transports unions and the South
African Bus Employers Association.
</P>
<P>
About 18,000 transport employees have been involved in the
countrywide strike, the South African Broadcasting Cooperation
reported.
</P>
<P>
The workers are demanding an 11 percent wage increase, whereas
management is offering only six percent, the strike organizers
said.
</P>
<P>
The association officials said they would not resume wage talks
with the striking workers until they agreed to compromise.
</P>
<P>
So far, the strike has not affected municipal bus services in
the country, as the municipal drivers do not belong to any of the
four unions involved in the dispute.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's former prime
minister Benazir Bhutto and her spouse were disqualified for
public office and awarded five years' imprisonment on Thursday
morning.
</P>
<P>
The chairwoman of the Pakistan People's Party (PPP), the
largest opposition, and sitting senator, was also fined 8.6
million U.S. dollars for a corruption prosecution by Rawalpindi
Ehtesab (Accountability) bench of the Lahore High Court.
</P>
<P>
Her spouse Asif Zardari, former minister of investment in
Bhutto's cabinet and chairman of Central Board of Revenue, was
involved in the same case.
</P>
<P>
A short order was announced by the Ehtesab Bench that both the
accused persons got illegal gratification from the SGS and
Cotecna, both Swiss companies, against the award of contract for
customs evaluation.
</P>
<P>
The court in its short order observed that the prosecution has
succeeded in proving the case against the couple.
</P>
<P>
It further observed that the commission appointed by the court
to verify the validity of the documents from Swiss Authorities has
also confirmed that the documents provided by the prosecution were
valid and authenticated documents.
</P>
<P>
Bhutto's defending counsel Abdul Hafeez Pirzada, however, said
the decision of awarding contract to the two Swiss companies were
taken by the cabinet committee and the collective responsibility
lies in the cabinet though the prime minister was the first among
the equals.
</P>
<P>
Bhutto's PPP government was dismissed by the then president
Farooq Leghari in November 1996 and Nawaz Sharif won the following
general election to form the current Pakistan Muslim League
government.

<HEADLINE> China Export Trade Fair Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The 85th China Export Commodity
Trade Fair, one of the country's most important annual occasions
for promoting exports, opened here today.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 64,000 business people from 177 countries and
regions are expected to attend the 15-day fair, which features
exhibits of domestic products ranging from textiles, light
industrial handicraft articles, machinery, and chemicals to
medicines, health care, food, and animal husbandry.
</P>
<P>
This year's fair is the first after establishing a website on
the Internet, on which people can obtain information on exhibiting
companies and products.
</P>
<P>
No effort has been spared in the promotion of exports at the
fair, as restrictions on the transaction volume of high-tech
machinery producers have been lifted, and more overseas-invested
companies are being allowed to participate.
</P>
<P>
A number of private firms that have been given export rights
this year will be striking a pose at the fair, while some older
foreign trade companies have now disappeared.
</P>
<P>
The Guangzhou Trade Fair has been held twice a year since 1957.
Its annual transactions normally account for 30 percent of the
country's total export volume, and some 21.2 billion U.S. dollars
worth of trade was accomplished at last year's two sessions.
</P>
<P>
The number of overseas buyers at the fair increase by about 10,
000 every two years on average. At the autumn fair last year,
contracts made with companies from the European Union accounted
for 31 percent of the total, and those with United States
companies amounted to 16 percent. Business with the countries of
Latin America and Africa also increased by a wide margin.
</P>
<P>
Currently, China's exports are facing mounting difficulties due
to a waning international market and Asia's financial crisis.
Foreign trade rose 0.3 percent in the first quarter, about the
same quarterly growth as last year, reaching 70 billion U.S.
dollars, with exports falling 7.9 percent to 37 billion U.S
dollars, according to Customs figures.

BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- China's Ministry of Justice plans
to make a hotline service available nationwide within two years in
a bid to provide more general legal aid.

first three months this year, the official said, describing the

<HEADLINE> WTO Membership to Make China's SOEs More Competitive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Membership in the World Trade
Organization (WTO) will make China's state-owned enterprises (SOEs)
more competitive, according to a commentary in China Economic
Times.
</P>
<P>
Joining the WTO will promote China's SOEs to the market
frontier, and accelerate their reforms, the article said.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement issued during Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji's
visit to the United States, the U.S. committed itself to firmly
supporting China's entry into the WTO this year.
</P>
<P>
Some SOEs may continue to operate at a loss after China enters
the WTO, and there could be more of them closing and laying-off
more workers. But in the long run, all of these enterprises will
have to become more competitive under the pressure of competition,
it said.
</P>
<P>
There is now a condition of competitive imbalance between SOEs
and non-SOEs in China, as SOEs are under the protection of
government administration, while the non-SOEs are not.
</P>
<P>
However, statistics show that of the more than 7,680 large and
medium-sized SOEs, those operating in the red exceed 2,300,
accounting for about 30 percent of all state enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Dew Project Improves Shaanxi Water Supply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The Dew Project has provided more
than 4.2 million people living in arid areas in northwestern
Shaanxi Province with adequate water for both consumption and
irrigation.
</P>
<P>
The local government launched the project in 1996, with more
than one billion yuan (120 million US dollars) in provincial
allocations over the past three years for the construction of 10,
000 water-supply projects, including wells, ponds and water
storage pits for family-use.
</P>
<P>
The water projects have played a major role in helping Shaanxi
overcome problems related to this year's lingering dry spells.
</P>
<P>
The local meteorological department reported that there was
practically no snowfall or precipitation in 72 Shaanxi counties
during the November-March period. In addition, temperatures in the
region have averaged one to three degrees centigrade higher than
normal.
</P>
<P>
Water flow rates for three major rivers in the province are 33
percent below rates in previous years. The severe drought has
impacted 1.2 million ha of cropland, or 70 percent of the total
acreage planted to cross-winter crops.
</P>
<P>
Water projects built over the past three years are currently
operating at full capacity. The province has allocated 120 million
yuan (145,000 US dollars) to construct irrigation facilities.
Moreover, 340 drought-combatting brigades staffed by over two
million local officials and workers have been formed.
</P>
<P>
Irrigation efforts have been carried out on over 900,000
hectares of Shaanxi's arid land.

<HEADLINE> Sales Drop for China's Large Department Stores </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey on China's 286
leading department stores reveals that the growth rate of their
total sales volume, retail sales volume and profits all slowed
down last year, reaching the lowest point in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted by the Information Center under the
State Administration of Internal Trade (SAIT).
</P>
<P>
The total sales volume of the 286 large department stores hit
some 107 billion yuan, slightly up 0.29 percent on an annual basis;
and retail sales volume was 85.2 billion yuan, up 2.62 percent.
</P>
<P>
The country's 1998 total retail sales volume was 2,915.3
billion yuan, up 6.8 percent, according to the SAIT survey.
</P>
<P>
Profits of these department stores exceeded 2.23 billion yuan,
a year-on-year drop of 16.93 percent. About one half of them were
making less profit and 53 of them are even losing money.
</P>
<P>
There are 221 department stores whose sales volume was over 100
million yuan each last year, including 22 each with more than one
billion yuan in sales.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts noted that the overall pattern of the
commercial market remained quite unchanged and that retail sales
were highest in downtown areas of large cities, Beijing and
Shanghai in particular.
</P>
<P>
Seven department stores in Beijing and eight in Shanghai were
labeled as the top ten best-performing ones in terms of the above-
mentioned three indicators.
</P>
<P>
Veteran department stores nationwide still have a huge
attraction. Beijing Wangfujing Department Store and Wuhan
Department Store were knocked out of the top ten, replaced by a
Nanjing department store and a Wuxi department store.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Tea Production to Drop in 1999: Authority </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's tea production in 1999 is
expected to drop by about 35 percent due to droughts in many parts
of the tea- growing country, the Kenya Tea Development Authority
(KTDA) has said.
</P>
<P>
The dry spell between December and February is likely to result
in a drop from the record-breaking 750 million kilograms of leaf
last year to about 500 million kg this year, managing director of
the authority Eustace Karanja said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
However, improved management of tea factory companies and
purchase of new trucks had resulted in decreasing operation costs,
the Daily Nation newspaper Thursday quoted Karanja as saying.
</P>
<P>
The managing director noted that prices at tea auctions were
also not so good as those of last year.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the restructuring and liberalization of the tea
industry, the director said that the move would give farmers more
pay and also lower cost of production leaving bigger profit
margins for farmers.
</P>
<P>
He said the Kenya Tea Development Authority, which would
transform itself into Kenya Tea Development Agency, would be
acting as a private management body helping to manage the tea
factory companies.
</P>
<P>
The procurement of fertilizers, computers, trucks and other
machinery would be also continue to be done through the authority
for greater efficiency, he added.
</P>
<P>
The on-going restructuring and liberalization of small holder
tea sub- sector and the Kenya Tea Development Authority will be
finalized by January 2000, the director said.
</P>
<P>
Tea is one of Kenya's major foreign exchange earners. Last
year, Kenya earned about 580 million U.S. dollars through
exporting tea.

<HEADLINE> BOC Supports Loss-Making SOEs with Closed-End Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Sources from the Bank of China (
BOC) said today that the BOC had granted closed-end loans of 2.98
billion yuan and 4.3 million U.S. dollars by the end of February
to help loss-making state-owned enterprises (SOEs) overcome their
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Of these loans, 1.76 billion yuan and 3.08 million U.S. dollars
went to 178 foreign-trade enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Closed-end loans are loans earmarked for funding specific
projects, and the debtors are not allowed to use the capital for
purposes other than these pre-designated projects.
</P>
<P>
Sources said the BOC has detailed regulations governing these
loans in order to minimize financial risk.
</P>
<P>
Strict management measures have thus far yielded good results,
according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
The BOC provided 120 million yuan in closed-end loans to the
Chifeng Foreign Trade Corporation in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous
Region to purchase cashmere, helping the company to grow rapidly.
The BOC now has recovered all of the closed-end loans it provided
to Chifeng, as well as 8.6 million yuan from old loans to the
company.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo said here
Thursday at an annual Sino-French Economic Seminar that China and
France can cooperate well in many economic sectors.
</P>
<P>
"China and France are highly complementary in their economy,"
he said in a speech at the opening ceremony of the 5th Sino-French
Economic Seminar.
</P>

expansion," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jointly launched by the China Council for the Promotion of
International Trade (CCPIT) and the France-China Committee of
France, the seminar is attracting more than 300 French and Chinese

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Crack Down Unroadworthy Vehicle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The South Africa Bureau of
Standards (SABS) has vowed to crack down on imported vehicles that
do not comply with its standards.
</P>
<P>
Although these imports are not necessarily illegal, the fact
that they have been manufactured for foreign markets can make them
unroadworthy in South Africa, Local daily Business Day Thursday
quoted SABS as saying.
</P>
<P>
The so-called grey car import market is threatening to
undermine SABS standards. It also affects local vehicle
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
Minibuses and trucks can be imported cheaply from Southeast
Asian countries and sold for a huge profit in South Africa, SABS
sources said.
</P>
<P>
Consumers are also at risk because of technically inferior
products, the absence of after-sale services and vehicle parts.
</P>
<P>
John Nimmo, a manager of Toyota South Africa, said his company
is aware that a large number of grey imports of Toyota products
are being sold in the country.
</P>
<P>
The SABS has drawn up a set of proposals to ensure that only
vehicles meeting standard, or those for which a full justification
for importation is provided, will allowed into the country.
</P>
<P>
These proposals will be adopted on May 1 when customs officials
will be empowered to refuse entry to any vehicles not issued with
a letter of authority from the SABS.
</P>
<P>
Wimpie Lyons, managers of the bureau's electrotechnical and
automobile department, said that a five-day period of grace will
be allowed for the letter of authority to be produced by the
consignee."
</P>
<P>
"If the letter is not produced the vehicle will either be
returned to the sources country at the shipper's expense or
forfeited to the state," Lyon was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
A letter of authority can be obtained only on application from
the SABS. Applications must be made in good time and will be
granted only if full justification for the import is provided and
proof of compliance with bureau requirements is produced.
</P>
<P>
Immigrants to South Africa who wish to import their vehicles to
the country will have to obtain a personal letter of authority
before their cars arrive.
</P>

yet to be explored.

"It has become a very important channel for entrepreneurs of
both countries to exchange ideas, and have greatly pushed forward
the trade and economic cooperation between the two sides," he said.

characteristics at auctions scheduled from April 20 to 22 in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The auctioneers estimate that the well-known work, Lijiang

</P>
<P>
These Spring auctions by the China Guardian Auctions Company
will include more than 500 ancient, modern and contemporary

<HEADLINE> Rural Poets: What Does Literature Brings To You? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- There is a group of young and
energetic people in the remote areas of northwest China's Gansu
Province and southwest China's Yunnan Province who wrote poetry in
their leisure time when they are not doing farm work.
</P>
<P>
In May, the monthly publication Poetry Magazine will publish an
edition of the works of some of these young poets from the poor
mountainous areas of Gansu Province, and a magazine called "
Everyone" in Yunnan Province will publish a survey in its next
edition with answers from 15 poets from the rural areas of Yunnan
Province to the question, "What does literature bring to you?"
</P>
<P>
This shows that the poems of these young farmers are beginning
to draw attention, said Ye Yanbing, deputy chief editor of Poetry
Magazine.
</P>
<P>
Ye said his magazine sent editors to Lintan County in
mountainous area in southern part of Gansu Province, which is 3,
000 meters above sea level and has a low per-hectare grain output,
to do some poverty-relief work last year.
</P>
<P>
The editors were surprised to find that in this poverty-
stricken area many people were writing poetry, and some of their
poems were very good, according to the Shanghai Wenhui Daily. "We
receive works from these poor farmer poets almost every day," said
Lei Pingyang, an editor at 'Everyone', "and they come not only
from one particular area, but from all over the country."
</P>
<P>
There is usually a story behind the poems in which the author
tells of his or her bitter living conditions which makes you sad,
Lei said. "Some poems I have received are written on small writing
pads used by middle-school students."
</P>
<P>
"But these young poets really show their true feelings in their
poems and are very conscientious about their writing," said Lei. "
This makes their work different from the literature of urban
residents."
</P>
<P>
"Their poems, sprouting from the real life of country people,
are full of love for their hometowns, and full of passion and the
confidence of youth," noted Poetry Magazine.

million dollars of foreign financial grants in 1998 to rehabilitate
the aging water supply systems of the desert kingdom.

<P>
BOSTON, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji's visit
to the United States has achieved positive results as had been
expected, Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan said on Wednesday
at the end of the visit.
</P>
<P>
The positive results have been achieved through frank and
candid talks and discussions between Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji
and U.S. President Bill Clinton and other leaders during the eight
days of the visit in six cities, Tang told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Tang, who accompanied Premier Zhu in the entire trip, summed up
four results of Premier Zhu's visit.
</P>
<P>
It has vigorously pushed forward the Sino-U.S. relations in the
direction of establishing a constructive strategic partnership
between China and the United States, Tang said of the first result.
</P>
<P>
"After in-depth exchanges of views on bilateral relations and
international and regional issues, Premier Zhu and President
Clinton agreed that both China and the United States, as permanent
members of the U.N. Security Council, should take on great
responsibility for world peace and development despite their
differences," Tang said.
</P>
<P>
He said development of Sino-U.S. relations conforms to the
fundamental interests of the two countries and two peoples; it
also serves peace, stability and development of the Asia-Pacific
area and the world at large.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, Premier Zhu's visit has deepened mutual understanding
and strengthened friendship between the Chinese and American
peoples, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
During his tour of six cities in eight days, Tang said, Premier
Zhu made direct contacts with Americans of various levels from
senior administration officials, to lawmakers, state officials,
business leaders, the media and other walks of life, bringing them
to a comprehensive understanding of China's on-going reforms and
the situation of the economic development there, of the Chinese
people's aspiration for peace and progress, and of China's
position on major international issues.
</P>
<P>
Premier Zhu, while adhering to the principles, reasoned with
facts and clarified misunderstandings among some misinformed
Americans, winning high appreciation from them and boosted their
support for further improvement of Sino-U.S. relations, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, important progress has been made in Sino- U.S.
negotiations on China's entry into the World Trade Organization (
WTO), Tang said. This was reflected in the joint communique on
issues concerning China's entry into the WTO, in which the U.S.
government made it clear that it firmly supports China to enter
the WTO in 1999. The two sides have reached consensus that China's
early entry into the WTO is in the interests of both countries.
</P>
<P>
Finally, Tang pointed out, Zhu's visit has given impetus to
cooperation in various areas between the two countries. The many
agreements signed during the visit will yield benefits to both
peoples.

<HEADLINE> Another Drought in New Zealand Forecast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, April 15 (Xinhua) -- La Nina weather patterns are
likely to continue in New Zealand and can bring drought to Otaga,
an important sheep and beef farming area on South Island, for the
third year in a row, the Dominion reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Wellington-based newspaper quoted Director Rick Pridmore of
the National Institute for Water and Atmospheric Research as
saying scientists are "pretty sure" La Nina will persist through
winter, bringing further dry weather to Otaga.
</P>
<P>
Continued La Nina weather patterns will also be likely to bring
 drought to Hawke's Bay on North Island and Marlborough on South
Island, and can "spell disaster for farmers already struggling to
survive after two years of drought", he said.
</P>
<P>
Senior climate scientist Reid Basher said the severity of the
drought experienced by Otaga this summer will normally only be
expected once every 30 years.
</P>
<P>
According to officials of the New Zealand Ministry of
Agriculture and Forestry, farm gate losses from last year's
drought are estimated at 460 million NZ dollars (248 million U.S.
dollars), this year's drought costs another 200 million NZ dollars
(108 million U.S. dollars), and the flow-on effects next year are
expected to cost farmers another 300 million NZ dollars (162
million U.S. dollars), a total farm gate loss of 960 million NZ
dollars (518 million U.S. dollars). The total cost to the New
Zealand economy is estimated at around 3.5 billion NZ dollars
(1.89 billion U.S. dollars).

<P>
The Australian Bureau of Statistics said in early March that
the Australian economy grew at 4.7 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
"Economic growth will surely slow in Australia in 1999," JP
Morgan senior economist John Kyriakopoulos said.
</P>
<P>
The quarterly report said gross domestic product (GDP) growth
was expected to drop to 2.7 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
Australian federal Treasurer Peter Costello said Wednesday the
Australian economy would slow this year, adding "if the slowing
comes back to two to three percent, that'll be a fantastic
outcome".
</P>
<P>
"Australia has mostly weathered the storm from Asia's
recession, but not without some economic damage," Kyriakopoulos
told the Australian Associated Press Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"For example, while big spending consumers have been the engine
of recent GDP (gross domestic product) growth, they have not
prevented a sharp slowing in overall private spending growth,
which is now at 1993 and 1996 levels, when the RBA (the Reserve
Bank of Australia) was cutting interest rates."
</P>
<P>
Kyriakopoulos also said the boost in infrastructure from the
2000 Olympics was fading as construction came close to completion
and residential investment was experiencing a modest downturn.
</P>
<P>
"However, exports could improve as trading partner growth
rebounds, but mining investment will remain depressed for some
time," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Households are still benefiting from historically low and
stable interest rates, rising real wages and continuing job gains
which have boosted consumer confidence.
</P>
<P>
"But public sector employees will not receive substantial pay
rises again for several years as the federal government aims to
keep a tight rein on spending."
</P>
<P>
For world financial markets, the JP Morgan report forecast
faster global growth by the second half of this year, with Japan's
recession almost over.
</P>
<P>
"The better tone to global growth can occur even though a
slowing of the U.S. economy later in the year is a key feature of
the forecast," the report said.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar and GDP Growth to Rise: ABARE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Growth in Australian real gross
domestic product (GDP) would jump from three percent in the fiscal
year of 1999-2000 to 3.5 percent for the next four years, with the
Australian dollar rising to 72 U.S. cents in the same period, the
government's chief commodities forecaster predicted Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A new report by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and
Resource Economics (ABARE) predicts GDP growth will remain at 3.5
percent until the fiscal year of 2003-2004 before declining to 3.3
percent for 2004-06 and then 3.2 percent for the fiscal year of
2006-2008.
</P>
<P>
ABARE then assumes a growth rate of three percent for the next
seven years until the fiscal year of 2014-2015.
</P>
<P>
However, JP Morgan's World Financial Markets report released
Thursday said Australia's economic growth rate was expected to
drop to 2.7 percent this year from the 4.9 percent calendar year
result in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Australian federal Treasurer Peter Costello said Wednesday the
Australian economy would slow this year, adding "if the slowing
comes back to two to three percent, that'll be a fantastic
outcome".
</P>
<P>
ABARE expects the Australian dollar, which was buying 63.94
U.S. cents at the close of trade Wednesday, to gradually
strengthen from 65 U.S. cents in the fiscal year of 1999-2000,
which starts on July 1, 1999, to 68 U.S. cents in the following
fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
It said the Australian dollar would cut the 70 U.S. cent
barrier the next year and then strengthening slowly again to reach
a peak of 75 U.S. cents from 2006-2009.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar is then expected to decline slightly to
be worth about 72 U.S. cents by the year 2014-15.
</P>
<P>
World oil prices (in 1999 dollars) are forecast to rise from
12.84 U.S. dollars per barrel in the fiscal year of 1999-2000 to
15.40 U.S. dollars in the fiscal year of 2001-2002 before
gradually declining to 11.50 U.S. dollars in the fiscal year of
2014-2015.
</P>
<P>
ABARE has also predicted Australia's population is likely to
rise from 19.1 million people in the fiscal year of 1999-2000 to
21.6 million people by the fiscal year of 2014-2015.

<HEADLINE> TV Series to Draw Laughter and Tears from Audience </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- China Central Television Station
(CCTV) and many other TV stations have their eyes on a new TV
comedy series depicting the life of an ordinary Beijing resident.
</P>
<P>
Based on the novel "The Happy Life of Zhang Damin, the
Garrulous," the 20-part TV series presents interesting episodes in
the life of a young man living with his large family in a small
single-storey house in one of Beijing's hutongs (narrow lane).
</P>
<P>
The author of the novel, Liu Heng, also wrote the TV version of
his story, according to the Beijing Daily.
</P>
<P>
The novel has already been made into a movie called "A Tree in
the House" which was screened in Beijing and other cities during
the Spring Festival, the Chinese lunar new year festival.
</P>
<P>
Since the movie has been warmly received by audiences across
the country, CCTV and local TV stations in Beijing, Shanghai and
Hunan are anxious to present the TV series.
</P>
<P>
"The story of Zhang represents the lives of many ordinary
people here in our city, and they will personally relate to this
series," said Yin Hong, a professor at Beijing Normal University.
</P>
<P>
The TV series, which combines serious elements with laughter
and tears, is one of the few current TV drama portraying ordinary
people in China in a real way, said TV critic Zhang Yongjing.

<HEADLINE> Pak Successfully Test-fires Shaheen-I Missile  by Wang Wei </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan successfully
test-fired a Shaheen-I ballistic missile Thursday morning, about
24 hours after its launching of a Ghauri-II missile, a Foreign
Office statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Shaheen ballistic missile, a surface-to-surface missile,
was test-fired at 09:50 a.m. local time (0450 GMT) from Sonmiani,
around 75 kilometers northwest of Pakistan's southern port city of
Karachi, an informed source told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The Shaheen missile hit the target in the desert area of Nok
Kundi in Pakistan's southwestern province of Balochistan bordering
Iran after a little more than five minutes, the source said.
</P>
<P>
One source from the Kahuta Research Laboratory, when contacted,
said that the government is expected to announce the concerned
details later in the day.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Office has called for a press briefing at 14:45
p.m. Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The statement by the Foreign Office said earlier that "the test
concludes, for now, the series of SSM (surface-to- surface
missile) flight tests involving solid and liquid fuel rocket motor
technologies, which started yesterday (Wednesday)."
</P>
<P>
However, the source from the Kahuta Research Laboratory
indicated that Pakistan is likely to conduct more tests of
Ghauri-II ballistic missile with an expanded range.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan successfully test fired a Ghauri-II missile Wednesday
morning after its successful launching of Ghauri-I a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said in a briefing in Ormara navy
base in Balochistan that the Ghauri-II missile, with a payload
capacity of 1,000 kilograms, had an effective target range of
2,000 kilometers, one-third longer than the earlier version of
Ghauri-I, which has a range of 1,500 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Due to the non-availability of enough depth in Pakistan
required to carry out the test to its full range, the Ghauri-II
was tested at a reduced range of 1,150 kilometers, said Sharif.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources said that Pakistan will carry out another test
of Ghauri-II with an effective target range, and target is to be
set on the Arabian sea.
</P>
<P>
Shaheen, with a range of 600 kilometers, employs a solid fuel
motor and can be tipped with any type of warhead, the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
However, sources from the test site said the flight range of
Shaheen-I was 700 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The Shaheen-I missile, 13-meter long, weighs around 9 tons and
has a maximum range of 750 kilometers with a payload of 1,000
kilograms.
</P>
<P>
Media reports said that a second more advanced Shaheen-II with
a range of 2,300 kilometers is ready and waiting to be tested.
</P>
<P>
However, there is no announcement of when or whether that the
Shaheen-II would be tested.

<HEADLINE> Honey Bees Found to Be Scheming, Factional: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- An Australian biologist has
found bees to be scheming and factional.
</P>
<P>
Ben Oldroyd, 40, a senior lecturer from the School of
Biological Sciences at the University of Sydney, has found a
genetic mutation can make usually sterile female worker bees rebel
and lay "counterfeit Queen bee eggs", causing chaos and
destruction within the bee colony.
</P>
<P>
The mutant trait occurs in approximately one in 2.5 million
bees, and Oldroyd's finding has generated enormous excitement
among his international colleagues, the Australian Associated
Press reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a normal bee colony, the Queen is the only one allowed to
lay eggs. If a worker does lay her own eggs, they are quickly
eaten by other jealous "policing" workers.
</P>
<P>
In "anarchist" colonies, certain rebelling workers are able to
lay eggs that are unidentifiable from the Queen's, causing the
eggs to survive, thrive and reproduce.
</P>
<P>
The colony continues for about three to four months until all
the workers start laying eggs, the Queen's power is marginalized,
the workers stop working and the colony rapidly disintegrates.
</P>
<P>
His discovery also explains why the Queen bee is the only bee
who reproduces, solving a problem that has long puzzled Darwinian
theorists.
</P>
<P>
"Purely Darwinian logic would say every individual worker bee
should raise their own eggs because she gets more of her own genes
into the next generation. Instead, female worker bees provide a
nest for the Queen to lay her eggs in, feed her lava, raise her
kids and do all the work," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We now have a Darwinian explanation of why workers (normally)
don't lay their own eggs. They have all agreed in evolutionary
terms to rear the Queen's eggs. They hate it, but are trapped in
it."

<HEADLINE> Australia Rejects UNESCO Report on Kakadu National Park </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The Australian federal
government Thursday rejected a UNESCO report which called for
Kakadu National Park in northwest Australia to be placed on the
endangered list because of the threat posed by the Jabiluka
uranium mine.
</P>
<P>
Australian Environment Minister Robert Hill said scientific
evidence proved the natural values of Kakadu would not be
threatened by the development of the mine.
</P>
<P>
Hill said the report of the United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage
mission contained "several errors of science, law and logic".
</P>
<P>
Located in the Northern Territory, northwest Australia, the
Kakadu National Park covers 20,000 square km.
</P>
<P>
Many environmentalists have been calling on the Australian
government not to approve the uranium mining project adjacent to
the park, but the government rejected their environmental
concerns, saying jobs and export income to be generated from the
mining project is important.
</P>
<P>
Hill said Australia's response to the report "clearly
demonstrated that there is no basis to including Kakadu National
Park on the in-danger list".
</P>
<P>
The findings of the mission report were inconsistent with the
fact the Ranger uranium mine, less than 20 km from Jabiluka had
operated for 20 years with no adverse impact on Kakadu.
</P>
<P>
"This proves mining can occur on leases adjacent to Kakadu
without harming World Heritage values," he told journalists in
Canberra.

<HEADLINE> ABCs of Macao SAR Basic Law (31) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Following is part 31 of a
question and answer series on the Basic Law of the Macao Special
Administrative Region (MSAR).
</P>
<P>
What are the two roles that the Chief Executive of the Macao
Special Administrative Region has?
</P>
<P>
Article 45 of the Basic Law says the Chief Executive of the
Macao Special Administrative Region shall be head of the Macao
Special Administrative Region who represents the region.
</P>
<P>
It is clear from this article that his first role is as the
highest official of the region.
</P>
<P>
The MSAR is an administrative region under the jurisdiction of
the Central People's Government and its Chief Executive is elected
by the Election Committee composed of local people.
</P>
<P>
As such, the Chief Executive shall, according to the
stipulations of the Basic Law, be accountable to the Central
People's Government and to the MSAR in accordance with the Basic
law.
</P>
<P>
To allocate the Chief Executive with the role of the highest
local officer conforms to the status of a highly autonomous region
in a unified country.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the relationship between the Central Government
and the MSAR, for instance, the Chief Executive shall implement,
on behalf of the MSAR, the directives issued by the Central
Government on matters under its responsibility.
</P>
<P>
As for the internal affairs of the region, the Chief Executive
may sign the bills adopted by the Legislative Council and
promulgate laws in his capacity as the highest local officer.
</P>
<P>
According to Article 62 of the Basic Law, the second role of
the Chief Executive is head of the government of MSAR who takes
charge of the day-to-day work of its government.

<HEADLINE> ABCs of Macao SAR Basic Law (32) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Following is part 32 of a
question and answer series on the Basic Law of the Macao Special
Administrative Region (MSAR).
</P>
<P>
What is the nature of the Executive Council of the Macao
Special Administrative Region?
</P>
<P>
Article 56 of the Basic Law says the MSAR shall establish an
executive council. The Executive Council shall not be an
administrative organ, but an organ to assist the Chief Executive
in making policies.
</P>
<P>
The members of the Executive Council shall be Chinese citizens
who are permanent residents of the MSAR.
</P>
<P>
The Executive Council shall be composed of seven to 11 persons
to be appointed by the Chief Executive from among the principal
officials of the executive authorities, members of the Legislative
Council and public figures. The term of office of members of the
Executive Council shall not extend beyond the expiry of the term
of office of the Chief Executive who appoints them.
</P>
<P>
But members of the original Executive Council shall remain in
office until the new Chief Executive is selected.
</P>
<P>
The Executive Council shall meet at least one a month and such
meetings shall be presided over by the Chief Executive who may, as
he or she deems necessary, invite other persons concerned to sit
in on such meetings.
</P>
<P>
It is the main function of the Executive Council to be
consulted by the Chief Executive before the latter makes important
policy decisions, introduces bills to the Legislative Council,
formulates administrative regulations or dissolves the Legislative
Council, except for the appointment, removal and disciplining of
officials and the adoption of measures in emergencies.
</P>
<P>
If the Chief Executive does not accept a majority opinion of
the Executive Council, he or she shall put the specific reasons on
record.
</P>
<P>
At present, there is a similar body in Macao known as the
Consultative Council which is composed of 10 members and presided
over by the Governor of Macao or his representative.
</P>
<P>
The Consultative Council's main function is to furnish the
Governor with opinions on the bills to be submitted by the
Governor to the Legislative Council, the laws promulgated by the
Legislative Council and the guiding principles on economic and
administrative matters of the Macao region so that the Governor
will come to a better decision or policy.
</P>
<P>
Such opinions have no binding force on the Governor. To some
extent, the Executive Council as provided for by the Basic law is
similar to the system of the existing Consultative Council in
Macao.
</P>
<P>
However, the Chief Executive of the MSAR shall have a legal
status totally different from that of the present Governor. And
the Executive Council needs not to be linked or converged with the
original Consultative Council. more

<HEADLINE> Pak Successfully Test-fires Shaheen-I Missile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan successfully
test-fired a Shaheen-I ballistic missile Thursday morning, about
24 hours after its launching of a Ghauri-II missile, a Foreign
Office statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Shaheen ballistic missile was test-fired at 09:50 a.m.
local time (0450 GMT) from a site near Pakistan's southern port
city of Karachi, an official from the Pakistan Atomic Energy
Commission told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Shaheen, with a range of 600 kilometers, employs a solid fuel
motor and can be tipped with any type of warhead, the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
However, sources from the test site said the flight range of
Shaheen-I was 700 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
One source from the Kahuta Research Laboratory, when contacted,
said more data is still awaited.
</P>
<P>
The missile, 13-meter long, weighs around 9 tons and has a
maximum range of 750 kilometers with a payload of 1,000 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
As a response to India's Agni-II missile flight test last
Sunday, the Shaheen missile test-firing is following Pakistan's
Wednesday launching of a Ghauri-II ballistic missile.
</P>
<P>
"These flight tests have strengthened the national security and
will help in maintaining strategic balance in South Asia," said
the statement.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Approves 76 Investment  Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe Investment Centre
(ZIC) has approved 76 projects with a total investment of 193
million U.S. dollars in the first quarter of the year with a
potential of creating 4,300 jobs, the daily Herald reported on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The major project, valued at 128 million U.S. dollars, will see
the expansion of the telecommunications network, which is an
essential infrastructure in investment promotion.
</P>
<P>
The second-largest project involves mineral exploration and the
 development, while some of the projects are in agriculture,
tourism, construction, transport and commercial sectors.
</P>
<P>
In an interview on Wednesday, Executive Director of ZIC
Nicholas Ncube said investment approvals had declined slightly
compared to the same period last year, but improved in value
terms.
</P>
<P>
He said investors with a long-term view have continued to show
interest in the available investment opportunities and are
enjoying the benefits of improved infrastructure, an educated
workforce and a diverse industrial base.
</P>
<P>
The current economic problems were not unique to Zimbabwe alone
and resembled a transitional process common with previously
controlled economies, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added, "We need to mount our own publicity campaign to
dispel the bad image that has been created in the international
press."

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Host World Renewable Energy Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia will host the World
Renewable Energy Congress (WREC) in June this year to promote the
development, adoption and wider utilization of renewable energy
resources globally.
</P>
<P>
Energy, Telecommunications and Multimedia Minister Leo Moggie
told a news conference here Thursday that the WREC to be held
from June 8 to 11 would be the first congress to be held outside
the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD),
and in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The event will be an activity of the Solar World Program (WSP)
1996-2005, an initiative of the World Solar Commission (WSC) aimed
at promoting the development, adoption and wider utilization of
renewable energy resources globally.
</P>
<P>
June 8 this year would be treated as the "Renewable Energy Day"
for Malaysia with a host of related programs including the
official opening of the Malaysia Energy Center and the flag-off of
the central leg of the Malaysia International Solar Cycle
Challenge by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, he said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia is reviewing its energy strategy to add renewable
energy as the fifth fuel. Currently, Malaysia depends on the four
energy resources -- oil, gas, hydro-power and coal.
</P>
<P>
Leo Moggie said the new five-fuel strategy would be
incorporated in the Eighth Malaysia Plan (2001-2005) which would
mark an important step in the development of a sustainable
national energy policy.
</P>
<P>
Solar and hydro energy, wind and biomass are some of the
renewable energy resources which could be harnessed, Leo Moggie
said, adding renewable energy is increasingly more important now
and technology development and research has progressed so much in
the last few years that the viability of some of the renewable
energy resources are beginning to be seen.

<HEADLINE> Zhu: Chinese, U.S. Leaders dedicated to Bilateral Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOSTON, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Premier Zhu
Rongji said here Wednesday that both Chinese and U.S. leaders have
been dedicated to Sino-U.S. friendship despite ups and downs in
the relations between the two countries during the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of three Chinese generations, including Mao Zedong,
Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin, have made unremitting efforts to
maintain and develop Sino-U.S. relations, Zhu said while
delivering a speech at a gathering in the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology (MIT).
</P>
<P>
He said American leaders, both Republican and Democratic, have
followed a common policy of friendly cooperation with China in the
past two decades.
</P>
<P>
President Richard Nixon, a Republican, re-opened the U.S.-China
ties, which was followed by the establishment of diplomatic
relations with China by President Jimmy Carter, a Democratic.
Later on, Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush, of the
Republican Party, further pushed forward bilateral ties, Zhu told
the gathering, which was attended by 1,200 people.
</P>
<P>
In the 1990s, he said, President Jiang Zemin and President Bill
Clinton, of the Democratic Party, have made a successful exchange
of visits and have decided to work toward establishing a
constructive strategic partnership, marking a new phase of
development in Sino-U.S. relations, he said.
</P>
<P>
To develop Sino-U.S. relations is the bipartisan policy of the
United States, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said a constructive strategic partnership between China and
the United States will benefit the peoples of the two countries,
the people of the world, world peace and international cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the so-called "China's threat," Zhu said China
does not constitute any threat to the United States, nor will it
do so in future.
</P>
<P>
"China is not your potential adversary, nor your enemy, but
your friend in whom you can trust," Zhu told the audience.
</P>
<P>
Zhu arrived in the United States on April 6 to pay an eight-day
official visit to the country, the first by a Chinese premier in
15 years.
</P>
<P>
Zhu quoted President Bill Clinton as saying that the United
States has 6,000 pieces of nuclear weapons, while China has only
20 to 30 pieces. "I wonder how President Clinton got the figures,
which even I haven't heard of. But I agree with him that the
United States is far more superior than China in nuclear arms
stocks and that China poses no threat to the United States
militarily," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu, who arrived in Boston, the last stop of his current trip,
from New York Wednesday morning, said that it is important for
China and the United States to build a constructive strategic
partnership, which conforms to the interests of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in the United States, Zhu met with many
American public figures including Congress people, federal and
local government officials as well as heads of news organizations
and executives of financial institutions and enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier said he got an impression from his contacts
with people here from various walks of life that ordinary
Americans are supportive for the development of Sino-U.S.relations,
which laid the foundation for further advancement of friendly
cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Zhu recalled that when he said this to President Clinton on
telephone on Tuesday, the president replied, "I shared the view
with you."
</P>
<P>
Zhu said he is convinced that the American people stand for a
cooperative relations with China and support its efforts to join
the World Trade Organization (WTO).

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Smuggler Executed on the Mainland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The captain of a Taiwan fishing
boat was executed today for attempting to smuggle more than 73
million counterfeit yuan (8.8 million US dollars) into Guangdong.
</P>
<P>
Lin Jingchuan was caught by customs officials in a coastguard
cutter in February 1997 as his boat, with three other crew members,
sailed in Shantou in south China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
His conviction was confirmed today by the Supreme People's
Court after an initial appeal and the sentence carried out soon
after. His fellow smugglers were all given life imprisonment and
had 50,000 yuan of their possessions confiscated by the
Intermediate People's Court of Shantou. Lin also had 100,000 yuan
worth of possessions confiscated.
</P>
<P>
Three other separate smuggling cases saw four more Taiwanese
and four Hong Kong people given prison sentences ranging from four
years to life, in addition to fines.
</P>
<P>
In another customs breakthrough, Li Wei, also Taiwanese, was
caught at a Guangzhou airport in February last year attempting to
smuggle 60,000 fake US dollars into Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
He will serve 14 years in prison and pay a fine of 100,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
And four Hong Kong residents were caught in January last year
at Jinan Airport in east China's Shandong Province when they
failed to declare 128 kilograms of gold hidden in their luggage.
</P>
<P>
The Intermediate People's Court of Jinan meted out a seven year
imprisonment sentence on one, a five year sentence on two and a
four year sentence on the final accused.
</P>
<P>
According to the Supreme People's Court, the nine defendants
appealed to the Higher People's Court in Guangdong and Shandong
respectively after their first trial but all were rejected leaving
the original verdicts standing.

<HEADLINE> Soft Drink Industry Grows Fast in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The soft drink industry has been
growing fast in Bangladesh, the latest issue of the Dhaka-based
weekly Economic Times reported.
</P>
<P>
There was only one multi-national beverage factory in the
country in the early 1970s, and now four large companies are
marketing their products across the country and some small
companies are also active in the market.
</P>
<P>
Beverage factories produced soft drinks worth 401 million taka
(about 8.35 million U.S. dollars) in the 1989-90 fiscal year, on
the basis of fixed price, with an estimated net value addition of
165 million taka (about 3.44 million dollars), according to
figures from the Bangladesh Bureau Statistics.
</P>
<P>
In the year 1995-96, the production in the beverage industry
rose to 1,593 million taka (about 33.19 million dollars),
registering a value addition of 963 million taka (about 20.06
million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The beverage industry recorded a staggering 397 percent
expansion in a span of six years, while the profit from both
production and sales rose to 60.45 percent in 1995-96 from 41.14
percent in 1989-90.
</P>
<P>
The consumption of soft drink also registered a marked increase
over the years, according to the report. The sales of soft drink
jumped from 70 million bottles in 1984-85 to 259 million bottles
in 1996-97.
</P>
<P>
The figures show that in 12 years, while the population
increased by 24 percent, the selling of soft drink increased by
270 percent, and the per head soft drink of 1.4 bottles in 1984-85
grew to 2.7 bottles per head in 1996-97.
</P>
<P>
However, the lion's share of the country's soft drink market is
controlled by foreign brands, with almost 50 percent of the market
dominated by Coca Cola brands, followed by Pepsi Cola, the report
said.

<HEADLINE> Milosevic Willing to Talk With Kosovo Ethnic Albanian Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Gregor Gysi, first German mediator
to Belgrade, briefed the press on his talks with Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic Wednesday, saying Milosevic would
like to negotiate directly with Kosovo ethnic Albanian leaders
under the mediation of U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
Gysi, parliamentary chairman of the Democratic Socialist Party
(DSP) group who returned here after his one-day trip to Yugoslavia,
said Milosevic promised that all Kosovar refugees fleeing NATO
airstrikes could return home in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia sticks to its stance of refusing forces of NATO and
the United Nations to enter Kosovo, except for UN civilian
observers, he added.
</P>
<P>
During his stay there, Gysi visited the Zastava Plane
Manufacture Plant, which was destroyed by NATO missiles.
</P>
<P>
Shocked by damages imposed by NATO's air strikes, he criticized
the German media for keeping quiet on the issue while making a hue
about the sufferings of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that his party will continue opposing NATO's
military actions against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The DSP, the only parliament party with unanimous opposition to
NATO air strikes, has organized several large scale demonstrations
for the purpose.

provide a favorable breeding ground for many cash aquatic products
and form a natural bulwark to filter pollutants which are know to
cause so-called "Red Tides".
</P>
<P>
However, the coverage of natural mangrove trees in the city's
coastal areas have declined in recent years due to the exploration
of resources for economic purposes. Some 30 hectares of remaining
mangrove stands are sparsely scattered along Xiamen's coastline.
</P>
<P>
The mangrove plantation project, initiated by the Xiamen
Forestry Department and Xiamen University, is expected to increase
the coverage by about 107 hectares. Large-scale planting drives
will be initiated through May this year.
</P>
<P>
The project will represent the city's first large-scale effort
to plant mangroves.

<HEADLINE> Tomato Nutrient May Protect Men From Prostate Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 14 (Xinhua) -- American researchers have
found the first direct evidence that the tomato nutrient lycopene
may protect men against prostate cancer by shrinking tumors and
preventing them from spreading.
</P>
<P>
A study, released at a meeting of the American Association for
Cancer Research in Philadelphia, said that researchers from the
Karmanos Cancer Institute in Detroit gave lycopene, the nutrient
that makes tomatoes red, to men who were about to undergo surgery
to remove cancerous glands.
</P>
<P>
According to Tuesday's edition of Washington Post, the study
involved 33 men who were randomly assigned to take lycopene or
nothing for 30 days before their prostate operations.
</P>
<P>
Before surgery the volunteers showed no obvious signs that
their cancer had spread. After surgery, the doctors found cancer
tissue was less likely to extend to the edges of the lycopene
users' prostate glands. And pre-cancerous cells in their prostates
were less abnormal looking.
</P>
<P>
"This suggests that lycopene results in a decrease of the tumor
size and makes the cancer less aggressive," said Omar Kucuk who
directed the study.
</P>
<P>
Lycopene has become a trendy nutritional supplement, and large
population surveys have suggested that those who eat plenty of
tomatoes, the primary natural source of lycopene, are less likely
to get prostate cancer or other malignancies.
</P>
<P>
Findings by researchers from the Karmanos Cancer Institute
confirm and support the above surveys.
</P>
<P>
However the researchers warned that their study is small, and
cautioned against routine use of lycopene supplements without
further evidence.

<HEADLINE> Boat Accidents Frequent in Southern China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua)-- China had 46 accidents involving
the sinking of 11 boats and causing 101 deaths in southern China's
Guangdong, Guangxi and Yunnan provinces during the first ten
months of last year, according to a Guangming Daily report.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said the number of boating accidents is probably
much greater in all of southern China, as the water-rich region is
filled with boats and ships.
</P>
<P>
The article quoted an official from the Guangxi Shipping
Administration as saying that scant attention to navigation
regulations and safety measures, as well as the inadequate
education are among the reasons for all these accidents.
</P>
<P>
The boats of the farmers in the region, mostly made of wood,
are often poorly maintained, said the official, adding that some
boats which should have been scrapped are still being used.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper called for more stringent supervision and
management of water transport, and greater efforts to improve
awareness of safety measures among the farmers who own boats.
</P>
<P>
The report also lauded the city of Guilin in Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region for its building of more bridges to better
contain water traffic.
</P>
<P>
The paper said Guilin raised over 1.8 million yuan to build 76
bridges, substantially reducing the number of boats operating on
its rivers, and dramatically reducing the number of accidents.

<HEADLINE> Milosevic: No NATO Civilian Observers in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 14 (Xinhua) - Yugoslavia will allow no foreign
troops in Kosovo under any circumstances and any future civilian
observers must come from countries not involved in NATO bombing of
Yugoslavia, announced visiting Belarus President Alexander
Lukashenko here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a joint press conference with his Yugoslav counterpart
Slobodan Milosevic, Lukashenko said he had asked Milosevic if any
compromise was possible in Yugoslavia's fight against NATO, which
has bombed the country for three weeks over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"Yugoslavia is ready to accept civilian observers from the
United Nations or representatives of other countries. Civilian
observers, not army or police teams," Lukashenko said.
</P>
<P>
"Those representatives must be from the countries which are not
involved in recent NATO bombing of Yugoslavia. We must have in
mind that this is the final point of view of Yugoslavia, not only
us, but the NATO countries too."
</P>
<P>
For his part, Milosevic said he had discussed the issue of
Yugoslavia's accession to the loose union between Belarus and
Russia.
</P>
<P>
He said he had already submitted an official application to
President Lukashenko and Russian President Boris Yeltsin, adding
that he expected that the two would make an official reply in the
interests of the three peoples.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko said he was pleased to hear from Milosevic that
Yugoslavia does not want to draw Russia and Belarus into the war.
</P>
<P>
"I see that this is not a simple process and that it takes a
lot of time. I said that we'll do everything to do things as fast
as we can. But we must be absolutely clear and do it in the right
way."

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Debt Hits 47.8 Billion US Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' foreign debt rose
by 2.3843 billion U.S. dollars to 47.817 billion U.S. dollars in
end-1998 from 45.433 billion U.S. dollars the previous year, the
Manila Times reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted a recently released report of the
Philippine Central Bank as saying that the increase was due to
more foreign borrowing of the public sector including the national
government and foreign exchange revaluation.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Central Bank, however, said that despite the
rise in the foreign debt, the country's debt service ratio stood
at 11.6 percent, still lower than the 36 percent recorded in the
mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
Public sector debts which comprise 63 percent of total debts
inched up to 30.125 billion U.S. dollars from 28.623 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Obligations of the private sector slightly increased to 17.692
billion U.S. dollars from 16.81 billion U.S. dollars. Due to the
currency crisis, private firms found it hard to obtain loans from
abroad.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the weakening of the U.S. dollar
against the yen last year likewise contributed to the rise in the
country's foreign exchange debts. The country's foreign loans, 25
percent of which are owed from Japanese creditors, are booked in
dollar term, thus, any movement between the greenbacks and the yen
affects its level.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank said from the foreign exchange revaluation
alone, the debt rose by more than 2 billion U.S. dollars. It noted
that the yen appreciated by more than 14 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
By maturity profile, medium- and long-term debts, amounting to
40.644 billion U.S. dollars with an average maturity of 20.6 years
for the public sector debts and 7.2 years for private firms,
comprised 85 percent of the obligations.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the short-term debts comprised only 15
percent at 7.17 billion dollars, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Shaanxi, Focus of Investment in Northwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Shaanxi Province has become a
strong point for attracting domestic and overseas investment in
northwest China due to its unique geographical location and rich
resources.
</P>
<P>
The province plans to invest 60 billion yuan in fix assets this
year, a 13 percent increase over 1998, to further improve
infrastructure facilities and attract investment from domestic and
overseas businesses.
</P>
<P>
Situated at the crossroads of central and western China,
Shaanxi is playing an important role in helping promote economic
development in northwestern China, provincial governor Chen Andong
said recently.
</P>
<P>
Shaanxi has over 100 colleges, universities and research
institutes and 820,000 technical personnel, and produces more than
2,000 scientific research results annually. In 1998, the
provincial domestic product reached nearly 140 billion yuan, up 9.
3 percent over 1997.
</P>
<P>
A group of domestic and overseas firms have shown interest in
investing in the province at a recently concluded trade fair here,
where there were 131 contracts worth 1.075 billion U.S. dollars in
investment signed, and 127 agreements reached on 2.2 billion U.S.
dollars worth of investment.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Zhongyou Jingxi Scientific and Technological
Development Co. Ltd. signed oil-exploration contracts with three
companies in the province worth an aggregate 30 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The firm's general manager Wang Guozhi said that investing in
Shaanxi will lay a solid foundation for his company's future
development as northwest China has great potential for the oil
industry.
</P>
<P>
Among domestic investors, Jiangsu Province in east China has
plans to invest 100 million yuan to build a large commercial store
in Xi'an, capital of Shaanxi.

BUENOS AIRES, April 14 (Xinhua) -- A mummified baby, believed
to be between 1,500 and 2,000 years old, has been found in
Antofagasta de la Sierra of Argentina's Catamarca province.

<HEADLINE> Network Consulting Service Market Expands Worldwide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Of all the fast-growing
markets in information technology (IT) services, the market for
network consulting and integration services is expanding rapidly
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
According to a report released Wednesday by the U.S. research
firm International Data Corporation (IDC), revenues in the
worldwide market for network support and integration services grew
by almost two billion U.S. dollars in 1998 over the previous year
to reach 12.1 billion dollars. By 2003, the market will more than
double to 25.5 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Skilled IT employees are becoming more and more scarce while
network complexities and demands for higher-quality service are
increasing. As a result, said IDC in the report, a typical
organization's internal information service staff does not have
enough time to deal with issues like network redesign, capacity
planning and security policies.
</P>
<P>
Under these circumstances, organizations of all sizes have had
to increase their spending on network consulting and integration
services, in order to address human resource constraints, remain
ahead of the technology curve and align IT investments to core
business processes.
</P>
<P>
Integration services have come into being as technology is
increasingly becoming complex. More and more customers want
complete solutions to information problems, requiring hardware,
software and networking expertise in a multi-vendor environment.
</P>
<P>
Of all network consulting and integration services, the IDC
believes organizations will increase spending more rapidly on
security-related services.
</P>
<P>
Increased media exposure to network hackers, viruses and other
security threats has left organizations desperate to protect their
valuable data. As a result of these trends, the IDC expects end-
user spending worldwide on security consulting and integration
services to reach approximately 977 million dollars by 2003.
</P>
<P>
The United States spent 7.6 billion dollars on network
consulting and integration services in 1998, more than any other
region. Western Europe came next with 2.6 billion dollars. The
Asia-Pacific region cut spending in the same year, but the IDC
expects the region to renew enthusiasm in the long term and
increase its spending at a compound annual growth rate of 20
percent through 2003.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Reacts Cautiously to German Plan on Kosovo Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The Clinton Administration
reacted cautiously to a German peace proposal for Kosovo on
Wednesday, saying Yugoslavia must first meet NATO's demands before
U.S. would consider any bombing pause under the plan.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said the United States was
consulting with Germany about the plan unveiled early Wednesday,
which includes a temporary bombing halt to allow Yugoslavia to
begin withdrawing its troops.
</P>
<P>
He said the German plan was in line with NATO conditions for
ending the offensive against Yugoslavia. But he added, "there will
be no cessation of this air campaign until the demands are met."
</P>
<P>
Lockhart said the United States had talked with Germany about
the plan proposed by German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer. "I
think it's very much in the spirit of what NATO has laid out as
the conditions," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin said the
German plan was more detailed than had been publicly revealed. "We
think it's a constructive thing to do," he said of the German
effort.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Rejects General Dynamics-Newport Merger Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Defense Department on
Wednesday rejected a merger between defense giants General
Dynamics Corp. and Newport News Shipbuilding that would have
created a single ship builder for all nuclear submarines.
</P>
<P>
The proposed two billion U.S.-dollar deal would have also
reduced competition in other sectors of military shipbuilding, and
any cost savings to the Navy would not justify that loss of
competition, Defense Secretary William Cohen said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Because the merger would collapse the two existing companies
into a single entity, there would be a reduction in the likelihood
of future competition," Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
General Dynamics made an unsolicited bid for Newport News in
February. The deal required Pentagon approval and also was subject
to a review by the Justice Department's antitrust division.
</P>
<P>
If successful, General Dynamics would have dominated the
approximately 7-billion-dollar annual market for U.S. Navy ships.
</P>
<P>
Nicholas D. Chabraja, General Dynamics chairman and chief
executive officer, called the Pentagon decision "disappointing"
and said his firm has withdrawn its offer.
</P>
<P>
"General Dynamics believes that its proposed acquisition of
Newport News Shipbuilding would have meant significant savings for
the U.S. Navy, enhanced value for the shareholders of both
companies, and still preserved jobs," Chabraja said.
</P>
<P>
Much of the Pentagon review concerned calculating possible cost
savings, which Cohen called considerable, from having shipbuilding
engineering, research and development talent concentrated in one
place.
</P>
<P>
But Cohen said planned improvements at Newport News can save
nearly as much money as the merger offered, without a loss in
competition.
</P>
<P>
"While there was still an important differential, we felt that
this differential was not now so great as to override the
management and competitive challenges we could face from the
merger," Cohen said.

<HEADLINE> China Steps Up Water, Soil Erosion Control Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- China plans to implement model
water and soil conservation projects nationwide this year to
protect the nation's ecology and promote sustainable development,
China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
The initiative will involve model projects for 10 cities, 100
counties and 1,000 small rivers, according to officials with the
Finance and Water Resources ministries.
</P>
<P>
The goal of the projects is to control ecological deterioration
in selected areas within five years, said Vice-Minister of Water
Resources Zhu Dengquan.
</P>
<P>
The plan calls for reducing soil erosion in small river valleys
by 70 percent within five years, he added.
</P>
<P>
China has recorded monumental achievements in water and soil
conservation over the past 50 years, with related efforts
effectively controlling serious erosion in areas covering over 780,
000 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
China has successfully harnessed 20,000 small rivers, in
addition to tackling soil erosion problems along the nation's
major rivers, including the Yellow and Yangtze rivers, said Zhu.
</P>
<P>
Central government funding for soil erosion control programs
carried out in 1998 was five times greater last year than the
annual amount in recent years, he added.
</P>
<P>
The government plans to increase 1999 funding for soil erosion
control by some 50 million yuan, said Zhang Hongbing, deputy
director of the Agricultural Department under the Ministry of
Finance.
</P>
<P>
Remarkable achievements in water and soil conservancy have not
yet stemmed serious soil erosion and ecological deterioration,
according to Zhu.
</P>
<P>
He noted that last summer's record flooding along the Yangtze,
Nenjiang and Songhua rivers revealed the serious problems China
continues to face.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Central Bank Backs Low Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Central Bank Governor
Gabriel Singson said Wednesday that the aim of the Department of
Finance to bring down interest rates to 10 percent within the
first half of the year is realistic.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Post Thursday quoted Singson as saying that the
monetary authorities are supporting the move authored by Finance
Secretary Edgardo Espiritu since this encourages greater economic
activities.
</P>
<P>
"When Secretary Espiritu said they would bring interest rates
to 11 percent by mid-April of this year, I confirmed that,"
Singson said, stressing same support will be given to the new
target.
</P>
<P>
Singson told the newspaper that the Central Bank remains poised
to initiate measures that would pull down lending rates further,
from the prevailing average of about 15 percent which commercial
banks were charging as of Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We will not tighten our present monetary program because the
need right now is to infuse additional liquidity into the system
to fuel economic growth," he explained.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank has already reduced its key overnight rates by
200 basis points since the start of the year and imposed a 3
percent cut in the liquidity reserves requirement for banks,
thereby providing more-than-sufficient funds to "pump-prime" the
economy.
</P>
<P>
Singson reiterated that the Philippines is heading towards a
strong economic resurgence soon as the peso maintains its
stability vis-a-vis the dollar, a lower inflation, and a decline
in interest rates, among others.

<HEADLINE> Italy Says Raids in Kosovo For "Integrated Defense" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Massimo
D'Alema said that Italian warplanes, which carried out an air
strike Wednesday in Kosovo for the first time since NATO's war
against Belgrade, were engaged exclusively in "integrated defense"
tasks.
</P>
<P>
"Italy has not taken part in attacks on Serbian territory, but
it has always taken part in defense actions," he said.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema said some of the tasks are to defend Italian troops in
Albania and Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
He added that "Italian warplanes are at NATO's disposal to
strike those who shell Albanian territory or those who attack
Macedonian territory, because we obviously have to defend Italian
citizens, both military and civilian, who are operating in those
countries."
</P>
<P>
According to the Italian Defense Ministry, Italian warplanes
bombed military targets over Kosovo Wednesday morning in response
to what the NATO military command felt was "a real threat" to the
allied forces, including the Italian forces present in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
The ministry specified that the targets in Kosovo were adjacent
to border areas, and the missions were carried out in accordance
with the "integrated defense principle," which means to protect
Italian and the allies' air space and forces present in the war
zone.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will launch a war on
rats nationwide to control diseases transmitted by rats, the
Bangkok Post reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
About 300,000 villagers will be hired to help exterminate 20
million rats.
</P>
<P>
The villagers will have to produce dead rats at local health
offices, where tests will be carried out into vermin-related
diseases.
</P>
<P>
The Public Health Ministry is running the project in 28
provinces under the 53-billion-baht (1.4-billion-dollar) job
creation scheme, from which it will draw 24.9 million baht
(673,000 dollars) to pay the rat-catchers.
</P>
<P>
In addition to providing jobless villagers with an income, the
project will improve conditions in communities and help prevent
serious diseases such as leptospirosis, Sutcharit Sripraphan,
acting permanent secretary for health, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He added that the work will start later this month, prior to
the monsoon breeding season, and will end in September.
</P>
<P>
Leptospirosis, which causes high fever, severe headache,
giddiness or even death, often occurs during the rainy season. It
is transmitted by rat urine and people often contract the disease
when exposed to water accumulated on roads.

BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- China has increased resource
utilization but saved more resources last year, according to the
Economic and Trade Commission.
</P>
<P>
At a national meeting on resource conservation recently, it
said that the amount of energy consumed to produce every 10,000
yuan of GDP decreased from 3.55 tons of standard coal in 1996 to 3.
38 tons last year.
</P>
<P>
In addition, 70 million tons of standard coal, 1.1 million tons
of steel, and 17.37 million cubic meters of timber were saved in
1997.
</P>
<P>
About 316 million tons of industrial solid waste, or 45 percent
of the total, were recycled; waste materials worth 36 billion yuan
(about 4.3 billion US dollars) were recycled in China last year.
</P>
<P>
China earmarked 2.37 billion yuan to support some resource
saving projects as national examples early last year, including a
"green light program" to help reduce electricity consumption.
</P>
<P>
Some experts say that poor management is the major reason for
wasted resources in many enterprises but that some good energy
saving ideas have been introduced to the metallurgical, railway,

<HEADLINE> China Issues Standards on National Flag Making </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The State Quality and Technical
Supervision Administration issued new standards on national flag
quality to prepare for the celebration of the 50th founding
anniversary of the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
Today's China Daily reported that the regulations, issued
recently, are the first step taken by the country to forbid
national flag manufacturers from using fabrics made from man-made
fibers.
</P>
<P>
The central and local governments have designated more than 110
manufacturers across the country in accordance with the law to
guarantee high quality flags.
</P>
<P>
China has announced that it would hold a grand military parade
on the National Day, falling on October 1, at the Tian'anmen
Square. Together with other celebrations nationwide, national
flags are badly needed in the market.
</P>
<P>
In the revised quality standards, seams on the flags are no
longer allowed. This requirement applied only to flags measuring
less than two meters in length and width.
</P>
<P>
Li Rucheng, an official with the standardization department,
said: "As symbols of the country, national flags should be
produced using materials like silk and cotton to ensure high
quality."
</P>
<P>
Fabrics of man-made fiber wear out easily and are not suitable
for making national flags, which are mostly hung outdoors, Li
added.
</P>
<P>
He believed that it is within the manufacturers' technical
capability to produce seamless flags. It only takes a slightly
more complicated process along with some more material.
</P>
<P>
Li's administration issued quality standards to regulate the
production of national flags in 1991, one year after the country's
adoption of the Law on National Flag.

NAIROBI, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Hosts Nigeria grabbed the World
Youth Cup quarter-final berth by beating Ireland on penalties in
searing temperatures on Wednesday while Uruguay went through in
the same style with penalty shoot-outs.
</P>
<P>
They were joined by Brazil, who crushed Croatia 4-0, and Ghana,
2-0 winners over Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
Ireland stunned the crowd by taking a first half lead through
Richie Sadlier, but Pius Ikedia equalised in the second half.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria won 5-3 on penalties after Ireland's Thom Heary had his
kick saved by Sam Okoye.
</P>
<P>
In another match, Owusu Afriyie set Ghana on their way with a
long-range shot in the 18th minute. Peter Ofori-Quaye added the
second 11 minutes from time.
</P>
<P>
In the evening games, Brazil scored four more in Calabar, two
coming from Gremio striker Ronaldo and one each from Edu and
Fernando Baiano.
</P>
<P>
They now move to Lagos for Sunday's quarter-final against
Uruguay whose clash with Paraguay was the most dramatic of the day.
</P>
<P>
Paraguay came from two goals behind to draw 2-2 during 90
minutes, only to lose 10-9 in a marathon penalty shootout. Striker
Roque Santa Cruz, who scored both Paraguay goals, missed the
crucial spot kick.
</P>
<P>
Ernesto Chevanton gave Uruguay, runners-up in Malaysia two
years ago, a halftime lead. Diego Forlan increased the advantage
in the 50th minute before Santa Cruz led Paraguay's fightback.
</P>
<P>
Uruguay had captain Omar Pouso and right-back Damian Macaluso
sent off for two bookable offences while Paraguay's Elvis Marecos
was also shown the red card for a crude challenge before halftime.
</P>
<P>
The remaining second round games will be played Thursday:
Argentina vs Mexico (Ibadan), Japan vs Portugal (Bauchi), Mali vs
Cameroon (Enugu) and Spain vs United States (Port Harcourt).

<HEADLINE> Senior Citizen Services Gain Increasing Popularity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The service industry, introduced in March last year, offers
senior citizens a wide variety of activities for an hourly fee of
2.5 yuan (30 US cents).
</P>
<P>
Good living conditions quite often fail to relieve the
loneliness of many senior citizens. "I feel better after
discussing my frustrations." according to one senior citizen named
Yang.
</P>
<P>
Yang, a 70-year-old retiree, has experienced depressing
loneliness due to the fact that his wife passed away and his only
son is busy with his own affairs.
</P>
<P>
Chen Lihui, founder of the service, said that the senior
citizens enjoy simply things such as phone calls.
</P>
<P>
"Our service is quite different from a nursing home which
focuses mainly on spiritual comfort. Most of our staffers are
young people with high-level education and are thus able to
discuss wide-ranging topics." said Chen.
</P>
<P>
Over 400 senior citizens have applied for the service and the
number continues to rise.
</P>
<P>
"Good living conditions do not necessarily bring senior
citizens happiness. Psychological health is also extremely
important," said Chen.
</P>
<P>
Senior citizens accounted for 10 percent of the city's total
population in 1997. Harbin's civil affairs departments have
responded by establishing entertainment centers and various
recreational venues for over 900,000 senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
The service satisfies the needs of senior citizens to
communicate with the younger generation.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Reserves Hit Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The gross international reserves
(GIR) of the Philippine Central Bank hit a new high of 13.196
billion U.S. dollars as of April, up from 12.9 billion U.S.
dollars at the end of March, the Business World reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted the Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson
as saying late Wednesday that the Central Bank boosted its
reserves by buying dollars "from various sources."
</P>
<P>
The GIR is the central bank's holdings of gold, foreign
exchange, and special drawing rights used to pay the country's
debts and imports.
</P>
<P>
Singson told the newspaper that the Central Bank bought dollars
discreetly so as not to influence the peso-dollar rate. "Every
time there is a buying opportunity, we buy to improve or increase
our reserves, but we buy dollar when it will not heavily influence
the market," Singson said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Central Bank bought "over 1.5 billion" since
the start of the year, but did not provide an exact figure.
</P>
<P>
The country's GIR is now equivalent to 5.4 months' worth of
imports. "These are the highest reserves ever in the history of
the country," Singson said.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Central Bank has been steadily building up its
reserves after these were depleted when it defended the peso
against speculators at the height of the Asian currency crisis.

<HEADLINE> Insurance System Helps Underemployed People in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The unemployment insurance system
is playing a positive role in keeping social stability in China,
with more than three million people benefiting from the system
each year.
</P>
<P>
Established in 1986, the system includes a subsidy fund for the
underemployment in accordance with law, and provides financial aid
and reemployment service to those who lose their jobs through no
fault of their own, according to the Ministry of Labor and Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, 79.32 million people, or 45 percent of
the total number of urban employees had been subscribed to the
insurance system, and 12.74 million of them had benefited from the
underemployment subsidies.
</P>
<P>
Since the establishment of the insurance system, labor and
social security departments have been actively involved in setting
up this social insurance fund, and have helped half of all
underemployed people find jobs with financial supports from the
fund.
</P>
<P>
In June 1998, the central government issued a circular raising
the contribution to the unemployment fund from one percent of the
enterprise total payroll to three percent. According to the
circular, enterprises are no longer solely responsible for paying
the fees, but individuals must now contribute one percent.
</P>
<P>
This January, the State Council issued its Regulations on
Unemployment Insurance to initiate several major reforms in the
unemployment insurance fund system, including the method of fund
collection, which will further perfect the system.

ST. JOHN'S, Canada, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu
Rongji, wrapping up his tour to the United States, arrived in St.
John's on Wednesday to start his seven-day official visit to
Canada to enhance friendship and promote cooperation between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
St. John's, capital of Newfoundland province and one of the
oldest cities in North America, gave the Chinese Premier a red-
carpet welcome when he, walking down from his special plane, set
foot on the beautiful Maple Leaf land.
</P>
<P>
Newfoundland's Premier Brian Tobin and Canadian Minister of
Veterans Affair Fred Mifflin were among Canadian officials

</P>
<P>
In a written statement delivered at the airport, Premier Zhu
said he was glad to pay the official visit to Canada at the
invitation of Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the fact that China and Canada are tens of thousands
of miles apart, there exists a long history of exchanges and
traditional friendship between our two peoples," Premier Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
"Thanks to the joint effort of the two sides, in recent years,
China and Canada have registered significant development with
remarkable achievements in the exchanges and cooperation in

"To maintain and develop such a sound relationship of
cooperation conforms to the fundamental interests and common
aspirations of our two countries and two peoples, it also serves
peace and prosperity of the Asian-Pacific and the world at large,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Premier Zhu said the Chinese government has all along "attached
importance to developing the friendly relations and cooperation of
equality and mutual benefit with Canada."

around cooperation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Premier Zhu said he was looking forward to an in-depth exchange
of views with Prime Minister Chretien and other Canadian

looking forward to meeting with more Canadian friends from all
walks of life to exchange views and learn from each other.
</P>

"I am convinced that with concerted efforts of the two sides,
this visit will be crowned with success," he concluded.

<HEADLINE> Owen Out for Three Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Liverpool and England striker
Michael Owen will miss the next three months with a hamstring and
tendon injury.
</P>
<P>
According to the BBC on Wednesday, the striker has discovered
the shattering results of the scan on his right leg which reveals
far worse damage than was first feared.
</P>
<P>
Owen will miss England's next three matches - the friendly
against Hungary in Budapest on April 28 and the European
Championship qualifiers against Sweden and Bulgaria on June 5 and
9.
</P>
<P>
Liverpool only discovered the real extent of Owen's injury when
they received hospital reports on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Club manager Gerard Houllier said: "The scan has revealed
damage to the hamstring and the tendon. It will take six weeks to
recover from. And then it will take another six weeks after that
to build up the strength in the leg again."
</P>
<P>
Houllier had already decided that Owen would be given a long
rest to recover from the stresses of almost three seasons non-stop
playing before he knew the full extent of the injury.
</P>
<P>
But now the Anfield chief has no option but to write Owen out
of his plans until next season.
</P>
<P>
Owen limped out of Monday's Premiership match at Leeds with a
recurrence of the hamstring injury that has hit him twice before
this season.
</P>
<P>
Now not only will he miss Liverpool's final seven games of the
season, but England's game in Hungary and the two Euro 2000
qualifiers.
</P>
<P>
It is a bitter for England boss Kevin Keegan, who lost Owen
from the Wembley qualifier against Poland last month following an
identical injury picked in the 3-2 defeat at Derby on March 13.

<HEADLINE> Keegan Confirms Commitment to Fulham </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 14 (Xinhua) -- England manager Kevin Keegan has
confirmed that he remains committed to the development of newly
promoted Fulham.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday night, Keegan saw his Fulham side earn the right to
play in Nationwide League Division One thanks to a 3-0 win over
Gillingham.
</P>
<P>
Some critics believed that promotion for the club would allow
him to take on the role of England boss on a full-time basis, but
Keegan denied that emphatically.
</P>
<P>
"There's no pressure on me from anyone at the Football
Association to do anything," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It's as we were - three games to go with England and six games
with Fulham and then we'll look at it.
</P>
<P>
"The FA understand my situation here, you saw tonight why I
want to keep part of this. It just makes me more determined to
make a success of both jobs this season," he added.
</P>
<P>
Keegan also outlined some of his plans for the future.
</P>
<P>
"I told the players that money alone wouldn't get us up, we
needed talent and spirit as well.
</P>
<P>
"These players have played against Aston Villa, Southampton
four times, Liverpool and Manchester United in the cups this
season and in all of those games, they've given a good account of
themselves.
</P>
<P>
"So we're not a million miles away but if the right player
comes up at the right price then of course we'd be interested," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Footballers 'Disabled by Injuries' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Former footballers are much more
likely to suffer from the painful disabling condition
osteoarthritis than the general public, according to the BBC
reports here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The research said that as many as 15% are registered disabled.
</P>
<P>
Some also complain of dizziness and migraines which may be
linked to constant heading of the ball.
</P>
<P>
The research by the University of Coventry's Psychosocial
Rheumatology found that 49% of current and former footballers have
osteoathritis.
</P>
<P>
The average age of onset was 40. In the general population,
less than 10% of men aged 35 to 44 develop the disease.
</P>
<P>
Its major symptoms are pain, stiffness, crackling and
enlargement and deformities of the afflicted joint or joints.
</P>
<P>
Andy Turner, who led the research, said 284 footballers
returned questionnaires about their health.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-nine per cent of former players said they had received at
least one steroid injection during their career.
</P>
<P>
Most said they had been forced to play when they had not had
enough time to recover from an injury.
</P>
<P>
Some former players said they would not have done things any
differently if they had known when they were playing that they
would develop injuries.
</P>
<P>
One said: "The state of my knees is definitely the result of my
football career, particularly the fact that I was a defender, but,
in no way, had I known then what the result of playing would be,
would I have changed anything.
</P>
<P>
"I loved my football. I am hoping that my forthcoming knee
replacements will further extend my physical capabilities."
</P>
<P>
Sixty-eight per cent of former players with osteoarthritis said
they had problems walking and 61% had difficulty performing tasks
such as washing, dressing and housework.
</P>
<P>
Eighty-nine per cent said they were in moderate to extreme pain
and sixteen per cent said their injuries had affected their work
prospects, leading to early retirement or working fewer hours.
</P>
<P>
Several ex-players said they now suffered from constant
migraines, feelings of dizziness or memory problems.
</P>
<P>
Some said they felt this was the result of constantly heading a
football during their career.
</P>
<P>
Mr Turner said: "It is easy to diminish the problems reported
by the respondents as a price worth paying for the glamour, fame
and riches, but only about 800 of the UK's 2,600 professional
players earn their living in the Premiership.
</P>
<P>
"In the lower divisions, many players earn little more than the
spectators."
</P>
<P>
He added that increasing demands on footballers in terms of
greater competition and pressure for a quick return after injury
could mean disability and pain were likely to remain a major
feature of life after football.
</P>
<P>
The Football Association (FA) is conducting research into long-
term injuries.
</P>
<P>
Its medical committee is looking into head injuries as part of
a 10-year study.
</P>
<P>
And a two-year research project which consists of an audit of
all injuries suffered by professional players is due to finish at
the end of this season.
</P>
<P>
The results will be published once they have been collated.
</P>
<P>
They will form the basis of recommendations to all involved in
football.
</P>
<P>
Richard Hawkins, a sports scientist at the FA, said there was
no conclusive proof that heading the ball led to memory or
migraine problems.
</P>
<P>
But it was difficult to prove injuries were related directly to
football unless accurate medical records were kept.
</P>
<P>
"If we track them throughout their professional career and they
develop problems these can be related back to the injuries they
sustained on the pitch," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that treatments used to kill pain were no longer as
disabling as those used 20 years ago, such as cortisone.
</P>
<P>
And players were less likely to be forced to play on with an
injury.
</P>
<P>
This was because coaches were now more aware of the long-term
effects.
</P>
<P>
Their training courses now include issues such as nutrition and
health.
</P>
<P>
However, he admitted some players and coaches might feel under
pressure to return to football before their injury had properly
healed.

<HEADLINE> Man United Keeps Treble Dream Alive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 14 (Xinhua) -- One goal from substitute Ryan
Giggs kept Manchester United's treble dream alive when the team
defeated holders Arsenal 2-1 after extra time at Villa Park on
Wednesday to reach the English F.A. Cup final.
</P>
<P>
In a match of unrelenting drama and incident, United, reduced
to 10 men after skipper Roy Keane was sent off in the 74th minute,
won with a brilliant individual goal from Giggs.
</P>
<P>
Giggs ran 60 meters from inside his own half and rode four
tackles before smashing the ball into the roof of David Seaman's
net.
</P>
<P>
United now play Newcastle United in the Cup Final on May 22 and
keep alive their dream of winning a league and cup double as well
as the European Cup -- a feat never performed by an English club.
</P>
<P>
Arsenal, whose hopes of a second successive cup and league
double died with this defeat, had a golden chance to wrap up the
match up on the stroke of full time but Peter Schmeichel
brilliantly saved Dennis Bergkamp's penalty and sent the match
into extra time.
</P>
<P>
United took the lead after 17 minutes with a superb curling
shot from David Beckham -- the first goal Arsenal had conceeed for
660 minutes since Dieter Hamann of Newcastle scored against them
on February 28.
</P>
<P>
His shot followed a quick inter-passing move with Teddy
Sheringham whose clever reverse flick left Tony Adams stranded and
Beckham in space. His 30-meter shot was always curling away from
his England international colleague Seaman who never came close to
saving the shot.
</P>
<P>
Arsenal equalised in the 69th minute thanks to a lucky
deflection off defender Jaap Stam. Bergkamp's shot was going wide
but hit the knee of his fellow Dutchman and flew past Schmeichel
to level the scores.
</P>
<P>
Arsenal thought they had gone ahead four minutes later when
Schmeichel failed to hold a Bergkamp shot and spilled the ball
into the path of Anelka who led his team mates in wild
celebrations after putting it into the net.
</P>
<P>
But the linesman had already flagged for offside against Anelka
in the build-up to the goal and after a lengthy discussion between
the officials, referee David Elleray disallowed it.
</P>
<P>
United manager Alex Ferguson dropped his 47-goal strike force
of Andy Cole and Dwight Yorke, as well as Giggs from the starting
line-up, but it was Giggs, who came on for Jesper Blomqvist after
an hour, who had the final say.

<HEADLINE> Internet Appliance Market to Grow in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The development and adoption
of Internet appliances will explode in the United States during
the next 12 months, according to a report released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
By leveraging the capabilities of the Internet, the report
said, Internet appliances stand ready to revolutionize the way
that information is used and accessed by enabling universal access
-- the ability to access any information, over any network and
from any device.
</P>
<P>
And instead of developing proprietary systems to support the
underlying platform capability necessary to support Internet
appliances, service companies will turn to third-party
infrastructure software and services companies that have begun to
address the unique challenges of the Internet appliance market,
said the report from San Francisco-based Internet Research Group
of the investment bank Hambrecht &AMP; Quist.
</P>
<P>
The group defines Internet appliance as any non-PC device that
leverages the capabilities of the Internet to extend content,
services and applications to the users of those devices. These may
include Internet television, network computer, specialized
hand-held devices with wireless connection to the Internet, and
personal digital assistant (PDA) -- a hand-held computer that
serves as an organizer for personal information.
</P>
<P>
A recent sign of market activity concerning Internet appliances
was announced last week with the agreement between Yahoo and
Online Anywhere. The latter is a provider of products and services
that deliver Web content to television, pagers, cell phones, PDAs
and other non-PC devices. Companies such as America Online,
Microsoft and Excite have also announced initiatives to make
personalized content and services universally accessible to users
regardless of the appliance or type of network they are using to
access the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The research group expects traditional access providers, such
as telephone companies, Internet service providers, cable
operators and wireless carriers, to drive the mainstream
acceptance and uptake of Internet appliances. "The winners will be
the service providers that marry the benefits of the Internet with
the specific functions the appliance performs," the group said.
</P>
<P>
Highlighting some of the conclusions, the report said that
contrary to popular belief, Internet appliances will not replace
PCs, but in many cases will provide different services than PCs.
Certain devices, it added, will capture imagination and
enthusiasm, which will add to the viral effect of device adoption.
The power of using the Internet as a vehicle for building
community around a device and its use should not be
underestimated.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Passes Republican-Written Budget for 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The Republican-controlled
House of Representatives approved Wednesday a final 1.74 trillion
U.S. dollar budget for fiscal 2000 proposed by the Republicans,
paving the way for the year-long dispute between the Republicans
and Democratic President Bill Clinton over tax cuts and spending.
</P>
<P>
The near party-line vote was 220-208. Senate approval was
expected by Thursday, which Republicans hoped would help them
spotlight their tax-cut drive even as Americans contend with the
April 15 deadline for filing income taxes.
</P>
<P>
The plan signals the issues the Republicans wants to highlight
in this year's run-up to the 2000 elections: a 10-year tax cut
totaling at least 778 billion dollars, using Social Security's
enormous surpluses to reduce the national debt, and extra money
for defense and schools.
</P>
<P>
Democrats said the measure used for tax cuts expected federal
surpluses that should instead be saved to prepare Medicare for the
baby boomers' retirements and to beef up other social programs.
</P>
<P>
The measure, which does not require the president's signature,
sets overall totals for detailed tax and spending bills that
lawmakers will produce later this year.
</P>
<P>
A prolonged duel with Clinton over those bills seems all but
certain. For one, Clinton wants far smaller tax cuts. In addition,
Republicans say they will pay for their defense and domestic
spending increases by cutting other programs, which Democrats and
even some Republicans say is unrealistic.
</P>
<P>
This year's measure was a compromise between similar House and
Senate budgets approved last month. It envisions a surplus of 141
billion dollars next year.
</P>
<P>
The Republican plan calls for using all 1.8 trillion dollars in
expected Social Security surpluses over the next decade to reduce
the national debt -- or to revamp Social Security or Medicare
should a bipartisan compromise emerge on either.
</P>
<P>
Clinton would spend a small portion of those surpluses for
domestic programs. Neither side has proposed changes in benefits
or taxes for Social Security and Medicare that many experts say
will be needed to buttress both programs for the long run.
</P>
<P>
Most economists agree that reducing the national debt would
strengthen the economy by keeping interest rates lower. A larger
economy should make it easier for the government to raise money to
pay benefits to future retirees, they say.
</P>
<P>
By setting aside the Social Security surpluses, Republicans
also hope to prevent Democrats from accusing them of diverting the
money to tax cuts for the wealthy.
</P>
<P>
Republicans say their tax cut might grow if new projections
expected this summer show larger surpluses than now expected. It
will start relatively small, about 15 billion dollars next year if
Republicans can find spending cuts or new revenue to pay for it.
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers will decide later this year how much to spend on
specific programs. But the Republicans' budget proposes spending
289 billion dollars on defense, 9 billion dollars more than this
year and 8 billion dollars more than Clinton proposed.
</P>
<P>
The plan also calls for 66 billion dollars for education and
job training. That is about 1 billion dollars less than Clinton
proposed, but Republicans would outspend Clinton on elementary and
secondary schools and would emphasize diminished strings on
federal education aid.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Bourse Still Near Record Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wednesday's KSE index was the second lowest in 34 months. On March
21 the bourse hit 1,489.3 points.
</P>
<P>
Regarding other indicators, trading on the KSE also picked up
this week. The average \u}W|9&AMP;=%jtF;o0zb[? .zmillion Kuwaiti
dinars (15.11 million U.S. dollars), compared with 3.38 million
dinars (12.8 million dollars) last week.
</P>
<P>
During the past five days, a total of 131.81 million shares were
traded in 3,609 deals, as against 72.89 shares in 1,752 deals in the
four trading days last week.
</P>
<P>
KSE, once one of the most lively stock markets in the Arab world,
has been witnessing a slipping trend since the end of 1997, when its
index ended at 2,651.8 points.
</P>
<P>
The KSE index plunged by more than 1,000 points in 1998 to end
at only 1,582.7 points.
</P>
<P>
Investors and brokers here have attributed the continuing drop
to a lack of confidence in the proposed government economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
Facing the sagging oil prices which greatly trimmed the revenues
of a state mainly counting on oil exports, the Kuwaiti government
has been promoting its reform package based price-hikes.
</P>
<P>
But in a country like Kuwait which imposes a cradle-to-grave
welfare policy, it has proved to be a tough job for the government
to ask the people to tighten their belts and live a hard life.

NEW YORK, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The Dow Jones industrial average
reached its new height Wednesday as investors returned to
manufacturing stocks in belief that the world economy is
recovering.
</P>

</P>
<P>
the Intel warning about its second quarter earnings turned the
Nasdaq index into the negative territory from the positive one.
The index rose more than 40 points in earlier trading in reaction
to Intel's first quarter earnings report.

Bill Clinton and Al Gore, and America needs a fresh start."
</P>
<P>
Quayle promoted his proposed 30 percent across-the-board tax
cut, billing it as a boon to middle-income families.
</P>
<P>
And he portrayed himself as the best qualified potential
commander-in-chief, recalling his participation in White House war
councils and his service on foreign policy committees in the House
and Senate.
</P>
<P>
He accused Clinton and Gore of compromising U.S. sovereignty,
starving the armed forces' budgets and using the military "as a
laboratory for their social experiments."
</P>
<P>
His aides would not say whether Quayle was targeting Bush or
Gore when he declared: "A presidential nomination is not something
that is inherited. It must be earned."
</P>
<P>
Quayle, 52, is a longshot for the nomination despite his
popularity among grassroots activists.
</P>
<P>
He joins a crowded field of social conservative candidates
wrestling over the same votes. His campaign team has come together
slowly. And he raised about 2 million dollars in the first quarter
of 1999 -- 1 million dollars less than projected.
</P>
<P>
His supporters argue that Quayle will easily exceed those low
expectations to sneak up on Bush, who they say can't live up to
his early billing. If the former vice president can emerge from
Iowa and New Hampshire as the choice of social conservatives, his
miscues would fade from memory in the showdown against Bush,
supporters say.

<HEADLINE> NATO Bombing on Yugoslavia Enters 22nd Night </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Air raid sirens went off at
20:40 local time Wednesday over Belgrade, heralding the 22nd night
of NATO's bombing campaign against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The capital has been quiet during the day except for a strong
explosion at around 10:00 in the morning, followed by air-raid
sirens shortly after.
</P>
<P>
The sound, it turned out, was possibly the result of sonic boom
from a NATO plane flying over, and the all-clear was sounded about
two and a half hours later.
</P>
<P>
More civilian casualties were reported Wednesday as a result of
NATO air raids.
</P>
<P>
In the most deadliest instance since NATO started its bombings
on March 24, 64 people, including women and children, were
reportedly killed in four waves of NATO air attacks on a convoy of
vehicles with ethnic Albanian refugees returning from the Albanian
border.
</P>
<P>
The convoy, escorted by Yugoslav police, was attacked in broad
daylight at around 13:00 to 15:00 along the Djakovica-Prizren
road, the Tanjug news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"Today's massacre of ethnic Albanian refugees... has
demonstrated NATO's most brutal aspect," Tanjug quoted Serbian
President Milutinovic as saying in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Striking four times on refugee convoys cannot be described as
a mistake," the statement said. "It was done on purpose."
</P>
<P>
At around 20:35 Wednesday, NATO launched another wave of
bombing on targets around Pristina, capital of Kosovo province.
</P>
<P>
Three missiles hit the city's environs, Tanjug reported, adding
that an air-raid alert had been on in Pristina since Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people gathered on many bridges in Belgrade, Novi
Sad, Sremska Mitrovica, and Zrenjanin as "human shields" against
NATO air raids.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the Yugoslav Navy issued an order
Wednesday banning civil navigation in its territorial waters in
the Adriatic Sea and in the inland waterways in Lake Skadar and
the River Bojana.
</P>
<P>
The measure, effective immediately and in force until 05:00
Friday, was necessitated by the complexity of the operations
situation in the Adriatic Sea and intensification of NATO's
threats to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Tanjug reported.
