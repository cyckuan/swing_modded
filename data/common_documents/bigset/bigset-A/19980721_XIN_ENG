<HEADLINE> AMD, Motorola to Cooperate in Technology Exchange </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Advanced Micro Devices and
Motorola Inc., two major chip makers in the U.S., are expected to
unveil a strategic technology sharing alliance Monday, with AMD
expected to use Motorola's copper process technology to make
faster chips, industry sources said.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the alliance will affect the embedded and desktop
microprocessor markets.
</P>
<P>
Industry sources said AMD and Motorola are engaged in a
technology exchange pact that will include Motorola sharing its
copper process so AMD can develop faster microprocessors, using
copper, which has less resistance than aluminum, in the
manufacturing process.
</P>
<P>
Motorola, in return, will gain access to AMD's flash memory
products, to incorporate flash memory in its embedded processors,
for faster embedded chips. Embedded processors are designed for
specific functions, such as printing, and it is one area where
Motorola's PowerPC chip has made big inroads.
</P>
<P>
Semiconductor experts regard copper technology as a future way
to design faster chips.
</P>
<P>
Since International Business Machines Corp. announced it
created faster, lower-cost semiconductors using copper, other
companies, including Motorola, have also announced copper
technology processes.
</P>
<P>
Advanced Micro Devices needs to find ways to make its
microprocessors even more competitive with Intel, which is
spending about 4.5 billion U.S. dollars on capital expenditures
this year, which includes its manufacturing facilities.
</P>
<P>
Analysts speculated Motorola will use AMD's flash memory and
other AMD technologies such as embedded networking to build
system-on-a-chip processors, with more functions on one chip, for
low-cost, small, hand-held computing devices.

<HEADLINE> UK Plans to Charge Car Parking to Cut Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 20 (Reuters) - British Deputy Prime Minister John
Prescott Monday unveiled a white paper for transforming the
nation's transport system, with plans for charges on car users to
finance the improvements.
</P>
<P>
Prescott told parliament he would grant new powers to local
councils to charge car drivers for using congested roads and for
work-place parking. The cash raised will be ring-fenced for
spending on the public transport system.
</P>
<P>
In what he described as "a new deal for motorists" to cut
traffic congestion and pollution, the government will give new
powers to the Highways Agency to pilot road charging schemes and
use the income to reinvest in the road network.
</P>
<P>
He also spelt out a range of measures to encourage freight on
to railways, including proposals to use the proceeds from the
planned part-sale of the National Air Traffic Control Service to
reinvest in other transport projects.
</P>
<P>
These include proposals for Euro-gauge freight rail system
running from the Anglo-French Channel Tunnel through to Scotland,
if terms can be agreed, Prescott said.

<P>
SANAA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh
claimed Monday that three Yemeni were killed and nine wounded in a
military attack launched by Saudi Arabia navy Sunday on a Yemeni
island in the Red Sea.
</P>
<P>
Nine Saudi naval vessels took part in the aggression with
long-range artillery that resulted in the death of three Yemeni
and wounding of nine, the president told a news conference in
Sanaa.
</P>
<P>
Saleh accused Saudi Arabia of trying to change demarcation
lines by force to grab territory from Yemen. The territory dispute
between the two countries dates back 60 years.
</P>
<P>
The attack stopped later Sunday after Yemen contacted the Saudi
government, said the president.
</P>
<P>
Saleh said Yemen's Foreign Minister, Abdul-Qader Bagammal,
would fly to Saudi Arabia to discuss the issue.

CHANGCHUN, July 20 (Xinhua) -- A group of people recently began
a journey along the Songhua River, China's third biggest river,
thanks to a company in Harbin, the capital of Heilongjiang
Province.
</P>
<P>
The river runs for 1,745 kilometers from the Changbai mountains
in Jilin Province into the Heilongjiang River. Chinese began to
live in the Songhua river valley as early as 3,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The group will study the River's water quality and the ecology
along it, explains Qiu Shiyu, chairman of the board of a jade
company that is sponsoring the activity and a participant.
</P>
<P>
The group is made up of entrepreneurs, an artist and a
technician. They began their trip from Tianchi Lake in the
Changbai mountains and went to Tongjiangkou on the Russian border,
where the Songhua river meets the Heilongjiang river.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> UNHCR, WFP Condemn Murder of Aid Workers in Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Heads of the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the World Food Program (WFP)
have condemned the killing in Afghanistan of two Afghan aid
workers.
</P>
<P>
"This tragic incident once again demonstrates the extreme risk
faced by locally recruited staff of humanitarian agencies in
certain parts of the world," said Mrs Sadako Ogata in a statement
issued here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"On behalf of UNHCR, I express our outrage at these killings
and our most sincere condolences to the families of the two men,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
In Rome, WFP Executive Director Catherine Bertini said, "All of
us at WFP are united in condemning this evil act. These brutal
killings are a cruel reminder that despite appeals for greater
respect for humanitarian workers, some people or groups continue
to kill with impunity."
</P>
<P>
The victims, Mohammed Nazir Habibi, 49, and Mohammad Hashim
Bahsaryar, 55, worked in Jalalabad with UNHCR and WFP. They were
kidnapped on July 13 in front of Jalalabad University while
waiting for a U.N. vehicle to transport them to work. Both had
previously been professors at the university.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR and WFP immediately contacted the local Taliban governor
in an effort to locate the two men. Bahsaryar's body was found on
July 18 on the outskirts of Jalalabad and Habibi's body was found
on July 19 near Torkham, not far from the border with Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Habibi was a key member of the team working on UNHCR's program
for the reintegration of returnees in the Jalalabad area, where
most of the 70,000 refugees who returned from Pakistan in 1998
have settled. Bahsaryar was WFP's administrative clerk in the
Jalalabad office.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Electricity Employees Stage Strike For </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Lebanese employees in
the state-run electricity company staged a 24-hour strike on
Monday in protest against the company administration's failure to
meet their demands on benefits and working conditions.
</P>
<P>
"Electricity will be supplied as normal but in the event of a
network failure, we will not carry out repairs until the strike is
over," Abdel-Ghani Abla, the head of Electricite du Liban(EDL)'s
union, told the Voice of the People radio.
</P>
<P>
The union leader also threatened an open-ended strike if the
government and EDL's board failed to act before the union's
deadline, now set for the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
"We sent memorandums to administration officials a month and a
half ago explaining our case but we never received a response," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The union will meet on Wednesday with Electricity and Water
Resources Minister Elie Hobeika to brief him on their demands
prior to a cabinet session scheduled for later in the day, in
which he is expected to raise the issue.
</P>
<P>
The workers are asking for a 30 percent increase in financial
aid for their children's school fees, a demand that has been
rejected by the finance ministry.
</P>
<P>
They are also calling for a new ranks and salaries scale, based
on a study of the issue drafted by the union.
</P>
<P>
The union wants to increase the minimum bonuses awarded for
those working under hazardous conditions to 300,000 Lebanese
pounds (about 200 U.S. dollars) a month from the current 118,000
pounds (about 79 dollars).
</P>
<P>
To support EDL employees, workers from other sectors like
tobacco, telephone, and the public transport also carried out a
one hour strike Monday.
</P>
<P>
Electricity workers last held a strike last October, after
which two of their demands were met.

<HEADLINE> Strike by Zimbabwe's Trade Union Not Ruled Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade
Unions (ZCTU) Monday said it still had the option to call for
another nationwide work boycott, denying the reports that it had
reached an understanding with the government.
</P>
<P>
ZCTU Secretary-General Morgan Tsvangirai told the Zimbabwe
News Agency that a final decision would be reached at the General
Council's meeting which would be held in Mutare of east Zimbabwe
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"How can we rule out the mass job stayaway when we have not
even met and even without the knowledge of the people we
represent?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
The ZCTU organized a mass job stayaway in January which
crippled the country's economy resulting in the loss of business
worth more than 3.8 million U.S. Dollars over two days.
</P>
<P>
ZCTU has demanded among others crapping the five percent
development levy, tax on pensions and the need for the government
to find a long term solution to increases of basic commodities.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether a nationwide stayaway was still the only option
for the ZCTU to force the government into accepting some of its
demands, Tsvangiral said, "We are not ruling out the stayaway but
we still have to discuss all available options."

<HEADLINE> Little Progress Made in Indian-U.S. Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Little progress was made Monday
in the third round of talks between India and the United States
with India ruling out any roll back of its nuclear weaponization
and missile programs.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from his meeting with Indian Prime Atal Bihari
Vajpayee here Monday afternoon, visiting U.S. Deputy Secretary of
State Strobe Talbott told reporters that the discussions were held
in an atmosphere and spirit of quiet diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
"We have more work ahead of us....I would rather wait until we
reach a point that is conclusive. We are not there yet and we have
a long way to go," said Talbott who arrived in the Indian capital
Sunday evening amidst tight security.
</P>
<P>
He said that he conveyed Washington's desire to put bilateral
relations on a solid footing in the aftermath of India's nuclear
tests.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that President Bill Clinton's visit to India
slated for November this year was under review.
</P>
<P>
The Press Trust of India (PTI) reported that Talbott delivered
a letter from President Clinton to Vajpayee, the content of which
is unknown.
</P>
<P>
Talbott is the first high-ranking U.S. official to visit the
South Asian country since India conducted nuclear tests in May.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Talbott held a one-hour meeting with Vajpayee's
special envoy Jaswant Singh who said that India would not
compromise on its security interests.
</P>
<P>
Both Talbott and Singh termed their talks as constructive and
continuing and said they exchanged views on strategic perspectives
of regional and international developments.
</P>
<P>
Talbott said the talks between the two sides covered a wide
range of security issues relating to arms control, disarmament,
non-proliferation and regional and international developments.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of External Affairs issued a statement Monday
afternoon, saying that Talbott's talks with Indian officials were
marked by a spirit of working together to find common ground and
to narrow gaps in their governments' respective perceptions.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that Vajpayee was informed of the progress
made during the talks towards removal of problems in Indo-U.S.
relations which surfaced after India's nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
"There is now a clearer understanding of each other's concerns
and certain steps in the direction of addressing those concerns
are contemplated," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
However, it added, (some) ground remained to be covered and it
had been agreed that another round of talks between Talbott and
Singh would be held in the second half of August in Washington.
</P>
<P>
This is the third meeting between Talbott and Singh in less
than 40 days. His first two rounds of talks with Singh -- in
Washington on June 12 and in Frankfurt on July 9 -- reached no
concrete results with New Delhi asserting that its demand for
building a nuclear deterrent was not negotiable.
</P>
<P>
It is significant that the talks come ten days before the
planned crucial meeting between Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee and Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on the
sidelines of the three-day summit of the South Asian Association
for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) in Colombo beginning on July 29.
</P>
<P>
India had also made it clear that it would not sign the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) in its present form while
Washington insisted on the immediate and unconditional signing of
the CTBT by India and refraining from deploying nuclear weapons or
advanced missile systems in the country.
</P>
<P>
Talbott and Singh are scheduled to have another round of talks
Tuesday morning before the U.S. delegation leaves for Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
Both the U.S. and India were reportedly keen on improving the
bilateral relations so as to save the plans of President Bill
Clinton to visit South Asian countries later this year.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. delegation included Deputy Assistant Secretary for
Non-Proliferation Robert Einhorn, senior adviser in the National
Security Council Bruce Riedel, Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff Joseph Ralston, Assistant Secretary of State for South
Asian Affairs Karl Inderfurth and U.S. Ambassador to India Richard
Celeste.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Reiterates Support for Angolan Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- South African President Nelson
Mandela reiterated Monday his government's support for the
Angolan peace process which is now facing a crisis.
</P>
<P>
Mandela made the remarks during his short stay here on the way
to Brazil.
</P>
<P>
He said Angolan peace process is now facing the worst crisis
in four years due to the failure of opposition National Union for
the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) in implementing the
Lusaka Peace Accord. Instead, the former rebel movement has been
snatching back some cities and towns from government control.
</P>
<P>
Mandela pledged that the South African government will
continue to support the Angolan Peace Process.
</P>
<P>
Under the current circumstances, he said, the Angolan
government should fight for every inch of land. Meanwhile, he
urged the Angolan people to work hard to achieve the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Brazil is the first leg of Mandela's south American tour which
will also bring him to Argentine to attend the summit of Mercado
Commun del Sur (Mercosur).
</P>
<P>
Reports from the Angola News Agency said UNITA has launched
armed attacks in several provinces in Angola.
</P>
<P>
In the diamond-rich Lunda-Norte Province in northeast Angola,
the national police clashed with UNITA militiamen. However, the
police had taken control over the situation, with UNITA forces
fleeing toward the area bordering the Democratic Republic of
Congo.

<HEADLINE> Prisons' Budget Soars in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The cost of maintaining prisons in
Zimbabwe has doubled over the past four years to 454 million
Zimbabwean Dollars (26 million U.S. Dollars) this year although
the prison population has remained stable.
</P>
<P>
"As indicated by the figures, the costs are definitely
increasing. The major causes of the increasing costs are mainly
due to the inflation and the economic environment," a spokesman
for the Zimbabwe Prison Service told the Herald daily at the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, Zimbabwe's prisons, meant to hold
about 16,000 inmates, hold about 22,000. However, he said, the
number of inmates has stabilized over the past four years.
</P>
<P>
"From the figures of the past four years, it is quite evident
that the total number of inmates in the country has been stable.
However, this is well above the current holding capacity of
16,000 inmates," he said.
</P>
<P>
Prisons' expenditure has encompassed provision of food,
clothing, bedding, medication for the criminals and officers'
salaries and wages.
</P>
<P>
James Devitte, a high court judge, said that Zimbabwe faced
the prospect of a high prison population as present economic
difficulties meant that an increasing number of people would have
difficulties in sustaining themselves.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Launch Nationwide Campaign against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe embarks on a nationwide
campaign this week to introduce the 70-million-U.S. Dollar
community action project meant to improve living standards in
rural areas.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ministry of Public Service, Labour and Social
Welfare, the project, which is being financed by the World Bank,
is a component of the Zimbabwean government's poverty alleviation
action program and is administered through the social dimensions
fund. It will be implemented over five years, the daily Herald
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The project is targeted toward the country's 26 poorest
districts and seeks to strengthen the capacity of rural
communities, promote participatory and collaborative planning and
the implementation of projects through community partnership with
rural district councils, non-governmental organisations, the
government and private sector.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Turkey Vows to Protect Turkish Cypriots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman Demirel
reaffirmed Monday that Turkey will carry out its promise to defend
the freedom and rights of Turkish Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
In a congratulatory letter to Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash on the 24th anniversary of Turkey's military intervention
in Cyprus, Demirel said that Turkey will retaliate if the Turkish
Cypriot community is in danger, the semi-official Anatolia News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"The Turkish Cypriot people should be at ease. Turkey is
carefully evaluating those provocative developments within the
framework of her past experience and shall take all necessary
measures," he said.
</P>
<P>
Turkey landed its troops and took over the northern third of
the small island on July 20, 1974 when Greek Cypriot military
officers attempted to seek union with Greece. The island is now
divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south and Turkish
Cypriot-controlled north.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the operation, Demirel said that it ended
"pressure, violence and pain upon the Turkish Cypriot people" and
created the conditions which were necessary for permanent peace in
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared in 1983 "Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus" which was recognized only by
Ankara. At present, 35,000-strong Turkish troops are stationed
there to keep a deterrent on the Greek Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish president stated that Turkey will do what it can to
help Turkish Cypriots gain a more prosperous future, saying the
Cyprus peace process is of great significance to peace and
stability of the eastern Mediterranean region.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he accused "some circles" of continuing their
activities to provoke tension on the divided island.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus signed a deal with Russia early last year to buy S-300
surface-to-air missiles in a bid to boost defense, prompting harsh
reaction from Turkey and Turkish Cypriots, which have vowed to
take all necessary steps to prevent the missile deployment.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz, accompanied by a group of
civilian and military officials, flew to northern Cyprus to
participate in the July 20 celebrations and show Ankara's
determination to protect Turkish Cypriots.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot FM Warns Foreign Observers of Losing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot Foreign Minister Ioannis
Kasoulides Monday warned foreign observers in Cyprus of losing
credibility if they fail to react to the recent visits of Turkish
warplanes and naval vessels to northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after attending a church service to
commemorate those killed during the 1974 Turkish invasion of
Cyprus, Kasoulides said these visits were "illegal" and he would
like to see reactions from the observers.
</P>
<P>
Press reports said 12 Turkish military planes, four naval
vessels and two submarines arrived in the Turkish Cypriot
controlled northern Cyprus over the weekend to participate in the
celebration to mark the 24th anniversary of Turkish troops'
landing on the island.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the Cypriot government came under fire for
allowing Greek fighter planes to land on its newly-built air base
in western part of the island, a move to which Turkey responded
by sending six warplanes to the north.
</P>
<P>
"The question to all those foreigners, who rushed to express
concern about the arrival of the Greek planes, is whether they can
convince us that this time they are acting as honest brokers
through their response to Turkey's provocative actions,"
Kasoulides said.
</P>
<P>
If they ignored the Turkish actions, he added, they would lose
all credibility as "objective observers."
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides said the Cypriot government would make all
appropriate representations to the United Nations over Turkey's
"provocative actions".
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.

<P>
LONDON, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Defense Secretary George
Robertson has agreed to give the green light to a new spy plane
designed to spot enemy forces 200 miles away, according to a BBC
television report Monday.
</P>
<P>
British officials were quoted as saying Monday the project,
known as Astor standing for airborne stand-off radar, would cost
750 million pounds (about 1.2 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The officials noted that the final go-ahead was given after the
government's defense review, released early this month, revealed a
need for better intelligence gathering.
</P>
<P>
Three bidders, which are planning to modify existing business
jets, are vying to supply the five planes, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Decides to Extend MINURSO Mandate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The Security Council of the
United Nations Monday decided to extend the mandated of the United
Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) for
a further period of time until September 21, 1998.
</P>
<P>
In its resolution unanimously adopted, the Security Council
reiterateded its commitment to assist the Morocco and the Popular
Front for the Liberation of Saguia el-Hamra and Rio de Oro
(POLISARIO front) to achieve a just and last solution to the
question of Western Sahara.
</P>
<P>
The council welcomed the engagement of the U.N.
secretary-general's personal envoy with the parties to seek a
solution to those issues bearing upon implementation of the
Settlement Plan.
</P>
<P>
The council called upon the parties to cooperation
constructively with the United Nations, the personal envoy of the
secretary-general, the special representative of the
secretary-general and the Identification Commission established in
line with the Settlement Plan in order to complete the
identification of voters.
</P>
<P>
The council requested the U.N. chief to report to it every 30
days from the date of extension of the mandate of the MINURSO on
the progress of the implementation of the Settlement Plan and the
agreements reached between the parties, and to keep it regularly
informed of all significant developments in the interim period.
</P>
<P>
Western Sahara had been a Spanish colony until 1976 when Spain
withdrew and released itself from international responsibility
over the territory which was subsequently occupied by Morocco, a
move which was opposed by the POLISARIO front.
</P>
<P>
Following diplomatic initiatives by the Organization of African
Unity and the United Nations, the Security Council approved a
settlement plan for Western Sahara in 1990. Under the plan, there
would be a cease-fire, and a transitional period during which the
special representative of the U.N. chief would be in charge of all
matters relating to referendum, assisted by the MINURSO.
</P>
<P>
The plan was eventually bogged down by the two parties's
differences over certain groups of people to be included in the
referendum.
</P>
<P>
A breakthrough was achieved last year when a new special envoy
of the secretary-general brought the two parties together and they
agreed to resume the identification process.

<HEADLINE> Greece Blasts Turkish PM's Visit to Northern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Greece Monday condemned the visit
by Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz to northern Cyprus, calling it
another act of provocation by Ankara.
</P>
<P>
The attack was launched here by visiting Greek Interior
Minister Alecos Papadopoulos following his meeting with Cypriot
President Glafcos Clerides.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that Yilmaz's visit was "nothing else but
another link to the endless chain of Turkish provocations".
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz arrived in the Turkish Cypriot-controlled northern
Cyprus earlier Monday to attend celebrations on the 24th
anniversary of the Turkish military intervention on Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Papadopoulos was in Cyprus representing the Greek
government to attend the events to mark the anniversary of what
they called Turkey's invasion of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since Turkey landed its troops and
took over the northern third of Cyprus on July 20, 1974, after a
coup launched by Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has since maintained some 35,000 troops in the north
with the claimed aim of protecting the Turkish Cypriot minority.
</P>
<P>
Papadopoulos said during their meeting, President Clerides
briefed him on the latest developments in the situation concerning
the island.
</P>
<P>
The Greek minister pledged that both Greece and Cyprus would
continue their joint efforts in seeking a peaceful solution to the
Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Cyprus signed a joint defense pact in November
1993, under which Greece will come to aid in case Cyprus is
attacked.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz's visit came at a time when tensions on the island have
escalated since early last year when Cyprus ordered a Russian
anti-aircraft missile system.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has threatened to strike the missiles if they are
deployed, but Cyprus has said that it would not cancel the missile
plan unless progress is made in resuming the stalled peace talks
and on its proposal for demilitarizing the island.

<HEADLINE> Green Lines Restored in Somali Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, July 20 (Xinhua) -- People in the Somali capital
were terrified Monday by the sudden restoration of the former
green lines which had disgracefully divided Mogadishu in the past
seven years.
</P>
<P>
The four main junctions linking the two sides of the capital
have been stormed by heavily armed infantry militiamen using
several battle wagons.
</P>
<P>
The militiamen who did not fire at anybody have forcefully
blocked all kinds of transport vehicles, public or private, from
crossing the green lines at about 9:00 am local time Monday.
</P>
<P>
However, the movement of the pedestrians is not yet restricted
as hundreds of people have gone on foot to either side of the
capital for their normal duties.
</P>
<P>
The uncertainty created by the new blockade has immediately
hindered major business activities within the capital as the
movement of large amounts of money to any side of Mogadishu
became almost impossible or highly dangerous.
</P>
<P>
Without giving any specific reason, the militiamen manning the
green lines have ordered all public transport buses not to try to
come close to them.
</P>
<P>
"This is the order we have," said one of them with an AK-47
assault rifle.
</P>
<P>
According to sources close to the main faction leaders of the
Somali capital, the restoration of the green lines has a
political motive prompted by what they characterized as minor
political difference that emerged between the peace brokers of
Mogadishu and other politicians after serious negotiations Sunday
night.
</P>
<P>
The politicians did not rule out the possibility of an
agreement very soon. However, they declined to mention who is
responsible.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the people Monday pointed their finger of blame
on Hussein Hajji Bod, one of Ali Mahdi's deputy chairmen, who has
been a rival of Ali Mahdi himself ever since the Cairo peace deal
was reached late last December.
</P>
<P>
Hussein Hajji Bod who spoke with Xinhua Monday has shouldered
the responsibility of the militiamen who were dispatched for
sealing off the green lines.
</P>
<P>
The militiamen were sent merely to secure public order and
combat the lawlessness as part of what he called a peace
campaign.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to correct if anything went wrong during these
operations and we did not order the militiamen to stop the
buses," said Bod.
</P>
<P>
This unforeseen closure of the former green lines came at a
time when there is an air of optimism for the settlement of
Mogadishu political crises following the peace agreement between
Ali Mahdi Mohamed, Hussein Mohamed Aidid and Osman Ali Atto on
one hand and one of Ali Mahdi's deputy chairmen on the other.
</P>
<P>
Ali Mahdi's deputy chairman, the well-known militia leader
Muse Sudi Yalahow, has been offered the post of a deputy
co-chairmen in Mogadishu's forthcoming administration. Ali Mahdi
has five deputy chairmen in his faction.
</P>
<P>
The green lines had also been restored at a time when the
people of the capital had been expecting the announcement of the
inauguration of Mogadishu's air and seaport late Monday.
</P>
<P>
The air and seaport of the capital had been out of use since
1995, just a few months after the departure of the multi-national
forces of the United Nations from Mogadishu.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Former United Nations
Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali called on the Arab world
to adopt a firm position towards the Iraqi regime and force it to
implement all U.N. Security Council's resolutions, Kuwait News
Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Boutros-Ghali was speaking in an interview with Kuwaiti
magazine Al-Yaqadha in its coming Friday edition.
</P>
<P>
On how to lift the economic sanctions against Iraq, the former
U.N. chief said "this matter is linked with the Arab countries who
have to take a firm stand towards Iraq."
</P>
<P>
He said the sanctions only harm the Iraqi people, not the
regime.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions were imposed on Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait
in 1990.
</P>
<P>
In the interview, he also called on the Iraqi government to
release the Kuwaiti POWs and detainees who were brought to Iraq
during the Baghdad invasion.
</P>
<P>
He said delaying the release "is causing an agony for the POWs
whose freedom has been denied and their families are feeling pain."
</P>
<P>
Kuwait insists that 625 people went missing in the final days
of Iraq's seven-month occupation, among them more than 550 are
Kuwaitis, besides Saudis, Iranians, Egyptians, Syrians, Indians
and Lebanese. But Iraq denies it.

ATHENS, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Greece Urged Monday the
international community to help break the impasse of peaceful
negotiations in the divided island republic of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the 24th anniversary of the Turkish invasion of
Cyprus, Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said that it
was time for the impasse in the resolution of the Cyprus problem
to be overcome.
</P>
<P>
The presence of Turkish government officials and fighter planes
in northern Cyprus not only confirms that Turkey illegally
occupies a section of Cyprus but also proves that Turkey has no
intention of contributing to a solution, he said.
</P>
<P>
He warned that such a negative policy not only shows up Turkey
but fosters serious dangers.
</P>
<P>
Greece's Alternate Foreign Minister George Papandreou also said
Monday that the international community should move its focus from
concern over the deployment of Russian-made S-300 anti-aircraft
missiles to the demilitarization of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriots-dominated south
and Turkish Cypriots-controlled north since July 1974 when Turkey
landed its troops and took over the northern third of the island
in the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>

So far, no progress has been made in the peace process on the

LAGOS, July 20 (Xinhua) -- President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah of
Sierra Leone arrived in Monrovia, capital of neighboring Liberia,
Monday for a one-day state visit at the invitation of President
Charles Taylor.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two leaders had long been soured by
accusations that Taylor backed Sierra Leonean rebels and the army
regime which ousted Kabbah in May last year, and continued to
support the remnants of the junta forces after the regime was
toppled last February.
</P>

According to a report reaching here, Kabbah was greeted by
Taylor and other top officials at the James Spriggs Airport in
Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
A statement from Taylor's office said the two leaders would
discuss "peace and stability of both countries and the
sub-region."

Besides holding face-to-face talks, Taylor and Kabbah were
also due to meet Jesse Jackson, the U.S. special envoy on the

The visit was agreed at a meeting in the Nigerian capital

further hampered by the danger and security threats to the mission
personnel.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief said its presence in the country is essential.
Not only does the mission's presence continue to be a stability
factor in the area and to provide useful support for the political
process, but it also helps to create a sense of confidence and
security among the local population of the country, he added.
</P>
<P>
Annan condemned the attacks against peacekeepers of the United
Nations and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and urged
the Georgian authorities, especially the Abkhaz authorities, to
take measures to ensure the safety and security of the personnel
of the UNOMIG and the CIS.

<HEADLINE> Shevardnadze Urges Speedy Probe Into Murder of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Georgian President Eduard
Shevardnadze has ordered law enforcement agencies to quickly find
out those who murdered a U.N. worker and bring them to justice,
saying it was "a matter of national dignity."
</P>
<P>
Maria Wewiorska, a 31-year-old Polish women working for the
U.N. military observer mission, was murdered in her apartment last
Tuesday in Tbilisi, the Georgian capital.
</P>
<P>
"The timely investigation of the murder... is a matter of
national dignity for Georgia," the Itar-Tass quoted Shevardnadze
as saying over the national radio.
</P>
<P>
He said authorities had acquired "a lot of information" about
the circumstances of the crime.
</P>
<P>
A Georgian investigator in charge of the probe said Wewiorska
might have been killed by a robber.
</P>
<P>
The country's Foreign Ministry hoped that the incident would
not prevent the mission of the United Nations and other
international organizations from continuing their operation in
Georgia in search of a peaceful settlement to the Abkhazia
conflict.
</P>
<P>
A bloody interethnic unrest escalated into a violent armed
conflict in 1992 when Georgian government troops were dispatched
to the breakaway republic. About 7,000 people died in the conflict
before a cease-fire agreement was reached in May 1994 under
Russian auspices. Sporadic violence, however, persisted.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council condemned Wewiorska's murder and
reminded the two conflicting sides in Georgia of their obligation
to protect the life and ensure the security of the U.N. observer
mission in Georgia.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Says Agreement Depends on Palestinians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu said Monday that if Palestinian negotiators hold serious
talks with Israel, an agreement on the second redeployment would
be wrapped up soon.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu made the remarks just a day after the resumption of
the direct Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, which have been
stalled for months over the extent of next Israeli troop pullback
in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with visiting Estonian Foreign Minister Toomas Ilves
here, Netanyahu said it was still too early to say if the
Palestinian negotiators have come with a mandate to reach an
agreement, adding that "we will know it in coming days."
</P>
<P>
"If they have, the talks can be wrapped up in the near future,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai and Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) deputy head Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) met
Sunday in Tel Aviv in an effort to reach an agreement on the
long overdue second redeployment.
</P>
<P>
The talks came at the urging of the United States, which
called on the two sides to negotiate directly to resolve
differences over a U.S. initiative calling for Israel to withdraw
from another 13 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Among the key issues discussed were the nature of the 13
percent withdrawal, revision of the clauses in the Palestinian
Covenant calling for Israel's destruction and amendment of the
U.S.-brokered security memorandum initiated last December.
</P>
<P>
On the redeployment, Israel reportedly demanded placing special
restrictions on 3 percent of the 13 percent of West Bank to be
yielded to the Palestinians. In the area, Israeli troops have the
right to reenter in case of need and the Palestinians residents
are not allowed to build without Israeli permits.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai and Mazen have agreed to set up several teams to
continue the negotiations in order to clinch a deal on all the
issues.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai, a moderate among the right-wing Israeli coalition,
has said that he hoped his meeting with Abu Mazen would lead to
a summit between Netanyahu and the PNA Chairman Yasser Arafat to
finalize a deal on the second redeployment.
</P>
<P>
And Netanyahu also repeated his willingness on Monday to hold
a meeting with Arafat. But the Palestinian leader has rejected to
meet Netanyahu unless he comes with real determination to move
forward the peace process that has been stalled for 16 months.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Ready to Help Papua New Guinea in Disaster Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations stands
ready to help Papua New Guinea in overcoming the damage brought up
by last week's tidal wave, Secretary-General Kofi Annan said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued through his spokesman, Annan said he was
profoundly distressed to learn of the terrible damage, especially
by the "tragic loss of so many lives, including those of hundreds
if not thousands of children."
</P>
<P>
He said the U.N. will help assess the damage and mobilize the
necessary international relief effort. The U.N. Office for the
Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Geneva is leading the
relief effort, according to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
An undersea quake with the magnitude of 7.0 on the Richter
scale was registered near the Northern coast of Papua New Guinea
Friday, which triggered a tidal wave of some 10 meters, crashing
into a coastal area stretching 30 km. The affected area is 800 km
north of the capital Port Moresby.
</P>
<P>
At least seven villages have been wiped out and destroyed. The
latest information received from the U.N. Development Program
(UNDP) Office in Port Moresby put the official number of deaths at
725.
</P>
<P>
However, the death toll is expected to rise considerably as a
large number of people are still unaccounted for. In addition,
hundreds of people have been injured. A state of national disaster
has been declared in the country.

<HEADLINE> German Businessman Gets Jail Term for Nuke Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 20 (Xinhua) -- A German court Monday sentenced a
German businessman to three years and nine months in prison on
charges of illegally selling machinery parts to Pakistan that are
used to enrich uranium.
</P>
<P>
The 67-year-old businessman was found guilty of violating
German laws to control exports of military goods by delivering to
Pakistan from 1988 to 1993 accessories for gas centrifuges used to
enrich weapons-grade uranium for the country's nuclear program.
</P>
<P>
The exports had endangered German foreign relations and
undermined the German policy of non-proliferation of mass
destruction weapons, the Stuttgart court said.
</P>
<P>
The businessman denied the accusations at the start of the
trial in March. But after Pakistan's nuclear tests in May, he
admitted that he could not rule out the possibility that his
products could also be used for nuclear purpose.

<HEADLINE> Kok Appointed Chief to Form Dutch Coalition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Dutch Queen Beatrix Wilhelmina
Armgard Monday appointed outgoing Prime Minister Wim Kok the chief
for the formation of the next coalition government.
</P>
<P>
This was announced in the Hague after the queen met with the
three informateurs or persons in charge of pre-cabinet formation
negotiations, according to news reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The appointment meant that Kok is the prime minister-designate
of the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Kok, Frits Bolkestein and Els Borst, the three informateurs,
represent the Labor Party, the People's Party for Freedom and
Democracy and the Democrats 66.
</P>
<P>
The three parties had formed the previous coalition for a term
of four years during which the coalition won the trust of the
Dutch public.
</P>
<P>
In the May elections, the Labor Party won 45 seats; the
People's Party for Freedom and Democracy got 38 seats, and the
Democrats 66 had 14 seats.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition, the Christian Democratic Appeal, took 29
seats.
</P>
<P>
The trio combined accounts for 97 of the 150 seats in the lower
house of the Dutch parliament.
</P>
<P>
Kok is expected to spend the next few days selecting candidates
for his cabinet and the queen will finally confirm Kok's choice in
office.
</P>
<P>
Several of the previous coalition, however, have announced
their wish not to form part of the new coalition. They include
former Foreign Minister Hans van Mierlo, Justice Minister Winnie
Sorgdrager, Education Minister Jo Ritzen, Economy Minister Hans
Wijers and Social Affairs Minister Ad Melkert.
</P>
<P>
It usually takes a while for parties to negotiate into a
coalition in the Netherlands and the longest government-forming
negotiation in the post-war Dutch history was recorded in 1977
when 208 days elapsed before the new cabinet was formed.

<HEADLINE> EU Dismayed Over Weekend Fighting in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The European Union expressed
Monday its dismay at the reports that intensified hostilities in
Kosovo over the weekend led to more deaths.
</P>
<P>
The union said that the priorities now are a cessation of
hostilities and a start of a meaningful political process.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement, Austria, that is now serving the
rotating presidency of the 15-nation union, said that the EU
condemns the alleged recent infiltrations of several hundred
fighters from Albania into the Yugoslav province of Kosovo and
calls urgently on both the armed Kosovar groups and the Serbian
authorities to exercise restraint and to cease hostilities
immediately.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that intensified fightings in Kosovo over
the weekend left up to 450 people unaccounted for.
</P>
<P>
The union also demands from the Serbian and Yugoslav
authorities an immediate halt to shellings that had violated the
international borders.
</P>
<P>
The EU stressed that violence will not enhance the prospects
for a negotiated solution of the Kosovo crisis.

ATHENS, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Greek police Monday confiscated 306
kilograms of Indian cannabis near Parga, northern Greece.
</P>
<P>
The cannabis was hidden in bushes on a beach near Parga and
police suspected that the drugs had probably been left by Albanian
drug dealers, the semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA) reported.
</P>
<P>
It is the third major drug discovery in a week. Greek Customs
officials discovered Sunday 1.5 tons of Indian cannabis hidden in
a refrigerator truck passing through the Greek-Albanian border
post.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Greek officials at the Krystallopigi customs post
discovered more than 1,000 kilograms of hashish when they searched
a tanker truck coming from Albania.
</P>
<P>
In the northern Greek city of Thessaloniki, police confiscated
a total of 1,918 pirated CDs after they searched a 48-year-old

<HEADLINE> Russia, India in Deal of Designing Nuclear Power Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Russia and India signed a contract
here Monday to prepare a detailed design of a nuclear power plant
in Kudankulam, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The document was signed by Viktor Kozlov, general director of
Russia's Atomstroiexport company, and Y.S. Prasad, director of the
Indian Atomic Energy Corp., Itar-Tass quoted the Russian Ministry
of Atomic Power as saying.
</P>
<P>
For actual construction of the nuclear power plant, the two
sides will have to sign another general contract, which is
expected this autumn.
</P>
<P>
The value of the deal has not been revealed yet, but Itar-Tass
quoted Atomic Energy Minister Yevgeny Adamov as saying earlier
that the project would cost 2.6 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Russia intends to build two light-water VVER-1000 nuclear
reactors in India on a turn-key basis, Itar-Tass said.
</P>
<P>
An agreement on the construction of a nuclear power plant was
signed in 1988 between India and the former Soviet Union, but
implementation was postponed for lack of funds.
</P>
<P>
Last month, India and Russia, the legal successor to the Soviet
Union, signed an additional agreement that provided the legal
basis for bilateral nuclear cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Stresses School Discipline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, july 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Monday called for wider use of school uniforms, tough curfews and
anti-gun policies designed to restore "order in our children's
lives" and discipline in their schools.
</P>
<P>
"We either have discipline in the classroom or we have disorder
and, quite often, danger," Clinton was quoted by the Associated
Press as telling the national convention of the American
Federation of Teachers (AFT) in New Orleans, Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also announced he would lead a White House conference
on school safety on October 15, which he will proclaim "national
school safety day."
</P>
<P>
The conference will include educators, law enforcement
officials and families touched by school violence -- including
those from communities hit by recent fatal shootings by students.
</P>
<P>
Citing such measures as stricter curfews and the wider use of
school uniforms, Clinton urged the teachers and their school
districts to pursue "a new approach to restore discipline in our
schools and order in our children's lives."
</P>
<P>
"Teachers can't teach if they have to fight for respect or fear
for their safety," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also promoted successful programs in local communities.
He told the AFT convention he was particularly impressed with a
Milwaukee policy that allows police to stop and question youths on
the streets during school hours.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he has reviewed new statistics that showed three
out of four students say they have trouble with disruptive
classmates and that 81 percent of teachers say undisciplined
students take up most of their time.

<HEADLINE> Russian Speaker Reassures Turkey Over Cyprus Missile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of Russia's State Duma
(Lower House) Gennady Seleznyov reassured his Turkish host that
the Russian-made S-300 missiles ordered by Cyprus are only for
defensive purposes.
</P>
<P>
In a joint press conference after meeting with Turkish
counterpart Hikmet Cetin, Seleznyov said that Cyprus is a state
recognized by the United Nations and it can regulate its defense
system as it wishes.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus signed a deal with Russia early last year to buy the
S-300 missiles with an aim to boost its air defense. But the move
sparked angry reactions from the Turkish Cypriots and Turkey,
which has threatened to launch preemptive strikes to destroy the
missiles if they are deployed.
</P>
<P>
Seleznyov, who arrived here Sunday for a one-day visit, said
that within the framework of the commercial deal between Cyprus
and Russia, the S-300 missiles would be delivered to Cyprus
late this year.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since July 20, 1974 when Turkey
landed its troops and took over the northern third of the
Mediterranean island after a failed coup by the Greek Cypriots
seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared in 1983 the
"Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus," which is only recognized by
Turkey, to counter the internationally acknowledged Republic of
Cyprus dominated by the Greek Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has been stationing over 35,000-strong troops in
northern Cyprus with the claimed aim to protect the Turkish
Cypriot minority.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Turkey repeated its warning Monday that it would
retaliate against any provocations by the Greek Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
In a congratulatory message to Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash on the 24th anniversary of Turkey's military intervention
in Cyprus, Turkish President Suleyman Demirel said that "Turkey
will retaliate if the Turkish Cypriot community is in danger."
</P>
<P>
Demirel pledged that Turkey would carry out its promise to
defend freedom and rights of the Turkish Cypriots.

<P>
BAGHDAD, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Iraq on Monday slammed a comment
broadcast by the Voice of America which said the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea had sold missiles to Iraq and the
United Nations had found VX gas on Iraqi missile warheads.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi News Agency quoted the political editor at
Al-Jumhoriya (Republic) Radio Station as saying on Monday that
the claims on VX gas was made by a biased party -- U.S. army
laboratory, and leaked by U.S. intelligence agents.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Washington Post reported late last month that an
American army laboratory had found traces of deadly VX gas on
some remnants of Iraqi missile warheads, but Iraq disputed the
findings.
</P>
<P>
Although the chief U.N. arms inspector Richard Butler said he
had no doubt of the findings, the United Nations agreed to take
samples for further testing in laboratories in France and
Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi radio political editor said it were the U.S. troops
that used chemical and napalm bombs in the Vietnam War, and in the
Gulf War, U.S. and British troops used depleted uranium bombs
against the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
While advocating non-proliferation of mass destruction weapons,
the U.S. government itself helped Israel to build large nuclear,
biological, chemical and hydrogen arsenals, said the editor.

<P>
PARIS, July 20 (Xinhua) -- France Monday pleaded for a gradual
lifting of sanctions on Nigeria by the European Union (EU),
according to Agence France-Presse (AFP).
</P>
<P>
French Delegate Minister in charge of cooperations with Africa
Charles Josselin made the declaration after a meeting with the
Nigerian head of state, General Abdulsalam Abukabar, in the
Nigerian capital Abuja.
</P>
<P>
AFP quoted Josselin as saying that he had delivered "a message
of understanding" from the French government to Abukabar.
</P>
<P>
Josselin told Abukabar that "each country makes democracy
according to its own rhythm" and that the primary signs of change
given by Nigeria since Abukabar succeeded General Sani Abacha as
the chief of state in June were "very positive."
</P>
<P>
He said that France would plead for within the EU a gradual
lifting of the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
"We have the confidence in the will of General Abukabar to
carry forward the democratic process which will allow Nigerians to
choose their government within a reasonable duration of time from
now," he said.
</P>
<P>
The United States and the EU imposed sanctions on Nigeria in
1993 after the Nigerian military canceled the result of a
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions were reinforced in 1995 by the U.S. and the EU.

<P>
LAGOS, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Head of State General
Abdulsalam Abubakar has pardoned and ordered the immediate
release of 10 convicts of the 1995 coup plot, the state TV NTA
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The release, signed by David Attah, the Chief Press Secretary
to the head of state, was announced in a statement in federal
capital Abuja, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The statement gives the names of the convicts as Shehu Musa

</P>
<P>
About 40 people, including former head of state General
Olusegun Obasanjo were arrested and convicted for alleged plot to
overthrow the military government of General Sani Abacha in April
1995.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo was released a month ago by Abubakar, who became
Nigeria's new leader after the sudden death of Abacha on June 8.
</P>
<P>
As part of his national reconciliation effort, Abubakar has
ordered the release of 26 coup plotters, opposition leaders and
journalists.
</P>
<P>
He also ordered the release of all prisoners who have
completed their jail terms but remained behind the bar, to
decongest the country's cells and show his will to protect human
rights.
</P>
<P>
Also according to the NTA, Abubakar is expected to make his
long-awaited national broadcast Monday at 9:00 p.m. (local time)
on his plan to return Nigeria to civil rule, after 13 straight
years of military government.

<HEADLINE> Russia Vows Dramatic Increase in Tax Collection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The Russian government has pledged
to the International Monetary Fund to fundamentally increase tax
collection next year, the Itar-Tass news agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement addressed to the IMF, the Russian
government and the Central Bank said a complete list of major
tax payers would be drawn up and measures would be taken to ensure
that they pay up.
</P>
<P>
Other steps for more tax revenue include simpler individual
income tax rates, higher land rent and taxes on gambling.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Central Bank promised to make its operations
more transparent and set mandatory requirements on commercial
banks for greater transparency.
</P>
<P>
The moves were seen as efforts taken by the Russian government
to meet conditions set by the IMF and other international
financial institutions for release of vital bail-out loans to help
Russia tide over its economic difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Russia announced last Monday that it would get 22.6 billion
U.S. dollars from the IMF, the World Bank and Japan in 1998-1999.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Russian President Boris Yeltsin
instructed the government to submit the draft budget for 1999 to
the State Duma, or lower house of parliament, before August 26.
</P>
<P>
In a presidential decree, Yeltsin said the draft should
envision revenues of no less than 376 billion rubles (about 60.5
billion U.S. dollars) and spending of no more than 456 billion
rubles (about 73.5 billion dollars). The ceiling for the budget
deficit is set at 80 billion rubles (about 13 billion dollars), or
2.8 percent of the projected gross domestic product (GDP),
Itar-Tass reported.
</P>
<P>
Also Monday, Russia Vice-Prime Minister Viktor Khristenko told
reporters that the government may sell its stakes in Rosneft,
Slavneft, the United Energy System of Russia, LUKoil, Svyazinvest
and some other major conglomerates to boost productivity,
profitability and competitiveness and generate more jobs.
</P>
<P>
More importantly, the government hopes to increase budget
revenues through such privatization schemes.

<HEADLINE> Experts Meet on AIDS in Eastern, Southern Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 20 (Xinhua) -- About 63 experts from 12 eastern
and southern African countries gathered here Monday over how to
tackle HIV/AIDS in workplaces in sub-Saharan Africa which sees
the fastest HIV/AIDS spread in the world.
</P>
<P>
HIV carriers now make up 7.4 percent of all those aged 15 to
49 in the region, according to a U.N. report.
</P>
<P>
"Within the sub-continent, HIV rates have been found to be
higher in the military, in educated and skilled groups, in urban
areas and in migrant employment," said Dr Rene Loewenson at the
meeting scheduled to end Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
As a result, "workplaces have had more frequent and longer
periods of absenteeism, losses in skills and experience,
diminishing returns to training investments, with an overall
shift to younger and less experienced workers" in the region, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
"On average, an estimated 15 years of working life will be
lost per employee due to AIDS," he quoted data from the
International Labor Organization as saying.
</P>
<P>
Losses due to AIDS have cost formal sector business on average
between 20 and 200 U.S. Dollars per worker per year, with further
unmeasured but significant costs in the informal and household
sectors, and in terms of social development and morale, he said.
</P>
<P>
The expert suggested that the business response to HIV/AIDS
should be divided into different levels and involve in HIV
prevention, health promotion and care, as well as human resource
development and monitoring and evaluation.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Health Minister Jackson Kalweo also called for more
active and serious participation of the business circle into the
anti-AIDS campaign when opening the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"It is becoming increasingly clear that governments alone are
not able to reduce the transmission of HIV/AIDS so as to mitigate
the social impact of AIDS," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"We in this region (eastern and southern Africa) are in deeper
trouble than we ever knew," he warned.
</P>
<P>
The meeting brings together people from key organizations in
eastern and southern Africa with a role in planning and
implementing programs to reduce the impact of HIV/AIDS in the
workplace.
</P>
<P>
Issues to be discussed also include preventive interventions,
their costs and benefits, approaches to workplace awareness and
behavior change and consulting and testing.
</P>
<P>
The three-day meeting is organized jointly by UNAIDS, Family
Health International and the Organization of African Trade Union
Unity (OATUU).

WASHINGTON, July 20 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton will pay
a visit to Ireland and Northern Ireland following his trip to
Russia in September, the White House said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"His visit will highlight America's continuing deep commitment
to a peaceful and prosperous future for Ireland and Northern
Ireland," the White House said in a statement issued during
Clinton's stay in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
"The president will use his visit to underscore the United
States' strong support for the new beginning created by the Good
Friday accord and its overwhelming approval by popular vote," the
White House statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The president worked closely with the heads of both
governments and the leaders of the parties to make this historic
accord a reality," it said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton played a personal role in urging all sides to
compromise to reach the Northern Ireland political settlement in
April. He also has taken a close interest in recent violent
disturbances related to traditional marches by pro-British
Protestants, White House officials have said.

JOHANNESBURG, July 20 (Xinhua) -- South Africa welcomed the
adoption last week of a U.N.-sponsored agreement on the creation
of an international criminal court, South African Justice
Minister Dullah Omar said Monday.
</P>
<P>
In the context of Africa, the sooner the court was

Omar said in an opening address at a conference of the

Africa had suffered all four core crimes mentioned in the
court's founding statute: genocide, crimes against humanity, war

<HEADLINE> Rural County Gets More Voters Than Adult Residents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The little, rural county of
Taliaferro in Georgia of the United States, has an astonishing 1.1
registered voters for every adult resident.
</P>
<P>
Taliaferro, the least populated of Georgia's 159 counties, has
1,387 registered voters and an adult population of 1,305,
according to the Census Bureau. About 300 absentee ballots have
already been filed for Tuesday's primary.
</P>
<P>
In the rest of Georgia, about 70 percent of the voting-age
population is registered to vote, according to An Associated Press
report.
</P>
<P>
"It's gotten to be ridiculous," Lois Richards, a retired
probate judge who complains that people who haven't lived here in
decades can vote.
</P>
<P>
Some have charged that Taliaferro, or any place else with more
than 100 percent registration, must be rife with fraud.
</P>
<P>
But defenders of the voting list say there's nothing wrong with
former residents continuing to vote here long after they've moved
away. Georgia law on absentee balloting leaves open such a
possibility.
</P>
<P>
Some residents say there's a history of voting chicanery in
this town nearly 100 miles east of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
At the courthouse in the center of town, Chief Registrar Edwin
Sigman said he knows some people are suspicious. After state
elections officials suggested a review last year, he said, about
300 people were struck from the rolls.
</P>
<P>
Such elections rules aren't unique to Georgia. They are
designed for people who are in the military or leave their home
area for jobs or education but plan to return and prefer to
exercise their right to vote in their home county.

WASHINGTON, July 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 20 (Xinhua) -- South Africa is to hold a
peacekeeping exercise for countries of the southern African
region in November, Defense Minister Joe Modise said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The exercise is very important for the continent if you look
at what is happening in Somalia and west Africa. We need to be
pro-active and not wait until we have problems," South African
Press Association quoted Modise as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said a number of friendly countries had been asked to help
finance the operation which would cost about 15 million Rand (2.4
million U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
Budget cuts made it impossible for the South African Defense
Ministry to carry all the costs.
</P>
<P>
Italy had agreed to help, and would provide two aircraft and
experienced officers for the exercise, which is dubbed "Blue
Crane".
</P>
<P>
All Southern African Development Community countries except
Botswana will take part in the exercise.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Tea Prices up at Weekly Export Auction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan tea prices increased at
the weekly export auction in the Indian Ocean port of Mombasa
Monday, according to a report reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The rise was due to a strong demand from Pakistan and recent
cool weather which appears to slow tea growth, improve quality
and reduce quantities on offer, tea brokers were quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"Because the quality is better, the more discerning markets
like the U.K. also come in," said Norman Wilson, the managing
director of Africa Tea Brokers (ATB).
</P>
<P>
Brighter and medium BP1s appreciated by 0.05 to 0.15 U.S.
Dollars, while lower mediums were dearer by 0.02 to 0.05 Dollars,
brokers said.
</P>
<P>
Brighter PF1s were a strong feature and advanced by 0.20-0.30
Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Tea output in Kenya, a key export earner, is poised to hit a
new high this year thanks to improved weather, better husbandry
and strong global prices, the ATB announced earlier last month.
</P>
<P>
The cumulative figure for the year to April stood at 113.26
million kg, an increase of 58.29 million kg or 106.04 percent
over the previous year, said the Mombasa-based company.
</P>
<P>
Kenya is one of the world's leading producers of black teas,
with a record output of 257 million kg in 1996.

MOSCOW, July 20 (Xinhua) -- A top Russian intelligence official
said Monday that it is normal for Russia and South Korea to agree
on an equal number of secret service agents in each other's
diplomatic missions.
</P>
<P>
However, Yuri Kobaladze, head of the press bureau of Russia's
Foreign Intelligence Service, declined to confirm or deny reports
that Seoul had agreed to recall five foreign intelligence agents
working under diplomatic cover, two in Moscow and three in
Vladivostok.
</P>
<P>
"We make no comments on our agreements reached with foreign
colleagues, but we think that there is nothing unusual if each
secret service possess an equal number of its representatives in
another country," the Itar-Tass news agency quoted Kobaladze as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday, the South Korean Foreign Ministry announced
that it was recalling five diplomats to reduce its number of
intelligence agents in Russia to the level of Russia's in South
Korea.
</P>
<P>
"The withdrawal is in accordance with an agreement between the
intelligence authorities of both countries," said Foreign Ministry
spokesman Lee Ho-jin.
</P>
<P>
The diplomatic row began July 4 when Russia ordered the
expulsion of a South Korean diplomat, Cho Sung-woo, on spying
charges. Four days later, Seoul retaliated by ordering the
expulsion of a Russian diplomat, Oleg N. Abramkin.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister
Grigory Karasin told the Interfax news agency that Foreign
Minister Yevgeny Primakov would meet his South Korean counterpart,
Park Chung-soo, on the sidelines of an international forum
sponsored by the Association of South East Asian Nations in
Manila, the Philippines, slated for July 26-29.
</P>
<P>
He said the meeting was scheduled on South Korean initiative.
</P>
<P>
"Various aspects of the unpleasant incident in our relations
with South Korea will be discussed to some extent," Karasin said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Kenyan Economy Continues to Slow Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The economic growth rate in Kenya
fell to 1.9 percent between March 1997 and March 1998 from 2.3
percent in the previous year, the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK)
said in the July edition of its Monthly Economic Review.
</P>
<P>
The slowdown, evident in virtually all sectors, was mainly
caused by bad weather, rising costs of inputs, depressed
long-term investment, decline in investor confidence and weak
state of infrastructure, said the CBK.
</P>
<P>
The growth in agricultural production in the east African
country is estimated to have declined to 0.7 percent in the year
to March from 1.2 percent in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Coffee fell by 50 percent in the year to March 1998 compared
with the decline of 20 percent in the year to March 1997 while
sisal fell by 22.8 percent from a three percent decrease.
</P>
<P>
Tea yield was down by 11.5 percent in the year to January 1998
from an increase of six percent over the same period in the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
Growth in the manufacturing sector is estimated to have
declined to 1.6 percent in the year to March 1998 from 1.9
percent by the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The CBK said the decline was due to power rationing in mid
last year, poor infrastructure, strong competition from cheaper
imports, slack domestic demand associated with declining per
capita incomes and the general decrease in industrial investment
last year.
</P>
<P>
The bank predicted that the worsening performance in this
sector is expected to reverse after the second half of 1998,
citing cheaper and increased supplies of agro-based raw materials
and the re-opening up of the U.S. market for Kenyan textiles.
</P>
<P>
Despite the general repression, Kenya's financial sector
improved in 1997 and early 1998 as a result of investment in
Treasury Bills due to high rates of returns and more efficiency
following the introduction of innovative banking techniques.
</P>
<P>
The growth of trade, restaurants and hotels was estimated to
have declined to 3.4 percent in the year to March 1998 from 3.9
percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, transport, storage and communication, which
continue to be troubled by weak infrastructure, estimatedly
dropped to 1.6 percent from 1.8 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
However, the Central Bank forecast that the gross domestic
product will rebound from the 1.9 percent in the year to March
1998 to 2.7 percent by the end of this year.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Clash with Yemen on Disputed Island Confirmed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia has confirmed
that Saudi and Yemeni troops exchanged fire on a contested red sea
island two days ago, the Kuwait News Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Interior Minister Prince Nayef Bin Abdel-Aziz said in a
news conference late Monday night that Saudi troops "opened fire
in self-defense" in a gunfire clash with a Yemeni force on the
island.
</P>
<P>
He said three Yemeni guards were killed during the clash Sunday
on Duwaima off the Yemeni coast after Yemeni troops fired on Saudi
positions and wounded a Saudi border guard.
</P>
<P>
However, Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh had charged that
Saudi troops carried out "aggressions" along the border during the
past two months.
</P>
<P>
The two neighbors on the Arabian peninsula share a
2,000-kilometer common border and have a decades-old dispute over
three Red Sea islands and parts of the desert region, where huge
oil reserves are expected, between them.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's exchange of fire continued sporadically for five hours
and left another nine guards injured before the two sides agreed
on a cease-fire later the same day.
</P>
<P>
Nayef said the Yemeni and Saudi authorities agreed on Monday to
maintain the cease-fire and instruct border committees to resolve
the dispute.
</P>
<P>
He said the bodies of the Yemeni soldiers and a Yemeni officer
falling captive will be returned. Yemen's foreign minister was
reportedly to fly to Saudi capital Riyadh later Tuesday in a bid
to ease tension.
</P>
<P>
Yemen is one of the poorest countries in the Arab world while
Saudi Arabia is one of the richest. Their border dispute has led
to clashes in the past, but both seemed reluctant to raise the
skirmishes openly.

<HEADLINE> Primakov's China Visit Step Toward Russia-China Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Russia sees a visit to Beijing by
Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov as an important step to prepare
for an informal summit between the presidents of Russia and China,
a senior official said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Foreign Minister Grigory Karasin told the Interfax news
agency that Primakov's Beijing trip, scheduled for July 22-25,
represents an important stage in the preparation for the summit
between Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Chinese President
Jiang Zemin in Moscow, in early September.
</P>
<P>
He said Primakov, who is scheduled to leave Moscow later
Tuesday, would primarily discuss with Chinese officials political
issues at bilateral and multilateral levels.
</P>
<P>
Such issues as the financial crisis in Southeast Asia and the
long-term security in the region would also be discussed, Karasin
said.
</P>
<P>
"Contacts between Moscow and Beijing in this sphere play an
important role, and the comparison of views on developments at a
regional and global level is extremely important for both
countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
After the nuclear tests in India and Pakistan, Karasin noted,
the strategic security situation in this region had worsened
seriously. "Possible courses of developments should be discussed
and the approaches of Russia and China to the questions compared,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Moscow and Beijing had acute political
differences, Karasin said: "There are no questions on which the
views of the two countries would cardinally differ."
</P>
<P>
Primakov, who is to arrive in Beijing Wednesday morning, is
also scheduled to fly to Manila, to take part in an ASEAN
ministerial conference, Interfax said.

<HEADLINE> Traffic Re-Opened in Somali Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The four main junctions linking
of the Somali capital Mogadishu opened once again Tuesday for the
traffic following the restoration of the green lines on Monday by
militiamen loyal to Hussein Hajji Bod, one of Ali Mahdi's deputy
chairmen.
</P>
<P>
Bod, who briefly spoke to reporters here, said that the
roads have been opened for the sole interest of the people.
</P>
<P>
"We did not dispatch the militiamen to block the traffic
movements in the first place," said Bod who disassociated himself
from the activities undermining the security situation along the
former green lines that divided Mogadishu in the past seven
years.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about his strength and the prospect of peace in
Mogadishu, Bod merely expressed that no one could suppress his
views regarding the on-going decisions to be made for the
formation of Mogadishu's administration and the opening of the
air and seaports.
</P>
<P>
Bod said there are currently peace negotiations continuing
between the war factions to find a lasting solution for all the
existing problems and that he is optimistic for a quick
settlement.
</P>
<P>
Contrary to the previous history of the capital, the security
situation in south Mogadishu has been much better than the part
controlled by faction leader Ali Mahdi Mohamed.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Decides to Curb Import of Luxury Items </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government has
decided to curb import of luxury items for balance of payments
purposes.
</P>
<P>
Announcing a package of measures here Tuesday at a press
conference, Finance Minister Sartaj Aziz said that a regulatory
custom duty of 100 percent is being levied on import of four-wheel
vehicles, including Pajero and Land Cruisers, and on cars above
1,800 c.c.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the initial registration fee will be increased by
200,000 rupees (46 rupees to one U.S. dollar) on Mercedes Benz,
BMW and other luxury vehicles up to 2,000 c.c. and 400,000 rupees
on such vehicles beyond 2,000 c.c.
</P>
<P>
The initial registration fee for vehicles with engine capacity
of 2,500 c.c. or above will be 300,000 rupees.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the finance minister also announced measures to
prevent the flight of capital.
</P>
<P>
"It is unfortunate that at this critical time some people have
been working against the national interests and sending the scarce
foreign exchange abroad," Aziz noted.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot allow this practice to continue," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said that restrictions are being imposed, until further
orders, on carrying abroad more than 10,000 dollars without prior
written approval of the Sate Bank of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
All unlicensed money changers are being asked to register with
the State Bank of Pakistan within one month. They will then be
granted licenses provided they meet the criteria of the bank.
</P>
<P>
Aziz believed that the steps, which are being taken, will
stabilize the exchange market, boost exports and remittances and
curb non-essential imports.
</P>
<P>
"Success in this area is crucial if we are to meet the
challenge of sanctions, while preventing any disruption of
economic activity within the country and avoiding inflation in the
prices of essential commodities," he said.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Unveils Economic Package to Counter Impact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government
announced Tuesday a comprehensive package of measures to counter
the impact of sanctions imposed by the international community due
to the detonation of nuclear devices.
</P>
<P>
The package announced here by Finance Minister Sartaj Aziz at a
press conference was aimed at stabilizing the exchange market,
boosting exports and remittances, restricting non-essential
imports and preventing flight of capital to offset the impact of
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Aziz announced the launching of U.S. dollar bonds with
attractive interest rates coupled with new facilities offered to
both the resident and non-resident foreign currency accounts
holders
</P>
<P>
New foreign exchange regime has been introduced to boost
exports, restrict non-essential imports and divert and increase
remittances through the banking system.
</P>
<P>
As part of the incentives for exporters, a fast track procedure
for payment of refund has been developed through which most
exporters would receive their refunds within seven days.
</P>
<P>
To curb luxury imports, the minister announced a regulatory
custom duty of 100 percent, besides increasing registration fees
for vehicles above 1,800 c.c.
</P>
<P>
The government also announced a limit of 10,000 dollars for
carrying abroad as part of the efforts to stop capital flight and
a prior approval of the State Bank of Pakistan will be needed for
any amount exceeding the limit.
</P>
<P>
"Just as we acted on the May 28 (when Pakistan detonated
nuclear devices) to protect our geo-political security, we must
act now to assure our economic security, without which our
geo-political security cannot be sustained," Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We are ready to pay the price for our security."
</P>
<P>
Aziz made it clear that the recent deterioration in Pakistan's
economic situation was due to the extension of sanctions to the
international financial institutions which was not applicable to
them earlier.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Severe droughts are raging through
the northern and central parts of Vietnam, drying out reservoirs
and threatening the summer and fall harvest from tens of thousands
of hectares of rice crops.
</P>
<P>
A total of 23,000 hectares of summer-autumn rice fields in the
three central provinces of Ha Tinh, Quang Binh and Quang Tri which

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
President Yasser Arafat arrived here Tuesday for talks on the
latest developments of the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is expected to brief Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on
the first high-level direct talks in months between the PNA and
Israel.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming meeting is part of continued coordination and
consultation between the two leaders, who have been seeking ways
to break the deadlock in the peace process caused by Israel's
building a Jewish settlement in East Jerusalem in March last year
and its overdue troop pullback from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Chief Palestinian negotiator Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai on Sunday held a three-hour meeting on
contentious issues blocking the pullout.
</P>
<P>
But Palestinian officials said on Monday that no progress was
made at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The United States has reportedly called on Israel to withdraw
from another 13.1 percent of the West Bank in second redeployment
as required by the Oslo accords. The Palestinians have accepted
the proposal, but Israel resisted it.
</P>
<P>
Israeli right-wing extremists insisted that the proposed scope
of withdrawal will endanger its security interests and no more
than 9 percent should be handed over to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The PNA has full or civil control over 27 percent of the West
Bank and the Gaza Strip.

CAIRO, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
President Yasser Arafat Tuesday briefed Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak on the first direct Palestinian-Israeli talks in months
over Israeli redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Arafat arrived here earlier Tuesday as his deputy Mahmoud Abbas
and Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai completed two days
of talks, the Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
But the agency gave no details of the Arafat-Mubarak talks.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has proposed a 13 percent more Israeli troop
withdrawal from the West Bank. The Palestinians have accepted the
formula, but Israel rejected it, citing security reasons.
</P>
<P>
At the request of Washington, the two sides resumed the first
direct talks Sunday after 16 months of stalemate.
</P>
<P>
Little progress was reportedly made in the first two rounds of
talks Sunday and Monday. A third round is scheduled to be held
later Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, a key Palestinian ally, has kept a close watch on the
development in the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Cairo has been pushing for an international
conference to revive the Mideast peace process. The proposal was
made in an Egyptian-French initiative put forward in May.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, who will visit Paris next
week to discuss details of the initiative with his French
counterpart, has said the initiative dovetails the U.S. proposal
on Israeli withdrawal.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Workers Determined to Stage Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Two Korean workers' organizations
announced on Tuesday decisions for 650,000 workers to go on strike
on Wednesday, despite a government warning of tough action.
</P>
<P>
The Korean Metal Workers' Federation said its members will
strike to protest mass layoffs.
</P>
<P>
"A general strike is inevitable unless the government accepts
our demands," a federation spokesman told a press conference here.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said 50,000 workers of the federation will begin
a general strike after a mass rally in front of the Seoul Station
Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The federation, which includes the labor union of Hyundai Motor
Co. and other major manufacturers, urged the government to put an
end to layoffs and prevent illegal labor practices by employers.
</P>
<P>
It will be the second strike by the federation within a week.
Members of the federation across the nation downed tools last
Tuesday and Wednesday, calling for an end to mass layoffs.
</P>
<P>
The Korean Confederation of Trade Unions (KCTU), reaffirmed its
plan to stage an indefinite general strike from Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Our 600,000 member workers have no choice but to strike and
fight if the government rejects our call for an end to forced
restructuring of the economy," said the confederation.
</P>
<P>
The government, which has called the strikes as illegal, said
it will take stern action against union leaders and strikers.
</P>
<P>
A manhunt is still underway for 83 union leaders who, police
say, masterminded last week's strikes.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean parliament legalized the mass layoffs last
April after a tripartite commission of the government, management
and labor unions reached an agreement on the layoffs.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement signed last December with the International
Monetary Fund for a rescue loan of 57 billion U.S. dollars, South
Korea has to restructure its economy, open its markets and shut
down ailing financial institutions and companies this year.

In an interview with Xinhua, Stiglitz said that the role
of China in Asia and the world is very important, and China's
effort in keeping the exchange rate of the yuan RMB stable has
helped stablize the economy of the Asian region.
</P>
<P>
"I think the actions taken by the Chinese government are going
to be very supportive to the overall stability of the region," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Asian financial crisis which began last July has lasted
longer and has been deeper than most people expected, he
noted. The depth of the downturn in the region's economy is very
severe, and most people are now forecasting a relatively slow
recovery in the region.
</P>
<P>
He also said that China has recognized the consequences of the
Southeast Asian financial crisis and has committed itself to
compensating for weak exports by increasing domestic demand, which
is very important.
</P>
<P>
However, he acknowledged that it often takes a while for
economic policies to have actual effects, as monetary policy
usually has a lag of between six to 18 months.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that at this junction the most important
thing is to maintain a strong economy, and that is what is
happening in China. Chinese financial authorities understand the
nature of the financial problems and are very committed to
addressing them.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he expressed his full confidence about the long-run
prospects for the Asian economy, saying that the fundamentals of
the Asian economy remain strong, which in the long run will ensure
a high level of growth.
</P>
<P>
Western economies have had periodic recessions every four to
six years, while many Asian countries have enjoyed economic growth
for two to three decades, therefore one should not be too upset by
an episode of recession, he said.
</P>
<P>
Stiglitz, who began his China visit on July 19, will leave on
July 25.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Egyptian newspapers on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Al-Ahram:
</P>
<P>
-- The Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President Yasser
Arafat is due in Cairo Tuesday to brief Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak on the outcome of the Palestinian-Israeli meetings Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The meetings between Arafat's deputy Manmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen)
and Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, the first direct

</P>
<P>
Al-Akhbar:
</P>
<P>
-- The coffin of Nkaw-Isi-Isi, ruler of upper Egypt in the era
of Titi I, King of the sixth dynasty 4,500 years ago, has been
discovered.
</P>
<P>
A joint team, grouping experts from the Suez Canal University
and the Australian University of Maccury have found the coffin of
the ruler recently, 14 years after the discovery of his tomb in
1984.
</P>
<P>
Al Gomhuria:
</P>
<P>
-- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said Monday that the
Egyptian-French initiative for an international conference on the
stalled Middle East peace process dovetails with the U.S. proposal
calling for a 13 percent Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Moussa will visit Paris next week to discuss with his French
counterpart details of the initiative, which was put forward in
May.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Gazette:
</P>
<P>
-- The Environment Affairs Agency has completed an
environment-friendly atlas containing information and guidelines

part of a project seeking to manage the Red Sea coastal
resources.

<HEADLINE> Bomb Kills 1 SLA, Wounds 2 in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 21 (Xinhua) -- A member of the Israeli-allied
South Lebanon Army (SLA) was killed and two others wounded in
Tuesday by a roadside bomb, the National Broadcast Network radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
The bomb was detonated by anti-Israeli guerrillas when a SLA
armored personnel carrier was patrolling near the town of Jezzine,
in Israeli occupied south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In Beirut, the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God,
claimed responsibility for the attack, saying at least four SLA
members were killed or wounded.
</P>
<P>
In retaliation, Israeli warplanes raided villages in the Iqlim
al Toufah area, a Hezbollah stronghold on the edge of the occupied
zone. There is no immediate report of casualties.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a 1,200-square-kilometer self-styled security
zone in south Lebanon in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting
its north from Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then the 1,500 Israeli occupying troops and the
2,500-member SLA have been locked in a war of attrition there with
Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by Hezbollah.

<HEADLINE> Iran Blames Iraq Over POW Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Head of the Iranian Commission
for Prisoners of War (POWs) Abdollah Najafi on Tuesday blamed
Iraq for lacking sincerity in solving the POW issue.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has not given accounts of the fate of 3,738 Iranian POWs
who Iran holds firm evidence to show that they were captured
by the Iraqi forces during the 1980-88 war, the official news
agency IRNA quoted Najafi as saying.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has said that a number of Iranian POWs have died and some
others are unwilling to return home. But Najafi said that Iran
would not accept the Iraqi claim unless the International
Committee of Red Cross confirms it.
</P>
<P>
He expressed dismay over the slow pace of implementing the
accord between the two countries on the POW issue, criticizing
Iraq for failing to fully honor its commitments.
</P>
<P>
"If the trend continues, we will not reach a desirable
result," he said.
</P>
<P>
Najafi's remarks seemed to contradict his earlier statement
Friday that the names listed as POWs of the two countries had
become clear in the recent talks between Iranian and Iraqi
officials. He expected the POW issue to be fully clarified within
the next few months.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister for Arab-African affairs Seyed
Mohammad Sadr also said Saturday that Tehran and Baghdad would
finally settle the POW issue within six months and all Iranian
POWs would return home under a timetable to be set by the sides.
</P>
<P>
During the past eight years, Iran has exchanged 54,776 Iraqi
POWs for 39,364 Iranian detainees. But it is still unclear how
many Iranian and Iraqi POWs are still held by the other side.

<HEADLINE> Middle East Economic Briefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
DUBAI -- Gold imports of Dubai fell to 244 tonnes in the first
half of this year, down 20 percent from 307.8 tons in the same
period last year, the Arabic daily Al Hayat reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The drop in Dubai's gold imports was attributed to the decline
of consumption by Indian markets, one of the world's biggest
consuming markets of this precious metal.
</P>
<P>
Dubai is considered the world's biggest trading center of gold
ingots.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- The profits of the Gulf Airways during the first
half of this year will reach 25 million U.S. dollars from 10
million in the same period last year, the United Arab Emirates
Newspaper Al Itihad reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The company's Executive President for Financial and Strategy
Affairs of Walter Van West was quoted as saying that the company
anticipated the doubling of operation profits this year.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that the company would purchase six Airbus planes
equipped with the latest technology at a cost of 600 million
dollars. The new planes will join the operating fleet in mid-1999,
in anticipation of the company's new plans for the coming century.
</P>
<P>
The Gulf Airways earned 48 million dollars in profits in the
past year.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Three Egyptian-Chinese joint ventures, with an
investment of 5 million U.S. dollars, will be established in the
Port Said free zone to produce recorder cassettes, measurement sets
and plastic products, the Arabic Al Akhbar reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the Egyptian Petroleum Authority has
decided to offer nine new areas in northern Sinai and the Suez
Gulf to world companies for oil prospection. October 29 has been
set as the deadline for tenders.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The price of Egyptian car spare parts will decline in
the next two months due to rising imports and abundant supply.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Egyptian Federation of Chambers of Commerce
attributed the price drop partially to the fact that spare parts
ordered from Japan, Taiwan and Malaysia will arrive in Egypt in
succession as of mid-August.
</P>
<P>
The trade volume of car spare parts in Egypt is estimated at
over 200 million Egyptian pounds (58.8 million dollars) annually.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- The handling capacity of Saudi local trading and
industrial harbors, excluding that of crude oil, has surpassed 44
million tonnes in the first half of this year, up 10 percent over
the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
A recent statement released by the General Authority for Saudi
Arabian harbors in Riyadh showed that exports constituted 70
percent of the total handling capacity, and imports 30 percent.

PARIS, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The French Football Federation (FFF) said

FFF had planned to name a new coach last week and then on Friday said the

But FFF officials decided they need more time and will likely make the
appointment Monday, said FFF spokesman Romain Laisne.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Supports Arab Summit With Clear Goals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General Esmat
Abdel Meguid Tuesday expressed support to Egypt's stance that an
Arab summit should be convened with well-defined objectives to
rescue the faltering peace process.
</P>
<P>
"The league backs President Hosni Mubarak's assertion that an
Arab summit should be capable of adopting effective and
influential decisions," he spoke from Vienna in a telephone
interview with the Cairo-based Voice of Arabs Radio.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak Monday renewed his support for holding an expanded Arab
summit on the ailing Mideast peace process, which has been
demanded by the Palestinians for months. But he stressed that good
preparation was needed to clearly define the summit's goals in
order to come up with strong resolutions.
</P>
<P>
A string of coordination talks on the timing, venue and agenda
of the summit were held in Arab capitals in June, but so far there
is no indication that the summit is upcoming.
</P>
<P>
Meguid noted that there had been an international response to
the Arab wish to salvage the peace march.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that his ongoing European tour, which started
Monday and will also take him to Austria and Poland, highlighted
the Arab wish to promote the Euro-Arab relations in various fields.
</P>
<P>
He said he would discuss with Austrian and Polish officials the
feasibility of giving a push to the peace process based on the
Egyptian-French initiative.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace talks have been stalled for 16
months over Israel's construction of a new settlement in Arab East
Jerusalem and its long-delayed withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Upset by the prolonged deadlock due to Israel's intransigence,
Egypt and France called in May for convening an international
conference to save the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Cautious optimism has surfaced in the past days after Israel
and the Palestinian side resumed their direct talks Sunday night
in an effort to clinch a deal on the overdue redeployment and
other issues.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Says Israeli Demands Unrealistic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
said Tuesday that nothing new has come out of the recent
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks as Israel was expecting an
impossible compromise from the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"Apparently nothing new has so far been offered by the Israelis
to the Palestinians during their recent talks," the top Egyptian
diplomat told reporters here.
</P>
<P>
In statements following the talks between Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak and Palestinian National Authority President Yasser
Arafat held earlier in the day, Moussa said that Arafat briefed
Mubarak on the outcome of Israeli-Palestinian talks held this week
in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
Among the key issues discussed was the U.S. initiative calling
for an additional 13 percent Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank
in the second stage of further redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Arafat was not optimistic since the Israelis offered nothing
new to the Palestinians during the talks, Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
"Palestinians so far have accepted the U.S. initiative while
the Israelis rejected it. The Israelis expect concessions the
Palestinians will not give," he added.
</P>
<P>
On his visit to France next Monday, Moussa said he and the
French officials would study means to activate the Egyptian-French
initiative that calls for an international conference to salvage
the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
"In case the peace process should come to a full stop and face
absolute failure, the international community should know the
whole issue and the reasons behind this failure," he said.
</P>
<P>
As the 16-month deadlock in the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks
drags on, Egypt is expecting the Franco-Egyptian initiative to
work in a way that "dovetails" the U.S. plan.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said the U.S. has no objection to the Egyptian-French
initiative which only needs "more polishing" that could be
completed during his forthcoming visit to France.
</P>
<P>
He also dismissed as "incorrect" the speculation about a
possible U.S. withdrawal from the whole process, saying that
Washington would continue to play its role to achieve the success
of the peace march.

PARIS, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The drugs scandal hitting the Tour de France took
another turn on Tuesday when the Festina team manager allegedly ordered his
riders to contribute to a fund for illegal substances.
</P>
<P>
The team doctor Eric Ryckaert claimed that the riders were obliged to put
part of their win bonuses into a `black box' fund to buy banned substances.
</P>
<P>
Team manager Bruno Roussel was in charge of the system and riders decided
what substances they wanted to take, Arsene Ryckaert said.
</P>
<P>
The drug scandal has rocked the Tour de France since customs officers found
illegal substances in the car of the physiotherapist of Festina's top rider
Richard Virenque.
</P>
<P>
The Festina team was thrown out of the race Saturday and police in the
northern city of Lille are holding Ryckaert and Roussel.

<HEADLINE> Kiriyenko Sees IMF Loan As Government Victory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Sergei
Kiriyenko on Tuesday said the stabilization loan of 11.2 billion
U.S. dollars from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) was an
indisputable victory for his cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Kiriyenko told a press conference that the loan approval by the
IMF came after the Russian government had made up for the
rejection by the State Duma, the lower house of Russian
parliament, of several stabilization bills.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet's program paved the way for the approval of the
loan, he said.
</P>
<P>
The IMF Board of Directors decided Monday to appropriate a new
package of 11.2 billion dollars of aid to Russia, but the first
tranche Moscow can receive immediately was slashed to 4.8 billion
dollars, instead of the expected 5.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
News of the cut hit the Russian stock market, with Tuesday's
prices of blue chips slipping three to five percent in the Russian
Trading System.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the shortfall of 80 million dollars, Kiriyenko
said successful implementation of the program to exchange
government treasury bills for Eurobonds would allow the government
to offset the decrease.
</P>
<P>
He expressed satisfaction that the overall size of the
stabilization loan, 11.2 billion dollars, was not reduced.

<HEADLINE> Akayev Can Run For Third Term, Says Constitutional Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Kyrgyz President Askar Akayevich
Akayev will be eligible to run for re-election in 2000, the
Kazakhstan Pravda daily reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Kyrgyzstan's Constitutional Court returned a verdict recently,
legalizing Akayev's campaign for another term of presidency, said
the report.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the year, some parliamentarians of Kyrgyzstan issued
a statement opposing Akayev's campaign for re-election.
</P>
<P>
They held that the Constitution barred one from being president
for more than two consecutive terms, so Akayev, who was elected as
president in 1990 and again in 1995, could not run for another
term.
</P>
<P>
But other parliamentarians and supporters of Akayev argued that
1995-2000 should be Akayev's first presidential term because the
1990 presidential election was held under the old Constitution,
which was approved in the former Soviet era and expired in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The verdict by the Constitutional Court has been widely
welcomed in Kyrgyzstan because many people hope that the reform
process can continue in Kyrgyzstan if Akayev is re-elected.

<P>
The figures also showed that tourist arrivals in June dropped
by 19.8 percent from the same month last year.
</P>
<P>
According to STB's outlining review on the performance in June
in comparison with a year ago, visitors from Indonesia,
Singapore's largest visitor-generating market, declined by some 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
Visitors from Japan, another Singapore's largest tourism
market, registered a loss of some 26 percent because of the
sluggish economic conditions in that country.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia, the third largest source of visitors, saw a sharp
drop of about 26 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, visitors from Hong Kong grew by over nine percent due
to competitive packages offered by some airline companies during
the month, the STB said.
</P>
<P>
The STB said the continued decline in tourist arrivals from
ASEAN countries was prompted by their domestic economic
difficulties.

of Kazakhstan celebrated her return to the track by taking the
women's 100-meter hurdles title at the Asian Athletic

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 21 (Xinhua) -- A national teleconference was held

</P>
<P>
The enterprises included the Handan Steel Group Co. Ltd., the
Zhenhai Oil Refinery And Chemical Shareholding Co. Ltd., the
Yanzhou Mining (Group) Co. Ltd., and the Daqing Petroleum
Administration.
</P>

goals.
</P>
<P>
According to Li, China in the first half of the year increased

foreign capital; further readjusted economic structure to promote
steady growth in industrial and agricultural production; and
pushed forwards economic reform by adopting a number of major
reform measures.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier outlined the tasks for the second half of the
year. They include further expanding domestic demand by adopting
a more active financial policy; stepping up efforts to build
infrastructure; carefully handling the issue of state factory
layoffs and re-employment; deepening the reform in the grain
circulation system and bolstering the steady and sustained growth
of agriculture; pushing forwards enterprise reform and development
for the stable growth of industrial production; stepping up
efforts in taxation and improving financial services; trying to
boost exports and imports and making greater efforts to introduce
more overseas capital; cracking down on smuggling activities;
making every effort to increase the domestic demands for consumer
goods; and furthering in anti-flood efforts.

<P>
Li stressed that the key to fulfilling the tasks for the second
half of the year is the implementation of all the policies and
measures of the central government as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The conference was presided over by Vice-Premier Wu
Bangguo. Also present were Vice-Premier Wen Jiabao, State
Councilor Luo Gan, and leading officials from central government

<HEADLINE> Lebanese National Carrier to Form Alliance with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's national carrier, the
Middle East Airlines (MEA), is expected to form an alliance with
its French counterpart Air France next month, the Daily Star
newspaper reported here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The alliance will be signed in Beirut next month and the deal
will come into effect in April next year," Mohammed Hout, MEA's
chairman said in an interview with the paper.
</P>
<P>
He said if the overall cooperation succeeds, MEA passengers
would be able to book from Beirut into the Air France network of
more than 100 destinations.
</P>
<P>
In particular, the alliance will increase accessibilities to
and from the United States and South America.
</P>
<P>
Another significant feature of the deal will see MEA
passengers who will be able to participate in a frequent flyer
program by joining the one run by Air France and several of its
partner airlines around the world.
</P>
<P>
In return, Hout said, Air France passengers will benefit from
MEA's strength in the region as the MEA's routes to Kuwait and the
Far East would be attractive to Air France passengers.
</P>
<P>
"Some of the biggest airlines in the world have formed
partnerships with each other," the chairman said, "If we want
Beirut to become a regional hub, we have to make it possible for
passengers to connect around the world."
</P>
<P>
Until two years ago Air France had a 25 percent stake in MEA,
which is now owned by Lebanon's central bank.
</P>
<P>
Hout has been given three years to turn the airlines around
from its disastrous recent past which includes a loss of 100
million U.S. dollars in the last fiscal year.

<HEADLINE> Internet Society Conference Opens in Geneva </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The eighth annual meeting of the
Internet Society (ISOC) conference, known as the Internet summit
in the industry, began here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
One of the major issues at the conference will be the future of
the Internet's domain naming system, said the U.S.-based ISOC, the
organizer of the event on July 21-24.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from more than 120 countries and regions are
expected to discuss the next major steps to assist the Internet
Assigned Names Authority (IANA) in defining and developing a
non-profit corporation.
</P>
<P>
ISOC expects that about 4,000 stake-holders, policy makers and
Internet leaders around the world will be attending the conference.
</P>
<P>
The Network Training Workshops of ISOC, held annually since
1993, have helped some developing countries in Asia, the former
Soviet Union and more than 20 African countries to set up Internet
connections and to have individuals trained in the technical and
operational aspects of establishing and managing network system.
</P>
<P>
Another training system of ISOC, named "Hands-on", will be
given to professionals who will play a vital role in establishing
the Internet's presence in their countries or facilitating the
efforts of schools, government organizations, firms, and residents
to learn about and exploit Internet services.
</P>
<P>
As the conference is not a purely technical one, 11 tutorials
will be set up to help visitors understand the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The Internet Society is a U.S.-based non-profit international
organization. Since 1992, it has served as the international
organization for global coordination and cooperation on the
Internet, promoting and maintaining a broad spectrum of activities
focused on the Internet's development, availability and associated
technologies.
</P>
<P>
The first Internet Society Conference was held in 1991, when an
estimated four million people had access to the Internet. By 1997,
the number has risen to 57 million.

<HEADLINE> China, U.S to Cooperate on Energy-Saving Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Ministry of Science
and Technology and the U.S. Department of Energy have agreed to
cooperate on a commercial building which will showcase
energy-saving technologies, sources said.
</P>
<P>
China's Science and Technology Vice-Minister Deng Nan and
U.S. Ambassador to China James Sasser signed the Statement of Work
recently to explore designs for a medium-sized commercial office
building in downtown Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The building, if constructed, would develop energy efficient
design criteria and serve as a center for research on energy
efficiency and renewable energy technologies.
</P>
<P>
According to Lu Xuedu, an official of the Science and
Technology Ministry, this is the first time China and the United
States have begun practical cooperation under the obligation of
the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.
</P>
<P>
The framework convention stipulates that developed countries
are required to reduce their "greenhouse" gas emissions. It also
provides for developing countries to obtain help with technologies
and funding to increase energy efficiency and reduce emissions.
</P>
<P>
China has already started to cooperate with Japan and Norway in
this field. Cooperation includes the three-billion-yen coke
project between the Capital Steel Group and Japan, an iron alloy
project and a dust-burning project, both with Japan, and the
themopower project between Shangqiu city in Henan Province and
Norway.
</P>
<P>
Lu said the energy-efficient building demonstration project,
with the United States providing designs and technologies, sets an
example for bilateral cooperation under the Framework Convention,
and helps build communication and trust between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
The commercial building, including a laboratory for
demonstrating energy efficiency, would also serve as the office
for China's Agenda 21 agency, a national effort to pursue
sustainable development.

<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, July 21 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Secretary
General Kofi Annan has urged Cambodians to vote freely according
to their own consciences in the July 26 general elections.
</P>
<P>
The message, sent last Friday to Cambodia, was broadcast
Tuesday evening by Cambodia's National Television TVK to the whole
nation.
</P>
<P>
The message will strengthen the voice of King Norodom Sihanouk,
whose appeal for a free vote has been frequently broadcast by
television and radio.
</P>
<P>
Expressing confidence in the secrecy of the voting, Annan said
Cambodians had the full support of the United Nations and the
international community in exercising their most important
political right.
</P>
<P>
In an earlier statement, Annan stressed: "The United Nations
remains committed to rendering all possible assistance to Cambodia
in its task of holding free and fair elections on July 26, 1998."
</P>
<P>
Annan said he still had some concerns about the election
process and called on all parties and candidates to conduct their
campaigns in a peaceful, democratic and mutually respectful manner
under the Cambodian Constitution and laws.

<HEADLINE> Navigation on Yangtze River to Resume Tomorrow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YICHANG, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The temporary shiplock of Three
Gorges Dam Project is scheduled to resume operation at eight
o'clock tomorrow after being shut down because of recent heavy
floods.
</P>
<P>
"If the water level on the river does not rise tonight, the
shiplock is expected to reopen tomorrow morning," said Zhang
Qingsong, director of the Yangtze Navigation Administration Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said the shiplock is ready to resume operation since the
water flow through the Three Gorges Dam Project has now dropped to
44,500 cubic meters per second. The shiplock was closed after the
water flow rose to 45,000 cubic meters per second several days ago.
</P>
<P>
More than 980 passenger ships were stranded at Yichang, and all
150,000 passengers on board were moved to safety.
</P>
<P>
However, Zhang said, the river canal at the Three Gorges Dam
will not be opened until the water flow drops below 40,000 cubic
meters per second.
</P>
<P>
According to weather forecasts, heavy rains might fall at the
upper reaches of Yangtze River in the next few days, and the
Three Gorges Dam may have to suspend navigation for a third time
if the water level hits 45,000 cubic meters again, Zhang added.
</P>
<P>
The third peak flood passed through the site of the Three
Gorges Dam Project in the early morning of July 18, and the water
flow remained above 53,000 cubic meters per second for two
consecutive days.
</P>
<P>
The water level began to drop slowly on July 21, and stood at
44,500 cubic meters per second at 6:00 p.m. today.

<HEADLINE> Crooked Parliamentary Candidates to Be Punished </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 21 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim Dae-jung
said that parliamentary candidates who engaged in vote-buying and
smear campaigns in Tuesday's one re-election and six by-elections
will be punished by law.
</P>
<P>
"It has yet to be ascertained, but it seems that there have
been such cases," Kim said on Tuesday in response to media reports
that some candidates had tried to buy votes.
</P>
<P>
"Those engaged in any illegal and illegitimate election
activities will face stern legal action by prosecutors and the
police," the president told reporters after he cast his ballot for
the by-election in Chongno district.
</P>
<P>
Chongno is one of the seven districts which began polling to
fill National Assembly (parliament) seats vacated by members
convicted of crimes, and those who had died or resigned to run in
local elections.
</P>
<P>
Television stations here have predicted that the ruling
coalition, composed of the National Congress for New Politics and
United Liberal Democrats, will win four out of the seven districts.
</P>
<P>
By 5:00 p.m., a low voter turnout of 36.2 percent was
registered, which was blamed on public indifference caused by the
current financial crisis, TV reports said.
</P>
<P>
The final result of the elections, which will come out late
Tuesday night, will determine whether or not the opposition Grand
National Party, now with 147 seats in the 299-member parliament,
can retain its majority status.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Not to Change Free Trade Area Schedule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The nine members of the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) are not keen on scaling down
the completion of their ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) commitments,
ASEAN Director General Rodolfo Severino said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Members have reaffirmed again and again that the commitment to
AFTA's schedule remains," Severino told reporters. "The only
debate is how much to accelerate the completion of AFTA and in
what way."
</P>
<P>
Severino said that ASEAN leaders and ministers are in fact
exploring the possibility of moving more products from the
temporary exclusion list to the inclusion list whose tariffs will
be lowered.
</P>
<P>
"They have also addressed the questions of making trade easier
through measures such as harmonization of customs laws and
procedures and tariff rates, and computerization," he said.
</P>
<P>
Amid high inflation rates and negative growths caused by the
lingering currency crisis, he said, ASEAN leaders have agreed to
aggressively implement measures deemed to be crucial at ending the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
These include the call for ASEAN major markets to open their
markets wider to ASEAN products; strengthening of regional
economic integration; the establishment of surveillance mechanism
which reflects movement of capital and macroeconomic indicators;
and the use of ASEAN currencies for intra-ASEAN trade.
</P>
<P>
"We should not expect, however, that these measures would
result in overnight recovery," Severino said. "But economic
recovery would be possible in two to three years."
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN Standing Committee (ASC) and the ASEAN Senior
Officials Meeting (SOM) opened here separately Tuesday to prepare
for the ASEAN Ministerial Meeting and its related meetings. Both
ASC and SOM will end Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> E. African Union Aims to Benefit People: Ugandan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
explained that the East African Union should be one of the people
instead of one of the government or the leaders, because it is
aimed to benefit people.
</P>
<P>
He made the explanation of the union he put forth at last
week's national conference of the National Resistance Movement,
at a press conference in State House, Nakasero Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
He said that the union should provide freedom of movement and
employment for the people. Within the union, people of any of the
member countries can travel to neighboring states without
passports and they can do business there, he added.
</P>
<P>
The true meaning of union lies in free communication and real
integration in both political and economic fields, he said.
</P>
<P>
Museveni said economic integration in the region has already
begun because there are already many kinds of cooperation in the
economic sector.
</P>
<P>
He put forth the notion of the union when analysing the causes
of backwardness of Africa at the national conference of the
ruling National Resistance Movement. He said one of main things
responsible for the backwardness is political fragmentation.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the states in the region and even in the whole
continent should be united politically and economically. This is
the only way "for a state to avoid subjugation and heavy
dependence on others," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The European Union is a good example for Africans to follow,
he told the conference delegates.
</P>
<P>
In Uganda, he suggested that tribalism or the notion of clan
should not be so stressed as previously. Union can produce
independence, and independence can eventually to promote economic
development.

<HEADLINE> China's Water Crisis Blamed On Waste and Pollution (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists say that
wasted resources and pollution are the major causes of China's
water shortage and that it may become a major crisis by the
mid-21st century.
</P>
<P>
Many Chinese still believe that water supply in their country
is inexhaustible and do not try to find ways to improve water use,
according to Chen Mengxiong, of the Chinese Academy of Sciences
(CAS).
</P>
<P>
China has more than 2,800 billion cu.m. of water, but with only
a per-capita share of 2,700 cu.m., a fourth of the world's
average, and even though theirs is a water deficient country,
people still squander water resources and water pollution is
getting worse, Chen told an international symposium on water in
Changchun, the capital of northeast China's Jilin Province, last
week.
</P>
<P>
About 70 percent of the water used for irrigation, or half of
the country's total water consumption, has been wasted because of
a low utilization rate, he said, and a fifth of China's rivers are
polluted to varying extent, and 5 percent of them have serious
pollution.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that some 70 percent of China's fresh water
may not be available for direct use by the beginning of the next
century because of grave pollution from waste water discharge, and
that at least 300 cities are suffering from water shortages, and
approximately 20 million ha. of arable land is hit by dry spells
each year.
</P>
<P>
Ground subsidence and seawater are becoming problems becuse of
the over-use of groundwater in some coastal cities like Shanghai
and Tianjin, Chen said.

major goals of the Philippine government led by President Joseph
Estrada, Agriculture Secretary William Dar said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Dar said that strategic agricultural and fishery programs
should be implemented to materialize this goal, which Estrada has
promised to the people.
</P>
<P>
Dar said these programs should ensure food security and provide
livelihood opportunities particularly to the small, marginal
farmers and fisher folk.
</P>
<P>
Such programs include the putting up of new irrigation systems
in additional 600,000 hectares of agricultural land.
</P>
<P>
Dar said that at present, out of the 1.4 million hectares of
irrigated farmland in the country, only 20 percent or around
270,000 hectares are in Mindanao, the Philippines' second-largest
island.
</P>
<P>
More irrigation projects should be built in Mindanao which has
an irrigable area of 960,000 hectares, he said.
</P>
<P>
"While we are pursuing big irrigation projects, preferably
under build-operate-transfer schemes, we will also focus on
cost-efficient, high impact small irrigation systems, tapping vast
shallow underground sources," he said.
</P>
<P>
Field surveys show that an additional 1.6 million hectares of
farmland can be irrigated across the country through small systems
such as impoundments, reservoirs and shallow tube wells.
</P>
<P>
Poor agriculture infrastructures including irrigation systems
have hindered the development of the country's agriculture
industry and its rural areas, home to two-thirds of its 70 million
population.
</P>
<P>
Because of its backward agriculture, the Philippines has to
import millions of tons of rice to ease food shortage in the
country. Nearly 1.3 million tons of rice have been imported by the
country this year.

<HEADLINE> China's Water Crisis Blamed on Waste and Pollution (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In northwestern China, which has half of the country's land,
arable land has become increasingly desertified and sandstorms
have become more frequent because of improper use of water
resources.
</P>
<P>
And in the Southwest and North, karst formations can be an
important source of water for many cities, but people have to
attach importance to ground subsidence caused by the excessive use
of water.
</P>
<P>
Lin Xueyu, of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), told the
symposium that saving water can be a more effective and economical
way of solving water shortage than water diversion projects,
which are expected to compensate for the irregular distribution of
water resources. She said that diverting water from one area to
another may benefit some areas for a short period of time, but the
ecological damaged will have serious side effects.
</P>
<P>
The two academics have asked the central government to pay more
attention to developing subterranean water instead of surface
water, because it is the major water resource in many cities and
is less likely to be polluted.
</P>
<P>
China should try to build a nationwide water monitoring system
to provide accurate data for the healthy development of water
resources and should increase pollution controls, one Finnish
scientist suggested.

JAKARTA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's House of
Representatives' (DPR) Commission on Foreign Affairs approved a
bill on the anti-torture convention here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The bill was approved by all factions of the commission during
its third working meeting.
</P>
<P>
Now, the House commission will present the bill at the House
during its plenary meeting on July 24 for passing into a law.
</P>
<P>
After chairing the meeting, the House commission's chief Aisyah
Amini told reporters that it was the first time in more than 30
years for the DPR to use its right to propose a bill.
</P>
<P>
"The bill was proposed at the initiative of the DPR. This is a
record for the legislative body," she said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas told the meeting that
the passing of the bill on the anti-torture convention into a law
would be a historical event for the country not only because of
its content, but also because it was done at the initiative of the
DPR.
</P>
<P>
The convention is part of a series of international conventions
on human rights.
</P>
<P>
"We still have the task of preparing a convention on
anti-racial discrimination which is also part of the international
convention on human rights," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The official approval of the convention at the (DPR) plenary
meeting will be an initial step. But the most important thing is
that the government, the people and all agencies will implement
the convention," Alatas added.

<HEADLINE> 1.7 Million Cataract Sufferers Hope to Regain Sight by 2001 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, July 21 (Xinhua) -- More than 340,000 cataract
sufferers have regained sight since the SightFirst China Action
was launched last year and health officials have pledged to cure
1.7 million people by the year 2001.
</P>
<P>
According to Sun Jinzhong, an official with the Chinese
Disabled Persons Federation (CDPF) who is in charge of the project,
China has received 15 million U.S. dollars in aid from the Lions
Clubs which is co-sponsoring the action along with the CDPF and the
Ministry of Health.
</P>
<P>
China has some four million cataract patients and the number is
growing by 400,000 a year. Most patients are in financial straits
because of their poor vision, and they live mostly in
poverty-stricken rural areas.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony held today for the SightFirst China
Action hospital in Liaoning Province in north China, Sun said
China plans to send 250 medical teams to poor and remote areas and
provide operations for cataract sufferers over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
The medical teams will also run training courses in those areas
to ensure that the sufferers get proper and professional care from
local medical networks.
</P>
<P>
The SightFirst China Action helps cataract patients recover
their sight by replacing the diseased crystalline lens. This
method has had a high success rate and is relatively inexpensive.
</P>
<P>
Sun said China used to carry out some 50,000 cataract
operations a year. But last year 348,000 such procedures were
performed, costing just over 2,000 yuan each (about 250
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
He said more hospitals will be designated as SightFirst China
Action facilities, and the cost of surgery is expected to drop to
around 1,200 yuan for each case (about 150 U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Commonwealth Welcomes Nigeria's New Transition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Commonwealth Secretary-General
Emeka Anayoku has expressed welcome to the further release of
political prisoners and the new transition program announced by
Nigerian Head of State General Abdulsalam Abubakar.
</P>
<P>
The release of political prisoners and detainees by the
Nigerian authorities and the new program of transition to
democracy announced by General Abubakar Monday provide "further
evidence of his commitment to national reconciliation and the
establishment of a credible process to democracy in Nigeria,"
Anyaoku said, quoted by the Post Express Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In his nationally televised address Monday night, Abubakar
announced to free all political prisoners and set May 29, 1999 as
the new date for the military to handover power to an elected
civilian president, in stead of the originally planned October 1,
this year.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to Abubakar's address, Anyaoku said he particularly
welcomed the announcement of the "new independent electoral
commission which, with appropriate powers, should contribute to
the credibility of the electoral process in Nigeria."
</P>
<P>
"It is my sincere hope that the new transition program
announced by the head of state will lead to an open and
transparent political process in which all Nigerians can
participate," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Commonwealth secretary general, who comes from Nigeria,
visited his home country early this month to discuss with
Abubakar issues concerning Nigeria's political transition and
relations with the Commonwealth.
</P>
<P>
According to Anyaoku, the 53-nation organization, which has been
pressing for a return to democracy in Nigeria, will wish to
follow closely the implementation of the new transition program.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar, in his national broadcast, scrapped all the political
parties and transition institutions, including the National
Electoral Commission of Nigeria, and canceled all the elections
conducted on the basis of them.
</P>
<P>
The head of state announced that fresh elections will begin
later this year, with presidential election held in the first
quarter of next year.
</P>
<P>
The international community, particularly the United Nations,
the Commonwealth, the Organization of African Unity and other
relevant organizations, will observe the elections.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Seeks International Understanding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Head of State General
Abdulsalam Abubakar has appealed the international community for
understanding in his government's efforts toward resolving the
socio-economic and political problems in the country.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar in a national broadcast Monday night said the present
administration would consolidate existing relationship and
maintain positive and friendly relations with all nations of the
world.
</P>
<P>
This will be done "without compromise to our sovereignty and
independence as we endeavor to defend and protect the legitimate
interest of our sub-region on all issues", said the soft-spoken
general, who came to power after the sudden death of his
predecessor Sani Abacha six weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Noting that "every country is saddled with problems and
possibilities that are unique to it," Abubakar urged the
country's foreign friends extend "a level of understanding and
respect desired of all sovereign nations".
</P>
<P>
"We implore our friends to exercise patience and appreciate
the unique problems that face us as a nation", said the
56-year-old head of state.
</P>
<P>
This is against the background that as the world become
increasingly inter-dependent, "our actions at home as a people
are always interpreted in the context of the cherished norms of
international morality and behavior," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has in the last five years come under intense
criticism both within and outside mainly for its poor human right
record and lack of democracy.
</P>
<P>
Western powers, particularly the United States and the
European Union (EU), and the Commonwealth have imposed sanctions
against Nigeria, thereby creating for it the image of a pariah
state.
</P>
<P>
However, the west seems to be soft-pedaling its diplomatic
isolation against Nigeria since the visits earlier this months by
Tony Lloyd, British Minister of State and EU representative,
United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Commonwealth
Secretary-General Emeka Anyaoku and U.S. Under-Secretary of State
Thomas Pickering.
</P>
<P>
France has also expressed that it would encourage other EU
member countries to lift sanctions against Nigeria with its
progress in the democratization process.
</P>
<P>
The head of state has also reiterated the country's policy of
good neighborhood and appealed African leaders to solve conflicts
through peaceful means.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Stock Market Tumbles Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Share prices tumbled sharply on
the Singapore Stock Market Tuesday after the government projected
that total external trade for the whole year may shrink by 4.5-5.5
percent to reverse the four consecutive days of rally.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Straits Times Industrials Index (STII) fell by
39.80 points to close at 1062.52 points.
</P>
<P>
The total turnover slipped to 103.72 million shares worth
258.05 Singapore dollars (about 151.79 U.S. dollars). Falls
surged, outstripping rises by 240 to 29, while 321 stocks remained
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
TAC 200 was the most active stock as it registered a turnover
of 8.48 million units.
</P>
<P>
Elec&AMP;E topped the gainers of the day as it inched eight cents
to finish at 3.70 Singapore dollars. TAC 200 edged up eight cents
to 1.26 U.S. dollars at close. GP Bat was up six cents to close at
3.34 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the downside, Creative 50 was the top loser of the day as it
lost 50 cents to end 20.90 Singapore dollars. SPH shed 50 cents to
finish at 11.90 Singapore dollars. SIA was next slipping by 40
cents to 6.30 Singapore dollars at finish.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the country's Trade Development Board (TDB) said in
a press release that the total trade in 1998 would decline by
between 4.5 to 5.5 percent after taking into account of the
decline in the first half of the year, the regional currency
crisis, the expected moderate growth in the United States, the
United Kingdom and Germany, the global oversupply of key
electronic products, the scaling down of operations by many
manufacturers in Singapore, the four-month slump in non-oil
imports as well as the continued weakness in oil trade.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that the TDB comments about trade put a dampener
on the market and profit-taking on recent heavy gains set in
following the weak trade outlook projected by the government.
</P>
<P>
They also said that shares were compensating for gains that had
placed the market ahead of its regional counterparts in Asia in
the past few days.

<P>
PHNOM PENH, July 21 (Xinhua) -- There will be 95,000 security
personnel, including police, military police and soldiers, to
ensure the security of the polling station, Cambodia's National
Election Committee (NEC) announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The security forces, commanded by the NEC sub-committee on
security, are available to election officials at the levels of
province, district, commune and polling station.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there is also an intervention force under the
command of the NEC sub-committee on security, which can respond
quickly to any possible serious trouble.
</P>
<P>
Five security personnel will be deployed at each polling
station, all wearing civilian clothes and white identity cards.
</P>
<P>
There will be two unarmed guards posted 40 meters from each
polling station, and three more guards 200 to 250 meters away with
one AK-47 rifle kept out of sight to avoid causing scares among
the voters.
</P>
<P>
Friday's attacks on electoral officials northeast of Anlong
Veng has caused concern over the security of the election.
</P>
<P>
Senior election officials in Phnom Penh later pledged that they
would not allow the attack to deter the polls.

<HEADLINE> 5,000 PNG Tsunami Victims Unaccounted for: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- One of the biggest problems
facing relief efforts to the tsunami-hit area of Papua New Guinea
(PNG) is finding about 5,000 people who are still unaccounted for,
Australian Defense Minister Ian McLachlan said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The biggest problem at the moment is finding those people who
are still lost or hiding or injured or incapable of moving," he
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
McLachlan said the latest available figures from PNG said 705
people were confirmed dead and about 500 bodies had been found
floating, and about 2,500 people have been found alive while about
5,000 people are still unaccounted for.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Defense Force (ADF) has 94 personnel working in
PNG, 60 of them in medical and paramedical roles with three
Australian air force C-130 Hercules and one Caribou transport
aircraft operating there.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Associated Press quoted PNG Prime Minister Bill
Skate as saying Tuesday at least 1,200 people were dead and up to
6,000 others remained unaccounted for.
</P>
<P>
In a situation report released here Tuesday afternoon,
Australia's international assistance agency AusAID said the exact
magnitude of the PNG tidal wave disaster remains unclear although
the death toll could reach as high as 3,000.
</P>
<P>
It said devastation from the tidal waves, the isolated nature
of the region and poor communications meant there were varying
estimates of the likely human toll, adding the death toll could
reach up to 3,000 people over the next two or three months as
people die from injuries and disease.
</P>
<P>
McLachlan said the threat of disease from decaying bodies in
the area was becoming very serious.
</P>
<P>
Four days after a 10-meter-high tidal wave washed away villages
where up to 10,000 people lived, terrified, dazed survivors
continued to hobble out of the jungles and mangrove swamps behind
the coast, many with serious wounds and injuries which have become
infected after days in the tropical heat.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile food, water, water tanks, fuel and medical supplies
were flowing into Aitape at an increasing rate to be distributed
to centers set up to care for disaster survivors.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Australia's relief efforts, New Zealand and
France also offered their help to the disaster-hit area in PNG.

<HEADLINE> Commission of Inquiry on HK New Airport Set Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 21 (Xinhua) -- A Commission of Inquiry
appointed by the Chief Executive-in-Council has been formed here
Tuesday to probe into the operation of the new Hong Kong
International Airport which was opened on July 6 this year.
</P>
<P>
Justice Woo Kwok-hing has been appointed Chairman and Dr. Edgar
Cheng Wai-kin, former chairman of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, a
Commissioner.
</P>
<P>
The Commission is expected to finish its inquiry in around six
months and may call experts from local and overseas for
assistance.
</P>
<P>
It will have the following terms of reference:
</P>
<P>
-- To examine the planning and preparation for the opening of
the new airport including the adequacy of communication and
coordination between all interested parties;
</P>
<P>
-- To examine the decision to open the new airport on July 6,
1998 and the extent to which it was ready to begin operation on
that date;
</P>
<P>
-- To examine the operation of the new airport since it opened
on July 6, 1998 and to identify the roles of the various parties
involved;
</P>
<P>
-- To identify problems encountered in the operation of the new
airport and to establish their causes and where the responsibility
for each of them lies.
</P>
<P>
The terms of reference do not include maters to do with civil
liability or quantification of loss or damage.
</P>
<P>
Tung Chee Hwa, chief executive of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region, said: "the appointment of an independent
statutory commission demonstrates clearly our determination to
find out what went wrong, to establish where the responsibilities
lie, and to help prevent similar incidents from happening again."
</P>
<P>
"We have decided to appoint Mr. justice Woo Kwok-hing and Dr.
Edgar Cheng for their standing in the community and their record
of public service," he said.

<HEADLINE> 75 Mln People Exposed to Arsenic Contamination in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 75 million people of
Bangladesh are at risk of arsenic contamination, according to
recent estimates by experts, who have asked the departments
concerned to take immediate steps to tackle the problem.
</P>
<P>
There are hardly any tubewells of the worst-affected 44
districts in the five southern regions of Bangladesh that are not
arsenic positive, the latest issue of the New Nation weekly quoted
a study as saying.
</P>
<P>
Conducted by the Disaster Forum, the study also said that
arsenic concentration in the ground water of the country's six
northeastern districts was alarming too.
</P>
<P>
Though there are different guidelines for maximum allowable
limit, the arsenic concentration level in both southern and
northeastern districts are well above the permitted level.
</P>
<P>
According to the United States Environment Agency, the maximum
permissible level is 0.03 mg (milligram)/liter, while the World
Health Organization and the Canadian guidelines put it at 0.05
mg/l.
</P>
<P>
Samples collected from 1,210 tubewells in the six districts
showed that the arsenic concentration level was between 0.05 and
0.10 mg/l.
</P>
<P>
About 96 percent of people living in the above-mentioned
districts depend on water pumped from the tubewells for their
survival.
</P>
<P>
The symptoms of arsenic toxicity may take 8-14 years to be
manifested in a person's body after the patient starts drinking
arsenic contaminated water, and the apparent symptoms of
arsenicosis may be said to have manifested themselves as melanosis

<HEADLINE> Uganda Needs More Equipment to Fight Rebels: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
said here Tuesday morning that the army needs more equipment to
fight rebels in northern and western parts of his country.
</P>
<P>
The Uganda People's Defense Forces (UPDF) is presently lack of
more precise surveillance equipment to locate the rebels and this
is the first step towards wiping them out, he said.
</P>
<P>
The president also stressed the importance of the army's
mobility, saying that more helicopters and trucks are needed to
carry UPDF soldiers to the frontline.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Museveni accused the rebels of shunning
face-to-face confrontation with the government army and turning
their main energy to the soft targets.
</P>
<P>
They did this just to tarnish the image of the government and
prompt people to put more pressure on the government, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that the UPDF has done a good job in the north in
spite of the lack of equipment.
</P>
<P>
The Lord Resistance Army took 800 rebels from southern Sudan
to northern Uganda and there were only 300 left two months before
it was forced to retreat to its base in southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the letter he wrote to Kony recently,
Museveni said his letter meant to convey the message that the
government has not given up the possibility of resolving the
problem by peaceful means.

<P>
COLOMBO, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Some Sri Lankan parliamentarians
have called for the South Asian Association for Regional
Cooperation (SAARC) to set up an organization to protect children
in the South Asian region, informed sources here said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The SAARC, which groups Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the
Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, is due to hold its 10th
summit in Colombo at the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
Over 20 Sri Lankan parliamentarians representing both the
government and the opposition were united in calling for a
separate ministry in the country to look into issues affecting
children, the sources quoted president of the lobby Jayalath
Jayawardena as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said they ask the SAARC to have a mechanism to ensure that
the declarations to protect the rights of children, which were
issued at the previous SAARC summits, are implemented.
</P>
<P>
The forcing of children into begging was also a serious problem
in the country and in the rest of South Asia, while malnutrition
was on the rise due to poverty, Jayalath added.

<HEADLINE> Burundi Warring Parties Start Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The second round of Burundi
peace talks started Tuesday morning in Arusha, north Tanzania,
under the chairmanship of Tanzania's former president Julius
Nyerere.
</P>
<P>
Nineteen parties are taking part in the talks aimed at ending
a bitter ethnic conflict in which more than 150,000 people have
died since October 1993 in a series of bloody conflicts between
the Tutsi-dominated army and rebels who claimed to represent the
country's Hutu majority.
</P>
<P>
Two new parties, ANNADE and RADDES, also participated in the
second round of talks, which is expected to last more than two
weeks, with the participation of Burundian government officials
and the National Assembly, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Salim Ahmed Salim, secretary-general of the Organization of
African Unity (OAU), is also present at the talks.
</P>
<P>
The first task of Tuesday's meeting is to accept rules of a
procedure in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere, who is the international mediator on Burundi peace
process, told the delegates in his opening remarks that other
issues to be tackled before the start of the face-to-face talks
between all warring parties are to discuss the root causes of
ethnic violence in Burundi and set up essential committees to end
crisis in the country.
</P>
<P>
The peace facilitator has also proposed for election of
various chairmen of the sub-committees who could later meet to
suggest proposals of ending conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Supported by African leaders and the international community,
Nyerere began his mediation since August 1996 when seven east and
central African countries imposed economic sanctions on Bujumbura
following a military coup which toppled a civilian government led
by President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya and brought Major Pierre
Buyoya to power.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere has been holding informal meetings with various
parties in Arusha since Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The plenary session, which had been scheduled to start Monday,
was postponed to Tuesday following requests from the delegates to
be given more time to study rules of the procedure which was
issued Monday afternoon by the peace facilitator.
</P>
<P>
During the first round of negotiations in June the Burundian
government signed an agreement with three rebel groups and 12
political parties to return to the negotiating table and
implement a cease-fire.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar lifted
almost half a U.S. cent Tuesday as the Japanese foreign exchange
market returned from holidays to provide some spark for the local
unit.
</P>
<P>
After Monday dropping by almost one U.S. cent in the absence of
Japanese traders, the Australian dollar Tuesday confirmed its
close relationship with the yen as they rose together.
</P>
<P>
At the close, the Australian dollar was changing hands at 62.93
U.S. cents from 62.45 late Monday.
</P>
<P>
An attempt to hold above 63 U.S. cents did not last and IBJ
Australia senior foreign exchange trader Darrin Stewart said the
currency was largely trading at the higher level ahead of key
domestic data and the expected announcement of a new Japanese
prime minister on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Swift and decisive action on economic reform to lift Japan's
moribund economy by the new prime minister would underpin support
for the yen, and in turn, the Australian dollar.
</P>
<P>
On the cross-rates, the domestic unit was buying 87.57 Japanese
yen from 87.04 Monday and 1.1216 German marks from 1.1123.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the market had surrendered to a "wait and see"
mentality ahead of an address by U.S. Federal Reserve chairman
Alan Greenspan to the Congress tonight along with the inflation
figures.
</P>
<P>
"The market has been active in terms of volume, performing a
little bit better than the last day or so, but we have really gone
nowhere," ANZ Investment Bank head of securities trading Jeremy
Colless said.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Bureau of Statistics' inflation data due
Wednesday is widely expected to be "market friendly", with
economists predicting a rise of 0.5 percent in both the consumer
price index and the treasury's underlying rate.

<P>
CANBERRA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Australian shares ended flat in
quiet trade Tuesday after an afternoon sell off in industrials
offset a better performance by resources, particularly gold
stocks.
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries index ended flat at 2787.9, all industrials
lost 4.8 points to 4882.2 and all resources gained 4.5 to 1099.7.
</P>
<P>
Brokers said demand for industrial stocks softened over the day
ahead of U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan's address to
Congress Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
"There was a bit of balance squaring (this afternoon) ahead of
Greenspan's speech tonight ... and that knocked the earlier gains
on the head a bit," Dicksons broker Jon Hancock said.
</P>
<P>
"And the fact the Dow (Jones Industrial Average) drifted last
night only added to the caution."
</P>
<P>
The key U.S. index lost 42.2 points overnight to 9295.8.
</P>
<P>
Overall local volume traded at the close was a relatively small
254.7 million shares worth 740.1 million Australian dollars
(466.26 million U.S. dollars), with falling stocks just higher
than rising stocks at 491 versus 488.
</P>
<P>
In the resources sector the gold subindex's rise of 2.66
percent (29.4 points) to 1134.4.
</P>
<P>
Two of the stronger gainers in resources were North, up 12, and
WMC, up seven cents.
</P>
<P>
Leader BHP ended three cents stronger while global rival Rio
Tinto retreated 13.3.
</P>
<P>
Among the major industrials the picture was less rosy as most
major stocks ended lower or only marginally higher.
</P>
<P>
News Corp gained two cents and its preferred shares were steady
at 11.70 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
Telco giant Telstra drifted four cents but AMP gained 9.4.
</P>
<P>
Major banking stocks all ended lower. ANZ slipped seven,
Commonwealth gave up three, National Australia eased 16 and
Westpac's lost 4.8.

<HEADLINE> Three Politicians File Candidacy in LDP Presidential Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Foreign Minister Keizo
Obuchi, former Chief Cabinet Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama and Health
and Welfare Minister Junichiro Koizumi on Tuesday filed their
candidacy for presidency of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic
Party (LDP).
</P>
<P>
The three candidates, speaking at a joint news conference
shortly after filing their candidacy, reiterated their campaign
promises to revitalize the sluggish Japanese economy.
</P>
<P>
"Now is the time to make decisions" to ride out the recession
and settle the bad-loan problems of Japanese banks, said Kajiyama,
72, the oldest among the three hopefuls.
</P>
<P>
"I will tackle the bad-loan problem" even if it means "putting
my life at risk," said Kajiyama, who is supported by some business
leaders.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi, 61, vowed to form "the most powerful cabinet" if
elected and to proceed to conclude a peace treaty with Russia by
2000. He is backed by the largest faction within the LDP.
</P>
<P>
Koizumi, 56, who is favored by many of the LDP's younger
lawmakers, promised to make Japan a reliable democratic country
with an internationally acceptable economic structure.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto tendered his
resignation July 13 as LDP leader to take responsibility for the
party's major setback in the July 12 House of Councillors (upper
house) election.
</P>
<P>
A total of 413 LDP parliamentarians and local-chapter
representatives will vote Friday to pick the successor to
Hashimoto.
</P>
<P>
The new LDP president is sure to take the helm of the Japanese
government as the LDP holds a majority in the House of
Representatives (lower house), which has the final say in the
selection of a prime minister.

LAGOS, July 21 (Xinhua) -- France will encourage other states
of the European Union (EU) to lift sanctions imposed on Nigeria
based on the progress so far made by the country on human rights
and democratization, Foreign Minister Chakles Josseline said.
</P>
<P>
Josseline, who was leading a six-man delegation from France,
gave the assurance in Nigerian capital Abuja after a meeting with
the head of state, General Abdulsalam Abubakar Monday.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that France was watching keenly developments
in Nigeria especially its democratization process, adding that
his country would not set a timetable for Nigeria's transition to
civil rule as it was up to Nigeria to make the decision.
</P>
<P>
Observing that France has had no direct contact at high
government level with Nigeria for the past six years, Josseline
said his visit is an indication of the positive attitude on the
French side toward the new development in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Josseline said he discussed bilateral and African issues with
Abubakar, particularly the need for Nigeria to assist in the
peaceful resolution and prevention of conflicts in Africa.
</P>
<P>
He said the French government had solicited for the
intervention of Nigeria in the resolution of the ongoing crisis
in Guinea Bissau considering the experience of the country in the
resolution of conflicts in Sierra Leone and Liberia.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that he had invited General Abubakar to attend
the France-Africa summit on conflicts resolution coming up in
Paris between November 26 and 28 this year.

ISLAMABAD, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Minister for Food and
Agriculture Abdul Sattar Lalika said the area under cultivation
for cotton this year has crossed the earlier assessed target of
2.9 million hectares.
</P>
<P>
"Due to increase in cultivation area, we are expecting 10.5
million cotton bales this year," the minister told the reporters

cotton crop in the United States has been badly damaged. In the
states of Georgia, Texas, Alabama and California, all the cotton
crop has been damaged at the flowering stage.

<P>
Similarly, India has revised the cotton production target
downward, from 16.8 million bales to 14 million bales, Lalika
said.

<P>
Pakistan has very supportive weather conditions and is expected
to earn a hefty amount by exporting cotton this year, according to

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese water conservation
specialists are predicting that China's second longest river, the
Yellow River, could be dry up year round at its lower reaches by
the year 2020 as a result of drought, "China Youth News" reports
today.
</P>
<P>
The Yellow River started suffering from dry spells in the early
1970s and it has dried up 18 times over the past 25 years, with
each dry spell averaging for a week. In 1997, the dry-up period on
the lower reaches of the river lasted 226 days.
</P>
<P>
Based on these data, scientists say the river's dry spells will
lengthen to 140 days by the year 2000 and to 200 days by 2010.
</P>
<P>
This will have an adverse effect on development and on people's
livelihoods in those areas as the water table drops, the climate
gets drier, and desertification starts on some river courses.

PARIS, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The tone is mounting between Albania and Yugoslavia which
have accused each other of violating their sovereignty after the
fighting broke out last weekend on the frontier between Albanian
separatists infiltrating into Kosovo from Albania and the
Yugoslav military, in which 110 people were killed.
</P>
<P>
-- After the doping scandal in the Tour de France cycling
tournament erupted last weekend, some French doctors have
condemned the violation of medical ethics by some medical experts
in sports. They urged a complete ban of drug abuse in any form in
sports and stressed that health, which a doctor is committed to
protecting, must be above sports.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- In France, five million people -- 65 percent of them below
the age of 45 and 20 percent of them women -- are amateurs of
fishing. The Anglo-Saxon tradition of ``no kill'' in fishing,
which let the captured fish return to the water, is gaining
popularity among the French.
</P>
<P>
-- The European Union (EU) Monday urged the Albanian armed
groups in Kosovo and the Yugoslav army to stop fighting
immediately in fear of an escalade of the conflict. The EU
presidency expressed particular concern over the bombardment by
the Yugoslav army on the border with Albania, accusing the latter
of having ``apparently violated the international frontier.''

<HEADLINE> Clearer Skies For Northwestern China City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The skies over Lanzhou, the
capital of northwest China's Gansu Province, are clear again
thanks to the government's "blue sky" program.
</P>
<P>
Lanzhou suffered from serious environmental pollution caused by
the burning of coal, which made the city's sky gray all year
round, so it began the "blue sky" program in 1994, spending 1.45
billion yuan (180 million U.S. dollars) on combating atmospheric
pollution.
</P>
<P>
Trees have been planted on 6,600 hectares of ground around the
city and 32 environmental monitoring stations set up, and 38
industrial waste gas sites.
</P>
<P>
The city has built 146 pollution treatment projects and its
suspended particle index has dropped to 0.74 mg per cubic meter
from 1.07 mg per cubic meter.
</P>
<P>
Many residents leave their homes to have a look at the blue
sky, which was just a distant memory for most of them. "I've
seldom seen such blue skies my whole life," said Wang Chengzhi, a
70-year-old man who was standing on the dyke of the Yellow River,
staring up at the sky.
</P>
<P>
The city government has stepped up environmental protection,
replacing coal with electricity as its major energy source,
providing a fundamental solution to the environmental pollution
problem, a leading city government official told reporters.

SHANGHAI, July 21 (Xinhua) - During the intensely hot summer, a

Shanghai.

The new service gives ultraviolet ray intensity at noon every

people to wear hats in the scorching sun and avoid going outside
from 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.
</P>

Ultraviolet rays are good for people's health but too much
exposure can cause burns, cancer, or eye diseases, according to

<HEADLINE> India, U.S. End Third Round of Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 21 (Xinhua) -- India and the United States
ended here Tuesday morning their third round of talks primarily on
nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament without tangible
results.
</P>
<P>
Both sides admitted that differences persisted over
security-related issues but termed the talks as "constructive and
ongoing" and agreed to continue the dialogue process in Washington
later in August.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. delegation led by Deputy Secretary of State Strobe
Talbott and the Indian side headed by Prime Minister's special
envoy Jaswant Singh held a 90-minute meeting this morning mainly
to sum up the two-day discussions and to chart out the broad
agenda for the next round of talks, Indian officials said.
</P>
<P>
An American spokeswoman told reporters that both sides were
looking forward to areas of agreement and there has been steady
movement.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has insisted that India should roll back or freeze its
nuclear weaponisation and missile programs while India has made it
clear that this is not negotiable.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. asked India to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty
(CTBT) unconditionally and forthwith while India said it can not
sign so long as New Delhi is accorded the status of a nuclear
threshold state under the CTBT.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from his meeting with Indian Prime Atal Bihari
Vajpayee Monday, Talbott told reporters that the two countries had
not yet reached a point that was conclusive, adding that "we have
a long way to go."
</P>
<P>
The American envoy conveyed Washington's desire to put
bilateral relations on solid footing in the aftermath of India's
nuclear tests in May, said Talbott who arrived in New Delhi Sunday
evening.
</P>
<P>
He said that President Bill Clinton's visit to India slated for
November this year was under review.
</P>
<P>
Talbott, who left for Islamabad this morning, delivered a
letter Tuesday from President Clinton to Vajpayee, the content of
which is unknown.
</P>
<P>
Talbott is the first high-ranking U.S. official to visit the
South Asian country since India conducted the nuclear test.
</P>
<P>
The Indian Ministry of External Affairs issued a statement
Tuesday, saying that Talbott's talks with Indian officials were
marked by a spirit of working together to find common ground and
to narrow gaps in their governments' respective perceptions.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that during his meeting with Talbott
yesterday, Vajpayee was informed of the progress towards removal
of problems in Indo-U.S. relations which surfaced after India's
nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
"There is now a clearer understanding of each other's concerns
and certain steps in the direction of addressing those concerns
are contemplated," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
This is the third meeting between Talbott and Singh in less
than 40 days. His first two rounds of talks with Singh -- in
Washington on June 12 and in Frankfurt on July 9 -- reached no
concrete results.
</P>
<P>
The talks came ten days before the scheduled meeting between
Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Pakistani Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif on the sidelines of the three-day summit of
the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation in Colombo
beginning on July 29.

</P>
<P>
The move to computerize vote counting will lead to the early
proclamation of winners, making the tampering of election results
more difficult for cheaters.
</P>
<P>
The full modernization of the electoral system will be
complemented by the creation of a presidential commission on
constitutional reforms to study proposed amendments to the
Constitution, a move that will ensure that the government remains
"transparent, consultative and responsive" to the needs of the
majority.
</P>
<P>
Congress passed a law on poll computerization last December,
but the lack of time prevented the Commission on Elections from
implementing it on a nationwide basis during the May 11
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
The Autonomous Region for Muslim Mindanao, which had
computerized elections in 1995, was the only beneficiary of the
poll modernization measure during the May 11 polls.

<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, July 21 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese farmer has
discovered fossils of ivory and bones from an ancient elephant in
north China's Hebei Province, which archaeologists say could date
back 300,000 years.
</P>
<P>
The 3-meter piece of ivory weighs 150 kilograms. It was
discovered in a 12-meter-deep sand pit.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists say that the elephant stood about five meters
tall and was nine meters long.
</P>
<P>
They say that 300,000 years ago the region had a tropical
climate with flowers and trees flourishing. Fossils are of great
importance for research into the movement of the earth's crust in
the Jizhong Plain area and on the evolution of animals.
</P>
<P>
Fossilized ivory and bones were previously discovered in the
same county in 1985 and 1989.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Nations Reach No Consensus on "Flexible Engagement" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The nine member countries of the
Association of Southeast Asian (ASEAN) have not reached a
consensus on a change in ASEAN policy from "non-interference" to
"flexible engagement," a senior official said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN senior officials exchanged views on the "flexible
engagement" at an informal dinner Monday night, but "no consensus
was reached," Philippine Foreign Undersecretary Lauro Baja told a
press briefing on the ASEAN Standing Committee meeting and Senior
Officials Meeting, which opened Tuesday and are scheduled to close
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Only the ministers can decide" whether a change will be made,
Baja added, referring to the foreign ministers who will attend the
31st ASEAN Ministerial Meeting (AMM), also to be held here later
this week.
</P>
<P>
The new proposal means that when domestic developments in an
ASEAN member country have had positive or adverse effects on other
members, other ASEAN nations can give advice to or press the said
country to solve the problems.
</P>
<P>
The idea was raised by Thailand and backed up by the
Philippines. However, senior officials told Xinhua earlier Tuesday
that all the other ASEAN members are "strongly opposed" to the
policy change.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Baja said that during the Standing Committee meeting
and the Senior Officials Meeting, the participants reviewed the
work of ASEAN committees in implementing policies set by the
previous AMM and discussed the agenda for the forthcoming
meetings.
</P>
<P>
The fifth ASEAN Regional Forum and the ASEAN Post-Ministerial
Meetings, two important ASEAN annual events, will also take place
here in the Philippine capital from July 27 to 29.
</P>
<P>
During the 31st AMM, the ministers are expected to sign a joint
declaration on building ASEAN into a region free from drug abuse,
production and trafficking by the year 2020. The new document will
include Laos and Myanmar, the two new members of ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
Besides Laos and Myanmar, ASEAN also groups Brunei, Indonesia,
Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. The
Philippines is the rotating chairman of ASEAN this year.
</P>
<P>
Besides the drug issue, the ongoing financial crisis and its
social impacts, the Cambodian elections, nuclear proliferation in
South Asia and transnational crimes are also the highlights of the
meetings.
</P>
<P>
Baja added that the ASEAN senior officials would also issue a
statement on the tidal wave in Papua New Guinea which has killed
up to 1,000 people.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Govt, Unions Urged to Hold Dialog </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean government and the
Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) have been urged to
continue dialog to resolve their differences.
</P>
<P>
The country's leading daily Herald said Tuesday that state and
the ZCTU should continue with dialog.
</P>
<P>
ZCTU Secretary General Morgan Tsvangirai said Monday the ZCTU
still had the option to call for another nationwide work boycott
and it could not rule out the mass national strike when it has
not even met its demands.
</P>
<P>
The ZCTU organized a mass job stay-away in January this year
which crippled the country's economy, resulting in the loss of
business worth more than 3.8 million U.S. Dollars over two days.
</P>
<P>
The strike forced the government into accepting some of its
demands, which include scrapping the five percent development
levy, tax on pensions and the need for the government to find a
long term solution to high increases of basic commodities.
</P>
<P>
"What is important is for all stake-holders to work together
to solve the country's economic problems," said a commentary
carried in the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
If the ZCTU is truly interested in the workers' welfare,
rather than advancing the political careers of individual
leaders, it should continue seeking dialog with the government
and seek ways to advance to what must be the real goal: a better
standard of living and a higher quality of life for the ordinary
worker, said the commentary.

SHANGHAI, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai's Wild Animal Protection
Administration set two pangolins free in suburban Shanghai
recently.

<P>
The animal mainly live in mountainous parts of southern China

The two freed pangolins had been at the Zoo for two years. They
will live on Sheshan Mountain near Shanghai for a period of time
and researchers will keep track of them through radio
transmitters. Then they will be completely on their own after they
have adapted to the natural environment.
</P>
<P>
The 4 remaining pangolins will be set free soon, and a wild

<HEADLINE> ADB Grants for Kenya's Health Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The African Development Bank
(ADB) has issued a loan worth 672 million Shillings (around 11
million U.S. Dollars) to help deepen health reforms and improve
primary health care services in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
This is the second credit in the Kenyan health sector extended
by the bank following the one extended in 1986 to finance rural
health project, which has been completed, media reports here said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Omar Kabbaj, president of the bank, lauded the ongoing reform
in Kenya's health sector Monday when signing the loan agreement
with Kenyan Finance Minister Simeon Nyachae.
</P>
<P>
Kabbaj said the Kenyan government had demonstrated the
determination to promote and ensure equitable distribution of
basic health care services.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's Health Policy Framework was in line with ADB's own
policies, as it's placing emphasis on the reduction in the rate
of construction of new government health facilities and focusing
instead, on rehabilitating and properly maintaining existing
ones, he said.
</P>
<P>
The ADB money, said Nyachae, will finance the rehabilitation
and upgrading of health facilities in seven districts under the
Rural Health Project II Program.
</P>
<P>
"The objective (of the credit) is to improve the health status
of the target communities through a primary health care strategy,
with a focus on community participation and support to community
initiative," said Nyachae.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Politicians to Comment on AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Advocacy for prevention and
control of the spread of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, is set
to take on a new face in Zimbabwe with the highest political
level pledging to use every platform to talk about the pandemic.
</P>
<P>
Vice-President Simon Muzenda Monday pledged to a high level
political delegation that recently visited Uganda that he was
ready to be among the senior politicians who will openly speak
about AIDS, the daily Herald reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"There is no way we can run away from this problem. We cannot
just brush it aside especially after realizing what the pandemic
is doing to our productive young men and women," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Putting a cover around AIDS has been our biggest weakness,"
Muzenda told the delegation.
</P>
<P>
The 12-member delegation was in Uganda for a week studying how
that country had succeeded in bringing down HIV infection levels.
</P>
<P>
Muzenda said it was unfortunate that Zimbabwe, which together
with Botswana are leading the world in having the highest numbers
of HIV infected people, was not "very active" in trying to
prevent and control further infection.
</P>
<P>
Head of the delegation, Minister of State in President's
Office Oppah Muchinguri said among the important lessons learned
was that there was urgent need for the country to adopt an open
minded attitude about AIDS.
</P>
<P>
She said another important lesson learned was the highest
political office's involvement in advocacy for AIDS prevention
and control strategies.
</P>
<P>
More than 1.5 million Zimbabweans are estimated to be infected
with HIV. This means that one in every four people has the HIV
virus.
</P>
<P>
Uganda, which in the late 80s had infection levels at 30
percent, has managed to reduce it to 12.8 percent at present.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Emphasizes Ties With Japan's Communist Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 21 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin, General
Secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, in a
meeting here today with Japanese communists, said that the CPC
will develop a new type of party-to-party relationship with the
Communist Party of Japan under principles confirmed by the two
parties.
</P>
<P>
Jiang told the delegation, which was led by Tetsuzo Fuwa,
chairman of the Presidium of the CPJ Central Committee, that the
CPC will reinforce ties with the JPC to contribute to an
understanding between the Chinese and Japanese and to establish
long-term, stable and good-neighborly Sino-Japanese relations
geared to the next century.
</P>
<P>
The CPC and CPJ announced the normalization of party-to-party
relations last month. They had severed ties in the 1960s, during
China's "Cultural Revolution."
</P>
<P>
Jiang congratulated them on the normalization of relations and
said that it is an important event, and added that this year is
the 20th anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Japanese Treaty of
Peace and Friendship and that the two countries have reached an
important historic period of inheriting the past and ushering in
the future.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is in the interest of their people and the
peace, stability and development of the Asia-Pacific region and
the entire world if China and Japan, two major nations in Asia and
in the world, have good-neighborly and friendly relations,
increase mutually-beneficial cooperation, and prolong their
friendship for generations.
</P>
<P>
Fuwa said that since Japan and China normalized relations in
1972 there has been development in bilateral ties and the
normalization of CPJ and CPC relations fits this trend.
</P>
<P>
He also spoke about the development of Japan-China ties and
told Jiang that the CPJ is ready to work with the CPC for the
growth of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also discussed China's reform and opening to the outside
world and the country's foreign relations.
</P>
<P>
The CPJ delegation arrived here Sunday at the invitation of
the CPC.

The teams described the achievements in the four provinces in
tax collection and said that, in general, local governments and
tax offices have done a good job of implementing the Tax
Administration Law.
</P>
<P>
The strict enforcement of the law means greater revenues for
the state, Tian said, and added that offices should study current
problems and resolve them.
</P>
<P>
The fourth meeting of the Ninth Standing Committee of the NPC
will discuss a general report on the inspection in August.

<HEADLINE> Judiciary Plays Vital Role: Tembo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Vice-President Christon
Tembo has said the judiciary plays a pivotal role in governance
as a major watchdog over all other state organs.
</P>
<P>
Speaking Monday in Livingstone, Zambia's tourist capital in
the southern border, while officially opening a Judges seminar on
"Enhancing Knowledge for Effective Justice Delivery", Tembo said
the judiciary is a traditional custodian of law, freedom and
human rights.
</P>
<P>
It is imperative that the nation has an efficient
knowledgeable and professional judiciary that will be the
protector of individual rights as well, he was quoted by Zambia
Daily Mail Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Tembo added that the services rendered by Judges could not be
assured by monetary means but demand the highest facilities of
learning, training and character.
</P>
<P>
Judges status should not be regarded as power symbols as it is
a mark of high social and professional responsibility, said Tembo
while noting that Judges do not enjoy political leadership or
power over life and death, punishment and mercy.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president also stressed that the judiciary is one of
the chief anchors of democracy, hence the need for accountability
and transparency in their dealings and practices.
</P>
<P>
The seminor is held when the magistrates' strike throughout
Zambia has entered the third week, leaving the courts deserted
and cases piling up.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian magistrates have been demanding better salaries
and servicing conditions but up till now there is no response
from the government.

<P>
LUSAKA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The inflow of foreign currency has
remained at zero with no donor inflows coming into the Bank of
Zambia since March, and Zambia has continued debts servicing thus
depleting international reserves.
</P>
<P>
The latest Bank of Zambia Fortnight Statistics for the week
ending June 26 reaching here Tuesday shows that Zambia's reserves
have remained at 155 million U.S. Dollars since March this year
and yet the country has been disbursed money to meet debt
obligations.
</P>
<P>
At least seven million Dollars was paid out in debt servicing
in April and yet there are no inflows during the same period.
There were other outflows for debt servicing of about 4.7 million
Dollars without any donor inflows.
</P>
<P>
Since March, there has been no significant inflows of foreign
currency from donors who have indicated that they will not
release any Balance of Payment support until after the sale of
Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM), the country's largest
foreign exchange earner.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank has not bought any foreign currency in the
past four months from ZCCM which has in some cases been selling
foreign currency straight to the market.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Central Bank paid out almost 13.5 million
Dollars in debt servicing in June although during this period,
there were some inflows amounting to three million Dollars from
other non-governmental inflows, with none from ZCCM and donors.

<P>
ROME, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Former captain and goalkeeper Dino
Zoff will replace Cesare Maldini as coach of the Italian national
soccer squad this week, said ANSA news agency on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Luciano Nizzola, president of the Italian Football Federation,
had secret talks with Maldini in Turin on Monday and would return
to Rome on Tuesday to meet Zoff, ANSA said.
</P>
<P>
And the decision would probably be announced before meetings of
the Italian Olympic Committee CONI and the Football League, both
of which are scheduled for Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Cesare Maldini's career as Italy coach is over and Dino Zoff's
is about to begin," ANSA said.
</P>
<P>
With his contract runs to the end of 1998, Maldini hoped to see
it out despite criticism for Italy's poor show in the World Cup
finals wherein they were beaten by France in the quarter-finals.
</P>
<P>
Zoff, who also run for the coach's job when Maldini replaced
Arrigo Sacchi in late 1996, is the current president of Lazio.
</P>

Being captain, Zoff enjoys high reputation in Italy as its
squad won the 1982 World Cup finals in Spain.

<HEADLINE> NZ Made Drug May Beat Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Cancer patients may soon be
spared the
agony of chemotherapy, thanks to a drug developed by New Zealand
researchers.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent report of the Auckland-based newspaper
The New
Zealand Herald, Auckland University's Cancer Society Research
Center
headed by Professor Bill Denny has developed a chemical to fight
breast
and ovarian cancer with almost no side-effects.
</P>
<P>
If trials are successful, the treatment could be available in
two
years and is likely to be taken orally.
</P>
<P>
Until now, chemotherapy has been the only way of tackling
cancer,
bringing with it unfortunate side-effects such as hair loss and
lowered
resistance to infection.
</P>
<P>
But the new compound, EGFR, could end the suffering by shutting
down
abnormally functioning cells rather than wiping them out.
</P>
<P>
Parke-Davis, a US drug company working with the Auckland
researchers,
was so impressed with initial results that it agreed to begin
clinical
trials.
</P>
<P>
Professor Denny said: "If the trials prove successful it will
hopefully offer cancer patients a far less traumatic form of
treatment."
</P>
<P>
He said that the drug worked by targeting the signaling
pathways by
which cells communicate. In cancer cases, the enzyme components of
these
pathways mutate and produce irregular tumor-forming cells.
</P>
<P>
"One of the most important enzymes in the human body is called
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) which is responsible for
wound
healing."
</P>
<P>
The enzyme sits on the cell surface and acts like a trigger,
telling
the cells when to divide to heal wounds. Normally, once the injury
has
healed, the enzyme switches off and the cells stop dividing.
</P>
<P>
But in many human lung, ovarian and breast tumors the enzyme
tells the
cells to keep on dividing, leading to cancerous tumors.
</P>
<P>
The new drug works by selectively blocking the function of
EGFR,
preventing it from sending growth signals to the cell nucleus.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Poverty Level Widens: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 21 (Xinhua) -- About 13 million Kenyans are
living in absolute poverty and the number will swell in the
coming years if economic growth still stagnates, according to a
Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) report.
</P>
<P>
Half of the families in the east African state has serious
food problems, the East African Standard newspaper quoted the
report as saying.
</P>
<P>
Intensity of poverty is much worse in arid and semi-arid
areas, urban slums as well as among female-headed households,
said the report, the first of this kind issued by the Kenyan
government.
</P>
<P>
The pattern of poverty shows that 47 percent of Kenyans living
in rural areas are poor. The figure in urban areas stands at 29
percent.
</P>
<P>
The report classified four out of all the eight provinces --
Eastern, Western, Coast and North Eastern -- as "very poor
provinces."
</P>
<P>
At least 25 percent of victims of poverty in the country are
in Eastern Province, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The glimpse of urban poverty shows that 44 percent of
residents in Kisumu and Nakuru, Kenya's third and fourth largest
cities, suffer from absolute poverty.
</P>
<P>
One fourth of the people in capital Nairobi and almost one
third of residents in the Indian Ocean port of Mombasa, Kenya's
second largest city, are poor.
</P>
<P>
Currently, 18 percent of Kenya's population is composed of
urban dwellers of which 60 percent live in Nairobi, Mombasa,
Kisumu and Nakuru.
</P>
<P>
Whereas there is no official poverty line in Kenya, CBS
researchers defined poverty as a multi-dimensional phenomenon
that specifies levels of deprivation of basic needs.
</P>
<P>
In order to derive a poverty line for Kenya, researchers used
U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization minimum recommended daily
allowance of 2,250 calories per person.
</P>
<P>
The researchers thus set food poverty line expenditure at 978
Shillings (about 16.5 U.S. Dollars) in rural areas and 1,490
Shillings (25 Dollars) in urban areas per month.
</P>
<P>
"This means that it takes about 70 percent more to survive in
urban areas than up country," says the report.
</P>
<P>
The researchers estimated that the country needs 41 billion
Shillings (689 million Dollars) in fighting against poverty in
the next five years.
</P>
<P>
"Low investment and inefficient parastatal sector has led to a
fall in real wages, doubling unemployment and ringering
rural-urban migration," says the report.
</P>
<P>
Lack of ownership and access to land has become a major cause
for poverty among women who comprise 50.2 percent of Kenya's
population of estimated nearly 30 million.
</P>
<P>
Other dominant causes for poverty in Kenya include illiteracy,
negative cultural attitudes and practices, according to the
report.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Gov't to Dispose Stakes in Private Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is
planning to dispose its stakes in private banks, particularly the
Philippine National Bank (PNB), within a year, the Department of
Finance said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Felicitas del Rosario, spokesperson for the department, said
that the move was not just true with the PNB but the rest of
government-controlled corporations where the government has
interests.
</P>
<P>
She added that this move is in line with President Joseph
Estrada's directive to privatize government assets and
government-controlled corporations, particularly those not doing
well in their operations.
</P>
<P>
But del Rosario explained that prior to the disposition of
these stakes, the Finance Department will conduct a thorough study
and evaluation to determine how much really is needed to offset
the government's budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
The government, which suffered 24 billion pesos (0.585 billion
U.S. dollars) in budget deficit for the first half of the year, is
expected to incur a staggering deficit of more than 50 billion
pesos (1.22 billion dollars) for the entire 1998, according to the
Department of Budget and Management.
</P>
<P>
The Estrada administration has listed privatization of state
assets as one way to make up the ballooning deficit.

<HEADLINE> 237,000 Zimbabweans Drop out of School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 21 (Xinhua) -- More than 237,000 Zimbabwean
pupils dropped out of school countrywide last year because of
financial problems, long distances between schools and homes and
lack of confidence in the future.
</P>
<P>
Officials in the Ministry of Education, Sport and Culture
Monday attributed the high number of school drop-outs to levies,
distances which the pupils have to travel, and the high rate of
unemployment, the daily Herald reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Of the 237,000 pupils who dropped out of school, 105,000 were
in primary school. Drop-outs were registered from as early as
Grade One.
</P>
<P>
Distances which the pupils travel to the nearest school have
been cited as one of the major reasons for dropping out at Grade
One level. In some rural communities, pupils walk up to 20 km to
and from the nearest school.
</P>
<P>
The government built a number of primary and secondary schools
soon after independence in 1980 in an effort to provide basic
education to pupils who had been disadvantaged because of the
country's colonial past.
</P>
<P>
There are over 6,000 primary and secondary schools countrywide
but more are needed if distances to be travelled are to be
reduced.

<HEADLINE> Muluzi Calls for Curriculum Review to Improve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Malawian President Bakili Muluzi
has called for a continuous review of the country's education
curriculum to "meet the needs of the society."
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the national radio Malawi Broadcasting Corporation
(MBC) to mark the "National Day of Education" that fell on
Sunday, Muluzi said there is need to identify the society's needs
and see whether or not the current curriculum address those
needs, the Malawi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"The needs of the society are as dynamic as the society
itself," he said, adding, "it is very important that the review
of our curriculum should be an ongoing process if we are to
maintain quality education."
</P>
<P>
He lashed out at private school owners who use unsuitable
premises, few and under-qualified teachers in their schools,
urging them to give pupils education worth the "value to their
money."
</P>
<P>
Since Malawi attained multi-party democracy in 1994, there has
been an upsurge in both primary and secondary private schools,
most of which have been condemned by people as sub-standard and
not conducive to better learning though they charge exorbitant
fees.
</P>
<P>
"It is only fair that private schools charge affordable and
reasonable fees. They should not exploit desperate students and
parents," said Muluzi.
</P>
<P>
"Quality education is inevitably dependent on the quality of
both teachers and pupils," he said.
</P>
<P>
To improve on the country's education by allowing more pupils
in schools, Muluzi's administration introduced free primary
education in 1994 which has soared enrollment from 1.9 million to
3.2 million.
</P>
<P>
However, the president stressed the need to have
well-qualified and motivated teachers in primary and secondary
schools as well as colleges and distance education centers.
</P>
<P>
To this effect, over 10,000 primary school teachers are
currently undergoing training under the "Malawi integrated
teachers program".
</P>
<P>
With some 20,000 teachers already recruited for the free
primary education, the teacher-pupil ratio has now improved to
1:60 in most Malawian schools against the 1:120 ratio before
1994.
</P>
<P>
Malawian government has opened a new university, Mzuzu
University and increased enrollment in existing teachers'
colleges to train more teachers.
</P>
<P>
A total of 315 primary education advisors (PEAs) have been
assigned by the government to monitor primary and secondary
schools in the country's 315 education zones.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Cooperation With Other Countries In Offshore Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Even with a large number of
contracts with oil giants from 18 countries, China still needs
more foreign cooperation in offshore oil and gas exploration,
according to Lin Shaodong, president of the China National
Offshore Oil Bohai Corp (CNOOBC).
</P>
<P>
China is rich in offshore oil and gas, with proven offshore
reserves of one billion tons and 200 billion
cu.m. respectively. But, estimates reach as high as 25 billion
tons and 14 trillion cu m, respectively.
</P>
<P>
So, it is only by dramatically increasing Sino-foreign
cooperation that China can speed up offshore oil and gas
development, Lin says, and foreign oil giants have shown an
interest in investing in China's offshore oil and gas exploration,
and have already put 6.4 billion U.S. dollars into it.
</P>
<P>
Through joint efforts, China has drilled nearly 400 exploratory
wells, and verified nearly 100 oil- and gas-bearing structures with
deposits of 1.2 billion tons and 180 billion cu.m., respectively.
</P>
<P>
In the Bohai and Yingge seas and the Beibu Bay, there are 19
operational oilfields, with annual oil and gas output of 16
million tons and 4 billion cu.m., respectively.

<HEADLINE> Scientists: Vitamin B-6 May Decrease Heart Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 20 (Xinhua) -- People with the highest levels
of vitamin B-6 have only 30 percent of the risk of heart disease
compared to those with the lowest levels, said a study released
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The study, conducted by researchers of the University of
Minnesota and reported in the latest issue of the American Heart
Association Journal Circulation, started out with 759 people aged
45 to 64 between 1987 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
"Among the 759 volunteers, 232 developed heart disease at
different stages," said Aaron Folsom, heading the research group.
All the volunteers had given blood samples which were frozen for
analysis, he added.
</P>
<P>
The next step, according to Folsom, should involve giving some
people vitamin B-6 supplements, and other people placebos, to see
if that affects the rates of heart disease.
</P>
<P>
In February, researchers wrote in the Journal of the American
Medical Association that women who had high intakes of vitamin B-6
and another B vitamin, folic acid, had a 45 percent lower risk of
heart disease.
</P>
<P>
Researchers said vitamin B-6 is naturally rich in wheat germ,
soybeans, peanuts, bananas and other foods. They recommend people
eating plenty of fruits and vegetables.

old bricks are wearing out fast. All cement bricks on a
170,000-square-meter area will be replaced with wear-resistant
granite bricks, which have a life expectancy of at least 50 years.
</P>
<P>
Many of the loud-speakers on poles around the square are broken
or have become sparrow nests and need to be replaced.
</P>
<P>
Lighting has been a major problem for a long time. Four tall
lightpoles were put up for the celebration of Hong Kong's
returning to China last year, but the move was criticized by some
people for spoiling the square's appearance.
</P>
<P>
Some engineers have suggested that the tall poles be taken down
and the old dim lights replaced with bright ones. The lights on
the square's major buildings like the rostrum, the Great Hall of
the People, the Museum of Chinese History, the Museum of the
Chinese Revolution, and the Monument to the People's Heroes need
to be improved to highlight them.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a fountain, 70 meters in diameter, and equipped
with laser lights, will be built between the monument and the
national flag pole.

<HEADLINE> 5m People Suffer from Goiter in Northern Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- About 5 million people have been
suffering from goiter due to iodine deficiency in the northern
part of Bangladesh, an English daily here reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Deficiency of iodine is causing the spread of diseases like
mental and physical disability, dwarfness, less IQ (intelligence
quotient) and infant mortality in 16 districts of the country's
northern region of Pabna, The Bangladesh Observer quoted a medical
source as saying.
</P>
<P>
Iodine was available in sea creatures and land adjacent to the
sea, but it lacks in the land of the country's northern districts,
the source said, adding that besides, rainfall and flood water
washed away the natural ingredient every year from the land
specially in flood-stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the crops produced on the land cannot supply
required quantity of iodine.
</P>
<P>
The use of iodized salt is one of the means to get rid of the
diseases but the businessmen are marketing salt without iodine
taking the advantage of the lack of awareness of the people in the
region.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, a group of people of the society prefer
non-iodized salt due to low price which is being smuggled into the
country from India.

CHONGQING, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have
discovered a protein that could be important for domestic animal
breeding and pharmaceutical production that they extracted from
maggots.
</P>
<P>
Scientists at Southwest China Agricultural University's Biology
Institute in the city of Chongqing say the extract has proven to
be useful for a kind of high-quality fodder and could be used to
produce tonics and pharmaceutical products.
</P>

They said that the maggot powder fodder caused female chickens
to lay 20 percent more eggs than those fed with fish powder and it
can be used to help pigs put on weight.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank, supportive of
Malaysia's request for another loan of 700 million U.S. dollars,
is likely to disburse the loan before the end of the year to
support the country's social programs, Malaysia's national news
agency Bernama reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The 700 million U.S. dollars loan is particularly important as
the economic downturn had increased the number of hard-core poor,
"and our target is to eradicate the hard-core poor," Bernama
quoted Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim as telling
reporters in Washington Monday.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank recently approved and disbursed to Malaysia a
loan of 300 million U.S. dollars for the implementation of social
programs that include poverty eradication, agriculture, education
and medical facilities. The concessionary loan extended by the
bank is payable in 15 years.

<P>
HANOI, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Despite great difficulties, Vietnam
has made considerable economic achievements, said Vietnam Prime
Minister Phan Van Khai, according to Vietnamese media here Tuesday.

The prime minister said though facing great difficulties and
complicated developments in the midst of Asian financial crisis,
Vietnam kept its gross domestic product (GDP) growth at 6.62
percent.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of 1998, Vietnam's agricultural and
industrial output value increased 2 percent and 12.6 percent
respectively, while export turnover grew 9.2 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
Macro-economy and socio-political situation remain basically
good, Khai stressed.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the achievements to the timely and proper
policies initiated by the government, adding that the
policies were in conformity with the aspiration of the people,
therefore helped mobilize internal resources of the whole nation.
</P>
<P>
However, Khai warned of greater difficulties in the second half
of 1998 and early 1999, urging the people to continue coping with
great challenges caused by natural calamities and the on-going
regional financial fallout, particularly weaknesses and
shortcomings of the economy itself.

forced the U.S. players to fight to win the remaining games
with China Monday and Brazil Tuesday if they want to make the

<HEADLINE> Canada to Lift Ban on Gas Additive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government said on
Monday that it would lift immediately its year-old ban on the
gasoline additive MMT.
</P>
<P>
Industry Minister John Manley and Environment Minister
Christine Stewart admitted that the government didn't have enough
scientific evidence to support its ban on the importation and
inter-provincial trade of the additive.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the government said it will pay 13 million U.S.
dollars to Ethyl Corp. of the United States to compensate the MMT
manufacturer for loss of profit and costs because of the ban.
</P>
<P>
Ethyl Corp. has agreed to withdraw a 250-million-U.S.-dollar
suit against the Canadian government, which imposed the ban 13
months ago because of health and environment concerns.
</P>
<P>
MMT, methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl, is a
gasoline octane enhancer. Some studies have linked it to nervous
disorders.
</P>
<P>
The additive was banned in the U.S. briefly until a court
found last year that there was no basis for an Environment
Protection Agency ban.

<HEADLINE> Think-Tanks Predict Slower Italian Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Italian economic growth is expected
to be lower than the government's forecast of 2.5 percent for
1998, according to the two leading think-tanks -- the Institute
for Social Research (IRS) and the European Research Center (CER)
Monday.
</P>
<P>
But the institutions said other economic fundamentals may be
better than the government's forecast in its economic guidelines
for 1999-2000.
</P>
<P>
The IRS said growth would be 1.9 percent, lower than the two
percent it predicted in April, while CER saw a growth of 2.2
percent.
</P>
<P>
While both saw the government as over-optimistic on growth, the
CER was even more up-beat on the ratio of public debt to gross
domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
It expected the ratio to drop as low as 106 percent by the end
of 2001, faster than Treasury Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi's debt
reentry plan.
</P>
<P>
The IRS said it was lowering its April estimates because of the
effects of the Asian financial crisis, especially a lower growth
in trade world-wide. It said the Asian crisis should taper off in
the next few months, though its effects would continue to be felt
in Italy for all of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Both of them forecast inflation this year at 1.8 percent, an
improvement for the IRS on its April forecast of two percent. For
1999, the IRS saw growth rising to 2.1 percent (2.4 percent
predicted in April) with inflation at 1.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
It is only in the year 2000 that the IRS believed Italy will
reach the 2.5 percent growth rate predicted by the government.
</P>
<P>
Despite its relative optimism, the CER expected no significant
drop in unemployment. The budget should remain under control and
the inflation rate stable, but always under two percent for the
three years in question, said the center.
</P>
<P>
According to the CER, short-term interest rates from 1998-2001
should remain below three percent in real terms. This is about 1.5
percent lower than in 1997, and about half the average for the
last decade.

<P>
WASHINGTON, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) Monday announced the approval of a financial support
totaling 11.2 billion U.S. dollars for Russia.
</P>
<P>
The financing consists of an augmentation of Russia's extended
arrangement by the equivalent of about 8.3 billion dollars to
support the government's economic program for 1998, and about 2.9
billion dollars under the Compensatory and Contingency Financing
Facility (CCFF) to compensate for a shortfall in export earnings.
</P>
<P>
Of the augmented amount to be provided under the extended
arrangement, an equivalent of about 5.3 billion dollars is to be
made available under the Supplemental Reserve Facility (SRF).
</P>
<P>
The equivalent of some 4.8 billion dollars is available
immediately, comprising drawings of about 1 billion dollars under
the Extended Fund Facility (EFF), about 0.9 billion dollars under
the SRF and 2.9 billion dollars under the CCFF.
</P>
<P>
Russia's extended arrangement, for the equivalent of about 9.2
billion dollars, was approved in March 1996.
</P>
<P>
Russia joined the IMF in June 1992. Its quota is about 5.7
billion dollars and its outstanding use of IMF financing currently

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Around 7,000 refugees have
returned to their villages on the slopes of Merapi volcano in
Central Java, Indonesia, following a decrease in volcanic activity
in the area, reports reaching here Tuesday said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the decrease, the mountain, which had been spewing out
hot clouds since its eruption on July 11, was still gushing thick
clouds on Monday, said the reports.
</P>
<P>
As many as 5,000 people who fled the sub-district of Dukun,
Magelang regency, returned home early Monday, Sudjarwo, an
official in Dukun was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the villagers had insisted on returning home after
Mount Merapi appeared to have calmed down.
</P>
<P>
Around 2,000 villagers who fled from Serumbung sub-district in
the regency have also abandoned their temporary shelters and
returned home.
</P>
<P>
More than 40,000 people living in over ten villages on the
western slopes of he volcano fled to safer areas in Magelang as
volcanic areas in the mountain reached a critical level on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The 2,968-meter high volcano spewed out poisonous gases and
molten lava oozed out of the vent and ran down the Lamat,
Blongkeng, Boyong, sat, Seno and Jurong Jero lava canals. Hot
clouds shot out of the crater to an estimated height of 4,500
meters and ash covered the mountainside.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of hectares of paddy and tobacco plants in the Dukun
and Srumbung sub-districts were badly damaged by the ash, which
has been raining down incessantly since Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Merapi is one the most active volcanoes in the country. Three
major eruptions have been recorded in the past, the most of which
occurred in 1930 when 1,300 people were killed. The other two
eruptions were in 1994 and 1997, when a total of 88 people died.

COLOMBO, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's intelligence has
reported that the Tamil rebels of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam (LTTE) are planning to mislead SAARC leaders due to attend
this month's summit here, defense sources said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE is planning to hand over a memorandum defamatory of
the Sri Lanka government and the security forces to the leaders of
the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC).
</P>
<P>
The memorandum is to be presented to the Leaders by a bogus
non-governmental organization, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum will aim to expose the Sri Lanka government as
trying to massacre the entire Tamil race; that the security forces
have been indiscriminately bombing civilian targets; Tamil
civilians are indiscriminately harassed, detained and tortured and

<HEADLINE> EU to Provide Romania with Water Conservancy Loan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The Europe Union has decided to
provide a loan of 50 million ECU (about 45 million U.S. dollars)
for Romania's water conservancy projects, said the Romanian Water,
Forests and Environmental Protection Ministry on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The low-interest loan with a 10-year maturity term will be used
in water conservancy projects, renovation of flood-destroyed
forest roads and installation of early-warning radar equipment.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian government will provide guarantee for the loan.
</P>
<P>
Romania needs to invest at least 11,000 billion leu (1.26
billion U.S. dollars) in flood control projects, but the
government cannot afford the sum, Minister of Water, Forests and
Environmental Protection Ro MicaTomescu said.
</P>
<P>
The Water Conservancy Ministry's budget this year is only 340
billion leu (39 million dollars), representing only 0.059 percent
of the country's GDP, he added.
</P>
<P>
The direct loss caused by the severe floods this year is
estimated at 1,280 billion leu (147 million dollars).

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The Executive Committee of the
Bangladesh's National Economic council on Monday approved a
proposed target of manpower export for the year 1998, a press
report said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In the current year, the country will export some 222,500
Bangladeshi workers to different countries, according to the
target.
</P>
<P>
Of the total, 120,000 will be exported to Saudi Arabia, 22,400
to the United Arab Emirates, 15,000 to Kuwait and 25,000 to
Singapore, while the rest will go to some other Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh exported 205,200 workers last year.
</P>
<P>
Manpower export is one of the major foreign exchange earners
for the South Asian country. About 1.53 billion U.S. dollars in
remittances were sent back home in 1997 as against 1.36 billion
dollars in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Spain Backs Firms to Invest in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BILBAO, Spain, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Josep Pique Caps, minister
of industry and energy of Spain, said here Monday his government
will give financial backing to Spanish firms planing to invest in
China.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a trade and investment symposium, Pique said his
government has already provided such assistance to firms to help
their access to China in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Spain and China signed a financial agreement in May last year,
earmarking a credit of 600 million U.S. dollars to encourage
export to China.
</P>
<P>
The Spanish government also allocated five million dollars for
the feasibility studies of Spain-China cooperative projects.
</P>
<P>
The minister said Spain may provide more funds because "these
are not enough."
</P>
<P>
As China's political and economic influence are increasing, he
said, Spain needs a comprehensive and enduring action plan in its
economic and trade cooperation with China.
</P>
<P>
The minister added, though suffering from the impact of Asian
financial turmoil, China's investment market is still growing.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Relations Between Myanmar, ASEAN Develop (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The relations between Myanmar and
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) have been
developing after the country's integration into the grouping in
July 1997.
</P>
<P>
Exchange of visits by state leaders of Myanmar and other ASEAN
member nations since then has promoted the development of their
bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, leaders of five other member countries including the
 Philippine former President Fidel Ramos, Malaysia's Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad, Singapore's Prime Minister Goh Chok
Tong, Brunei's Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah and Vietnam's Deputy Prime
Minister Nguyen Manh Cam have visited Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Myanmar State Peace and Development Council
(SPDC) Senior-General Than Shwe, SPDC Vice-Chairman General Maung
Aye and First Secretary Lieutenant-General Khin Nyunt also toured
the Philippines, Brunei, Vietnam and Singapore respectively.
</P>
<P>
On these occasions, Myanmar initiated with these countries
memorandums of understanding (MOU) on mutual exemption of visas to
each other's citizens holding diplomatic and official passports in
order to facilitate the exchange of visits between officials of
Myanmar and the five ASEAN fellow member countries.
</P>
<P>
More MOUs on the exemption with the remaining ASEAN members are
 expected in the future.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Myanmar signed with the Philippines accords on
trade, establishment of a joint commission for bilateral
cooperation (JCBC), cooperation against drug trafficking and
abuse, and promotion of technical cooperation in forestry and
forest-industrial development, investment promotion and
protection, cultural cooperation and human resources development.
</P>
<P>
Agreements were also reached with Malaysia on double taxation
avoidance and prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes
and income, and with Brunei on setting up a JCBC.
</P>
<P>
Chairman Than Shwe attended for the first time the Kuala Lumpur
second informal summit meeting of the ASEAN last December, during
which Myanmar joined in signing a MOU concerning the setting up of
the ASEAN Foundation and a protocol to implement the initial
package of commitments under the ASEAN framework agreements on
services.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN Foundation to promote and strengthen people-to-people
contact was reportedly formally established earlier this month in
Jakarta, Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Since integration into the ASEAN, Myanmar has been working
closely with other ASEAN members, forming respective committees
and groups in all sectors and taking an active part in various
meetings and activities of the association.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has also attended since then a series of regional
meetings relating to ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) scheme,
investment, agriculture, forestry, transport, drug control,
education, tourism, information, environment, financial, labor and
home affairs.
</P>
<P>
On these occasions, Myanmar joined in the signing of accords on
regional cooperation in finance and tourism as well as the
setting-up of a foundation.

<P>
Myanmar, together with Laos, is also receiving technical
assistance from the grouping at the Kuala Lumpur meeting of the
AFTA Council in October 1997, for the fulfillment of its
obligations to the AFTA.
</P>
<P>
For the establishment of AFTA, Myanmar has presented its
commodities list for tariff reduction.
</P>
<P>
Also since Myanmar's joining of the ASEAN, both the
association's former Secretary-General Ajit Singh and new
Secretary-General Rodolfo C. Severino had respectively visited
Myanmar, enhancing the country's commitments in regional affairs.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's integration into the grouping is seen as not only an
opportunity for the country in the development of its economy and
trade and attraction of foreign investment, but also a challenge
for it in commodity production and market competition.
</P>
<P>
An ASEAN business forum delegation, led by Ajit Singh, visited
Yangon last November and explored business cooperation with
Myanmar counterparts, especially in the private sector.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, investment in Myanmar from
five ASEAN fellow member countries -- Indonesia, the Philippines,
Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand -- added up to more than 3.3
billion U.S. dollars in over 140 projects at the end of March this
year, accounting for about 45 percent of the 7-billion-dollar
total foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Of the five ASEAN fellow member states, Singapore ranked the
second out of the total foreign investment in Myanmar with 1.31
billion dollars in 65 projects, dominating investment in hotels
and tourism, followed by Thailand (1.16 billion dollars),
Malaysia (587 million dollars), Indonesia (236 million dollars)
and the Philippines (6.67 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
ASEAN now groups nine Southeast Asian countries -- Brunei,
Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Laos, the Philippines, Singapore,
Thailand and Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Opposes Nuclear Tests: Chuan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Thailand opposes any nuclear
testing as well as stockpiling of nuclear arms by any country and
is therefore deeply concerned with the recent nuclear testings in
South Asia, Thailand's Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai told his
Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif in a letter.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, dated July 17 and released by Thai Foreign
Ministry late Monday night, Chuan said that Thailand, a signatory
to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the Comprehensive Test
Ban Treaty, is of the view that nuclear testings conducted by
India and Pakistan in May "heighten tensions, accelerate nuclear
arms race and create instability in South Asia."
</P>
<P>
"The actions also run contrary to the spirit of the
international community in promoting global nuclear
non-proliferation and disarmament," Chuan said.
</P>
<P>
The Thai prime minister also reiterated Thailand's stance on
supporting the establishment of nuclear free zones. He said the
nuclear testings in the South Asia region "run counter to" the
ASEAN's effort to establish a Zone of Peace, Freedom and
Neutrality and the Southeast Asia Nuclear Weapon Free Zone.
</P>
<P>
As a response to Sharif's earlier letter on nuclear tests
conducted by India and the instability in South Asia, the letter
also urged India and Pakistan to make joint endeavor to improve
relations between them and find a mutually acceptable solution to
the Kashmir problem.
</P>
<P>
"For peace and stability to prevail in South Asia, I urge that
countries in the region exercise utmost self-restraint and promote
confidence-building mechanisms to lead to solutions to the
existing regional conflicts," the Thai prime minister said.

<P>
WASHINGTON, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The temperature in Dallas,
Texas hit 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 C) for the 15th straight day
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The heat has claimed 81 lives in Texas, including 43 illegal
immigrants who had crossed the border from Mexico, according to
media reports.
</P>
<P>
The heat led to at least 22 deaths in Louisiana, 11 in Oklahoma
and one each in California, Arizona and Missouri. Temperatures hit
102 F (39 C) in parts of Oklahoma on Monday.
</P>
<P>
In Dallas, deputies headed into remote neighborhoods with
bottled water and electric fans on Monday to prevent more
fatalities.
</P>
<P>
"It's time for someone to literally go door to door to check on
the safety and welfare of the citizens we serve," The Associated
Press quoted Dallas County Sheriff Jim Bowles as saying.
</P>
<P>
Most people visited by Dallas County deputies were in
unincorporated areas of the county outside city or town limits.
Some live in mobile homes with no water or sewage systems.
</P>
<P>
"In many cases, these are almost forgotten enclaves of
disadvantaged citizens," Bowles said. "Many are elderly. Some
don't even have telephones to call for assistance."
</P>
<P>
Bowles estimated that 10,000 people live in the unincorporated
areas.
</P>
<P>
In Iowa, temperatures were in the 90s by early afternoon and
expected to climb as high as 105 F (40 C) in some spots.
</P>
<P>
In Oklahoma, fans and mist-spraying devices ran full blast at
poultry houses in the eastern part of the state to keep birds
cool. Chickens have died by the thousands in the past few weeks,
according to some unconfirmed reports.
</P>
<P>
In Nebraska, where temperatures crept toward 100, road work was

<HEADLINE> NATO Not to Deploy Troops in Macedonia in near future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- NATO Secretary-General Javier
Solana said "NATO has no plans to deploy troops in Macedonia, let
alone adopt any form of military intervention" in clashes in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"Now we think the best way is to keep the U.N. Preventive
Deployment Forces (UNPREDF) in Macedonia longer," Solana told the
Macedonian daily New Macedonia, which carried the report on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Solana is expected to visit this country on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Considering the dangerous situation in Kosovo, Macedonia
expects NATO to deploy troops in the country to prevent
emergencies.
</P>
<P>
Solana indicated that even if NATO decides to deploy troops in
Macedonia in the end, the UNPREDF, whose term ends on August 31,
should stay.
</P>
<P>
Solana also said it is up to the international community, not
NATO, to decide Kosovo's future.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, NATO must be prepared for several alternative
actions. For the time being, NATO plans to hold multi-national
military exercises on the Krivolak base in central Macedonia in
September.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Members Strongly Opposed to "Flexible Engagement" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- All the members of the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) but Thailand and the
Philippines are opposed to a proposed policy change from
"non-intervention" to "flexible engagement" in other members'
internal affairs, a senior official told Xinhua here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The official of an ASEAN member, who asked not to be named,
said that at an informal meeting of ASEAN senior officials Monday
night, all the other seven ASEAN members are "strongly opposed" to
the "flexible engagement" proposal, a departure from ASEAN's
traditional policy of non-intervention.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was made by Thai Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan
in a letter sent to Philippine Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon
last week. The proposal was backed by the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Siazon said earlier that since domestic developments in any
ASEAN member countries would have positive or adverse effects on
other members, he and the Thai foreign minister have called for "a
change in ASEAN's policy from constructive engagement to flexible
engagement, suggesting a more pro-active policy in the affairs of
other ASEAN countries."
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN now groups Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia,
Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam and the
Philippines is the chairman of this year's ASEAN ministerial
meetings.
</P>
<P>
"If 'flexible engagement' only means giving advice to other
members, we have already been doing that. Why should we change our
traditional 'non-intervention' policy ?" the official asked.
</P>
<P>
A senior official from Indonesia also said that
"non-intervention" is the cardinal principle of ASEAN while
"flexible engagement," if adopted, would be against the U.N.
charter and the policy of the Non-aligned Movement.
</P>
<P>
"Why should we have a new policy?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a meeting of the ASEAN Standing Committee (ASC) and
a Senior Officials Meeting (SOM) opened here Tuesday to prepare
for the 31st ASEAN Ministerial Meeting scheduled for Friday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting of the ASC will focus on a review of the work of
ASEAN committees in implementing policies set by the AMM and
covering areas such as science and technology, the environment,
culture and information, social development, drugs and narcotics
control and civil service.
</P>
<P>
The ASC, the ASEAN's policy arm and organ of coordination of
ASEAN between ASEAN Ministerial Meetings (AMM), comprises the
chairman, who is the foreign minister of the country hosting the
annual AMM, the ASEAN secretary-general and the directors-general
of the ASEAN national secretariats.
</P>
<P>
The SOM meeting, formally institutionalized during the 1987
Manila summit, is responsible for ASEAN political cooperation and
is attended by senior officials and undersecretaries of member
countries.
</P>
<P>
It is to discuss on-going and possible areas of cooperation
between ASEAN member countries in the political arena including
confidence-building measures and the promotion of security and
stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
Both meetings are scheduled to close on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This year's ASEAN ministerial meeting is expected to discuss
topics including the financial turmoil in the region, ASEAN unity
and cooperation in face of the turmoil, Cambodia, nuclear
proliferation in South Asia and transnational crime.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRIDGETOWN, Barbados, July 20 (Xinhua) -- China attaches great
importance to developing relations with Caribbean nations
including Barbados, said Chinese Vice Premier Qian Qichen here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed confidence that ties with the region will be
further strengthened through joint efforts.
</P>
<P>
Qian made the remarks at a meeting with Barbadian Governor-
General Cliford Husbands, who expressed his hope that Qian's visit
will help promote exchanges and cooperation between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Later on, Qian met Barbadian Prime Minister Owen Arthur at the
Prime Minister's Office, which is located at a picturesque beach
of the Caribbean Sea.
</P>
<P>
Arthur told Qian that Barbados pays great attention to ties
with China, noting that the relations have withstood the test of
time since they were established in 1977.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that the two sides have cooperated well on
international, regional and bilateral levels, Arthur expressed his
hope that Caribbean-China ties will also further be strengthened.
</P>
<P>
In reply, Qian said that China and Barbados, which are both
developing nations and share many common points, are close friends
who can be mutually trusted.
</P>
<P>
China believes that countries in the world should enjoy equal
status no matter how big, rich or strong they are, said Qian,
adding that China regards its relations with Barbados as an
important part of the South-South cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said that the aim of his visit is to enhance this
cooperation, which already exists between the two countries.
"Strengthening the exchanges and cooperation between the two
countries is in the interests of both peoples and conforms with
their wishes."
</P>
<P>
Qian also highly praised the one-China policy which has long
been upheld by the Barbadian government, and expressed his
gratitude to Barbados for its efforts in helping develop relations
between China and those countries which have no diplomatic ties
with China.
</P>
<P>
On economic and trade cooperation, Qian said good basis has
been laid and strengthening it is a common task of both sides.
</P>
<P>
China and Barbados enjoy a good political relationship and have
the desire to cooperate, said the vice premier. The Chinese
government supports more business between enterprises of the two
countries, he added.
</P>
<P>
Following their meeting, Qian and Arthur signed an agreement on
encouragement and protection of investment in both countries.
</P>
<P>
Qian, who arrived here on Saturday, met President Neville
Vernon Nicholls of the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) on Sunday
afternoon. China became a full member of the bank in January.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Heavy flooding in various parts of
China has turned 4.19 million ha of farmland in 10 provinces and
autonomous regions into extremely wet ground, the State Flood
Control and Drought Relief Headquarters reports.
</P>
<P>
Of that area, 642,900 ha are expected to have total crop
failures this year, agronomists say.
</P>
<P>
Governments of the 10 provinces have gathered a massive amount
of machinery to drain the fields, and have moved 19.3 billion
cubic meters of water from 3.48 million ha of land, and farmers
are working hard to plant late rice.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu Province, a major rice grower, has got enough
machinery to pump water from all its soaked fields, while Anhui,
Hunan and Guangdong have also had some success in this.
</P>
<P>
Jiangxi Province and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region are
lagging behind because of a fear that excessive drainage would
pose a threat to river banks.

<P>
COLOMBO, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Three parcels of explosives were
found in a bus bound for Sri Lanka's capital city Colombo from
Negombo 35 kilometers from here, according to police here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
When army personnel detected the explosives at a check point at
Wattala, a suburb of Colombo, in addition to the explosives they
also found two handgrenades with their pins off and covered with
cellophane tape.
</P>
<P>
Twenty passengers of the bus including six Tamils were detained
for questioning, police sources said.
</P>
<P>
Police are investigating as to why these explosives were being
transported to Colombo.
</P>
<P>
They believe it may be possible that it was for an attack on a
telecommunications center or an electricity transformer. Over 25
such installations had been attacked in the past one month.
</P>
<P>
With the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation
summit scheduled to commence in Colombo on July 29 security in and
around Colombo has been stepped up.
</P>
<P>
However, the police do not believe that the latest find of
explosives was to be directed at the SAARC leaders.

<HEADLINE> Two Women's Tennis Opens in Indonesia Cancelled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The WTA Tour, the women's
professional tennis circuit government body, has dropped two open
tournaments in Indonesia from its calendar this year due to
security concerns, the Jakarta Post reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The tournament in Indonesia's second largest city of Surabaya
was scheduled for September 28 to October 4, and the Jakarta Open
was slated on November 9 to November 15.
</P>
<P>
WTA Operations manager Linda Christensen said in a July 17
faxed letter to the Indonesian Tennis Association that the
decision was made after an inspection of the cities.
</P>
<P>
"The Tour recently conducted security risk checks for the
cities of Surabaya and Jakarta. Given the strong chance that
Indonesia will become more volatile and the possibility for
further violent unrest in Surabaya and Jakarta later in the year,
it is not in the best interests of the Tour players or officials
to travel to these cities at this time," Christensen said.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, based on these results, both tournaments have been
cancelled for good," Christensen added.
</P>
<P>
In response to the WTA Tour's decision, deputy
secretary-general of the Indonesian Tennis Association Subiyanto
said: "It's too bad to cancel both tournaments just because of
security reasons."
</P>
<P>
Riots shook several Indonesian cities in the wake of student
movements that culminated in the ouster of former president
Soeharto in May.
</P>
<P>
Security worries have also been blamed for disrupting other
sports events in the country. The Indonesian Open badminton
championships has been moved back from August to November, while
the soccer league was prematurely halted in May.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: ASEAN And Its Annual Meetings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- ASEAN has been playing a more and
more important role in the Asia-Pacific region by hosting a number
of events to increase the cohesion of ASEAN nations and strengthen
ties with outside countries.
</P>
<P>
These events include the ASEAN Ministerial Meeting (AMM), the
ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) and the ASEAN Post Ministerial
Conferences (PMC).
</P>
<P>
From July 21 to 29, the three annual meetings will take place
in the Philippines, ASEAN's rotating chairman this year.
</P>
<P>
AMM is responsible for the formulation of policy guidelines and
coordination of ASEAN activities while ARF serves as a
multilateral consultative forum aimed at promoting "preventive
diplomacy and confidence building" among the nations in the
region.
</P>
<P>
The forum is currently attended by the nine ASEAN member
countries, the 10 ASEAN dialogue partners (Australia, Canada,
China, the European Union, India, Japan, New Zealand, Russia,
South Korea and the United States) and the two observers Cambodia
and Papua New Guinea.
</P>
<P>
During the PMC, ASEAN countries will exchange views on
political and security issues with the dialogue partners. There
will be a plenary session and separate individual sessions between
ASEAN and each dialogue partner.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon, the chairman of
the meetings, said the ongoing Asian financial crisis and its
widespread social impacts, nuclear arms race in South Asia, the
forthcoming Cambodian elections, fight against transnational
crimes, concerns over Japan's economic and political woes and drug
and narcotics control are among the highlights of the meetings.
</P>
<P>
He said the Manila gatherings provide an incomparable
opportunity "to put focus on the current economic situation and
consider its implications on the countries within Asia, as well as
those beyond."
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the PMC, for the first time, will issue a
joint statement on the financial crisis which started last July
and has plagued Southeast and East Asian economies.
</P>
<P>
This year's AMM might be a turning point in ASEAN's history. In
response to the financial and economic crisis, Thailand and the
Philippines are "informally" calling for a change in ASEAN's
policy from "non-interference" to "flexible engagement."
</P>
<P>
"Flexible engagement" means that when domestic developments in
an ASEAN country have had positive or adverse effects on its
neighbors, other ASEAN nations can "flexibly intervene" in the
affairs of the said country, Siazon explained.
</P>
<P>
However, as some ASEAN members are not keen on such an idea, no
consensus seems likely to emerge from the meeting, analysts said.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Black smoke billowed Monday
from the stern of a Carnival cruise ship two miles offshore before
crews were able to contain flames shooting from portholes,
according to local media here.
</P>
<P>
No injuries have been reported and a tugboat pulled the ship
Ecstasy back to Miami, after the fire appeared to be contained in
about two hours.
</P>
<P>
The ship, with nearly 3,000 aboard, was bound for Cozumel,
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Long plumes of water spewed from hoses aboard tug boats as the
flames blackened the sides and rear of the ship, which had just
set out on a four-day trip. The first stop was to be Key West.
</P>
<P>
The ocean liner, which is owned by Miami-based Carnival Corp.,
has 10 decks and can hold 2,040 passengers. It has a regular crew

<HEADLINE> Belgian PM Emphasizes Small Countries' Cooperation in EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Belgian Prime Minister
Jean-Luc Dehaene emphasized here Monday that small countries
should strengthen their cooperation so as to exert their influence
on the European Union's policies.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference after meeting with Finnish Prime
Minister Paavo Lipponen, he said that as big countries tend to mix
their national interests with those of Europe as a whole, it is
important for the small countries to cooperate to make their clout
inside the EU.
</P>
<P>
He and Lipponen agreed that EU policies should be reinforced to
allow small countries to have bigger influence on EU policies
through the European Commission and the European Parliament.
</P>
<P>
The two prime ministers met Monday morning after spending the
weekend together in the eastern part of Finland.
</P>
<P>
They discussed the EU agenda for the year 2,000, the outcome of
the Cardiff EU summit, EU's expansion and Finland's future role as
the EU's rotating presidency.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian prime minister ended Monday his visit to Finland

<HEADLINE> Fashion Through Chinese Eyes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 21 (Xinhua) -- More than half the people of
China regard fashion as something a bit avant-garde, according to
a recent survey of 1,500 citizens in large Chinese cities like
Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, and some 5,400 Internet users.
</P>
<P>
Fashion was regarded as avant-garde by 55 percent of the
respondents, while 22 percent said that fashion is a natural,
attractive, and cultural accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
Another 7 percent thought that fashion follows trends and 5
percent said that the wealthy and powerful are fashionable.
</P>
<P>
In answer to "What is fashionable", most said new
entertainment, exaggerated clothing, and being wealthy enough to
enjoy a colorful life.
</P>
<P>
A major index for fashion is whether one owns high-tech
products and cosmetics and has a new life style.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Association of Southeast Asian Nations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) was established on August 8, 1967, in Bangkok,
Thailand, with the signing of the Bangkok Declaration by the five
original member countries namely Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Singapore and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The Bangkok Declaration united the five member countries in a
joint effort to promote economic cooperation and the welfare of
the people in the region. It set out the guidelines for ASEAN's
activities and defined the aims of the organization.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN nations came together with three main objectives in
mind: to promote the economic, social and cultural development of
the region through cooperative programs; to safeguard the
political and economic stability of the region; and to serve as a
forum for the resolution of intra-regional differences.
</P>
<P>
During the first ASEAN summit meeting in Bali, Indonesia, in
1976, ASEAN set up a small secretariat in Jakarta, Indonesia, to
provide administrative support and help for the coordination of
ASEAN activities.
</P>
<P>
Brunei Darussalam joined ASEAN in January 1984, making the
regional political, security and economic organization a
six-member group until July 1995 when Vietnam was admitted to
ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
During the past three decades, ASEAN nations have cooperated on
a wide range of issues from politics, economy and security to
science and technology, environment, culture, social development,
drugs and narcotics control and civil service.
</P>
<P>
Political and security cooperation in ASEAN began in its
formative years. Some of the most important accords adopted by
ASEAN include the 1971 declaration designating Southeast Asia as a
Zone of Peace, Freedom and Neutrality, the Treaty of Amity and
Cooperation in Southeast Asia and the Declaration of ASEAN Concord
in 1976.
</P>
<P>
These accords stated ASEAN's intentions and commitment to
building regional resilience free from any form and any manner of
interference by outside powers, a code of international conduct
governing peaceful relations among countries in the region and the
principles and framework for ASEAN cooperation in the political,
security, economic and functional fields.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, ASEAN absorbed Vietnam as its seventh member country
at the ministerial meeting held in Brunei. At the end of the same
year, the Fifth ASEAN Summit in Thailand decided to develop ASEAN
into a 10-member group including Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
On the occasion of ASEAN's 30th anniversary last year, Laos and
Myanmar joined ASEAN. However, ASEAN postponed Cambodia's
accession due to the newly-emerged political unrest in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Another most significant step taken by ASEAN is the proposed
establishment of the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) by the year
2008. In 1995, ASEAN's heads of government agreed to accelerate
the scheme by reducing the time frame from 15 years to 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The primary objective of AFTA is to promote greater foreign
direct investments and intra-ASEAN investments in the region.
According to the ASEAN Common Effective Preferential Tariff Scheme
for AFTA, ASEAN must cut tariffs to no more than 5 percent by the
year 2003. So far, more than 90 percent of ASEAN's total tariff
lines have already been included in the scheme, thus making a
giant step toward free trade within the ASEAN region.

MANILA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The Association of Southeast Asian
Association (ASEAN) opened a meeting of the ASEAN Standing
Committee (ASC) and a Senior Officials Meeting (SOM) here Tuesday
to prepare for the 31st ASEAN Ministerial Meeting scheduled for

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: ASEAN Facing Greater Challenges (1)  (By Chen Hegao, Liu Huorong) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) will start their
annual meeting here Friday to work out new strategies to meet a
series of political, social and economic challenges facing the
group.
</P>
<P>
Since the ministers met in Malaysia a year ago, drastic
political, social and economic changes have taken place in the
region of ASEAN, which groups Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Brunei, Vietnam, Laos and
Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Mainly due to a one-year-old regional financial crisis,
economic growth in most ASEAN members has slowed down to a pace
that is a far cry from what used to be the highest in the world;
political unrest has forced Thailand and Indonesia to change
guards; social stability in other Southeast Asian countries has
also been undermined by protests, strikes and riots; the recent
nuclear tests by India and Pakistan have raised tension in South
Asia and the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
In Cambodia, where a general election is scheduled for Sunday,
a lasting peace needs more efforts by all the political parties in
the country and assistance from the international community,
including the ASEAN, which would accept Cambodia as a 10th member
in the future.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts said, the continuation of the financial
crisis and the deterioration of the economic situation are posing
the most grave challenge to the ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
Over the past year, countries in the region have been severely
affected by the financial turmoil. Since Thailand floated its
currency, the baht, on July 2, 1997, a wave of currency
devaluations has spread over Southeast Asia, and the currencies of
Thailand, the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore have
lost 15 percent to nearly 80 percent of their value.
</P>
<P>
The currency devaluations have led to high interest rates,
soaring inflation and an increase in U.S. dollar-denominated
foreign debts in Southeast Asia. The crisis has thrown millions of
Southeast Asians out of work as corporations are forced to close
or trim their payrolls, or downsize for the sake of survival.
</P>
<P>
In Indonesia alone, 13.4 million people have lost their jobs, a
five-fold increase from the pre-crisis level.
</P>
<P>
With the full-blown impact being felt this year, Indonesia and
Thailand have entered a period of economic recession during the
first half of the year. Malaysia also saw a negative 1.8-percent
growth in its gross domestic product in the first quarter, while
the Philippine economy increased by only 1.7 percent, much lower
than its target.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: ASEAN Facing Greater Challenges (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What has made the economic situation turn from bad to worse is
the economic recession in Japan and a weak yen in particular. The
Japanese economy has registered negative growth in two consecutive
quarters, the first quarter of this year and the last quarter of
1997. The recession failed to lift the weak yen, which fell to 146
against the greenback in mid-June and around 140 since the U.S.
intervention on June 16.
</P>
<P>
The yen's weakness has rendered ASEAN products less attractive
to Japanese consumers, blocking ASEAN exports to Japan. In April,
Japan's imports from ASEAN countries declined by 26 percent
compared with that a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The slump in the Japanese economy would impede the economic
recovery of ASEAN countries from the current crisis as Japan is
Southeast Asia's major creditor, economists here noted.
</P>
<P>
Since ASEAN is facing the severe economic challenge, the ASEAN
Ministerial Meeting and its related meetings -- the 5th ASEAN
Regional Forum and the Post Ministerial Conference -- are an
incomparable opportunity to put focus on the financial crisis and
consider its implications for the countries within Asia and for
those beyond the region.
</P>
<P>
Under the region's deteriorating economic situation, forest
fires in Indonesia and other ASEAN countries over the past year
have caused huge economic losses and environmental problems in the
region. According to estimates by environmental watchdogs, forest
fire-related losses in 1997 amounted to more than 3 billion U.S.
dollars mainly in Indonesia and Malaysia, with an additional 1.4
billion dollars in economic losses for the region from the haze
generated by the fires.
</P>
<P>
Although most of the fires have been put out by rains so far in
these countries, renewed threat of fires and smogs emerged again
with fresh forest fires reported in Indonesia's Sumatra.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said ASEAN countries must find out ways to change the
slash-and-burn tradition to eliminate sources of forest fires,
which have eaten up thousands of hectares of forests in the region
in the past year.
</P>
<P>
As the founding fathers of ASEAN dreamed of an association
comprising all countries in Southeast Asia, nine countries in the
region have joined ASEAN, leaving out only Cambodia, which is now
the key to the realization of the dream. At last year's ASEAN
Ministerial Meeting, the political developments in Cambodia
prevented the group from accepting the country as a new member.
Since then, the ASEAN has made great efforts to promote peace in
Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
The country's general election next week could pave the way for
its membership, but ASEAN countries need to continue to express
concern and extend fraternal cooperation and assistance to ensure
a lasting peace in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, according to Philippine Foreign Secretary Domingo
Siazon, chairman of this year's ASEAN ministerial meeting, the
ASEAN is not turning a blind eye to the nuclear tests conducted by
India and Pakistan earlier this year and the ASEAN Ministerial
Meeting and its related meetings will pursue this issue.
</P>
<P>
Observers believe that so long as ASEAN members make joint
efforts and continue their cooperation, they can tackle all these
problems and make new contributions to peace and development in
the region and the rest of the world.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Plans to Lift Rice Import Restrictions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is
planning to remove existing import restrictions on three sensitive
agricultural products -- sugar, rice and corn -- to help producers
cope with the rising cost of production.
</P>
<P>
The National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA), the
country's socio-economic planning agency, is studying the issue,
the newspaper Business World reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
NEDA Secretary General Felipe Medalla was quoted as saying
while the NEDA is aware of the prospective policy's impact on
farmers, the government faces a pressing concern to see to it that
the economic environment is not too restrictive for industries.
</P>
<P>
"Any protection on agricultural products is anti-industry ...
and anything that makes food expensive is a tax on food," he said.
</P>
<P>
Medalla said that in the Philippines, almost 50 percent of an
average worker's money is spent on food, indicating the importance
of removing the importation restrictions.
</P>
<P>
"What we are aiming for is to privatize the decision to
import," he said.
</P>
<P>
Medalla said the proposed policy is in line with the new
administration's action agenda which puts top priority on food
security.
</P>
<P>
Estrada has promised to guarantee food security by abolishing
the monopoly of the National Food Authority on food importation.

<HEADLINE> Using CDs To Preserve Tibetan Medicine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese experts are considering
the use of CDs as a means of preserving Tibetan medicine,
sources at the Tibetan Medical College say.
</P>
<P>
Tibetans began using plants, minerals, and animal organs to
treat diseases in the 4th century B.C. Tibetan medicine has proven
effective in treating some chronic ailments that did not respond
to more modern methods, but science provides no good explanations
for this.
</P>
<P>
Medical records interspersed with Buddhist scriptures contain
some 20,000 prescriptions, many of which are not recorded anywhere
else, and some have been lost during the chaos of history.
</P>
<P>
Scholars expect to put the "Four Classics" of Tibetan medicine
onto discs as well as hundreds of prescriptions collected by
Choru Cerang, one of a handfull of surviving Tibetan medicine
masters.
</P>
<P>
The discs can preserve Tibetan medicine and help in its study
by means of technology, scholars say. China has spent 3 million
yuan (370,000 U.S. dollars) recording Cerang's lectures on Tibetan
medicine. These materials will be put onto discs.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government now encourages the use of Tibetan
medicine in other parts of China, and has begun a program to help
foreigners learn more about it. At least 20 countries have Tibetan
medical research institutes or use the methods.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Government Sees Lower Inflation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' inflation rate,
which peaked at 10.7 percent in June 1998, will likely recede in
the rest of the year, the Philippine Journal reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Socio-economic Planning Secretary Felipe Medalla was quoted by
the newspaper as saying that the National Economic and Development
Authority (NEDA) expects the inflation rate to start going down
starting in July.
</P>
<P>
Medalla, who is also secretary general of NEDA, also predicted
that interest rates, determined each week by the benchmark 91-day
Treasury Bills, could still go down some more "but realistically
not to its pre-crisis level of less than 10 percent."
</P>
<P>
The benchmark rate went down on Monday by 56.3 basis points to
14.195 percent from 14.756 percent last week, according to the
Bureau of Treasury. The slowdown is expected to be reflected in
the lending rates of banks.
</P>
<P>
Medalla confirmed that inflation will average above 10 percent
under the new method using the base year 1994.
</P>
<P>
He said the government will put in place macroeconomic policies
consistent with relatively low inflation and interest rates to
achieve overall growth of 2 to 3 percent this year and domestic
growth of 1.5 percent up to 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Medalla said the recent uptrend in inflation could not be
attributed to wrong macroeconomic policies but to food supply
constraints and to increased uncertainty in the financial markets
in general.

<HEADLINE> Peru Wishes to Solve Border Disputes With Ecuador Peacefully </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, July 20, (xinhua) -- Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori
reiterated on Monday that Peru would end negotiations with Ecuador
on the border disputes peacefully.
</P>
<P>
"I am reiterating the firm certainty that the Peruvian
Government wants to end the conversations of peace according to
the law, and to what is already being said," said Fujimori in a
message congratulating Jamil Mahuad on his election as president
of Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
Peru and Ecuador are trying to negotiate a lasting agreement on
the border dispute, which has already caused three armed clashes
in more than half a century.
</P>
<P>
"We will participate with a real desire for peace, political
assertiveness, good will, and a desire to achieve a better
integration among our societies," Fujimori said.
</P>
<P>
Fujimori will go to a ceremony of transfer of the presidency of
Ecuador on August 10, 1998.
</P>
<P>
And ambassador of Ecuador to Peru Horacio Sevilla said on
Monday that the President-elected has the intention of continuing
the peace negotiations until the two nations reach a final

<HEADLINE> Chinese Say More Cows Are Needed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Some experts in Hangzhou, the
capital of east China's Zhejiang Province, say that more attention
needs to be paid to the dairy industry in China.
</P>
<P>
Chinese eat a lot of pork and less milk, and replacing pigs
with cows could give Chinese healthier bodies, while reducing the
amount of grain consumption, these members of the China Rice
Institute and the Zhejiang Provincial Academy of Agricultural
Sciences say.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese are mainly engaged in grain production and raising
pigs and are not so used to foods like milk and cheese and Chinese
milk output is only about 1 percent of the world's total, but its
population accounts for a fifth of the world's total.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the average per-capita daily intake of protein for
Chinese was 64.2 g., 20 percent of that from animal products. The
world's average was 70.9 g.
</P>
<P>
By 2000, if the average amount of protein intake for Chinese
reaches the world's level of 1996, the country will need to
produce 6.27 million tons more animal protein, which means it
needs 16 million tons of fodder if cows are used, or 49 million
tons, if pigs are used, researchers say.
</P>
<P>
Cows produce the same amount of animal protein but use 65
percent less feed, they say and point out that pigs are fed with
grain, and that 540 million tons of grain, which is the output of
36 million ha. of farmland, are needed to produce 49 million tons
of fodder and this does not fit China's reality.
</P>
<P>
In addition, cows mainly feed on grass and straw, which
requires a much smaller growing area than that needed for pigs,
according to the experts.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Seeks Changes in ICC Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Monday that it would oppose ratification and implementation of a
treaty of setting up an International Criminal Court (ICC) if
its demand for changes to the treaty should be turned down.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin told reporters the
United States was at odds with the treaty in its present form
because it could adopt frivolous or politically motivated
war-crime prosecutions against U.S. military personnel
conducting operations abroad.
</P>
<P>
"It could inhibit the ability of the United States to meet
alliance obligations and participate in international
peacekeeping operations," he said at a regular briefing.
</P>
<P>
The treaty of setting up the International Criminal Court was
approved in Rome By 120 countries last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said the court would be deluged with complaints from
well-meaning individuals and organizations that would want the
court to redress every wrong in the world. "This will turn the
court into a human rights ombudsman and limit its ability to
investigate the most serious crimes," he said.
</P>

it. It needs some repair work, desperately," he said.

<HEADLINE> Romania Raises Taxes to Decrease Budgetary Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The taxes are to be raised in
Romania due to the increased budgetary deficit, informed sources
of the Finance Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The budgetary deficit increased beyond the expectations in the
first semester of this year. Therefore, the government has to find
new resources to keep the budgetary deficit within the 3.6 percent
of GDP limit as it was stated in the agreements signed with the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
The 1998 budget, which was adopted in May this year, would have
to be revised in August.
</P>
<P>
During the budget alteration, the ministry would make cuts on
budgetary expenses at all state institutions as well as the
companies subsidized by the state, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Without specifying neither the tax raise percentage nor the tax
categories which would be raised, advisor to the Finance Minister
Cornel Tirhoaca stated that "at present, there are categories of
taxes which are lower than in other countries."
</P>
<P>
He added that the tax raise would increase the budget by 3
percent of the GDP.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Fails in Agreement with Panama on Drug Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Monday
expressed pessimism over negotiations with Panama to establish
an international drug interdiction center in the country.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin acknowledged the impasse
that the negotiations are now in, saying "the prospects are not
good."
</P>
<P>
During two years of the negotiations, the United States
insisted that the U.S. military be allowed to carry out
unilateral activities such as search and rescue operations,
training flights, humanitarian relief and logistical support
beyond Panama's borders after Washington hands over the
authority of the Panama Canal in 1999.
</P>
<P>
But Panama has objected to the U.S. suggestions and the
negotiations have so far been in stalemate.
</P>
<P>
Failure to reach an agreement would mean the United States
must withdraw its military forces from Panama by the end of
1999, when the Panama Canal reverts to local control under terms
of the Panama Canal treaties. It would mean an end to
Panama-based operations by the U.S. military aimed at curbing
flows of U.S.-bound cocaine from South America.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said that in the light of the impasse, the United
States has decided to begin pursuit of alternative
anti-narcotics arrangements with other governments.
</P>
<P>
"This doesn't mean that these negotiations won't ever yield
success, but it means the prospects are not good and therefore
we need to be able to be making alternative arrangements," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Starr Speeds up White House Scandal Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Independent Counsel Kenneth
Starr, who is investigating the White House scandal, brought the
grand jury in for an extra day this week to hear testimony by U.S.
President Bill Clinton's bodyguards and major witness Linda Tripp.
</P>
<P>
The closed-door panel that has been hearing evidence since
January in the case of alleged illicit sex and cover-up is
expected to meet Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, adding a session
to its usual schedule of Tuesday and Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, Starr summoned seven current and former Secret
Service personnel to the federal courthouse in Washington, minutes
after Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist rejected a
Justice Department appeal.
</P>
<P>
Starr's staff is reportedly putting in long hours during the
week and on weekends at the counsel's office.
</P>
<P>
However, Starr's spokesman Charles Bakaly discouraged reports
of any timetable for finishing the inquiry or delivering a final
report to Congress.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court decision to let Secret Service employees
testify was a setback for the Clinton administration, which had
argued in court that the president's bodyguards should have a
so-called protective function privilege, which would shield them
against being compelled to testify about what they witness while
on duty.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Secret Service, Tripp is expected to return
for more testimony before the grand jury. After six full days of
testimony, Tripp, her lawyers had said, still has more to say to
the panel.
</P>
<P>
Tripp taped some 20 hours of telephone talk with former White
House intern Monica Lewinsky, which reportedly involves discussion
of a presidential affair.
</P>
<P>
Both Lewinsky and Clinton have denied the affair in sworn
statements.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Furor Over Secrecy of Mandela's Wedding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Doubtful secrecy over South
African President Nelson Mandela's marriage to Graca Machel on
Saturday frustrated local and international media, which
questioned the credibility of the president's office Monday.
</P>
<P>
Presidential spokesman Parks Mankahlana had categorically
denied that the wedding was to take place.
</P>
<P>
The Star newspaper wrote on Monday that for three days it
insisted it was true that Mandela and Machel were getting
married, and for three days the president's office denied it. But
The Star was right.
</P>
<P>
As late as Friday afternoon, Mandela's office made an appeal
to the media to discontinue the "false rumors" that the president
was to get married on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"The rumors are false and we would like the president and his
family to enjoy the tranquillity they deserve on his 80th
birthday," Mankahlana said.
</P>
<P>
Cape Town's Afrikaans daily, Die Burger, in an editorial
Monday called for Mankahlana's dismissal because his credibility
as the presidential spokesman had collapsed, according to South
African Press Association (SAPA).
</P>
<P>
The South African National Editors Forum (SANEF) said although
the wedding was a private affair, it was badly handled by
Mandela's office.
</P>
<P>
"We acknowledge that this is private affair... but from the
presidential spokesman's point of view, I believe there were
better ways of handling it than it has been," said SANEF
chairman, Mike Siluma.
</P>
<P>
It was important that the presidential aide be trusted, even
on a not important function like a wedding, he said.
</P>
<P>
Brendon Boyle, head of Reuters' southern African bureau, also
said the matter was mishandled.
</P>
<P>
"For the president's office to deliberately mislead the media
once the news of the wedding had been leaked, sets a very
dangerous precedent for the future," Boyle said.
</P>
<P>
Other reports said Monday that only two to three photographers
and one TV crew were invited and were apparently selling the
pictures and footage at exorbitant prices.
</P>
<P>
One photographer was reportedly selling the Mandela/Machel
wedding pictures at a price of 1,000 U.S. Dollars per photo.
</P>
<P>
The big question raised on Monday by various media
organizations was who was the beneficiary of the proceeds from
the wedding footage and photo sales as there had been no clarity
on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The suspicion was that people were taking advantage of
Mandela's international stature to enrich themselves.
</P>
<P>
The Star said the veil of secrecy thrown over the wedding was
at least partly to protect the interests of a publishing company
which had bought the rights to the story for an undisclosed
amount of money.
</P>
<P>
It said Mafube intended to produce a special publication on
the wedding in two weeks' time.
</P>
<P>
But Mafube denied the allegations, saying it paid nothing to
be at Mandela's wedding.
</P>
<P>
In a statement on Monday evening, Mandela's office admitted
that it might have overstepped the mark in its attempt to uphold
Mandela's privacy in his marriage.
</P>
<P>
"It is possible that the office of the president and its
officials overstepped the mark in its attempt to uphold the
president's privacy," the office said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
But it argued that this was a matter of conjecture about which
there would always be argumentation.
</P>
<P>
"We would urge our detractors not to conflate government
policy with the private wishes of the presidential couple," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
It said officials of the president's office understood the
considerable frustration of the media in not being able to
publish and have access to the wedding.
</P>
<P>
"The president's marriage was, and still is, a very popular
story which every news organization or newspaper would like to
report on. It at the same time remained a private matter," the
statement said.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Leader Announces New Economic Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Head of State General
Abdulsalam Abubakar Monday night announced a new package of
economic policies, including the cancellation of the dual
exchange system, improved infrastructure and others.
</P>
<P>
In a nationally televised broadcast, Abubakar announced the
cancellation of the dual exchange system, one being the fixed 22
Naira to one U.S. Dollar and the other market-determined rate of
about 85 Naira to one Dollar.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar also promised to improve the country's
infrastructure, including better power and fuel supply, improved
telecommunications and transportation services.
</P>
<P>
To this end, he said the government will give up its minimum
of 40 percent ownership in major state-owned firms such as the
National Electrical Power Authority and the Nigerian
Telecommunications, among others.
</P>
<P>
The proceeds from the process, he said, will be used to pay
the country's foreign debt, which stood at 27 billion U.S.
Dollars as at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar promised to invest more on the oil industry, which
provides more than 70 percent of the government's revenue and 90
percent of the country's foreign currency income.
</P>
<P>
He has ordered the immediate negotiation of a medium term
economic plan with the World Bank and the International Monetary
Fund.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria will also start discussions with the Paris Club on
debt relief, he said, adding that his government will liberalize
the current debt conversion program to attract more foreign
investment.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar promised to review the salary system for civil
servants annually, for which he ordered the suspension of the
rationalization practice initiated by former head of state late
General Sani Abacha last year.
</P>
<P>
He also announced that as a means to combat rampant
corruption, all contracts for constructions and supply of
equipment, goods and services will hereafter be subject to
competitive bidding.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Sets New Date for Military Handover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Head of State General
Abdulsalam Abubakar Monday night unveiled a much-awaited new date
for the end of the military rule in the country.
</P>
<P>
In a broadcast to the nation which was just concluded, General
Abubakar said the presidential elections will be completed at the
end of the first quarter 1999 and the president elect will be
inaugurated on May 29 that year.
</P>
<P>
The announcement gave an eight-month delay to the military
government's transition to civil rule program set by former head
of state late General Sani Abacha, who died of heart attack on
June 8.
</P>
<P>
Under Abacha's program, presidential elections would be held
from August 1 this year and the president elect be sworn in on
October 1.
</P>
<P>
The major policy change is a result of the wide consultations
between Abubakar's government and various interest groups across
the country since Abubakar became the head of state the second
day after the sudden death of Abacha.
</P>
<P>
The soft-spoken general also announced the dissolution of the
five registered political parties and the National Electoral
Commission of Nigeria with immediate effect, to be replaced by a
truly independent new one.
</P>
<P>
Both the parties and the commission were set up during
Abacha's time.
</P>
<P>
The results of state and national assembly elections already
conducted have also been cancelled for new arrangements, because
of their lack of credibility and acceptability, Abubakar said.
</P>
<P>
Contrary to widespread speculations, Abubakar, 56, ruled out
the establishment of a government of national unity as demanded
by some groups.
</P>
<P>
He said such a government poses dangers that are unacceptable
to his administration.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar, however, promised to form a new cabinet that will
accommodate various interest groups.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet formed by Abacha in mid-December last year was
dissolved under the order of Abubakar about two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
He also announced the release of all political detainees as a
means to further promote national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
About 40 political detainees have been freed since Abubakar
assumed office. Ten of them were released earlier Monday.

<HEADLINE> Romania Granting Interest Credits for Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The Romanian government Monday
announced a package of measures, including a wheat fund, to
protect domestic farmers.
</P>
<P>
Romania is expected to record this year a good wheat crop, but
the farmers are worrying about the market, as the world's wheat
price is the lowest in the last 17 years. Since customs duties for
wheat and flour are quite low, there is the risk that Romanian
market will be invaded by imported wheat and flour.
</P>
<P>
According to Minister of Agriculture Dinu Gavrilescu, the
government wanted to set up a wheat fund worth 1,000 billion lei
(115 million U.S. dollars) for granting credits with 50 percent
subsidized interest to the wheat storage units and those of
milling and bakery that buy Romanian wheat.
</P>
<P>
The Government agreed at the same time to allocate 200 billion
lei (23 million U.S. dollars) from the budget to purchase and
store wheat from Romanian producers.
</P>
<P>
The customs duties on imported wheat and flour are also to be
increased from a present 15-25 percent to 60 percent to protect
domestic producers.

<HEADLINE> Warring Burundians Meet for Second Round of Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The second round of peace
talks for the warring Burundian government and all the opposition
factions started Monday in Arusha, northern Tanzania, to continue
the national reconciliation process.
</P>
<P>
The delegates studied carefully a set of rules of procedure
issued by Julius Nyerere, the founding president of Tanzania and
facilitator for the Burundi conflicts, which set code for face to
face talks, sources from Arusha said.
</P>
<P>
Two new factions, ANNADE and RADDES, joined this time with the
other 17 partners present at the first round of talks in Arusha,
in discussion at the Arusha International Conference Center.
</P>
<P>
Observers said the second round will be more difficult and may
stretch longer because it will tackle nature of the conflicts and
reform of the justice and security in the war-torn central
African republic.
</P>
<P>
The government was represented by Ambrose Niyonsaba, the
Minister for Peace Process, on behalf of President Pierre Buyoya
who attended the first round of talks.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Nyerere held informal talks with FRODEBU President
Dr. Jean Minani, and special envoy from the European Union Aldo
Ajello while his aides met separately with other parties.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that warring parties will put their heads together to
bring peace in Burundi," an aide to Nyerere said.
</P>
<P>
Salim Ahmed Salim, the Secretary General of the Organization
of African Unity (OAU), was also present at the talks for the
first time since the first week-long round of talks which issued
a joint declaration to deal with the problems of genocide,
refugees, peace and public security and others.
</P>
<P>
"All armed parties to the conflict (agree to) declare a
suspension of hostilities to take effect not later than the 20th
of July 1998, (We) pledge to resolve the Burundi conflict through
peaceful means, and to put an end to all forms of violence." the
declaration said.
</P>
<P>
"We will create a climate of lasting peace in our country and
bring to an end the constant cycle of violence and fratricidal
killings which have afflicted Burundi for a long time," it said.
</P>
<P>
However, so far there has not been any formal declaration of
end of hostilities among the warring factions and there are still
reports of civilian killings by armed rebels in southern Burundi.
</P>
<P>
Supported by the African leaders and the international
community, the 76-year-old Nyerere began his mediation since July
1996 when seven east and central African countries imposed
economic sanctions on Bujumbura following a military coup which
toppled a civilian governemnt led by President Ntibantunganya and
brought Major Buyoya to power.
</P>
<P>
In May, Nyerere met separately in Dar es Salaam with all the
Burundi factions leaders in preparation to make the Arusha talks
a success which may lead to an early lifting of the economic
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
As a gesture to answer the calls by sanctions imposers and to
ease the internal tension, Major Buyoya, an ethnic Tutsi, signed
later a new transitional constitution and named two vice
presidents including an ethnic Hutu leader of the main opposition
party.
</P>
<P>
More than 150,000 people, mostly civilians, have died in
bloody conflicts between the ethnic Hutu majority and the ruling
Tutsi minority since the assassination of Melchior Ndadaye, the
first president elected under a multi-party system in 1993.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Shilling Strongest vs U.S. Dollar Since </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan Shilling Monday
reached its strongest exchange rate against the U.S. Dollar since
last August when a multi-million-Dollar aid package was suspended
by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
Some local traders said they were expecting the Shilling to
strengthen further in the near future while analysts warned the
currency is already overvalued and may not be able to sustain
these levels indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) posted the Shilling at a
commercial mean-opening rate of 59.3878 to the Dollar, its
strongest opening rate since August 1, 1997, according to CBK
data.
</P>
<P>
At 12:00 a.m. local time (0900 GMT), the Shilling was at
around 59.30/45 to the Dollar, said the dealers.
</P>
<P>
Traders said the Shilling's direction was mainly driven by
trade flows, with speculative activity relatively low. Meanwhile,
they put as the next target 59.00 Shillings to the Dollar.
</P>
<P>
The Shilling fell drastically last August to around 70 to the
Dollar after the IMF cut the key loan citing corruption and poor
governance in the east African country.
</P>
<P>
The Shilling's previous strongest opening for 1998 was
59.4006, set on July 3, CBK data shows.

Brushing aside accusations that he was squeezing the car-lovers
of Middle England, Prescott told parliament: "The most anti-car
policy is to do nothing. Pro-public transport does not mean being
anti-car."
</P>
<P>
Prescott predicted that without action now, traffic on
Britain's already crowded roads would grow by 30 percent in the
next 20 years. Carbon dioxide emissions would increase 10 percent
at a time when Britain is required under last year's Kyoto accord
on global warming to cut emissions of so-called greenhouse gases.
</P>
<P>
He said local councils will be given powers to charge car
drivers for using congested roads and for workplace parking. The
cash raised will be ring-fenced for spending on the public
transport system, a new departure in Britain where revenue has
traditionally gone straight to the Treasury.
</P>
<P>
The government's Highways Agency will be given new powers to
pilot road charging schemes and use the income to reinvest in the
road network.
</P>
<P>
Under the new plan, there will be new moves to provide safe
routes for children to walk or cycle to school to end the
congestion caused by parents driving them there at peak hours.
</P>
<P>
Pensioners will also be given a national concessionary fare
scheme, guaranteeing them at least half-price bus fares.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Prescott spelt out a range of measures to improve
the privatized rail network, while ruling out any return to public
ownership.
</P>
<P>
According to him, an extra 100 million pounds will be invested
to the rail industry and a new strategic rail authority will be
set up, which will police Britain's privatized rail network and
provide tougher regulation of rail companies.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urges Japan to Speak Less, Do More on Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Monday
urged Japan to speak less and do more for recovery from
recession.
</P>
<P>
"Japan needs to speak less and carry a big stick," Assistant
U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said. "They need to
demonstrate by what they do, not by what they say they might do,
to turn this thing around."
</P>
<P>
Gaithner made the remarks as three candidates are fighting
to take over Japan's premiership after Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto resigned a week ago on losing support in an Upper
House of Parliament election.
</P>
<P>
All of them have promised to try and wrench the world's second
biggest economy from a deep and painful recession. And Japanese
people are awaiting the outcome of the three-horse race.
</P>
<P>
Geithner reiterated U.S. demands for Japan to take urgent
steps to stimulate domestic demand, clean up the ailing
financial sector and deregulate financial markets.
</P>
<P>
Geithner, who last week returned from a brief visit to Japan,
said it was unclear whether the political upheaval in Japan
would help to push the reform process ahead.
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to say at this stage what the prospects will be,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> Britain Catches More Illegal Immigrants Than Before </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The number of illegal immigrants
caught trying to sneak into Britain had risen from 330 a month
last year to 550 a month this year, the government said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We don't know whether more people are coming through or
whether we are being more successful catching them," a Home Office
(interior ministry) spokeswoman told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"People are coming in from the (European) continent on freight
lorries, but they may have originated from anywhere and come in as
a part of a trafficking route," she said.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokeswoman, police last week disarmed 15
Turkish Kurd immigrants who retaliated with screwdrivers and
broken bottles after they were found to have stowed away on a
ferry to the port of Folkestone.
