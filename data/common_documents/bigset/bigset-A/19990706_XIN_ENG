<HEADLINE> Russian Forces Launch Preemptive Strike in Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Russian forces launched a preemptive
strike early Monday against some 150-200 militants inside its
breakaway Chechen republic, killing a number of rebels, Interior
Minister Vladimir Rushailo said.
</P>
<P>
The operation was taken at around 06:00 and involved helicopter
gunships and mortars, Rushailo said following a meeting with
President Boris Yeltsin, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"The militants sustained casualties. We know from intercepts of
radio messages that a number of militants were killed," the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue doing our best to prevent cross-border
attacks from Chechnya on our checkpoints and civilians," he said.
</P>
<P>
The move came after Rushailo's announcement last Saturday that
orders had been given to deliver "preventive strikes on places of
concentration of guerrillas and hardware discovered through
intelligence activities."
</P>
<P>
He characterized the strikes as "a local operation to respond
to the attacks on our checkpoints and roadblocks" rather than
"strategic strikes on the Chechen territory," Rushailo said in an
interview with the RTR television Vesti program.
</P>
<P>
Russia dispatched a temporary group of 17,000 troops in the
North Caucasus region, with 10,000 of them constantly deployed on
the Chechen border.
</P>
<P>
There have been frequent attacks on checkpoints and civilians
in the areas along the administrative border with Chechnya in the
past few months. A number of bomb explosions in Moscow, notably
inside the reception center of the Federal Security Service and
the lobby of the Interior Ministry, were also believed to be
connected to the Chechen militants.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Syrian President Hafiz al-Assad
arrived here Monday for a two-day official visit to Russia seen as
a landmark in bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Assad, here on his first official visit to post-Soviet Russia,
was received at the airport by Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin and
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian president, leading a delegation that includes
foreign, defense and economics ministers, is scheduled to meet
Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Stepashin on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Very serious negotiations are planned on the most important
strategic issues, both on the situation in the Middle East and on
the bilateral relations," said Sergei Prikhodko, Yeltsin's deputy
chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
"Syria plays a key role (in the Middle East) and Russia is a
co-sponsor (of the Mideast peace process). So it largely depends
on their interaction how stable peace in that region will be," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will also discuss economic issues, Prikhodko
said.
</P>
<P>
"For a number of years, right until last year, economic
relations between our countries were unfortunately in a state of
stagnation," Prikhodko said.
</P>
<P>
"It was only recently that a tendency for an increase became
evident. Undoubtedly, both presidents will make every effort to
sustain this increase," he said.
</P>
<P>
Assad last visited Moscow in 1990, when Russia was still part
of the Soviet Union.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Launches Investment Guide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Investment
Authority Monday said an investment guide designed to enhance the
inflows of foreign direct investment to Ethiopia was launched in
Geneva, Switzerland on the same day.
</P>
<P>
General Manager of the authority Tadesse Haile told press here
that the investment guide, which would be distributed to foreign
investors around the globe, featured the economic and political
landscape of Ethiopia as well as the prevailing investment
environment and opportunities in the country.
</P>
<P>
The guide would promote the favorable investment image of
Ethiopia and help attract foreign capital, trade, investment and
technology to it, he added.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia's endeavors to achieve socio-economic transformation
coupled with the promising democratization process had enabled the
country to get the support of the the United Nations Conference on
Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and the International Chamber of
Commerce, the general manager noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that Ethiopia is one of the six least developed
countries supported by the afore-mentioned international
organizations to prepare an investment guide. Bangladesh,
Madagascar, Mali, Mozambique and Uganda are the remaining five
countries.

<HEADLINE> Activists Meet to Push Forward Mideast Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of peace activists gathered
here Monday to call for momentum to the Middle East peace process,
which has increased hope of breakthrough now that Israel is about
to change the government.
</P>
<P>
The participants of the peace meeting included Egyptians,
Israelis, Jordanians and Palestinians. They met to seek ways of
promoting closer ties between Arab countries and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Moderate Ehud Barak, leader of the Israeli Labor Party,
trounced hardline incumbent Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu in the May 17 elections. Barak, pledging to advance the
Arab-Israeli peace talks, will assume power this week.
</P>
<P>
The peace meeting was organized by the International Alliance
for Arab-Israeli Peace that was set up in Denmark in 1997 by
Middle East lawmakers, religious leaders and intellectuals. The
group is also known as the Copenhagen group.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian former Prime Minister Mustafa Khalil, who chaired the
meeting, conveyed President Hosni Mubarak's greetings and wishes
of success to the conference for peace.
</P>
<P>
Khalil reviewed the peace-making between Egypt and Israel,
which resulted in the signing of the first peace treaty in 1979
between an Arab country and the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
"We celebrated the 20th anniversary of the signing of the peace
treaty, and our responsibility is to defend peace," he told the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
"Peace between Egypt and Israel had been for long seen as
impossible but we have overcome all obstacles and eventually
achieved peace," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, before the peace meeting opened in the evening,
hundreds of Egyptian politicians, artists and writers gathered
earlier in the day to protest the conference.
</P>
<P>
The protesters met inside a hall to hear speeches condemning
Egypt's 1979 peace treaty with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the peace treaty say Arabs should have no
relations with the Jewish state until it withdraws from all
territories it occupied after the 1967 Mideast war, including east
Jerusalem.

<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Four west African presidents are
scheduled to hold a one-day meeting Tuesday with key officials of
the rebels in Sierra Leone in a bid to resolve "sticking points"
in the draft pact to end the eight-year crisis in that country.
</P>
<P>
A top official of the Nigerian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said
here Monday that Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo and his
counterparts Charles Taylor of Liberia, Tejan Kabbah of Sierra
leone and Gnassingbe Eyadema of Togo would attend the talks in
Togolese capital Lome tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
The unidentified official pointed out that "we are working on
bringing key officials of the rebel group, including its military
leader, Sam Bockarie to the talks."
</P>
<P>
The talks are coming two days after "rank and file members" of
the rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF) reportedly rejected as
"not enough" the four cabinet posts offered in the draft
agreement.
</P>
<P>
"The People's War Council has told me that it is not enough,"
leader of the rebel RUF Foday Sankoh reportedly said, referring to
the four positions offered to the rebels in a national unity
government.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh, who has been involved in six weeks of talks in the
Togolese capital, said that the council insists on the seven posts
as well as the position of the vice-president in the government of
national unity.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministry official was, however, optimistic about
the prospects of Tuesday's mini-summit in resolving the
outstanding issues of the peace talks hosted by President Eyadema,
current chairman of the Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS).
</P>

He noted that "we want to make sure all the key officials
attend the meeting, particularly those in the bush, to ensure we
extract an agreement from them."

<P>
LUSAKA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Ministers attending the peace talks
for ending the 11-month conflict in the Democratic Republic of
Congo (DRC) in Zambian capital Lusaka put final touches Monday to
a long-awaited draft cease-fire document.
</P>
<P>
Zambian Presidential Affairs Minister Eric Silwamba told
reporters that a sub-committee set up by the ministers had worked
overnight to finish papers which set out the cease-fire terms.
</P>
<P>
Silwamba said the sub-committee worked late into the early
hours of Monday morning to finish all documents to be adopted by
the ministers at a plenary session later.
</P>
<P>
The adoption of the draft pact would be followed by a heads of
state signing ceremony with the date to be announced soon, said
the minister.
</P>
<P>
The regional summit in Lusaka, which had dragged on for 11
days, was aimed at ending almost a year of fighting between rebels
and Congolese government forces.
</P>
<P>
Three Congolese rebel groups and a government delegation led by
 Congolese Foreign Minister Abdoulaye Yerodia Ndombasi have agreed
that a new national army would be created out of the rebel forces
and the government army.
</P>
<P>
The government and the rebels also appear to agree in principle
on the withdrawal of foreign troops from the vast central African
country.
</P>
<P>
Silwamba said the problem of obtaining documents in both
English and French had delayed the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The foreign countries involved in the conflict -- rebel allies
Rwanda and Uganda, and the government backers Namibia, Angola and
Zimbabwe also appear to have resolved their main differences.
</P>
<P>
The ministerial meeting started last Monday, attended by
defense, home and foreign affairs ministers from the 14 Southern
African Development Community (SADC) member states, as well as
Rwanda, Uganda and Libya.

Lesser Tunbs.
</P>
<P>
They also set up a tripartite committee with members from
Saudi Arabia, Oman and Qatar to work out a mechanism for direct
negotiations with Iran.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was the continuation of the 71th session of the GCC
Ministerial Council. The session was suspended in June because of
a row between the UAE and Saudi Arabia over the latter's efforts
to improve ties with Iran.
</P>
<P>
The UAE has always required its GCC allies to help solve the
islands dispute first before warming up relations with Iran.
</P>
<P>
The row was difused later following the mediation efforts
by Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa Al Thani.

<HEADLINE> Brent Oil Breaks 18 Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Crude Oil prices powered higher
again on Monday driven by bullish sentiment surrounding strict
OPEC adherence to supply limits agreed earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
London August futures for benchmark Brent traded 50 cents
higher to 18.16 U.S. dollars a barrel, the highest oil price in 18
months and the bottom end of OPEC's target price range of between
18 and 20 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Market observers said evidence that the cartel's stringent
output limits, in place since April, were eating into surplus
stockpiles in the West was the main factor behind a rally which
has added 8 dollars to the price of oil from February's historic
lows.
</P>
<P>
Major OPEC producer Iran said on Sunday that it expected oil
prices to continue rising as a result of producer adherence to the
supply curbs forged with non-OPEC exporters.
</P>
<P>
Data from the United States last week showed falling crude
stocks and demand for gasoline and other petroleum products rising
faster than forecast.
</P>
<P>
Recovery in Asian demand has also bolstered the view among oil
market speculators that a hefty decline in global petroleum
stockpiles will force prices even higher later in the year.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts think the rapidity of the price rally may require
a decision by OPEC at its September meeting on the timing of any
upward adjustment to output quotas which would otherwise remain in
force until the end of March next year.

<HEADLINE> S. African Car Sales Down in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It said the decline of 15.6 percent -- 15,588 units down from
last year' s 18,474 units -- was a continuation of the difficult
and recessionary business conditions in the South African
automotive industry over the past two and three quarter years.
</P>
<P>
However Naamsa anticipated that the long-awaited turnaround in
the automotive industry would start in the third quarter of the
year, together with signs of some improvement in activity at
retail level.
</P>
<P>
Last month's sales also showed a "modest decline" of 327 units,
or two percent, compared with May.
</P>
<P>
"Sales of new light commercial vehicles, bakkies (light
delivery vehicles) and mini-buses at 7,965 units for June 1999
reflected a decline of 533 units or 6.3 percent compared to the
8,489 unit sales recorded during June 1998," Naamsa said.
</P>
<P>
"Compared to May 1999 - the latest month's sales of light
commercial vehicles had remained fully unchanged, recording a
slight fall of 11 units or 0.1 percent."
</P>
<P>
Naamsa also said medium and heavy truck sales also recorded
sharp declines last month and at 398 units and 425 units
respectively, reflected falls of 126 units or 24.1 percent,
compared to the sales levels of the corresponding month last year.
</P>
<P>
"However, both sectors had managed modest improvements compared
to the previous month's sales, rising by 12.4 percent (medium
commercials) and 1.0 percent (heavy trucks and busses)."
</P>
<P>
Vehicle sales were also sharply down in the last six months,
compared with the first half of last year - with new car sale
registering a fall of 18.4 percent, light commercial vehicles down
by 9.5 percent, medium commercial vehicles falling by 19.9 percent
and heavy trucks and busses by 21 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the significant and welcome reduction in interest
rates, private consumption expenditure in South Africa remained
under pressure and South African consumers generally appeared
reluctant to spend and incur additional debt.
</P>
<P>
"Investment trends, too, remained under pressure. However,
South Africa' s economic fundamentals were becoming progressively
more positive and conducive to further interest rate reductions
and a recovery in general economic activity levels during the
second half of the year."
</P>
<P>
"Despite an expected modest recovery during the second half of
1999, for the year as a whole the industry continued to anticipate
lower overall new vehicle sales compared to 1998."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Toyota announced Monday that the month just passed
was a " bumper month" in which it took 27.9 percent of the market
share, selling mostly Conquests, Hiluxes and Corollas.
</P>
<P>
"The month saw sales of individual model ranges move above
2,000 units for the first time in many months with Toyota selling
2,356 Conquests and 2, 142 Hilux commercial vehicles. Corolla
sales boosted Toyota's figures by a further 1,276 units."

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan President on SAARC Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga said here Monday evening that much more must be done
to make the potential of the South Asian Association for Regional
Cooperation (SAARC) tangible to the peoples of the region.
</P>
<P>
In her speech at a state banquet hosted in her honor by Nepali
King Birendra, Kumaratunga, who is also the current SAARC
chairman, noted that the member states have been able to follow up
systematically on the decisions taken at the 10th SAARC Summit
held in Colombo, Sri Lanka, in July last year.
</P>
<P>
"The process of our collective preparation for the forthcoming
WTO (World Trade Organization) ministerial round, which is almost
a synonym for globalization, is well under way," she said.
</P>
<P>
"We have made good progress in our contacts with the European
Union as well," she said. "We are poised to achieve a similar
positive outcome in our relationship with ASEAN (the Association
of South-East Asian Nations)."
</P>
<P>
She said the SAARC, which groups Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the
Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, has made some progress in
some other areas of mutual cooperation agreed upon at the Colombo
summit such as setting up a network for economic research and
working together on distance education.
</P>
<P>
"Much more, however, requires to be done to make the potential
of SAARC tangible to the peoples of South Asia," she stressed.
</P>
<P>
She noted that some of the technical cooperation activities
under the Integrated Program of Action have become desultory. She
called for greater purposefulness and vigor to be directed toward
this important area of the SAARC.
</P>
<P>
She also stressed steady progress in SAARC efforts on the SAARC
Preferential Trading Arrangement (SAPTA) and its later stage of
South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA).
</P>
<P>
She held that the respect and attention which the SAARC
receives from the outside world would be determined by the
strength and vitality of the SAARC's own regional programs.
</P>
<P>
SAARC leaders had preferred to set up the SAFTA by 2001 but
deferred it indefinitely at the Colombo summit.
</P>
<P>
The fourth round of trade negotiations under the SAPTA is
scheduled to start this month.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga arrived here Monday afternoon on a four-day state
visit. She is scheduled to visit the Kathmandu-based SAARC
Secretariat during her stay here.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Prime Minister-Elect Finalizes Coalition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister-elect Ehud
Barak officially wrapped up six-week-plus coalition talks Monday
and will present his cabinet list to the Knesset (parliament) for
approval Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The incoming seven-faction coalition comprises One Israel, the
ultra-Orthodox Shas Party, the United Torah Judaism, Meretz, the
Center Party, the Russian immigrants party Yisrael b'Aliya and
National Religious Party.
</P>
<P>
One Israel, consisting of the Labor Party, Gesher and the
moderate religious movement Meimad, is the biggest party in the
Knesset with 26 seats, which is followed by Shas with 17 seats.
</P>
<P>
Among the cabinet ministers he appointed Monday, Abraham
Shohat will be finance minister, Yossi Beilin justice minister
and Shlomo Ben-Ami public security minister.
</P>
<P>
Labor legislator Dalia Itzik will be the only one woman
minister in Barak's cabinet. She will head the Environment
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Former Prime Minister Shimon Peres will head a new ministry of
regional development, which will focus on economic cooperation
between Israel and its Arab neighbors. But he is at odds with
Barak over the responsibility of the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Israeli markets reacted nervously to the news that Shohat,
finance minister in the former Labor government in 1992-1996
with a bad reputation for overspending and loose financial
policy, will return to the post.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Tel Aviv-100 index was down 1.49 percent to
close at 421.02 points and Israeli shekel declined to 4.097
against the dollar from Friday's 4.075.
</P>
<P>
But some experts said it is unclear whether Shohat will repeat
his financial policy, which caused the budget and the current
account deficits to swell to dangerous levels, since Barak's
platform on economy has been drawn on very vague terms.
</P>
<P>
In an internal defiance to Barak who is regarded by many of his
colleagues as being left with too much power, the Labor central
committee rejected Barak's hand-picked candidate for the Knesset
speaker.
</P>
<P>
In a secret ballot, the central committee chose Avraham Burg,
No. 7 in the One Israel Knesset list, instead of Barak's choice,
Shalom Simhon, who has served only one term in the Knesset, as One
Israel's candidate for Knesset speaker.
</P>
<P>
The Knesset will elect a new speaker soon before it casts a
confidence vote on the new government Tuesday afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Croatia Ready to Boost Cooperation With Egypt: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic
said here on Monday that his country is ready to enhance economic
cooperation with Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after a meeting with his Egyptian
counterpart Amr Moussa, Granic described the talks as "fruitful
and constructive," Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that Croatia and Egypt are planning to sign an
agreement on preventing dual taxation, highlighting the close
cooperation between the two countries in various domains.
</P>
<P>
Granic arrived here on Sunday for a three-day visit. He is
scheduled to meet with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on
Tuesday, during which he is to convey a message to Mubarak from
Croatian President Franjo Tudjman.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said their discussions dealt with the political
developments of the situation in the Middle East, the Balkan
region and the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
Noting that a group of businessmen are accompanying the
Croatian foreign minister, Moussa played up chances for promoting
the bilateral economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Egypt and Croatia "are required to exert bulky
efforts to redress the deficiency in" the trade volume, which
stands at about 40 million U.S. dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the talks, the two sides signed three agreements
covering cultural cooperation, consultations between the two
countries' foreign ministries and revocation of visas for holders
of diplomatic passports.
</P>
<P>
Also Monday, Granic met with Egyptian Minister of Economy
Yousef Boutros Ghali to review prospects of furthering bilateral
economic cooperation, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed to set up a governmental mechanism to
oversee ways of promoting cooperation and to coordinate efforts
exerted by the two countries' businessmen in bolstering
investments.
</P>
<P>
During his ongoing visit, the Croatian official is also
expected to meet with Arab League Secretary General Esmat
Abdel-Meguid to seek ways of enhancing relations between Croatia
and the Arab world.

<HEADLINE> Regionalization Must Be Attended to: Mozambican </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican Foreign Minister Leonardo
Simao said Monday regionalization must be included in the agenda
of globalization because the economic globalization has not given
an answer to many questions raised by the southern hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
The agenda of globalization doesn't include such issues as
poverty elimination, stability promotion and welfare realization,
the minister said, while opening the conference on the cooperation
and integration in southern Africa here.
</P>
<P>
The globalization has not responded to the actual demand of the
Third World people, Simao said, adding: all signs indicate that
the next millenium will begin with the conflict between
globalization and regionalization.
</P>
<P>
The minister called upon participants at the two-day conference
to pay special attention to the analysis of the problems
concerning regionalization.
</P>
<P>
If the desires and aspirations of the people in this region
would not be attended to, then the regional economic integration
will become the tool for the region to achieve their social and
economic interests, said Simao.
</P>
<P>
The conference will also focus on such topics as the Basis of
the Regional Integration in Southern Africa and the Integration of
the Emerging Markets in Southern Africa, Asia and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was sponsored by the Strategic and International
Studies Center of the Superior Institute of the International
Relations of Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
Besides experts, diplomats in Maputo and members of the
Mozambican parliament were also attending the meeting which will
be closed Tuesday.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Malawi's clergy Monday held a
national service day of worship which calls for unity and peace in
the country before Malawians commemorate the 35th anniversary of
independence and republican status Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The service at the Chichiri International Conference Center in
Blantyre was graced by Malawian President Bakili Muluzi,
Vice-President Justing Malewezi and the newly appointed cabinet,
the Malawi News Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
One by one in turns, the clergy called for unity and peace
among Malawians as they delivered their prayers in their own mode
to the delight and satisfaction of the congregation that assembled
in the conference hall of worship.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the June 15 presidential and parliamentary
elections, the clergy generally praised them for their peaceful
conduct. Some isolated violent acts in some parts of the southern
African country were condemned.
</P>
<P>
Bishop Felix Mkhori urged Malawians to get rid of bitterness
and anger.
</P>
<P>
"If we surrender to the temptation to break the unity...we are
bound to compromise development and peace," said the bishop.

ATHENS, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Greece said Monday that 512 Albanian
illegal immigrants had been arrested in the northwestern Greek
region of Epirus over the past three days in a nationwide
crackdown on illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
The illegal Albanian immigrants would be deported in the coming
days.
</P>
<P>
The crackdown on illegal immigrants, mostly Albanian men, comes
after a meeting of the Greek government Council on Foreign Affairs
and Defense on Friday, which decided to hire about 2,500 more
police officers and border guards in a bid to curb illegal
immigration in the country.
</P>
<P>
Recently, cases of Albanian illegal immigrants breaking the law
have triggered fear among many Greeks, who now blame Albanians for
a rise in crime.

<HEADLINE> China Lodges Strong Protest against "Diplomatic Ties" between PNG and Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government has lodged a
strong protest with the Papua New Guinean government over its
signing of a communique on the establishment of "diplomatic ties"
with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were made by Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman
Zhang Qiyue here tonight when asked to comment on the move.
</P>
<P>
PNG Foreign Minister Roy Yaki signed earlier today with Taiwan'
s "Foreign Minister" Jason Hu a communique on the formation of "
diplomatic ties" between PNG and Taiwan during PNG Prime Minister
Bill Skate's visit to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that the Chinese side strongly urges the Papua New
Guinean government to correct its erroneous decision in signing
such a communique with Taiwan in order to bring the bilateral ties
between China and PNG back onto a normal track. "Otherwise, the
Papua New Guinean government must bear all responsibilities for
the serious consequences arising therefrom," she said.
</P>
<P>
She noted that it is widely acknowledged that there is only one
China in the world and the Government of the People's Republic of
China is the sole legal government of China and Taiwan is an
inalienable part of China.
</P>
<P>
"The PNG government's move of signing such a communique has
entirely violated its commitment towards the 'one China' policy,"
she said, adding that the move constitutes a serious infringement
of China's sovereignty and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
"The act has also seriously damaged the long term friendly ties
between China and PNG," she added.

<HEADLINE> Indian Diplomat Reported Abducted in Islamabad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The Indian High Commission in
Islamabad Monday accused Pakistan of abducting its diplomat for
the second time in a week.
</P>
<P>
The high commission said in a press release that one of its
staff members, Yog Raj Vij, was abducted in a pre-planned manner
by Pakistani intelligence operatives on Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Yog Raj Vij was kidnapped just outside his house on his return
from office and taken away in a vehicle to an unknown location,
said the press release.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, another commission staff member, T. R. Nair
was attacked and beaten up with sticks and received "injuries all
over his body," said the press release.
</P>
<P>
This abduction is "a serious and unacceptable incident" and "a
blatant violation of established norms," said the press release.
</P>
<P>
The Indian High Commission has lodged a strong protest with the
Pakistani Foreign Office, urging the Pakistani government to take
urgent steps for the "immediate and safe" return of Yog Raj Vij.
</P>
<P>
Zameer Akram, spokesman for the Pakistan Foreign Office, said
they have received this protest note from the Indian High
Commission and are "investigating into the accusation whether
that person has been abducted or not."
</P>
<P>
"After the investigation, we will be to reply to this
allegation," said Akram.
</P>
<P>
The Indian High Commission accused the Pakistani government of
abducting one of its staff members, N. R. Doraiswamy, on June 29,
but Pakistan rejected the accusation.
</P>
<P>
Prior to that, Pakistan had said India abducted one of the
staff members of the Pakistani High Commission in New Delhi on
June 28, whom India then expelled on charges of spying.

<HEADLINE> SADC Says Cereal Deficit "No Cause for Alarm" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The incessant rains of the 1989/99 agricultural season and the
 following dry spell have led to the prospects of reduced crop
production," South African Press Association quoted SADC as saying
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"An all cereals deficit of two million tons is now estimated as
of May.
</P>
<P>
"This is no cause for alarm, since it includes nominal
strategic reserve requirements. Some countries will, however, have
to import maize and wheat."
</P>
<P>
The committee of SADC's ministers for food, agriculture and
natural resources, met at SADC headquarters in Gaborone on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The ministers announced "The Hub" -- an initiative to
facilitate regional cooperation to improve food security and rural
development, including trade in agricultural products, improved
cooperation with the European Union (EU), and moves to combat
heart water disease and control tick infestations.
</P>
<P>
"'The Hub', would be the missing link between the SADC regional
and national food security programs," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Officially titled the "SADC Food Security and Rural Development
Hub", it would be backed by a Regional Program for Communication
for Development and an Agricultural Potential Information System.
</P>
<P>
"The Hub will facilitate the implementation of food security
and rural development programs in SADC member states through
capacity building and resource mobilization at both local and
regional levels," the ministers said.
</P>
<P>
"The communication program will be aimed at making sure the
intended beneficiaries of rural development programs can
participate in decision- making affecting their lives."
</P>
<P>
A donors conference to start the implementation of the Hub is
to be convened for July 23 in Harare, Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Efforts are under way to improve international cooperation in
agriculture between SADC, other regional bodies and, particularly,
the EU.
</P>
<P>
SADC and EU agriculture ministers have agreed to engage in
regular specialist dialog, involving not only their governments,
but also farmers unions and "non-state actors".
</P>
<P>
The 14 member states of SADC are: Angola, Botswana, Democratic
Republic of Congo, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique,
Namibia, Seychelles, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and
Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> Iraq May Exceed Oil Export Quota: U.N. Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Iraq will earn more revenues than
the quota set by the U.N. Security Council for the sixth phase of
the oil-for-food program if the current high oil prices continue,
said a senior U.N. official here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Benon Sevan, executive director of the U.N. Program for Iraq,
made the remarks at a press conference held here.
</P>
<P>
He said that if the oil prices on the world markets can
maintain the current going-up trend or based on last Friday's 14.5
dollars per barrel, Iraq's receipts from selling oil exceed the
5.2 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. oil-for-food program started in 1996 for
under-sanction Iraq to export limited amount of oil every six
months to buy food, medicine and other humanitarian supplies for
its nearly 24 million people.
</P>
<P>
The ceiling for oil exports has been raised from 2.8 billion
dollars to 5.2 billion since the fourth phase of the program.
</P>
<P>
Sevan admitted that "no matter what we do... there is no way we
can meet all the needs of the Iraqi people."
</P>
<P>
Iraq has long complained that this humanitarian program has
done little to achieve that goal.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has been pressing for the total lifting of the nearly
nine-year-old U.N. sanctions imposed on the country following its
1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Sevan, who arrived here on June 16 and will leave Tuesday, said
that after war compensation and other deductions from the Iraqi
oil proceeds, Iraq will get 3.4 billion dollars for humanitarian
purposes.
</P>
<P>
Low oil prices on the world market and the severe lack of spare
parts for its oil sector have enable Iraq to export only some 3
billion dollars and 3.9 billion dollars in the fourth and fifth
phase respectively.
</P>
<P>
Under the current sixth phase, which started on May 25, Iraq's
oil exports have been running at 2.2 million barrel per day.
</P>
<P>
It will be up to the Security Council to decide whether Iraq
will be allowed to exceed the oil export ceiling of 5.2 billion
dollars before the end of this phase, said Seven, the
highest-ranking U.N. official in charge of the Iraqi humanitarian
program.
</P>
<P>
During his 20-day visit to Iraq, Sevan toured some areas in the
country, including the northern Kurdish autonomous regions, and
held talks with Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadhan and
Iraqi ministers concerned.
</P>
<P>
"I am very happy with the results achieved during my visit,"
he told the press conference. But he did not elaborate.

<HEADLINE> 1 Killed, 10 Injured in Landmine Explosions in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- One person was killed and 10 others
injured in two landmine explosions in southeastern Turkey on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
A landmine, planted by militants of the outlawed Kurdish
Workers' Party (PKK), exploded Monday when a minibus pressed it
near Uzumlu village in Durankaya town of Hakkari province,
leaving one person dead and five others, including three village
guards, injured.
</P>
<P>
In another development, a vehicle belonging to the Turkish
Petroleum Corporation hit a landmine also planted by the PKK
rebels in Batman province Sunday night, injuring five, the
semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
One person was killed and 14 others wounded in a suicide
bombing in Adana, southern Turkey, Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Late Sunday night, one person was killed and 25 others injured
when a time bomb exploded in a dustbin in a picnic place at
Avcilar district of Istanbul, the largest city of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Istanbul Governor Erol Cakir accused the PKK of being
responsible for the explosions.
</P>
<P>
The attacks were suspected of retaliation acts launched by PKK
rebels because their leader Abdullah Ocalan was sentenced to
death last Tuesday on charges of treason and separatism.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan-led PKK has been fighting a war for an independent
Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey. Conflicts between the
Turkish security forces and the PKK militants have claimed over
37,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan was captured by Turkish special agents in Kenya in
mid-February and has ever since been detained on Imrali Island
in Marmara Sea near western Turkey's province of Bursa where
he was tried on charges of treasons and separatism.

<HEADLINE> Swedish Striker Martin Dahlin Retires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Swedish international Martin
Dahlin called it quits on Monday citing back injury preventing him
from playing aggressively.
</P>
<P>
"I have played my last match, scored my last goal and elbowed
my last opponent," the talented striker told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
The 31-year-old also ruled out the possibility that he would
accept offers of some clubs for his chronic back injury after he
was released from Blackburn Rovers of the Premier League.
</P>
<P>
"I have done all I can to get 100 percent fit again, and will
be able to live a normal life. But the back injury prevents me
playing aggressively and I therefore chose to retire."
</P>
<P>
Dahlin, a member of the third-placed Sweden at the 1994 World
Cup finals, notched 29 goals during 60 international appearances.
</P>
<P>
He played for several European clubs including the German
Bundesliga side Borussia Moenchengladbach and Italy's Roma.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Guerrilla Killed in Israeli Air Raid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's anti-occupation Muslim
group Hezbollah, or Party of God, Monday announced that one of its
fighters died in Israeli air raids on Lebanon last month.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the group said that Abas Mohmmed
Toufeili died of injury he sustained during the Israeli air raid
on the country's eastern Baalbek late June 24.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Israel launched heavy attacks on Lebanon's
infrastructure and the group's suspected bases in Baalbek,
killing eight people and wounding 64.
</P>
<P>
Two power stations, three bridges and a telephone relay station
around Beirut were also destroyed in the blitz which was seen as
the heaviest since the Israeli 16-day "Grapes of Wrath" operation
on Lebanon in April 1996. More than 200 people, most of them
civilians, were killed in the operation.
</P>
<P>
Israel claimed that its offensives on Lebanon were aimed at
retaliating Hezbollah's cross-border attacks while Hezbollah
argued it fired Katyusha rockets into northern Israel to avenge
the wounding of six Lebanese civilians by Israeli shelling in
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The latest attack raised to 15 the number of Hezbollah
guerrillas killed in south Lebanon since the start of this year.
</P>
<P>
Ten Israeli soldiers were killed in the border zone during the
same period.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by
Hezbollah has been fighting to oust Israeli forces and its proxy
South Lebanon Army out of the country.

<HEADLINE> Rios Rusty after Five-week Injury Layoff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Chilian Marcelo Rios showed sign of
rust from a five-week injury layoff as the former world number one
sweated to a three-set clay win at the Swiss Open at Gstaad on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Rios wrapped up a 6-2, 6-7 (7/9), 7-6 (7/1) victory over Czech
Bohdan Ulihrach to advance to the second round of the 550,000 U.S.
dollars tournament.
</P>
<P>
Rios, seeded third, has not played since losing in the quarter-
finals of the French Open to Dominic Hrbaty. He cited lower back
pain before pulling out of the Wimbledon Championships a fortnight
ago.
</P>
<P>
Another seed who is also coming off a long break is Spanish
titleholder Alex Corretja who opens with a first round match on
Tuesday against Nicolas Lapentti.
</P>
<P>
Top seed is Brazil's Gustavo Kuerten, who will face off against
fellow South American Mariano Puerta of Argentina.
</P>
<P>
Briton Greg Rusedski will be tuning up his huge serve to take
on another heavy hitter Swiss Marc Rosset.
</P>
<P>
On a low-key opening day, there was disappointment for Swiss
Lorenzo Manta, who was dismissed 6-1, 6-1 by eighth seed Albert
Costa of Spain, the 1996 champion.
</P>
<P>
Manta, ranked world No. 112, had surprised on the grass at
Wimbledon by reaching the fourth round before losing to Kuerten.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere two qualifiers moved ahead. Croatian Ivan Ljubicic
downed Czech Daniel Vacek 6-7 (5/7) 6-4, 6-4 and Italy's Andrea
Gaudenzi had an easy time against Rainer Schuttler, knocking out
the only German in the 32-man field 6-2, 6-1.

<HEADLINE> Tri-Lateral Protocol on Regional Project Signed in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 5 (Xinhua) -- A tri-lateral protocol aimed
at stimulating investment, agriculture and tourism in the region
straddling South Africa, Swaziland and Mozambique was signed at
the Southern African Economic Summit in Durban Monday.
</P>
<P>
The protocol for the one-billion rand (167-million-U.S.
dollars) Lubombo Spatial Development Initiative was signed by
South African President Thabo Mbeki, Swaziland's King Mswati III
and President Joaquim Chissano of Mozambique, according to South
African Press Association.
</P>
<P>
The leaders said the protocol was designed to foster private
sector confidence and help attract as much investment as possible
in the region, which includes parts of eastern Swaziland, southern
Mozambique and northern KwaZulu-Natal of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
According to them, the protocol laid down the legal framework
for the initiative and would serve as forerunner to other
protocols on such diverse aspects as malaria control, cross-border
movements and conservation.
</P>
<P>
The leaders said the signing of the protocol was a practical
expression of a theme that has run through the economy: namely
Mbeki's emphasis on regional cooperation and collaboration as a
way to stimulate industrial revival and job creation on the
sub-continent.
</P>
<P>
A lighter moment during the signing revealed that even state
leaders are often nervous around royalty when Mbeki quipped that
he had mistakenly signed where the Swazi king should have signed.

<HEADLINE> Dutch GDP Growth To Slowdown In 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The Netherlands Bureau for
Economic Policy Analysis said in The Hague on Monday that it
expects growth of Gross Domestic products (GDP) in the country to
slowdown this year to 2.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Bureau said the GDP growth forecast for the year of 2000 is
two percent, this marked slowdown in relation to the 3.8 percent
of growth in 1998 is due in particular to the slower growth of
exports.
</P>
<P>
However, the expected rate of growth is somewhat higher than
the forecast three months ago, it said. Because of the strong U.S.
dollar, the competitive position is more favorable and the
decreasing growth in exports need not be as pronounced as
anticipated previously, it added.
</P>
<P>
The government policy research body also said that consumsption
is continuing to grow strongly this year to about 3.75 percent,
although the growth next year will slow to 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
"By contrast exports will pick up vigorously, in particular
from the third quarter of 1999 onwards. This will mean export
growth for 1999 as a whole of 2.5 percent," the bureau said,
adding it expects an increase in exports of 5.25 percent in 2000.
</P>
<P>
The government bureau also was optimistic on the overall
economic picture. "The slower economic growth will still result in
a two percent rise in employment this year, or 135,000 jobs.
Unemployment will fall further to 4.5 percent as in 1998, and
inflation this year will probably amount to two percent, while
next year it is expected to fall to 1.5 percent".

<HEADLINE> G-7 Debt Policy "Criminal": S. African Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 5 (Xinhua) -- South African Trade and
Industry Minister Alec Erwin Monday described G-7 policy on Third
World debt as "criminal" at an economic summit of southern African
political and business leaders in Durban.
</P>
<P>
"For the G-7 to be cautious on debt is criminal. It's
criminal," Erwin noted.
</P>
<P>
He was responding to sharp criticism by United States Deputy
Commerce Secretary Robert Mallett, who berated southern African
states for moving too cautiously on regional trade integration.
</P>
<P>
"Investors hear this cautious conversation, and this
unwillingness to step out aggressively, and they say well, Africa
is not yet ready for prime time. That's the reality," Mallett
bluntly told the gathering of 850 regional political and business
leaders.
</P>
<P>
Mallett said the 14-nation Southern African Development
Community (SADC), which is involved in complex discussions on an
internal free trade agreement, lacked cohesion.
</P>
<P>
"The global economy is here and, unlike Europe, you don't have
40 years to get your act together.
</P>
<P>
"Unless there is real cohesion between the public and private
sector, unless there is a realization that the region has to be
integrated... you are not going to make it," he warned.
</P>
<P>
An irritated Erwin responded: "You have to distinguish between
bravado and realism. And we hear a lot of bravado at these
conferences."
</P>
<P>
"In Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Zambia, how can we do projects in
public- private partnerships when the sovereign risk is so massive
because of debt?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
"If we want to build southern Africa, G-7 can help, not by
preaching to us about governance, but by taking debt off the books
so we can have genuine public-private partnerships," Agence France
Presse quoted Erwin as saying.
</P>
<P>
Mozambican Trade Minister Oldemiro Baloi said that moving too
quickly on integration could threaten stability by leading to
exclusion. "Most of the conflicts we have are about exclusion."
</P>
<P>
Mallett said the support of G-7 nations for the region was less
than whole-hearted because of a perception of a lack of urgency
among southern African states.
</P>
<P>
"If regional integration proceeded with more vigor and if SADC
was able to meet the security needs of the region as a region, and
if it met common trade and tax policies, then there would be
greater support from the G-7 countries.
</P>
<P>
"But we are a long way from that in this region," said the U.S.
official.
</P>
<P>
The world's seven richest countries -- the United States,
Britain, Germany, France, Japan, Italy and Canada -- stopped short
of a total debt write-off for poor nations at their meeting in
Cologne, Germany, last month.

ISLAMABAD, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Monday demanded the
return of its eight-men patrol that lost contact with its base
during the military conflict along the Line of Control (LoC),
saying one of them is being paraded on Indian electronic media.

He said it has been a long time since the eight men were
captured. "It is reasonable to assume that they have either been
killed or kept under custody by the Indians."

<HEADLINE> China Proposes to Retain Existing UN Institution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- China has proposed to retain the
United Nations' existing institution, the International Decade for
Natural Disaster Reduction (IDNDR) (1990-2000), so as to
continuously promote and coordinate international actions on
natural disaster reduction.
</P>
<P>
Speaking here Monday at the opening of the forum, Vice Chairman
and Secretary-General of China National Committee for IDNDR Fan
Baojun said, over the decade, the UN system has been playing a
positive role and scored outstanding achievements in promoting
IDNDR activities in a deep-going way and raising the public
awareness of natural disaster prevention.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government highly appreciates these achievements,"
said Fan, who is also Vice Minister of Civil Affairs. "The Chinese
government attaches great importance to natural disaster
management and reduction work."
</P>
<P>
Fan told some 700 participants from more than 100 countries at
the meeting that, in April 1998, the Chinese government
promulgated the "National Natural Disaster Reduction Plan of the
People's Republic of China (1998-2010), which clarifies the
guiding principles, tasks and measures for natural disaster
reduction, and put forward major actions to be taken.
</P>
<P>
Under the guidance of managing state affairs by law, he said,
the Chinese government has strengthened the legal construction of
natural disaster reduction.
</P>
<P>
Since 1989, several laws have come into force, such as "The
National Earthquake Prevention and Disaster Reduction Law of the
People's Republic of China", "The National Fire Fighting Law of
the People's Republic of China" and "The National Fire Fighting
Law of the People's Republic of China" and "The Flood Control Law
of the People's Republic of China".
</P>
<P>
"These laws have gradually brought natural disaster reduction
onto the track of legal system construction," Fan said.
</P>
<P>
In the 1990's, China has experienced many severe natural
disasters such as floods, earthquakes and droughts. In particular,
the great 1998 floods along the valleys of the Yangtze River, Nen
River and Songhua River are seldom seen in history.
</P>
<P>
Confronted with threats from natural disasters, Fan said. the
Chinese government and the Chinese people struggled together as
one to achieve one victory after another in the fight against
natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the Chinese government, Fan expressed heartfelt
gratitude to the international community for their extensive
support and help in China's natural disaster reduction.
</P>
<P>
"We will actively take part in international cooperation in
natural disaster reduction and made due contributions to
international natural disaster reduction.

GENEVA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- China has put forward a five-point
proposal for the international community to make more concerted
efforts to mitigate natural disasters at the opening of the 1999
forum of the United Nations' International Decade for Natural
Disaster Reduction (IDNDR) (1990-2000).
</P>
<P>
Speaking here Monday at the forum, Vice Chairman and

disaster reduction and gradually realizing the sharing of
information in the field;
</P>
<P>
-- Establishing "the UN funds for international Natural
Disaster Reduction" aiming at supporting major disaster reduction
projects and actions, educating and training programs. The
developed countries should take effective measures to increase
assistance to the developing countries in natural disaster
reduction, particularly to help the developing countries improve
their capacity in natural disaster reduction;
</P>
<P>
-- Establishing monitoring and early warning systems for major
natural disasters worldwide to enhance the mankind's capacity in
responding to these disasters;
</P>
<P>

"How could we withdraw from the LoC?" he asked.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Urges India, Pakistan to Resolve Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Sri Lankan President
Chandrika Kumaratunga on Monday urged India and Pakistan to sit
down in a sincere endeavor to remove the irritants and resolve the
problems that have so long bedeviled their relationship.
</P>
<P>
In her speech at a state banquet hosted in her honor by Nepali
King Birendra, Kumaratunga said, "We are committed to the pursuit
of regional cooperation," but conflict and discord between
countries in any part of the region affect every part of the
region.
</P>
<P>
At the ninth summit of the South Asian Association for Regional
Cooperation (SAARC) in May 1997 in the Maldives, she noted,
leaders of the member states including India and Pakistan
recognized that peace, stability, amity and accelerated social and
economic cooperation may best be achieved by fostering
good-neighborly relations, relieving tensions and building
confidence.
</P>
<P>
SAARC was formed in December 1985 to promote social and
economic development in the region through cooperation among its
seven member states -- Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives,
Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Kumaratunga is the current chairman
of the regional grouping.
</P>
<P>
"The leaders of both India and Pakistan are statesmen with a
shared vision of peace and progress, not only for their respective
nations, but also for the region of South Asia," she said.
</P>
<P>
The president cautioned that tension and conflict between India
and Pakistan sap their energy, drain their resources, impede their
economic development and postpone the day when all the peoples in
the region can share the fruits of peace and tranquillity.
</P>
<P>
On the occasion, King Birendra also called for an environment
of mutual trust and working together in making the SAARC region
even more effective in the international arena through exchange of
experiences and proper utilization of human and natural resources.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga arrived here Monday afternoon for a four-day state
visit at the invitation of Birendra.

<HEADLINE> N.Irish Protestant Leader Calls Blair "Unconvincing" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Senior Northern Ireland Protestant
politician Ken Maginnis said Monday that British Prime Minister
Tony Blair's latest peace plan for the province was unconvincing.
</P>
<P>
Maginnis, security spokesman for the British province's main
Protestant party, the Ulster Unionists, told Channel Four
television that what was needed was a clear commitment from the
Irish Republican Army on disarmament.
</P>
<P>
"As always, Tony Blair's arguments are compelling but they're
not convincing," Maginnis said, accusing the IRA's political wing
Sinn Fein of not having given straight answers on the
make-or-break disarmament issue.
</P>
<P>
If the IRA said it was going to enter into "serious
negotiations with John de Chastelain of the disarmament commission
and are going to achieve disarmament by the 22nd of May next year,
then I believe there would be an onus, and only then, on my party
to change its policy," Maginnis said.
</P>
<P>
Blair, seeking Protestant support for his latest peace
blueprint for Northern Ireland, earlier Monday accepted a key
demand of Ulster Unionists worried about entering government with
Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
He told parliament that Sinn Fein would have to quit the
province's planned all-party executive immediately if the IRA
failed to start disarming on schedule, and he would encourage
other parties to govern without them, according to a Reuters
report.
</P>
<P>
The disarmament wrangle has paralyzed the Northern Ireland
peace process and thrown into jeopardy last year's Good Friday
accord for the future of the province.

<P>
OTTAWA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Trade Minister Sergio
Marchi appealed again Monday to the World Trade Organization (WTO)
for support of retaliation against Australia's continued salmon
ban.
</P>
<P>
Marchi accused Australia of failing to meet WTO's "July 6
deadline" to lift the long-standing ban on imports of Canadian
fresh, chilled and frozen salmon.
</P>
<P>
"The WTO has ruled twice in our favor" Marchi said. Citing a
1998 WTO rule, the minister pointed out that Australia's ban for
fish health protection "clearly has no scientific basis."
</P>
<P>
Canada is seeking authority to impose a 100 percent surtax on
imports of certain Australian products, the minister said, adding
"Under the WTO rules, Canada has until August 5 to request this
authority."

<HEADLINE> Russian Satellite Launch Fails </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The mission control center lost
contact with a Russian military communications satellite launched
earlier Monday, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Raduga satellite was not responding to signals from the
center and was not transmitting any information to the ground.
Some experts said the satellite might have dropped to the ground
in Russia's Altai area.
</P>
<P>
Raduga blasted off from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan
at 17:32 Moscow time (1332 GMT), and all three stages of the
Proton-K carrier performed well.
</P>
<P>
However, about 10 minutes after takeoff, when Raduga and the
new Briz-M booster were in a preliminary orbit, the satellite
stopped reacting to commands from the ground and failed to send
information. Spotting devices also stopped tracing it.
</P>
<P>
The launch of Raduga had been postponed several times due to a
unit replacement and extra tests of the Briz-M, which had not been
used in space flight before.
</P>
<P>
Malfunctions in fueling pumps were attributed to the latest
postponement, from Sunday to Monday.

<HEADLINE> Late Zimbabwean VP Buried In Harare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 50,000 Zimbabweans from all over the country gathered at
the Acre to bid farewell to veteran nationalist fighter Nkomo.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time since the national shrine was built in
the early 1980s that those numbers flocked to the national shrine.
</P>
<P>
Before Nkomo was taken to rest in full military honors to a 19
gun- salute by a 25 pounder cannon as in accordance with his post,
three speakers told of the gallant's exploits of the
vice-president of the country.
</P>
<P>
In an almost two-hour eulogy, President Robert Mugabe highly
praised Nkomo's outstanding contributions to the country's
struggle for independence, national unity and stability, and
economic development.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said one could not help appreciate and admire the
vice-president's commitment to national unity.
</P>
<P>
He urged Zimbabweans not to be swayed by those who wanted to
divide the country, saying that Zimbabweans should emulate Nkomo's
ideologies and principles.
</P>
<P>
"There are other external forces who say that unity of
political parties is a non-democratic process," Mugabe said.
"Unity is essential if we are to maintain a peaceful environment.
Unity, unity -- Mugabe has pledged unity of the people."
</P>
<P>
On December 22 ,1987, Nkomo and Mugabe signed the historic
Unity Accord between the Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU)
led by Nkomo and the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU) led by
Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
Nkomo was born on June 7, 1917 in Matabeleland Province in
west Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
In 1951, he was elected secretary of the Railway African
Workers' Union. In 1952, he was elected President of the African
national Congress.
</P>
<P>
On August 8, 1990, Nkomo was sworn in as Co-Vice-President of
Zimbabwe, together with Simon Muzenda -- a post he held till his
death.

ALGIERS, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Secretary-General of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) Salim Ahmed Salim has said
that the conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) will
be on the agenda of the 35th OAU Summit in Algerian capital
Algiers from July 12 to 14.
</P>
<P>
"If we manage to resolve the conflict in the DRC, we shall be
encouraged to make further efforts to find solutions to the other
conflicts tearing our continent apart,'' Salim said Sunday upon
arrival from Zambia where he had participated in the discussions
on Congo (K) peace with ministers of relevant countries.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general noted that collective efforts are
required from all OAU member states to put an end to conflicts and
terrorism, which constitute a "threat to the stability and
security of states and and their peoples."
</P>
<P>
Salim said he is optimistic about the outcome of the current
talks in Lusaka by the ministers to end the 11-month war in the
vast central African country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a sub-committee set up by the ministers worked late
into the early hours of Monday morning to finish all documents to
be adopted by the ministers at a plenary session later.
</P>
<P>
The adoption of the draft pact would be followed by a heads of
state signing ceremony with the date yet to be announced.
</P>
<P>
Salim also expressed satisfaction with the work done by the
Algerian government to prepare for the OAU Summit.
</P>
<P>
He underscored the need for increased economic cooperation
among African member states so as to meet the challenges of
globalization in the coming millennium.

<HEADLINE> FM: Belarus Views Russia as Main Strategic Partner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Belarussian Foreign Minister Ural
Latypov said Monday that despite President Alexander Lukashenko's
criticism of Moscow's slow action in the union of the two
countries, Russia remains Minsk's main strategic partner.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to Lukashenko's warning last Friday that if
Russia takes no concrete, real steps toward integration with
Belarus, Minsk would reconsider its foreign policy doctrine by
giving priority to cooperation with the West.
</P>
<P>
That statement "does not mean that Minsk has changed its policy
in relation to Russia," the Interfax news agency quoted Latypov as
saying in Minsk.
</P>
<P>
"Russia remains our main strategic partner," and Belarus favors
"the exhaustive and timely implementation of the agreements
reached within the framework of the Belarussian- Russian Union,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Lukashenko's "determination to normalize
relations with the West cannot be viewed as an alternative to
cooperation with Russia."
</P>
<P>
"Belarus will survive only if it maintains normal relations
with both East and West," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The normalization of relations with the European Union is not
empty rhetoric, calculated for a momentary effect, but a long-term
aspect of Belarussian foreign policy," Latypov said.
</P>
<P>
"We think we can simultaneously maintain good relations with
the West and with Russia," he said.

<P>
NAIROBI, July 5 (xINHUA) -- Ghanaian Vice-President John Evans
Atta Mills Monday met visiting Eritrean Foreign Minister Haile
Weldensai at the Castle, Osu, and reassured him of Ghana's
commitment to work for peace between his country and Ethiopia, the
Ghana News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
 "Ghana will do whatever it takes to bring peace to your two
countries",
</P>
<P>
Mills told Foreign Minister Weldensai.
</P>
<P>
 He said Ghana, as well as other well-meaning sister nations,
are " saddened by the unfortunate war that has brought unrest and
hardships to the two brothers".
</P>
<P>
 What is more worrying is that the war does not seem to be
abating despite mediation efforts from a host of countries and the
Organization of African Unity (OAU), Mills said.
</P>
<P>
 He urged the two sides to find common grounds to implement
the various pacts that were put before them. "We are mindful of
the fact that where there is war, there will be no development."
</P>
<P>
 Mills said it was time for Africa to respond to the global
trend by concentrating on development, hence the need to double
efforts to end conflicts on the continent.
</P>
<P>
 He referred to the upcoming OAU summit and said Ghana hopes
it would be used to make a strong case for peace among warring
nations so as to bring stability to the continent.
</P>
<P>
 Weldensai, who also delivered a special message from his
government to President J. Rawlings, briefed the Vice-President on
the situation and blamed Ethiopia for not being committed to the
OAU framework for peace.
</P>
<P>
 He said Eritrea was committed to peace and had made attempts
to cease- fire.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin has
said he is ready to pass his powers over to the new leaders that
will emerge "in an honest and open election struggle" in the
future.
</P>
<P>
"We must have the elections held in a worthy way. New leaders
-- young and energetic, and with new state ideas - must emerge in
Russia after them," Yeltsin said in an interview with the
newspaper Izvestia to be published Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"I will pass my powers over to them with a light heart,"
Yeltsin said. His term of office expires in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
"It's state affairs, not regalia that a new president will
inherit. Two elections in one year is a serious load on the
nation. Ahead of us are serious political battles, which, however,
must not hamper normal economic development," Yeltsin said,
referring to parliamentary elections next December and the
presidential race next year.
</P>
<P>
He said he has his own idea of who his successor must be but
would not disclose it so as to protect him.
</P>
<P>
"If I announce his name, he will not be able to live in peace.
He will be smothered," Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
His choice may be not to his personal liking, but "personal
likes and dislikes do not count here. We shall have a new and
legally elected leader, chosen by the people," Yeltsin said. "We
shall cast our votes for someone who will propose a worthy
development program and will be able to implement it."
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said he would like to see new faces in the next
parliament that should be "competent, politically responsible and
incorruptible."
</P>
<P>
"Those who have been doing big-time politics over all these
years are known too well. We need fresh forces to tackle the new
challenges of the new century," he said.

<HEADLINE> Dutch, Germans Want EU Energy Tax Hike Supported </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The Netherlands and Germany said
Monday that raising European Union (EU) energy taxes need to have
broad support at next week's meeting of EU finance ministers.
</P>
<P>
"We share many common convictions, for example energy taxes. We
all have an interest in raising energy taxes in a smooth way,"
German Finance Minister Hans Eichel told a news briefing in The
Hague after an informal meeting with his Dutch counterpart, Gerrit
Zalm.
</P>
<P>
He said the two countries are seeking a common policy within
the EU and all 15 finance ministers of the EU member states will
discuss the tax issue next week. Tax harmonization would be a
difficult task, he added.
</P>
<P>
Zalm also told reporters that an agreement by a majority of the
15 EU members would probably be the best way to make progress on
energy taxes. "We share the view that if not all 15 (EU members)
can make the same progress, then we should look at a group of less
than 15," he said.
</P>
<P>
Increased energy taxes would enable the European governments to
lower taxes in other areas, such as labor, while also being
positive for the environment, the Dutch finance minister said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to labor policy, Eichel said the Netherlands was very
successful in employing young people and women as well as in the
creation of part-time jobs, while Germany was ahead in employing
older people.
</P>
<P>
"We're interested in learning from the Netherlands... we both
can learn from each other," Eichel said, adding that given the
differences between the two countries, Germany could not simply
apply the Dutch labor model.
</P>
<P>
"The relations are different. In the Netherlands the social
partners are much closer to each other. A consensus is easier to
reach in the Netherlands than in a big country like Germany," the
German finance minister said.

<P>
NAIROBI, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The ninth International Conference
of Gender and Science and Technology Association opened in Accra
Monday to discuss strategies of the gender factor in science, the
Ghana News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The theme of this year's meeting is "From policy to action in
gender, science and technology for sustainable development in the
21st century."
</P>
<P>
The five-day meeting, the first to be held in Africa, bring
together some 300 policy makers, administrators and teachers from
all over the world to deliberate on strategies for integrate the
gender factor into science and technology.
</P>
<P>
Chairperson of the conference, Jayshree Mehta, said that even
though science and technology has made the world a global village,
it has not been able to bridge the gap between the rich and poor
and between men and women.
</P>
<P>
She mentioned high dropout rates among girls, high illiteracy
rate and imbalance in science education for women and lack of
policy direction toward science education as some forms of the
inequality.
</P>
<P>
Mehta noted that science and technology could bridge the gap if
it is used to improve upon the lives of women and children.
</P>
<P>
Ghanaian Education Minister, Ekwow Spio-Garbrah, said that men
and women should be seen as the wings on which a nation's
development flies, therefore, the inclusion of women in the
advancement of science and technology is important to development.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Role of Women Cannot Be Overlooked: Rawlings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Ghanaian President Jerry Rawlings
said in Accra Monday that the work and contribution of African
women toward sustainable development can no longer be overlooked.
</P>
<P>
Rawlings made the remarks when opening the ninth International
Conference on Gender, Science and Technology, the Ghana News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The president noted that a lot have been done to ensure equal
opportunity for all to have access to science and technology,
especially with regard to education, information and employment.
</P>
<P>
For instance, he said, efforts to include women in top
management and decision-making posts have gone far to the level of
18 women parliamentarians and six female ministers.
</P>
<P>
"We are not satisfied with these figures. We shall not relent
on our efforts," Rawlings said. "Women's interest must be further
considered in national planning and budgeting."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the desire of Ghana is to achieve equity
with regards to gender in all sectors and correct the strong
cultural biases that prevent women from being involved in science
and technology.
</P>
<P>
The president urged the conference to make critical analysis of
the various policies and program toward women empowerment so that
those policies could be used for future planning.
</P>
<P>
The conference, the first to be held in Africa, is under the
theme " From policy to action in gender, science and technology
for sustainable development in the 21st century."

<HEADLINE> Namibia Wants Troops Back From Congo (K) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Any development would be
welcomed which would enable Namibia to withdraw its troops from
Congo (K) so that it could concentrate on its own problems,
Namibian Prime Minister Hage Geingob said in Durban Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Any development which will enable us to bring our soldiers
back to concentrate on alleviating poverty and to develop our
country will be most welcome," Geingob was quoted by South African
Press Association as saying.
</P>
<P>
Namibia, along with Zimbabwe, has sent troops and supplies to
back Congolese President Laurent Kabila in the 11-month-old
conflict in the central African country.
</P>
<P>
On Namibia's decision to send troops, Geingob said: "Our aim
was limited. We were there for a limited purpose. We are a small
country."
</P>
<P>
Geingob stressed that Namibian President Sam Nujoma had been
engaged in peace efforts throughout and had hosted several
meetings to resolve the conflict.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said he was not abreast of the latest
developments in Zambian capital Lusaka where the warring parties
are trying to thrash out a cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
But he praised negotiators in Lusaka, saying that they were
working hard to ensure peace and stability in the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) region.
</P>
<P>
According to news reports from Lusaka, the long-awaited
cease-fire agreement could be signed soon.
</P>
<P>
Talks were suspended Monday to allow participants to attend the
funeral of late Zimbabwean Vice-President Joshua Nkomo.

<HEADLINE> IMF Urged to Suspend Gold Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Ghana's Ashanti King, Otumfuo Osei
Tutu II, Monday appealed to the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
to suspend its intended sale of its accumulated gold to support
the poor indebted countries, the Ghana News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The king made the appeal through the Canadian High Commissioner
in Ghana, Mrs. Janet Graham, when she paid a courtesy call on him
at the Manhyia Palace in central Kumasi.
</P>
<P>
Ghana, as a gold producing country, stands to lose when the
market is glutted with gold, the Ashanti king was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
He said being a traditional ruler of Ashanti, where gold is
produced in large quantities, he has the moral responsibility to
ensure industrial peace and the welfare of the people.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Gets Grant for Bomb Blast Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROB, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The Kenya Red Cross has received a
one-million-U.S. dollars grant from the U.S. Agency for
International Development to increase psychological support to
victims of the Nairobi bomb blast on August 7, 1998.
</P>
<P>
In a press release issued here Monday, the Nairobi Regional
Delegation of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red
Crescent Societies announced that the grant for a two-year program
designed to deal with the consequences of the terrorist attack
will target over 6,200 families.
</P>
<P>
The program will reach out to more than 200 Kenyan families
which lost a relative in the blast, 5,000 which had someone
injured and 500 which had family members hospitalized, said the
federation.
</P>
<P>
Psychiatrist Lorin Mimless, consultant to the program, said
that "we need to help individual cope with their trauma, and also
want to increase mental health awareness generally in Kenya and
strengthen the mental health aspects of disaster preparedness."
</P>
<P>
The release said the Kenya Red Cross would establish a trauma
center with psychologists, psychiatrists and counsellors, and
provide direct services as well as outreach.
</P>
<P>
The program will also train teachers, Red Cross branch members
and community leaders in relevant areas of mental health, it
added.
</P>
<P>
Mimless held the view that the experience of helping people in
Kenya could assist other countries to deal more effectively with
trauma victims.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Agency for International Development administers the
U.S. foreign assistance program providing economic and
humanitarian assistance in more than 80 countries worldwide.
