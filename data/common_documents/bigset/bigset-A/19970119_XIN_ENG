<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Some Muslim countries were
blamed for the bomb blast in Pakistan's eastern city of Lahore,
which killed at least 16 people this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"It is no more a secret that other Muslim countries have been
allowed to instigate sectarian strife within Pakistan," said Hanif
Ramay, Speaker of the eastern Punjab provincial assembly, in a
statement issued in Lahore when referring to the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
He said killing of innocent people through terrorism was "a
cowardly act and cannot be supported by anyone."
</P>
<P>
Sixteen people were killed and about 40 injured in a
remote-controlled bomb blast this afternoon at a court in Lahore,
the Punjab capital.
</P>
<P>
Maulana Ziaur Rahman, chief of Sapah-c-Sahaba Pakistan (SSP), a
local religious militant group, was among the killed.
</P>
<P>
He and another leader of the group, who were arrested earlier
for involvement in sectarian violence, were appearing in the court
for grant of bail when the bomb went off.
</P>
<P>
One local journalist were also killed in the incident while two
judges were injured.
</P>
<P>
SSP is an influential religious group who strongly opposes
Shiite Muslims.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of Nigeria
(CBN) will cease to operate commercial banking business in 1997,
Nigerian Head of State General Sani Abacha announced in his 1997
budget address this morning.
</P>
<P>
However, the bank will continue to maintain all accounts which
relate to revenue collection as well as the main accounts of the
government, he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that this is for reasons of safety and security, and
in view of the fact CBN is the fiscal agent of the government.
</P>
<P>
The head of state announced that to ensure orderliness, the
transfer of accounts will be phased over a period of six months
from January 1 to June 30.
</P>
<P>
All the government bodies, both central and local, shall have
opened new accounts with selected banks by the end of June. They
are also forbidden to transact business through banks other than
those selected, he said.
</P>
<P>
The list of banks to receive government accounts shall be
published by the Ministry of Finance and shall be reviewed and
updated periodically to reflect each bank's financial health, he
added.

<HEADLINE> Anti-AIDS Pearl Omega "Effective": Researcher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Thirty percent of the 77,000
AIDS victims administered on Pearl Omega, an anti-AIDS drug, have
been recovered, the Kenya Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted researcher Arthur Obel as saying on Thursday
that in 10 years, Pearl Omega had been administered on a total of
about 77,000 patients by January 7 this year, 53,672 of whom are
Kenyans.
</P>
<P>
The others are from various countries such as Uganda, Brazil,
the United States, New Zealand, India, Portugal, Spain, Ethiopia,
Tanzania, Malawi, Zimbabwe, Zambia, South Africa, Zaire, Cameroun
and the United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
The researcher was responding to a suit put forward by Kenya
AIDS Society seeking to stop the sale of the anti-AIDS drug.
</P>
<P>
Obel, who is also Chairman, Director and Chief Executive of
the International Foundation for Corrective and Rehabilitative
Medicine Ltd. (IFCOREM), claimed that 80 percent of the patients
had met the admission criterion, which is a CD4 cell count of
above 200 cells per milliliter of blood.
</P>
<P>
He said that all the information is maintained at the
IFCOREM and will be made available to anyone who has legal right
to such information.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the scourge of AIDS is a serious challenge to
the medical profession, adding that "we are on the threshold of a
significant breakthrough in this struggle."

<HEADLINE> "Quality" Tourism Remains Target of Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 18 (Xinhua) -- "Quality" will remain the top
priority of Egypt's tourist industry in 1997, Minister of Tourism
Mamdouh el-Beltagui said today.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry had promoted "quality" as the catch word in its
selling pitch during 1996 when Egypt attracted 4 million tourists,
the Egyptian MENA news agency quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
Beltagui said the exceptional increase in tourists has prompted
the establishment of 263 new tourist projects during the first 10
months of last year.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's marketing campaign calls for the application of
international standards in classifying Egyptian hotels and
regulating the services and for providing training opportunities
to employees in this business, he added.
</P>
<P>
Tourism has become Egypt's second largest foreign currency
earner last year as tourism revenues reached 3009.1 million
U.S. dollars, up by 710 million dollars against 1995.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, 4.2 million tourists are expected to visit Egypt,
which boasts a 7000-year-old history that is rich in pharaonic
legacies.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 18 (Xinhua) -- At least 16 people were
killed and 90 other injured in a powerful bomb blast today in the
eastern Pakistani city of Lahore.

official Associated Press of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Maulana Ziaur Rahman, Chief of the Sapah-e-Sahaba Pakistan
(SSP), was among the killed while his colleague Maulana Azam Tariq

</P>
<P>
Ten police officials and one local journalist were also killed

<HEADLINE> Increasing Violence Worries Nigeria's President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Head of State General
Sani Abacha expressed the government's grave concern over the
increasing violence and terrorism in the country in his 1997
budget address this morning.
</P>
<P>
The address is believed to be the first public reaction of
head of the military government over the wave of bombing,
assassination and armed robbery that have been afflicting the
country recently.
</P>
<P>
Series of bombing in Lagos, Nigeria's largest city and
ex-capital, have claimed the lives of more than 50 people.
</P>
<P>
While it is now agreed by many people that the country's
ruling military force is the target of the bombings, almost all
the assassinations are targeted at noted civilians.
</P>
<P>
These actions of violence and terrorism have cast a heavy
shadow over the country's public security situation and political
future, particularly its transition to civil rule program.
</P>
<P>
However, General Abacha seems to be confident of the
program's final success.
</P>
<P>
He assured Nigerians that every effort is being made to check
the wave of crimes and all those involved will be brought to
book.
</P>
<P>
He also called on the people to be extra-vigilant and support
the government in its efforts to protect the lives and properties
of its citizens.

<P>
MAPUTO, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The police authorities of
Mozambique are cooperating with some townships in the capital to
establish community forums for the safety of residents, local
press reported today.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by Minister of Internal Affairs Almerino
Manhenje on Friday when he met local reporters.
</P>
<P>
He said that community forums are designed to unite the police
and the masses for fighting increasing crimes. The campaign
against crimes will consolidate the General Accord of Peace
signed in 1992 at the end of the prolonged civil war, he said.
</P>
<P>
The community forums will include able and respectable
residents from the communities, the minister disclosed, adding
that those townships which reject to form community forums should
come up with their own ideas of solutions to the crime issue.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, Manhenje also accused some western
countries of trying to impose their own safety patterns on
Mozambique.

<HEADLINE> SDLP Leader Hume Says to Stand for Re-election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 18 (Xinhua) -- John Hume, leader of the
Irish Social Democratic and Labor Party (SDLP), announced
today that he would stand for re-election to continue his
efforts to bring peace to Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on his 60th birthday, the Irish nationalist said he
was "committed to continuing his work at Westminster to bring
lasting peace to this island."
</P>
<P>
The statement ended months of speculation about his
future. Hume, helped broker a 1994 Irish Republican Army
(IRA) cease-fire, had previously refused to confirm whether
or not he would stand for re-election.
</P>
<P>
Hume had complained of pressure of work -- he is also a
member of the European Parliament -- and poor health.
</P>
<P>
Hume's Catholic-backed SDLP represents moderate Irish
nationalists who want the peaceful reunification of now
British-ruled Northern Ireland with the overwhelmingly
Catholic Irish Republic from which it was partitioned 70
years ago.
</P>
<P>
The SDLP has four seats at the British parliament
compared with 13 held by its ideological rivals, the
Unionists, who represent the 60 percent Protestant majority
who want Northern Ireland to stay British.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Refuses to Negotiate with Palestinians on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu said in an interview with the French daily Le Figaro
published today that he will never negotiate with Palestinians on
the status of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"Jerusalem will never be negotiated. One should know this
definitely," said Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
The statement made by the Israeli Prime Minister goes contrary
to the layouts of the Declaration of Principles signed by Israel
and Palestinians in September 1993 in Washington.
</P>
<P>
The Washington declaration predicted that the question of
Jerusalem, as well as those of Jewish settlements and Arab
refugees, should be discussed in negotiations over the definite
status of West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said that Jerusalem will remain the one and whole
capital of the state of Israel "eternally."
</P>
<P>
"There will never be any redeployment (of Israeli army) in
Jerusalem. In the same way as one will not build a wall in
Jerusalem. And on this point, there is a consensus in Israel and
in the whole Jewish community in diaspora," said the Israeli
Prime Minister.
</P>
<P>
He said that he does not suspect that the former Israeli Labor
government of Prime Minister Yitzakh Rabin had the "intention...
to abandon Hebron, and without doubt, Jerusalem."
</P>
<P>
On the definite status of Palestinian territories, Netanyahu
said that he supports the idea of "Palestinian autonomy amputated
from certain prerogatives which could endanger" Israel.
</P>
<P>
As for the creation of a Palestinian state, he said that "one
can envisage that," but added that one should "first of all
define the word `state'."
</P>
<P>
"The modern thinking is made too tight: it forbids the third
road. In a dozen countries, there exist minorities who call for
their independence and, if one yields, one smashes the stability
of the country," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Israel needs a "new model which could give (the
Palestinians) an autonomy in administration in some fields but not
in others."

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Looks into Homestead Air Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Health
Ministry said today it has launched a study on the health threat
caused by fumes of charcoal and firewood, which are main energy
sources for households in the country.
</P>
<P>
Fumes of charcoal and firewood can cause diseases of eye,
respiratory and blood circulation diseases as well as poor
appetite, said Seleshi Taye, a senior official in the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Most of the victims are women, children and the elders,
especially those among the low income groups, Taye added.
</P>
<P>
The study, which is now being conducted in the capital and
some towns, aims to work out with official or civil groups a
mechanism seeking solution to homestead air pollution, Taye
noted.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the study focuses on the type of firewood
used by a family and the frequency of burning it, and the second
on the magnitude of the pollution caused by charcoal and firewood
fumes.
</P>
<P>
The study is being jointly carried out by the Hygiene and
Environment Health Service Department in the ministry and
regional health institutes.
</P>
<P>
Petroleum and electricity energy only make for about 10
percent of the total energy sources in the country.

<HEADLINE> UK Apologizes for Nazi Gold Error </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Britain admitted that there
might be eight times less Nazi gold hidden in Swiss bank vaults
than it had suggested in a report last September.
</P>
<P>
The British Foreign Office said it had confused Swiss Francs
with U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The error occurred in a passage in the report covering the
alleged comments of a director of the Swiss National Bank who had
suggested that his bank might have received 500 million U.S.
dollars of looted gold from Germany.
</P>
<P>
In its second edition of the History Note on Nazi Gold released
on Friday, the British Foreign Office said: "It corrects an error
in the first edition, where the figure of 500 million U.S. dollars
attributed to an official of the Swiss National Bank should have
read 500 million Swiss francs (SFr)."
</P>
<P>
The note made it clear that neither the British government nor
its wartime allies knew how much Nazi gold was hidden in
Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
But the world's media used the 500 million U.S. dollars estimate
to suggest that Switzerland was still hiding up to 90 percent of
the gold deposited by the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Office has now accepted that the Swiss official was
referring to 500 million SFrs and not 500 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Based on the exchange rate at the time of 4.3 SFrs per dollar
the Swiss central banker's estimate of the looted gold drops to
116 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Switzerland paid 250 million SFrs to the Allies on condition
that they waive all future claims. On this basis Switzerland
handed over half of its estimated looted Nazi gold and not l0
percent, and retained 250 million SFrs, and not 1.9 billion SFrs.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Says Golan Heights Not Negotiable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu said in an interview with French daily Le Figaro
published today that the Golan Heights occupied and annexed by
Israel is "absolutely" not negotiable.
</P>
<P>
"One should keep Golan for strategic, historical and economic
reasons. On this last (economic) point, one should know that one
quarter of the water resources of Israel comes from the Golan
Heights," said Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
But he said that Israel adopts a policy of "softly but
surely" going toward the resumption of peace talks with Syria.
</P>
<P>
"We are in liaison with Damascus through the intermediary of
the Americans, and the Syrians have always refused to accept our
proposals on relaunching the negotiations. Some think that they
are waiting for the coming into place of the new Clinton
administration," he said.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said that during the "interlude," there have been
an escalation of tension, increase of Syrian troops "from Beirut
to the Golan Heights" and threat of war.

<HEADLINE> GCC Committee to Hold Meeting on Border Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 18 (Xinhua) -- A four-member ministerial
committee of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) will hold the
third meeting within two days to try to improve relations
between Bahrain and Qatar.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed here today by Kuwaiti Deputy Prime Minister
and Foreign Minister Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah after he held
a meeting with Kuwaiti National Assembly's Foreign Affairs
Committee.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that a formula would be devised to
improve the ties between the two GCC neighbors to pave the way
for a GCC higher council to find a solution to their border
differences.
</P>
<P>
The GCC four-men committee has held two meetings since the
beginning of this month to prepare for a lasting solution of the
decades long border disputes between Bahrain and Qatar within the
framework of the regional political and economic body which also
includes Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman and the United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
The first meeting of the committee was held in Riyadh on
January 7. They discussed a problem-solving mechanism plan
regarding the strained Bahrain-Qatar ties.
</P>
<P>
As part of the mechanism, the commission was trying to
persuade Manama and Doha to sign a memorandum, to stipulate a
stoppage of media campaigns, adoption of dialogue and a pledge
to refrain from hosting opponents.
</P>
<P>
The second special meeting held by the ministerial committee
on January 12 failed to bring any positive results after closed
door discussions.
</P>
<P>
The seven-point memorandum of understanding which was drafted
by Saudi Arabia, which heads the committee, to end a war of words
between the two neighbors was not signed because it touched on
the territory dispute and both countries objected to different
points in it.
</P>
<P>
Bahrain and Qatar have been locked in a border dispute over a
number of small and bare but may be potentially oil-rich Gulf
islands, sandbanks and reefs controlled by Bahrain since the
1930s but also claimed by Qatar.
</P>
<P>
The bitter border dispute between the two countries is
blocking an ambitious project to set up a Gulf gas pipeline
network.
</P>
<P>
The project to distribute natural gas from Qatar's mammoth
North Field was floated in the early 1990s but was held up by
financial problems and the conflict between the two neighbors
over the islands.

<HEADLINE> Gunmen Raid 3 villages, killing 15 Sierra </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Lenoe's military
authorities said today that they are "investigating" in a report
that gunmen raided three villages and killed 15 civilians in the
northern district of Tonkolili on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We are looking into it to ascertain whether it was a rebel
attack or not," a defense information official said in a
telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
The attackers, in either military or Kamajor (the civil
defense unit) fatigues, raided the villages of Mamansoh Sanka,
Masorie and Masimoh, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
"The attackers stole goods and money and forced people to
carry their loot away," a local resident living near there,
identified as Sanda Chiefdom, was quoted by the reports as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Villagers there said they "believed that the attackers were
rebels", but could not tell whether they came from the
Revolutionary United Front (RUF), the reports said today.
</P>
<P>
The RUF had earlier signed a peace agreement with the Sierra
Leone government on ending nearly six years of civil war.

<HEADLINE> Implementation of Hebron Deal Touchstone: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said today the implementation of the Hebron agreement is
the real test for the effectiveness of the peace process on the
Palestinian track and a challenge to reactivating other tracks.
</P>
<P>
"It (the Hebron deal) also affects the other tracks and
therefore we have to wait for its implementation," he told
reporters here.
</P>
<P>
On the possibility of reactivating Syrian-Israeli peace talks,
Moussa said it is obvious that the Syrian stance has been stable.
</P>
<P>
"Syria calls for commitment to what had been realized in
previous negotiations and does not want to waste years of
negotiations which witnessed great work," he added.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said the Syrians are ready to resume talks provided
they start from the point the previous negotiations had ended.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the importance of respecting the international
legitimacy and land-for-peace formula, Moussa rejected the
Israeli idea to return to square one in talks with Syria. "The
Syrians will not accept this," he added.
</P>
<P>
During a one-day visit to Egypt Friday, Syrian Vice-President
Abdul-Halim Khaddam and Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara met with
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Prime Minister Kamal
el-Ganzouri and Foreign Minister Amr Moussa.
</P>
<P>
During their two-hour talks, the Syrian vice-president
conveyed a letter to Mubarak from Syrian President Hafez
al-Assad, which dealt with the current situation in the Arab
world and the Middle East peace process, the Egyptian Middle East
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
A day before the Syrian-Egyptian talks, Syrian President
al-Assad received a telephone call from Mubarak on some Arab
issues of mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
Details were unknown about their conversation, which came a
day after Israel and the Palestinian Authority signed a deal that
secured a partial Israeli troop withdrawal from the West Bank
town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
However, Syrian official daily Al-Thawra Thursday slammed the
agreement, saying it was the death knell of the Mideast peace
process. "There is nothing new to encourage Syria to resume peace
talks with Israel," it lamented.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia to Renovate World-Famous Relics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The Relics Research and
Preservation Agency of Ethiopia announced today that it has begun
to renovate internationally-known relics scattering around the
country.
</P>
<P>
Nigusu Damtew, a representative of the Department for Heritage
Maintenance and Preservation in the agency, said relics in Axum,
Gonder, Lalibela, Harar and West Shewa will be repaired in the
current Ethiopian year.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian government has allotted half a million Birr
(About 80,000 U.S. Dollars) for the renovation of the Fasil
Palace in Gonder, Damtew said.
</P>
<P>
The department is also preparing documents for attracting
international maintenance contractors, Damtew said.
</P>
<P>
The European Union (EU), the U.N. Scientific, Educational and
Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the Swiss government have
already pledged to extend financial and technical support to the
maintenance on rock-hewn churches, he disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Among the famous relics in Ethiopia, a country with a written
history of 3,000 years, are Axum Obelisks elected 2000 years ago,
rock-hewn churches built 800 years ago in Lalibela and some
castles constructed from 17 to 19 century in Gonder.

<HEADLINE> Gulf Committee to Meet for Improving Qatari-Bahraini Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, January 18 (Xinhua) -- A mediation committee of the
Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) will hold its 3rd meeting in
Bahraini capital of Doha Sunday to discuss ways of improving the
troubled Qatari-Bahraini relationship.
</P>
<P>
The committee, composed of the United Arab Emirates (UAE),
Saudi Arabia, Oman and Kuwait, will continue their efforts in
finding a way to help improve the relationship between the other
two GCC members, the United Arab Emirates News Agency reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The committee has held two meetings in Saudi Arabian capital of
Riyadh, calling the two neighbors to "stop press campaigns"
between them and settle the issue through diplomatic efforts.
</P>
<P>
During the second meeting held on January 12, Bahrain welcomed
a Saudi-proposed mediation plan which was rejected by Qatar on
ground of touching territorial issues.
</P>
<P>
The Qatari Foreign Ministry said earlier that the committee,
formed by a GCC summit in December last year, was only mandated to
help improve its relations with Bahrain, and not the territorial
issue itself.
</P>
<P>
Despite wide differences over their territorial dispute, both
Qatar and Bahrain have expressed their hope for reaching a
friendly settlement.
</P>
<P>
Bahrain and Qatar have been disputing over the sovereignty of
the Hawar islands for a decade, which are controlled by Bahrain but
also claimed by Qatar. Bahrain was angered after Qatar took the
dispute to the Hague-based International Court of Justice in 1991.

LAGOS, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria today urged African
governments to take concerted action to improve the less
</P>
<P>
The "limited scope of operations of inter-African airlines" is
a handicap to the efficient running of postal services, Nigerian
Minister of Communications Tajudeen Olanrewaju said at a ceremony
marking the 1997 Pan-African Post Day held here today.
</P>
<P>
"The nature of African rivers and the lack of connectivity
between the seaports" also constitute a constraint, he was quoted
by the News Agency of Nigeria as saying.
</P>
<P>
Now it is "difficult for African countries to exchange mails
on a daily basis within the continent as it is done in Europe and
America," the minister noted.
</P>
<P>
He also regretted that the objective of the U.N. Transport and
Communications Decade for Africa aiming to "have a motorable
highway criss-crossing the continent" is yet to be realized by
various African governments.
</P>
<P>
The minister reiterated the Nigerian government's commitment
to the reorganization of the Nigerian post service in line with
the African blueprint of postal development strategies, also
known as the "Maseru Plan of Action."
</P>
<P>
The Maseru Plan of Action directs African countries to
reorganize and restructure their postal service so as to be able
to respond quickly to the dynamics of customers' demand.

<HEADLINE> Serbian Official Slams City Election Commission Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Serbian Deputy Premier Ratko
Markovic has described the latest ruling of the Belgrade Election
Commission as a "nightmare of legal nonsense, unlawfulness and
error."
</P>
<P>
"The decision is an expression of usurpation of competency,
reached by an organ that has flagrantly usurped powers it has on
no grounds at all" Markovic said in an interview to Saturday's
edition of Belgrade daily Politika, a leading pro-government
newspaper in the country.
</P>
<P>
The election commission on Tuesday nullified 45 rulings of the
first municipal court, thereby conceding to the opposition 60 seats
in the 110-seat municipal parliament.
</P>
<P>
Markovic said the decision "does not have the forms of a legal
act," and that the commission had "simply requalified a judicial
act into an administrative one," turning from a "controller of the
legality of administration, into a controller of the legality of
the judiciary."
</P>
<P>
The three-party opposition coalition Zajedno claims it has won
the November 17 local elections in 14 out of 18 biggest cities in
Serbia. It has been staging demonstrations over the past two
months to protest the annulment of the local election results by
the court ruling and demanded full reinstatement of the election
results.
</P>
<P>
Markovic said the commission, a second-degree, supervisory
authority, had canceled a court ruling, which is inconceivable
from the legal standpoint, and can only be described as a
"freak-act."
</P>
<P>
He said administration can never judge a court, only vice
versa.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Intensify Rural Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lagos, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria will give more attention to
developing its rural areas, where 70 percent of its largest population
in Africa live, Head of State General Sani Abacha said in his
1997 budget speech this morning.
</P>
<P>
"To ensure sustainalbe economic growth and development, emphasis
must be shifted to rural areas where the majority of the populace
reside," he said.
</P>
<P>
For this end, the government will invest in agriculture to
promote food self-sufficiency and increase farm incomes. It will
continue to assist both small and large scale farmers in various
ways, he said.
</P>
<P>
The head of state, however, regreted that agricultural
subsidies have not reached the farmers. He vowed that the
government will work out more effective and efficient mechanism
to help the farmers in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The government will make items such as chemicals and improved
seedlings more easily available to farmers and it will encourage the
production of economic crops, he said.
</P>
<P>
The buget also contains a Family Economic Advancement Program
(FEAP), which is designed to promote local industry and improve the
living standard of local people.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that about 40 percent of the food produced in Nigeria
are wasted due to a lack of post-harvest processing, conservation and
inaccessibility to the market.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government has already undertaken a survey of
agricultural products and raw material availability in the
country so that the right industry will be set up.
</P>
<P>
The government will support the development of local industries
through bank loans, technological training, equipment maintenance and
the production of simple and inexpensive equipment, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Petroleum Trust Fund, which was launched in 1995 by the
Abacha administration to divert part of the country's huge oil
income to agriculture, health, education and other weak
departments, will also play a bigger role in rural development.
</P>
<P>
Specifically, the fund will help in the rehabilitation of farm
machines, the development of strategic irrigation and grains reserve
facilities, and livestock and fishery prdouctions, the head of state
said.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Removes Subsidy on Fertilizers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Fertilizer
Industry Agency said tonight that the country's price regulation
system and subsidy on fertilizer has been deregulated in line
with the liberalized economic policies.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here, the agency said the move aims to
help fertilizer dealers benefit from the competition in
fertilizer distribution and to meet the free market economic
system which is going fully operational in the country.
</P>
<P>
As of this month, the single wholesale price of fertilizer
will be regulated at the national level, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The government has subsidized price-soaring fertilizer in the
past four years and spent 338 million Birr (about 52 million
Dollars) for subsidizing fertilizers during 1995/96.
</P>
<P>
The cancellation of subsidy would not significantly affect
farmers who are now reaping a harvest more than double of the
previous one by using fertilizer, added the statement.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Rules Out Arab Summit to Solve Sudan Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
today denied news on holding an Arab summit at present to solve
the crisis in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
"Events taking place in Sudan are domestic issues and neither
Ethipoia nor Eritrea has anything to do with attacks on Sudan,"
Mubarak said at a meeting with the intellectuals, writers and
senior journalists at the opening of the Cairo International Book
Fair.
</P>
<P>
During an unexpected visit Thursday, Sudanese Vice President
Zubair Mohamed Saleh put up the request to Mubarak as his country
was mobilized for conflict againist advancing rebels.
</P>
<P>
The unannounced visit came amid escalating tensions in Sudan as
government forces are fighting against rebels in areas bordering
Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
"He came and presented the issue to me and said there was an
Ethiopian-Eritrean attack on Sudan," Mubarak said, but "We are
sure that no one has entered (Sudan) and that the attacks are by
the Sudanese (opposition)," he said.
</P>
<P>
Saleh is the most senior Sudanese to visit Egypt since
President Omar Hassan al-Bashir came last July for an Arab summit.
</P>
<P>
Cairo-Khartoum ties have been cool since Egypt accused Sudan of
having orchestrated the 1995 failed attempt on Mubarak's life in
Addis Ababa and granting asylum to Egyptian extremists.
</P>
<P>
Sudanese troops and rebel forces have been engaged in a
military clash since Sunday after two towns on the border with
Ethiopia were attacked by rebel forces.
</P>
<P>
While the Arab League has expressed "deep worries" over the
Sudanese situation, Egypt had given no response before.
</P>
<P>
Sudan's opposition forces comprise elements from the Umma
Party, the Democratic Unionist Party, the Sudanese Democratic
Alliance and the Sudan People's Liberation Army.

<HEADLINE> First Book on Grand National Day Celebrations Published </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Candid camera shots of a banner
with the message "Hello! Xiaoping", carried by Beijing University
students, have provided people with a reminder of scenes of
China's National Day parades 12 years ago.
</P>
<P>
A film clip showing the banner is just one scene of the
12-part documentary series "Deng Xiaoping", currently being
shown across China.
</P>
<P>
The series on China Central TV has already gained high ratings
from the first day of 1997. Vintage film shots include
footage of many parades from the great celebrations to mark the
founding of the People's Republic of China from 1949 to the most
recent large parades in 1984.
</P>
<P>
How did 500,000 people parade past the Tian An Men Rostrum
accurately to within two hours? What were the anecdotes of late
Chairman Mao Zedong and leaders from the former Soviet Union
standing side by side on that rostrum? And, what were the
backgrounds of the Beijing University students' slogan on the
nation's 35th anniversary?
</P>
<P>
These questions and others have been answered for the first
time in a newly-published book compiled by the sub-committee of
cultural and historical data and study of the Beijing People's
Political Consultative Conference (BPPCC).
</P>
<P>
"We are facing the approach of the new century," an official at
BPPCC, said, "The book can provide a reference for future grand
celebrations, including the festival to greet 1997 Hong Kong's
return to the motherland and the 50th National Day."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government arranged the annual National Day parades
and military reviews until 1959. From 1960 to the early 1970s, the
Chinese people saw parades, but without military reviews.
</P>
<P>
The book of "The Grand Celebrations -- Records of the Beijing
People's National Day Parades" spans nearly 20 years of parades
history before 1966, the first year of the Cultural Revolution
(1966-1976), and the 1984 grand parades and military reviews by

<HEADLINE> Israel Warns PA Official Against Inflammatory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Israel today warned the
Palestinian Authority (PA) of negative affects of remarks by a
senior security head who called for removing Jewish settlers
from Hebron.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister Office said in a statement that the
remarks by Jbril Rajoub, head of Palestinian Preventive Security
Service, were violation of the signed Hebron agreement.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to cheering Palestinians a day earlier, Rajoub said
that the Jewish settlers in Hebron were "big stones on our
chest, so we have to take them off."
</P>
<P>
There are 450 settlers now living in the 20 percent area of
the town, over which Israel retains security control, among
120,000 Palestinian residents. As a result of decades of
deeply-rooted religious feuds that have led to several
massacres, Palestinian residents had hoped that the Jewish
settlers would be removed out of the city.
</P>
<P>
"We will struggle, both the government and the people, in
order to liberate the rest of Hebron," Rajoub said.
</P>
<P>
His remarks aroused strong protest from the settlers. Settler
spokesman Noam Arnon denounced Rajoub's statements as "incitement
of violence against settlers", which is banned by the Hebron
agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister Office warned that the responsibility of
any negative effects arising from Rajoub's statements would rest
on the shoulder of the Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
David Bar-Ilan, media adviser for Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu, told reporters that Rajoub's comments were tantamount
to incitement of violence against settlers. He said such
statements were unacceptable because "they would only damage the
peace process."
</P>
<P>
In a goodwill gesture, Palestinian President Yasser Arafat
today called for peace co-existence between the settlers and
Palestinians in Hebron during his first visit to the
newly-liberated city.
</P>
<P>
"I tell the settlers, we do not want any confrontation...we are
also with the just peace," he said, recalling a meeting between
him and settler leaders late last year. Arafat promised that the
PA would honor its commitments to the peace accords if Israel
would keep its obligations.

<HEADLINE> American Balloonist to Abort Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 19 (Xinhua) -- American Balloonist Steve
Fossett's ground crew in Chicago said that he was expected to land
in either India or Bangladesh at about 0700 GMT Monday.
</P>
<P>
Fossett's support team says the balloon does not have enough
fuel to complete the around-world-nonstop trip. He began his
trip Monday in St. Louis of the United States.
</P>
<P>
"If we press on, we're kind of snuggling up against the
Himalayas, which are so high that we actually cannot overfly
them," said Bruce Comstock, ground crew spokesman. "We certainly
don't want to land in the Himalayas or on the Tibetan Plateau
which is about 15,000 feet above sea level."
</P>
<P>
In addition to the shortage of fuel, Fossett's physical strain
also calls for the decision to abort the mission.
</P>
<P>
"The reason he's tired is we've once again had heat problems,
so he's been unable to sleep as much as he should have been able
to sleep because the capsule's been cold," Comstock said.
</P>
<P>
Fossett was trying to stay aloft until early Monday to become
not only a world distance record setter for ballooning but also
the record for longest time spent in the air.
</P>
<P>
By noon Saturday, Fossett had traveled 9,600 miles (16,900
kilometers) in his silver-colored balloon, Solo Spirit.
</P>
<P>
The 52-year-old securities trader already has broken his own
distance ballooning record, 5,435 miles (9,130 kilometers) on a
1995 flight from Seoul, South Korea, to Canada.

<HEADLINE> Farmers' Income In East China Provice Exceeds 3,000 Yuan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Per-capita income of farmers
in east China's Zhejiang Province was 3,463 yuan (417.23 US
dollars) last year, a record for the economically-booming coastal
province.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Governor Liu Xirong announced Saturday that the income
tops all other provinces and autonomous regions and represents
yearly rise of 6.1 percent at 1996 prices.
</P>
<P>
Local economists attribute the fast growth in farmers' income
to the province's commercialization rate of agriculture and
sideline products, and rapid introduction of market principles to
rural development.
</P>
<P>
Farmer-run enterprises have expanded their share to 70 percent
of the province's economy, and, have outstripped agriculture as a
source of farmers' income.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that Zhejiang's farmer-run enterprises had
attained more than 31.8 billion yuan in pre-tax profits last year,
up 14 percent from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Tertiary industries have raised their proportion of the local
economy from 29.5 to 32 percent, and have provided millions of job
opportunities and great economic benefits for farmers, the
economists said.

<HEADLINE> 17 Kenyans Killed in Road Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Seventeen Kenyans were killed
in a road accident along the Nakuru-Eldoret Highway on Friday
night, according to a Sunday Times report today.
</P>
<P>
Peter Kavila, Senior Superintendent of Nakuru Central Police
Station, 160 kilometers northwest of Nairobi, confirmed that 15
people died instantly and another two died while undergoing
treatment.
</P>
<P>
Seven people admitted to a Nakuru hospital were in a critical
condition while 23 others sustained minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
The Nakuru police boss noted that the accident occurred near
Ngata Farm shortly after 11.30 p.m. (local time) when the bus
hit a combine harvester as the driver was
trying to overtake.
</P>
<P>
The bus heading for Isebania on the Kenyan-Tanzanian border
collided head-on with a on-coming lorry heading towards Nakuru
when the bus attempted to overtake the combined harvester.
</P>
<P>
Following the accident, Wali Oyondi, member of parliament from
Nakuru Town, on Saturday called for bus operators on
Nairobi-Kisii route to be vigilant. He criticized the drivers on
the route as "notorious" in overspeeding with some buses running
at a speed of over 150 km per hour.
</P>
<P>
The death rate on Kenyan roads is among the highest in the
world with one accident in five being fatal, said an earlier
report compiled by the International Road Federation.
</P>
<P>
Recent estimates show that Kenya has the higher number of road
accidents among developing countries with an average of 8.2 lives
lost daily in the country with a population of 28 million.

<P>
XI'AN, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Customs officials in Xi'an,
capital city of northwest China's Shaanxi Province, collected a
record 600 million yuan in taxes last year.
</P>
<P>
The revenue was more than 91 million yuan, or an increase of
17.6 percent over the previous year, said a customs official.
</P>
<P>
The increase was achieved despite sluggish imports as a result
of a reduction in tax tariffs, he said.
</P>
<P>
Customs officers have expanded the sources of tax revenue,
enhanced examinations on tax reduction and exemption, and clamped
down on tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
Last year they uncovered more than 50 smuggling cases involving
some 100 million yuan.

<HEADLINE> Laws Promote Agricultural Production in North China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, January 19 (Xinhua) -- A special card has helped
relieve heavy burdens off the shoulders of farmers in north
China's Shanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
The card, which has been distributed among farmers in more than
80 percent of the counties of the province, enables them to refuse
to pay unreasonable or outlawed fees to various departments, and
to sue those departments for over-charging.
</P>
<P>
An official said this was only one part of the province's
commitment to strengthening legal supervision and protection of
agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
Experts attribute successive harvests in the drought-frequented
province since 1993 to the fact some 40 laws and regulations, all
promulgated and implemented over recent years, have served to
legalize Shanxi's agricultural production, and improve its
investment environment.
</P>
<P>
In 1996 alone, governments at all levels within Shanxi province
cracked 316 cases involving false or over-charging by departments,
relieving 178 million yuan of burden off the shoulders of local
farmers.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that years of publicity work on legal
matters have increased awareness of the law among public servants
at grass-roots level and the province's peasants.
</P>
<P>
He added that in recent years, departments concerned have also
concentrated on cracking down on fake and inferior products in a
move to ensure a reasonable agricultural production order.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in 1996, 373 cases were cracked, resulting
in the confiscation of some 370 tons of fake seeds, 2,300 tons of
fake chemical fertilizers and 18.28 tons of fake pesticides.

<HEADLINE> Policeman Shot Dead in Clash with Soccer Fans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 19 (Xinhua) -- A policeman was shot dead
and several others injured in a football violence here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to a report reaching here, the violence broke out
when several thousand fans were not allowed to enter the Ellis
Park stadium where the National Soccer League (NSL) teams Orland
Pirates and Kaizer Chiefs were playing.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of angry fans began hurling stones and bottles at
police who replied by firing stun grenades.
</P>
<P>
One policeman was injured in the face by a rock, while another
was injured in the arm.
</P>
<P>
Fighting broke out again after the match, when a 24-year old
off-duty policeman was shot in the face while leaving the stadium
and later died in hospital.
</P>
<P>
In other incidents, two fans were stabbed and shot in the neck
and face, while members of the crowd prevented ambulance workers
from attending to the injured.
</P>
<P>
Police believed that the NSL should take the responsibility for
the violence because it sold up to 100,000 tickets for the match,
though the studium is only designed to hold 65,000 people.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: S. African Govt Squirms Over Arms Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The South African
government squirmed over a planned arms deal worth 638 million
U.S. Dollars with Syria, said a "Sunday Times" report today.
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to defuse the row caused by media reports on the
deal, the foreign ministry said in an earlier statement that the
cabinet had given approval for the tank firing control systems
only to be marketed in Syria, rather than delivered.
</P>
<P>
However, according to the newspaper, the cabinet had already
agreed that a pending contract be signed to deliver the systems
to Syria, subject to Deputy President Thabo Mbeki's approval.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's major state arms producer, the DENEL, had
stated two days ago that "there is no question" of an arms deal
with Syria.
</P>
<P>
DENEL spokesman Paul Holtzhausen said the permission for the
arms deal was granted by the National Arms Coordinating Committee
at the end of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that the cabinet approval for the arms deal with
Syria could plunge the South African government into a diplomatic
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The United States earlier issued its toughest warning to
President Nelson Mandela, saying it might be obliged to suspend
aid to South Africa if the deal goes ahead.
</P>
<P>
Mandela retaliated by saying that his country's foreign
policy would not be dictated by any foreign powers.
</P>
<P>
South African Ambassador to Israel, Frank Land, was summoned
by the Israeli foreign ministry and warned of the adverse efforts
of the arms deal.
</P>
<P>
South Africa alleged that a U.S. company was backing one of
the European companies bidding for the Syrian contract.
</P>
<P>
According to Sunday Times, DENEL has spent about 820,000 U.S.
Dollars on sending a team of technicians to Syria where the
control system was fitted to tanks and successfully tested last
November.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet is expected to review the proposed arms deal on
Wednesday.

LAGOS, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Two campuses of the University
of Nigeria Nsukka (UNN) were closed on Saturday after students
destroyed properties during a violent protest.
</P>
<P>
In the Nsukka and Enugu campuses, the students sacked the
residence of the vice-chancellor and burnt the official vehicle
of the chief security officer. The residence of the

The university authorities are yet to uncover the identities
of the rioters who struck barely two days after the school
reopened.
</P>
<P>
Local press reports sai the riot was sparked off by the recent
increase in school fees. Before the riot occurred, some leaflets
had circulated in the campuses, calling on students to resist any
exploitation by the university authorities.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the administrator of Enugu campus on
Saturday said the decision to close the campuses for the second
time is "in the interest of the university and all students."

<HEADLINE> Arafat Visits Hebron, Calling for Continued </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his emotional speech to about 60,000 jubilant flag-waving
Palestinians who gathered before the former Israeli military
headquarters, Arafat declared the formal liberation of Hebron,
the last West Bank city under Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
This is first official visit here by Arafat, who flew in
in a helicopter shortly after noon to a tumultuous welcome.
</P>
<P>
Speaking from the balcony on the top floor of the
headquarters, Arafat termed today as a day of celebration and a
day to remember thousands of the "martyrs" who have laid down
their lives in the long struggle for Palestinian liberation. His
speech often aroused loud cheers and chanting of "Long live
Palestine" and "Long live Arafat."
</P>
<P>
In a sign indicating the possible collision course of
future peace process, Arafat called for Palestinian national
unity and Jihad (holy fight) to fight for the liberation of
eastern Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The PNA wants eastern Jerusalem to be capital of a future
independent Palestinian state, but Israeli hardline Likud
government has vowed it would never compromise its self-claimed
sovereignty over the holy city and the opposition to
establishing a totally independent Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
In a good will gesture, Arafat called on Israeli
peace-lovers to work together with the Palestinians to
accomplish a just and comprehensive peace, which should include
the establishment of a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
He promised the PNA would honor its commitments to the
peace accords, while urging Israel to do the same. He also
called on Jewish settlers who stayed in the 20 percent area
of the city to live in peace with the Palestinian residents.
</P>
<P>
Arafat saluted Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Jordanian King
Hussein, the European Union and other "friendly countries" for
their contribution to help achieve the Hebron agreement. Thanks
to the last-minute mediation by King Hussein and Mubarak, the
long-delayed Hebron agreement was signed last week under the
auspices of the U.S., ending over three month marathon talks.
</P>
<P>
Arafat also called on U.S. President Bill Clinton and
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu to continue the peace
process "not only with Egypt, Jordan, Palestine, but also with
Syria and Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
But tension in the flashpoint city remained high as 450
settlers, many of whom are armed and militant, still stayed
in several settlements in the heart of the city among
200,000 Palestinian residents. The other 80 percent area was
handed over to the PNA control early Friday morning within
hours.
</P>
<P>
In sharp contrast to the joy of Palestinians, Jewish
settlers declared today as a day of mourning that witnessed
the visit to the city of Jewish patriarchs by Arafat, who
is blasphemed by them as a "murderer" and "terrorist".
</P>
<P>
To maintain security and order, a large number of
Palestinian policemen in dark-blue uniforms were deployed in the
Palestinian areas. Israeli soldiers were also on high vigilance
against possible violence between extremists from both sides.
</P>
<P>
After his arrived here shortly after noon, a smiling Arafat
waved to the welcoming crowd a V sign for victory and
shaked hands with some of the Palestinians nearby as he
squeezed his way to the police headquarters in an open wagon.
</P>
<P>
To welcome Arafat's visit, streets and buildings in the
Palestinian part of Hebron were decorated with Palestinian flags
and Arafat's portraits. For the past days, Palestinian residents
have been holding celebrations for freedom, which culminated in
Arafat's visit.

The SSP is an influential militant religious group in Pakistan
that is strongly against Shiite Muslims.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators urged the government to take effective
measures to curb such ugly incidents.
</P>
<P>
They said that the sectarian killing was creating uncertainty,
lawlessness, chaos and disorder which had already affected the
country's stability.
</P>
<P>
"The rising crime and violence in the society in recent days
should be of deep concern to our politicians, religious leaders
and common men who are affected by the poor law and order
situation," they said.

<HEADLINE> US Accused of Using Uranium Bullets in Gulf War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 19 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi newspaper today
accused the United States of using uranium projectiles against
Iraqi army during the Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
In an article marking the 6th anniversary of the Gulf War, the
Baghdad Observer quoted a secret report released by Britain's
Atomic Energy Authority as saying that uranium was used in attacks
against Iraqi vehicles by U.S. and British tanks in the 1991 war.
</P>
<P>
Lt. Colonel Vincent Maccin, a combat commander in "Desert
Storm," told the energy authority "every attack craft in the air
and on the ground carried them (uranium projectiles)."
</P>
<P>
The British organization stated that at least 40 tons of spent
uranium were scattered in the desert in northern Kuwait and
southern Iraq during the Desert Storm launched by the U.S.-led
allies in January 1991 against Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
But other experts assume that there are 300 tons of this type
of ammunition scattered in the border areas between Iraq and
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The Baghdad Observer also cited the findings of German
professor Siegwart Horst-Gunther, who presented evidence
supported by facts and documents that prove the use of uranium
ammunition during the war.
</P>
<P>
According to the German professor, uranium projectiles were
used for the first time by the allied troops during the war with
devastating effects and consequences.
</P>
<P>
In March 1991, Gunther, who organized and carried out several
relief actions for the sick and starving Iraqi people, detected
projectiles in an Iraqi combat area.
</P>
<P>
He found that the use of projectiles which contained depleted
uranium, a highly toxic radioactive material, contributes to the
so-called "Gulf War syndrome" and many deaths of Iraqi children.
</P>
<P>
However, Pentagon never admits the use of uranium projectiles
and always says the "Gulf War syndrome" has something to do with
the Iraqi chemical and biological factories bombarded by the allied
forces during the Gulf War.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Mosquito Menace Grips City of Dhaka (by Tian Fan) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- For Md. Abu Taher, a resident of
Bangladesh's capital city of Dhaka, the most irritant of her life
is not air pollution, shortage of electricity or water, but
mosquito.
</P>
<P>
"Mosquito menace has made our life miserable. Soon after the
sunset, we can't pass even a minute without having a burning
mosquito coil," complained Taher, adding that her children also
can't study without taking shelter inside a mosquito net.
</P>
<P>
The ever-increasing mosquitoes are also a big headache for the
Dhaka City Corporation (DCC), which is responsible for ensuring a
smooth civic life in the capital of about 8.6 million population.
</P>
<P>
The DCC is now continuing its anti-mosquito drive, which began
in July last year, with 500 hand spray machines, 104 fogger
machines, 30 vehicle mounting spray machines and two wheel machine
sprayers by a total manpower of nearly 550 people.
</P>
<P>
Local people, however, claimed the number of mosquitoes are
still on the rise. They alleged that the spraymen were quite
irregular.
</P>
<P>
M. Abdur Rahim, a businessman at Paikpara in the Mirpur area
said that he found the DCC men spraying insecticide for several
occasions. But the rate of mosquitoes in his area goes high again
after one to two days of the spray.
</P>
<P>
It is impossible to completely free the capital city from
mosquitoes. "The only thing we hope is to keep them under
control," admitted Dr. Ashrafuddin, the chief medical officer of
the DCC.
</P>
<P>
Ashrafuddin said that the DCC decided to carry out an aerial
spray but the decision was abandoned because the aerial spray
within a limited area could not bring any fruitful result.
</P>
<P>
"The city dwellers will feel comfort for few days after
spraying but the situation will take previous shape because
Mosquitoes do not need passports to travel," he said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the DCC bought insecticides worth 600 thousands U.S.
dollars and equipment worth 400 tho it was
strengthened prior to the high breeding season beginning in
November. "Yet you'll see mosquitoes. We can't prevent them flying
in the city from the areas beyond our jurisdiction," said
Ashrafuddin.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, DCC officials said their anti-mosquito drive could
not attain the desired success due to the slackness of government
departments and private house owners to keep their own premises
clean.
</P>
<P>
A DCC official said that a number of ditches and marshlands
owned by different bodies, which are proved to be the main
breeding beds for mosquitoes, do not maintain the cleanliness
properly.
</P>
<P>
The DCC requested those departments several times in black and
white to keep their premises clean, but they never responded, he
regretted.

<HEADLINE> Israel Criticized for Refusing to Withdraw </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Syrian media today criticized
Israel for refusing to withdraw from the Golan Heights captured by
Israel in the 1967 Mideast War.
</P>
<P>
Syrian official newspaper Al-Baath said today Israeli Prime
Minister Binyamin Netanyahu's statements in which he reiterated
Israel's adherence to the Golan Heights and Jerusalem are in line
with his policy based on "arrogance, intransigence and attempts to
impose his terms on others."
</P>
<P>
Israeli intransigent attitudes are likely to close the door to
peace efforts and to worry all the parties interested to achieve a
fair and overall peace in this region, the paper added.
</P>
<P>
Syrian newspaper Teshreen today also noted that the Netanyahu
government, by refusing to withdraw from the Golan Heights and
south Lebanon, searches neither for security or peace but
expansion and continuing "aggressive wars."
</P>
<P>
The paper pointed out that all Israel's pretexts for failing
to withdraw from the Golan Heights are not even worth discussing.
</P>
<P>
Syrian newspaper Al-Thawra said that Israel's calls for Syria
to return to the negotiating table unconditionally are a sort of
"deception and delusion."

<HEADLINE> Municipal Government of Kiev Running Heavy Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The government of this Ukrainian
capital city is operating on a budget deficit more than 40 percent
of its revenues, Deputy Mayor Viktor Padalka said today.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government, the official said, had a revenue of
500 million hryvnas (about 270 million U.S. dollars) in 1996 but
spent 900 million hryvnas (486 million dollars) instead.
</P>
<P>
The city's problem reflected the national economic situation,
Padalka said, adding: "Kiev is part of a country suffering from
the chronic disease of deficit spending."
</P>
<P>
He blamed the problem on the thriving black-market economy,
from which the government failed to collect taxes.
</P>
<P>
"More than 3,000 firms now operating in Kiev are not registered
anywhere and pay no taxes," the deputy mayor said. "Unfortunately,
the city's regulatory and enforcement agencies do not have the
resources to track down all the violators."
</P>
<P>
"If 50 percent of the country's gross national product (GNP) is
produced in the black market, this figure will be about 70 percent
in Kiev because the watchfulness of local authorities is minimal
here," said City Council member Igor Losev.
</P>
<P>
Losev added that legalization of the black-market economy
sector in Kiev could have doubled budget revenues and eliminated
the deficit.
</P>
<P>
Many of the legitimate businesses in the Ukrainian capital are
operating at a loss, reducing the tax income of the city.
</P>
<P>
"In 1996, one-fourth of Kiev businesses were losing money,"
said Larisa Smolyaninova, head of the city's economic department.
</P>
<P>
In spite of the revenue which is far below expectation, the
city spent twice as much as planned on various benefits for
veterans and disabled citizens, while failing to promptly pay the
wages and pension of municipal employees and retirees.
</P>
<P>
The press service of the city government said in a press
release that the wage arrears have amounted to 100 million hryvnas
(about 54 million dollars) by the end of 1996 due to empty
municipal coffers.
</P>
<P>
Losev said the performance of city officials was as much to
blame for the city's financial difficulties as the general
economic climate.
</P>
<P>
"Kiev did not have enough money to pay salaries, clean streets
or maintain adequate public transportation and health facilities,
but the city government used more than 100 million hryvnas to
reconstruct the Ukraina concert hall and buy Opel cars for top
officials," he said.

In a good will gesture, Arafat called on peace-loving
Israeli people to work together with the Palestinians to
accomplish a just and comprehensive peace, which includes the
establishment of Palestinian state.

Arafat saluted Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Jordanian King
Hussein, the European Union and other "friendly countries" for
their contribution to help achieve the Hebron agreement.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Javier Solana, Secretary General
of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), arrives in
Moscow today to discuss relations between Russia and NATO.
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, the NATO chief is expected to meet Russian Foreign
Minister Yevgeny Primakov and other high-ranking officials.
</P>
<P>
During Solana's visit the problem of NATO's eastward expansion
is likely to be raised. Moscow has categorically opposed the
planned admission of East European nations as new member states
into the Western military alliance.
</P>
<P>
Primakov declared recently that Moscow has no right to veto a
dangerous possibility of NATO's expansion.
</P>
<P>
"But another thing is that no one, including NATO member
states, can veto our right to defend our national interests," he
said, adding that Russia mainly fears that "NATO's expansion might
lead to a split in Europe."
</P>
<P>
On the eve of his departure for Moscow, Solana told reporters
in Brussels that during his visit to Moscow he was planning to
discuss a possibility of drafting a charter on the relations
between NATO and Russia.
</P>
<P>
He said he did not expect the talks to be easy.

<P>
He said he planned to compete in the Korea Open next week and

<HEADLINE> Another Nigerian Politician Escapes Terrorist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 19 (Xinhua) -- A new fear of insecurity was
raised on Saturday when Bode Olajumoke, national Deputy Chairman
of the United Nigeria Congress Party (UNCP), was attacked by
unknown gunmen.
</P>
<P>
Olajumoke and seven political associates, who were traveling
along the Lagos-Ibadan Express Way, escaped unhurt, according to a
report from the Guardian newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred only five days after Abraham Adesanya,
deputy Chairman of the National Democratic Coalition, survived a
hail of bullets in Lagos.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the car which carried Olajumoke and
others was approaching a toll gate when it was shot at. Unsure of
what happened, the driver stopped to check if the car had a flat
tyre.
</P>
<P>
But moments after the passengers stepped down, a four-man
gang, heavily armed, emerged on the scene and asked for the
whereabouts of Olajumoke who had walked away.
</P>
<P>
The disappointed gunmen then ordered everybody to lie down on
the roadside and proceeded to search for their victims, taking
away money, wrist watches, documents and other valuables.
</P>
<P>
"I took refuge in the bush for about 40 minutes. Although I
started hearing my friends calling me that the ordeal was over, I
did not respond until I saw one farmer who indeed confirmed it,"
the report quoted Olajumoke as saying.
</P>
<P>
"I think it was three days ago that I visited Adesanya who was
attacked. Today it is me," he said, adding that the attack on him
was most likely a robbery incident, rather than an assassination
attempt.
</P>
<P>
Investigation of the incident is currently underway.

<HEADLINE> No Visa for IRA Leader, Says U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The United States has signaled
that it will not issue an entry visa to Gerry Adams, the leader of
the political wing Sinn Fein of the Irish Republican Army (IRA),
until the IRA reinstates its ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
Local press reports today quoted diplomats in Washington as
saying: "the Clinton Administration has let it be known to Adams
that if he seeks a visa to come here (the United States) around
St. Patrick's Day on l7 March, the request would be refused."
</P>
<P>
In February l994, the U.S. government overruled objections from
Britain and reversed decades of the U.S. policy by granting a visa
to Adams. Since then Adams has visited the U.S. five times.
</P>
<P>
For the past four years, the IRA has been able to count on
American support to pressure the British Government to negotiate a
peace settlement, said a report in Independent On Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The refusal of a visa until there is a new ceasefire represents
an important change in the American policy towards Sinn Fein,
according to the newspaper report.
</P>
<P>
The development is the sharpest sign of the increasingly
visible irritation of the U.S. government that despite its
constant entreaties, the IRA has not taken the step to gain Sinn
Fein a presence at the virtually-stalled Northern Ireland peace
talks, observers said.

<HEADLINE> China's Sewing Machines Expands Market Internationally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 19 (Xinhua) -- China's exports of sewing
machines are expected to grow at about 20 percent annually in the
coming three or four years, developing into an emerging exporter
for the international market.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, the annual export will surpass 500 million US
dollars, and the buyers' list of the industry will expand to
Africa, South America, the United States and Europe, said today's
Business Weekly of China Daily.
</P>
<P>
At present, China produces more than eight million sewing
machines annually; its production capacity is more than 10 million
units.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the rapidly developing clothing industry in Southeast
Asia, countries in the region and Hong Kong have been the
traditional markets for mainland sewing machines.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Chonghe, chairman of the China Sewing Machine Association,
said that the domestic industry will continue to develop the Asian
market, including India, since it bears great potential due to its
fast-growing economy and large population.
</P>
<P>
Also, the industry should increase its market share in the
United States, which is a market in term of its producing
capacity, and other foreign markets through improving product
quality and raising the added value of machines.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus, Greece Unanimous on Cyprus Issue: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos
Clerides has said that Cyprus and Greece have taken unanimous
decisions on how to handle current and future moves related
to the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Clerides made the remark Saturday Night upon his return from a
three-day visit to Greece, during which the two countries
coordinated their efforts toward the Cyprus issue, according to
local press today.
</P>
<P>
Expressing satisfaction with his talks in Athens, the president
said that Nicosia and Athens have unanimously mapped out their
future policy on how to handle developments regarding the Cyprus
problem and other current issues.
</P>
<P>
He identified these issues as the purchase of the Russian-made
surface-to-air missiles by the Cyprus government for defense
purposes, the U.N.-sponsored military dialogue to reduce tension
along the demarcation line on the island and the U.S. proposal on
the flights ban.
</P>
<P>
However, President Clerides refrained from disclosing any
details about the Athens decisions on these issues.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus' deal to buy Russian missiles with a range of 150
kilometers, the agreement of which was signed on January 4, has
triggered criticism from the United States. And Turkey has
threatened to strike at the missiles if they are deployed.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the U.S. proposal for a ban on flights of
Greek and Turkish military aircraft over the island, the
President said "no such an agreement has been made, and it
will not be made either."
</P>
<P>
He explained that it is up to the Cyprus government to decide
during the peace negotiations, widely expected to start in the
months ahead, whether it should refrain from inviting Greek
aircraft to Cyprus. This, he said, is not a moratorium.
</P>
<P>
President Clerides announced in Athens after talks with the
Greek side the moratorium banning Greek and Turkish military
aircraft flights over the island "is dead."
</P>
<P>
But U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said
in Washington that U.S. special envoy Carey Cavanaugh
was confident that an agreement on a ban on overflights of
Greek and Turkish military aircraft is being taken very
seriously.
</P>
<P>
Concerning the peace efforts toward a Cyprus settlement, the
president said between now and the end of August, things will
become clearer in terms of progress toward a settlement.
</P>
<P>
He also underlined that common ground on the basic aspects
of the Cyprus question is a precondition for the start of
talks between the two communities.
</P>
<P>
"This common ground has been defined during our talks in
Athens. Unanimous decisions were taken on what constitutes common
ground," the President was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that a U.S. backed initiative on
Cyprus question will begin early in April.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
invaded and seized the northern third of the island following
an Athens-backed coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-sponsored peace talks aimed at reuniting the island
under a bizonal and bicommunal federal state have been held
on and off for the past 22 years, but so far no tangible
results have been achieved.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Workers of the religious
group Sapah-e-Sahaba Pakistan (SSP) today ransacked the Iranian
cultural center in Lahore of Pakistan before setting it on fire.
</P>
<P>
The SSP workers, after offering funeral prayers for their chief
Maulana Ziaur Rehman who was killed in Saturday bomb blast,
attacked the Iranian culture center located near the funeral site.
</P>
<P>
The fire caused heavy loss of books and other printed materials
in the center, according to local reports.
</P>
<P>
A remote control bomb blasted in a court in Lahore, capital of
eastern Punjab province on Saturday, when two SSP leaders, who
were earlier arrested in connection with various cases of
sectarian violence, were produced before the court for grant of
bail.
</P>
<P>
About 19 people were killed and 90 others injured in the
incident. Ziaur was among the killed while another SSP leader
sustained serious injuries.
</P>
<P>
The SSP is an influential religious group in Pakistan, who
strongly opposes Shiite Muslims.
</P>
<P>
Certain Pakistani leaders blamed some Muslim countries for the
incident.
</P>
<P>
After the SSP workers offered the funeral prayer of their slain
leader, they staged a demonstration, which was well covered by the
heavy police contingent.
</P>
<P>
However, police became helpless when the demonstrators started
moving towards the Iranian Cultural Center.
</P>
<P>
Soon, they were in front of the Iranian Cultural Center and
attacked the building before the police could control them, it was
set ablaze, said eyewitnesses.
</P>
<P>
Later, the SSP workers were dispersed from the scene and fire
was put off.
</P>

No casualties have been reported so far.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait to Adopt Measures to Regulate Labor Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait would adopt many
new measures in the coming days to regulate the labor market and
streamline procedures for foreign laborers.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti Minister of Social Affairs and Labor Ahmad Khaled
Al-Kulaib made the remarks at a press conference here Saturday
night.
</P>
<P>
Foreign laborers who came to Kuwait for work under a Kuwaiti
sponsor usually needed to get at first two years of residence
permit, anybody who wanted to change sponsorship or work during
this period must either go back to his own country and return
again or wait for two years.
</P>
<P>
Under the new measures, the two-year period required for the
local transfer of residence will be reduced to one year only.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the minister revealed a plan by his ministry to
impose high charges regarding almost all services including
issuance of work permits and transfer of residence. The fees
will be "high enough to make employers and employees to think
twice about whether it is better to make the transfer locally or
leave the country to come back."
</P>
<P>
Kulaib said this decision is aimed at encouraging employers to
recruit manpower from the local market. Kuwait is facing a
potential unemployment of 30 percent by the year 2000 as tens of
thousands of youths and graduates will come into the labor market
during the next several years, he added.
</P>
<P>
He also said a special committee has been formed to study
applications for licenses and cautioned that no permits would
be issued to employ unnecessary laborers, namely, unskilled
laborers.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labor have
also formed a commission, grouping 300 inspectors, to clamp down
on irregularities in terms of labor permits and workers of
illegal status, according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
Kulaib also said that the ministry will not approve work
permits for laborers of huge contracts unless the laborers are
hired from four different countries, adding that "the ministry
will also interfere with selecting the nationalities in a bid to
balance the structure of expatriates in Kuwait."
</P>
<P>
However, issuance of work permits for 13 sectors, including
state-owned companies, private schools, clinics, hotels, banks,
car dealers and newspapers, will continue as before, the
ministers said.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated his ministry's recent decision to apply a
minimum wage of 165 U.S. dollars and 330 U.S. dollars for
cleaners and employees of security companies respectively. He
said contracts which do not stipulate minimum wage are not
accepted.
</P>
<P>
These measures are in compliance with the principles of a new
Labor Law under consideration in Kuwait, which largely depends on
foreign manpower, Kulaib said.

<HEADLINE> Talks on Issues Beyond Hebron to Start Soon: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Israel and Palestine will
soon start the talks on other issues after the Hebron
redeployment to push forward the peace process, a Palestinian
official was quoted as saying today.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed Dahlan, security head in the Gaza Strip, told
Israel Radio that negotiators would discuss a number of
issues, including the opening of safe passages between West
Bank and Gaza Strip, the Gaza airport and the Gaza port,
and the release of Palestinian prisoners.
</P>
<P>
He said that the talks on the release of security
prisoners would convene in two weeks time.
</P>
<P>
The talks on the above-mentioned issues were stipulated in
the Note for the Record provided by the the U.S. as an
annex to the just-concluded agreement on Israeli troop
redeployment in Hebron. It demanded the two sides resume
immediately the talks after the redeployment, which was
completed last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli officials expected that the Hebron
redeployment would help improve the soured relations with
several gulf Arab states, which have frozen the ties with
Israel since the hardline Likud government came to power last
June.
</P>
<P>
The officials said the U.S. is taking advantage of the
Hebron agreement to persuade the Arab states to resume
normalization process with Israel. The U.S. government is
contacting countries such as Qatar, Oman and Tunisia on this
matter.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu
would soon get an invitation to visit Egypt. In a move to
exert pressure on Israel to conclude the Hebron deal, Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak had refused to receive Netanyahu before
the Hebron redeployment.

<HEADLINE> Booming Area in China Impresses Foreign Journalists (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 19 (Xinhua) -- One could hardly believe this
was the residence of a farmer. This was the impression of a group
of journalists during a recent visit to a farmer's house in
Xiaolan Town, Zhongshan city, in south China's Guangdong province.
</P>
<P>
The nine journalists from news agencies of countries, namely,
Turkey, Indonesia, Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Japan, Russia,
India, Thailand and China, were attending the 2nd Seminar for
Economic Writers and Editors of the Organization of Asia-Pacific
News Agencies (OANA) held in Guangzhou, capital of Guangdong
province, on January 6-16.
</P>
<P>
Apart from attending lectures given by Chinese and American
professors and a British expert, the participants to the seminar
also toured the Pearl River Delta area, one of the most developed
areas in China. Their tour covered Guangzhou, Shunde, Zhongshan
cities, and the Zhuhai Special Economic Zone.
</P>
<P>
Shunde and Zhongshan, ranking among the cities with the highest
economic growth rate in China since 1978, are two of the "four
little tigers" in Guangdong province.
</P>
<P>
The industrial and agricultural output value of Shunde city
reached 45.7 billion yuan last year, compared with only 1.6
billion in 1978, according to Zhao Ruji, secretary general of the
city government.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the city's GDP came to 15.4 billion yuan with the
per capita GDP reaching 15,000 yuan, and the per capita income for
rural residents and city workers was about 4,000 and 10,000 yuan,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Latest reports released by the State Statistics show that
China's per capita GDP in 1996 was expected to reach 5,600 yuan,
and the per capita income for rural and urban residents, 1,900 and
4,380 yuan, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The two-floor house in Xiaolan town, and newly erected
apartment buildings in the downtown area of Zhongshan, are clear
evidence that ordinary Chinese have been benefited much from the
reform and opening up in the past 18 years, said an official with
the city government.
</P>
<P>
Wu Ruicheng, vice mayor of Zhongshan, said the city has built
15 million square meters of housing in both the urban and suburban
parts of the city over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
"To improve Zhongshan people's living environment, the city
government has built a 100-million-yuan ecology park, and has
started the construction of a larger one," he added.
</P>
<P>
Impressed by what he saw in the city, Vladimir Gerasimov from
Russia's Itar-Tass News Agency said to Wu: "you call yourself a
little tiger; I should say you are already a middle-age one."

Zhuhai city adjacent to Macao was the last leg of the
journalists' tour in Guangdong. Since the establishment of the
Zhuhai Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in 1980, the former remote
village by the sea has blossomed into an emerging economic
powerhouse at the western part of the Pearl River Delta, with
well-developed infrastructure and a robust export-oriented
industry.
</P>
<P>
Since 1980, Zhuhai's economy has been growing at an annual
average of 35 percent, and its GDP hit 20 billion yuan last year,
more than 40 times the 1979 figure.
</P>
<P>
To support further economic expansion, Zhuhai has worked out an
ambitious plan to develop infrastructure and basic industries,
said Liang Guangda, secretary of the City Party Committee.
</P>
<P>
Liang, who is also chairman of the Administration Committee of
the SEZ, observed that the plan includes a railway line from
Guangzhou to Zhuhai at an estimated cost of 3.5 billion yuan, a
power plant with a designed generating capacity of 3.72 million
kw, and an international oil and gas storage and transport center
at the Zhuhai port.
</P>
<P>
At the end of their tour, the journalists offered their
opinions and suggestions to Huang Longyun, mayor of Zhuhai, and
other city officials, at a get-together.
</P>
<P>
Minggu Simon Lhasa from Malaysia was much concerned about the
development of the small local enterprises, and suggested that the
city pay more attention to supporting their growth; while Lee
Woo-Sung from the Republic of Korea expressed his hope that Zhuhai
should focus on tourism, since the city boasts of beautiful sea
scenery and good environment.
</P>
<P>
Having some difficulties in communicating with local residents,
Narintorn Chimsuntorn from Thailand called for more efforts being
made on improving the education of the residents, so that Zhuhai
would become a true international city.
</P>
<P>
When Gurbuz Akkiran from Turkey said he wished to visit other
Chinese cities such as the ancient capital of Xi'an soon, he
voiced the common aspiration of the journalists attending the OANA
seminar.
</P>
<P>
Having acquainted themselves with the rapid economic expansion
in China, the journalists were eager to know more about various
other fields of this land of ancient glory and future splendor.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Not To Ratify ILO Conventions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government will
not ratify some of the conventions of the International Labour
Organisation (ILO) as they are not appropriate to Zimbabwe,
Minister of Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare Floence
Chitauro yesterday said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the Zimbabwean government examined each
convention carefully before ratification to see whether or not it
will benefit the country.
</P>
<P>
Chitauro was responding to demands by representatives of civil
servants that it should ratify all ILO conventions. She said
even the so-called democratic countries like the United States of
America had not ratified all conventions.
</P>
<P>
Yet there were some countries that had ratified as many as 100
but were flouting them every day.
</P>
<P>
''So don't fooled that the more conventions you ratify, the
better things are going to be. The United States has ratified
only seven because they are in line with their laws. We should
also look up to our laws to protect us and not just the
conventions,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
She recalled that before she joined the government and was
with the Trade Union Movement she had pushed for ratification of
some ILO conventions.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that she had taken that spirit with her into
the government and continued to push for ratification, only to
realise that if this is done, some companies will have to close
down as they will not be able to cope with the demands, while
some do not have the technology needed to meet the demands of
these conventions.

NEW DELHI, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Census figures released here
recently show that India is set to become the world's most
populous country by the year 2040.
</P>
<P>
But no figure is available for India's estimated population
around the year 2040.
</P>
<P>
Present trends, as tabulated by the registrar-general of India,
pointed out that there is no stopping in India's galloping
population which will jump from the present 950 million to over
1.26 billion by the year 2016.
</P>
<P>
The population data revealed that India is sitting atop a
ticking population bomb despite the fact the country's fertility
levels have declined and the crude birth rate has come down.
</P>
<P>
The data also painted a dismal picture of the employment
situation in India, with one-third of the country's population, or
300 million, estimated to be out of work.

DHAKA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The main opposition Bangladesh
Nationalist Party (BNP) has decided not to contest the by-election
to the northwestern district of Thakurgaon, saying voting would
not be fair under the present Chief Election Commissioner (CEC)

The BNP has been agitating for the resignation of CEC Muhammad
Abu Hena for his "partisan role" in past general elections.
</P>
<P>
"We are agitating for resignation of the CEC, but Hena has not
yet resigned. So we cannot participate in the polls," said one of
the BNP leaders, whose party lost the ruling position in the
general election last June.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, eight candidates submitted nomination papers
Saturday, the last date for filing nomination, for contesting the

<HEADLINE> Brazil's 1996 Trade Deficit Reaches $5.54 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The Brazilian trade deficit
reached 5.541 billion U.S. dollars in 1996, surpassing the figure
expected by specialists, according to official data.
</P>
<P>
The monthly deficit of December also posted a record high of
1.787 billion dollars -- resulting from margin between the 5.567
billion dollars imports and the 3.789 billion dollars exports.
</P>
<P>
The December imports surge surprised the government's economic
department, which to this time cannot explain to itself the
systematic increase of purchases abroad of machinery, appliances,
and electricity material in a period in which the movement of
foreign trade is usually weak in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
December oil imports, valuing almost 700 million dollars, were
another pressuring factor for the trade deficit.
</P>
<P>
These data, revealed Friday by the government, show that
imports closed 1996 at 53.287 billion dollars, a 7.3 percent
increase over 1995.
</P>
<P>
Some of the outstanding items in the list of imports such as
motor vehicles, toys, and textiles, were already under
restrictions at the period.
</P>
<P>
Specialized media estimate that the lesson to be learned for
the area is that the so-called powers of the market will not be
enough to increase exports, and it will be necessary to implement
a government-sponsored policy to encourage enterprises to sell
their goods and services in the international market.

<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Cuba's 7.8 percent economic

Finance Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez said today.
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez said at the "Cubans Against the Helms-Burton Law"
forum being held here behind closed doors, that several economic
indicators show the effectiveness of Cuba's economic strategy
against U.S. interventions.

<P>
The finance minister pledged that the government will continue
to deepen the national economy reform, observing the principles of
securing the survival of the country and the continuity of the
revolution.

offered help to restore the monument to the famous Nicaraguan poet
Ruben Dario in a drive to commemorate the 130th anniversary of his

The monument was considered as a symbol and a point of
reference of a culture and a nationality, he said.
</P>

The restoration work is being directed by Italian engineer Georgio
Pascualini.
</P>
<P>
Ruben Dario, illustrious poet, was called "Prince of the
Castilian letters". He was born in San Pedro de Metapa, now Ciudad

QINGDAO, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The home of China's most famous
beer is toasting the steady growth of its industry in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Coastal Qingdao in east China's Shandong Province is the
production base of Tsingtao Beer, a traditional export.
</P>
<P>
The city scored a gross industrial added value of 20.68
billion yuan in 1996, up 19.7 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
City government officials said that the state-owned economy
rose by 10.5 percent thanks to the efforts made in changing
economic mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
Officials said that a modern enterprise system was introduced
into 40 firms in 1996, resulting in a more rational capital
structure.
</P>
<P>
The city also declared 61 local enterprises bankrupt, but
properly resettled laid-off workers affected by the move.
</P>
<P>
The city re-employed 28,000 laid-off workers last year,

<HEADLINE> Austrian Chancellor Resigns and Successor Named </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Austrian Federal Chancellor
Franz Vranitzky announced his resignation Saturday and suggested
at a party meeting his Finance Minister Viktor Klima be his
successor.
</P>
<P>
President Thomas Klestil has accepted the resignation Saturday
night after half an hour's talk with Vranitzky.
</P>

Vranitzky, 59, has served a 10-year term as Chancellor. He was
best known for acknowledging Austria's responsibility for
persecutions of minorities committed by the Nazi regime and for
bringing Austria into the European Union in June 1994.

The 49-year old Klima, also a Social-Democratic Party member,
has been accepted by his party as the new leader of the government

also vice chancellor and foreign minister, expressed his
appreciation over Vranitzky's hard work.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 19 (Xinhua) -- China's exports of sewing
machines are expected to grow at about 20 percent annually in the
coming three or four years, developing into an emerging exporter
for the international market.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, the annual export will surpass 500 US
dollars, and the buyers' list of the industry will expand to
Africa, South America, the United States and Europe, said today's
Business Weekly of China Daily.
</P>
<P>
At present, China produces more than eight million sewing
machines annually; its production capacity is more than 10 million
units.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the rapidly developing clothing industry in Southeast
Asia, countries in the region and Hong Kong have been the
traditional markets for mainland sewing machines.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Chonghe, chairman of China Sewing Machine Association,
said that the domestic industry will continue to develop the Asian
market, including India, since it bears great potential due to its
fast-growing economy and large population.
</P>
<P>
Also, the industry should increase its market share in the
United States, which is a market in term of its producing
capacity, and other foreign markets through improving product
quality and raising the added value of machines.

<HEADLINE> Forum Against Helms-Burton Law Held in Havana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The Helms-Burton law violated
the independence of Cuba and the sovereignty of the island country
and of other nations, Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina said
here today.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister made these remarks when inaugurating the
"Cubans Against the Helms-Burton" forum attended by more than a
hundred Cubans residing abroad.
</P>
<P>
The United States promulgated the law in an attempt to scare
foreign investments away from Cuba by announcing sanctions against
third country entrepreneurs who do business in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting, sponsored by the Cuban Foreign Ministry, was
aimed at explaining the interventionist and unlawful purposes of
the Helms-Burton law, said Robaina.
</P>
<P>
Those participants will be informed about the "antidote" law
approved by the Cuban parliament in last December which declared
the U.S. law as illicit, inapplicable, and without any juridical
effect.
</P>
<P>
The forum will also include dissertations of Cuban and foreign
jurists specialized in the theme.
</P>
<P>
Similar meetings have been held in U.S., Venezuelan, and

<HEADLINE> Diversified Regional Culture Flourishes in China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, January 19 (Xinhua) -- China's flourishing culture has
been described as like a tree, with the country's great cities
providing a snapshot picture of its evolution spanning thousands
of years.
</P>
<P>
People judging a tree have to closely watch its trunk, roots,
leaves and blossom. And when foreigners want to understand modern
China, they also have to read the culture in four main parts -
just like reading a tree.
</P>
<P>
The tree theory was shared by Birthe Marie Loveid, a Norwegian
painter, during a recent visit to China with a northern European
troupe.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on her i mpression of Chinese culture, Loveid said
that in her mind China is just like a tree in dream.
</P>
<P>
She saw the firm trunk in Beijing, the dense leaves in Shanghai
and the deep roots in Xi'an.
</P>
<P>
Add the blooming cities of Guangzhou and Shenzhen as the
blossoms, the tree cycle is completed.
</P>
<P>
A variety of regional cultures are flourishing in China,
centering around Beijing, Shanghai, Xi'an and the Pearl River
Delta, marking a new page in the country's cultural evolution,
experts say.
</P>
<P>
"Making an in-depth research on these four major aspects of
Chinese culture is of great importance to promoting the
theoretical and practical progress of modern Chinese culture,"
said Xiao Yunru, Vice-Chairman of the Literary and Arts Federation
of northwest China's Shaanxi Province, who is also a renowned
scholar on Chinese culture.
</P>
<P>
He added: "The four places have undoubtedly become the cultural
centers in the northern, eastern, western and southern parts of
China."
</P>
<P>
Some experts claim that this illustrates the latest academic
achievement into cultural research in China.
</P>
<P>
Xiao noted that the south China's Pearl River Delta, centering
around the economically booming cities of Guangzhou and Shenzhen,
could be called blossoming flowers.
</P>
<P>
Thus, the roots, trunk, leaves and flowers form the four key
parts of regional culture in China.

<TEXT>
<P>
Xiao noted that the culture in a city, region or even a
country, represents a multiple network in cultural development,
just like the different architectural styles in a city.
</P>
<P>
And the forming and establishment of a culture indicates the
signs of maturity of the culture, Xiao said, adding each country
should have a cultural "window" representing its own
characteristics.
</P>
<P>
It is commonly agreed in academic and tourism circles that the
2,000-year-old China is in Xi'an, the 500-year-old China in
Beijing, the 100-year-old China in Shanghai and the decade-old
China in Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Zhuhai, Xiao explained.
</P>
<P>
He stated that this cultural angle indicates the four-part
formation of contemporary Chinese culture.
</P>
<P>
"If you don't go to these four places, you just cannot have a
historical and dynamic understanding of Chinese culture."
</P>
<P>
Xiao argued that due to many years of development, the four
cultural centers have different styles which cannot be replaced.
</P>
<P>
"The Beijing culture is more of political flavor, the Shanghai
culture and the Pearl River Delta culture more of an economic
endeavor, and the Xi'an culture more of the historical sense," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Xiao noted that the four places have attached great importance
to their characteristic regional cultures, which is backed by the
fast economic growth in each place.
</P>
<P>
"An ideal route to travel is along the line of Beijing, Xi'an,
Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, and have a full understanding of
China in such a short period of time," said a short-stay foreign
tourist in China recently.

WASHINGTON, January 18 (Xinhua) -- American balloonist Steve
Fossett crossed over Saudi Arabia but he may stop his mission of
circling the globe in India.

A spokesman of the mission said that Fossett's current route
should take him south of Iraq and Iran and eventually across
central India.

<HEADLINE> Tibet Achieves All-round Economic Growth in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Town and country dwellers in
southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region are enjoying a big boost
to their incomes after all-round and remarkable achievements were
scored last year.
</P>
<P>
The region's GDP grew by ten percent over 1995 to reach 6.45
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics released by the regional government,
the annual income of farmers and herdsmen increased 9.3 percent
over the previous year, while the income of people in towns and
cities rose 25.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
With steady economic development in the region's rural areas,
Tibet reaped the ninth good grain harvest in a row. Total output
of grain is expected to reach 770,000 tons, an increase of seven
percent over 1995.
</P>
<P>
The gross industrial output value reached 668 million yuan, up
by 15.8 percent over 1995, helped by improved product quality and
better sales.
</P>
<P>
The import and export volume reached 116.48 million US dollars,
a rise of 65.2 percent over 1995. And the region received 32,000
domestic and foreign tourists.
</P>
<P>
Revenue income of the region's governments at various levels
reached 243 million yuan, rising by 12.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Last year governments at all levels put more emphasis on
agriculture, investing 300 million yuan in improving agricultural
conditions and promoting more scientific farming and fine animal
species.
</P>
<P>
The region has readjusted the purchasing prices of grain and
edible oil. And herdsmen have produced and sold more meat, milk
and wool from their herds.
</P>
<P>
Poor people in the region also obtained greater help. About
122,000 people in five counties were taken out of poverty last
year.
</P>
<P>
With the aid of the central government and local governments
across the country, Tibet has seen its infrastructure greatly
improved, and a number of electricity power stations, irrigation
projects, highways, and fibre-optic cables have been completed.
</P>
<P>
So far 57 out of 62 key projects aided by central and local
governments have been completed, paving the way for better
economic growth in the future.
</P>
<P>
The regional government has boosted economic reforms,
succeeding in organizing share-holding companies in trades such as
beverages, brewing, traditional Tibetan medicines, foreign trade
and tourism.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the government has made efforts to nurture pillar
industries, businesses and products.
</P>
<P>
Governments at various levels have also worked hard to ensure
stable prices and abundant supplies of daily goods. Price rises
last year were the lowest for a number of years.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the whole nation has become more enthusiastic
about offering aid to Tibet. More than 150 teams dispatched by
central government departments and local governments headed to
Tibet last year to help with future aid projects.

<HEADLINE> Zambian President for Reduction of Dependence on Donor Charity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President F. Chiluba
has urged his country to reduce dependence on donor charity in
its development, a source reaching here said today.
</P>
<P>
"If our development is to have a solid and lasting foundation
it is essential and expedient that we reduce dependence on
donor charity," stated Chiluba when he officially opened the
First Session of the Eighth National Assembly here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said that the finance minister will present this
year's budget and the major thrust of the budget will be "living
within our means by reducing very drastically the budget's
dependence on external subventions."
</P>
<P>
He noted that it is important for the country to cede the
dependence syndrome for outside assistance.
</P>
<P>
However, Chiluba did not reject foreign aid. He said
that Zambia will for a long time to come continue to suffer
serious resource gaps and it will always welcome external
assistance when it is available to supplement the inadequate
internal accumulations.
</P>
<P>
But donor aid must be seen in the correct context of
engendering international cooperation towards global development.
</P>
<P>
"Zambia fully supports the United Nations system-wide special
initiative for Africa intended to mobilize international support
for development for the continent," the Zambian president said.

<HEADLINE> Mortar Attack on Police Patrol Reported in Ulster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The Royal Ulster Constabulary
(RUC), the British police force in Northern Ireland, is
investigating an alleged mortar attack upon a police patrol near
the town of Downpatrick, Northern Ireland, according to a BBC
television report.
</P>
<P>
There had been a blast on the Ballydugan Road near a police
patrol car earlier today, but no one was injured in the incident,
police sources said.
</P>
<P>
The device, reported to be a mortar bomb, is a common weapon of
the Irish Republican Army (IRA) in its bombing campaign to end
British rule in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
This is the sixth such attack since the start of the new year
and chief constable of Northern Ireland Ronnie Flanagan said last
week that the IRA was deliberately targeting the police forces in
the area.
</P>
<P>
"We have had a series of attacks that are very real attempts to
kill. If these attacks continue, my fear is that killing will be
the inevitable result," he added.
