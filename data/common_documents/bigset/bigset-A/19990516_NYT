THIS LAKERS WIN WORTH CELEBRATING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Hey, guys, it's OK to smile.
</P>
<P>
   There's cause for celebration in the land of the Lakers after
they got over a low but significant hump Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   You and I know it. Now, who wants to to tell the players?
</P>
<P>
   The TV cameras showed victorious Lakers trudging off the court
in Houston looking about as joyous as if they'd just walked out of
a two-hour algebra class _ and into a three-hour geometry lecture.
</P>
<P>
   The blank expressions might have been the Lakers' quiet way of
saying their 98-88 victory and 3-1 series rout of the Houston
Rockets were no big deal, only one down and three NBA playoff
rounds to go.
</P>
<P>
   They might have been applying a lesson of 1998, when their
impressive playoff dismissal of the Seattle SuperSonics set up the
Lakers for a sweep by the Utah Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   ``It definitely feels good,'' Lakers guard Derek Fisher told the
Daily News' Howard Beck in the locker room after Saturday's
victory. ``But for me personally, I can remember last season, after
beating Seattle in the Western Conference semifinals, I was a
little (begin ital)too(end ital) excited.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that really affected the way I played _ and some of
our other guys _ in the Western Conference finals. We really felt
like we had done something after beating Seattle four games in a
row. And we had a big-time letdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today we're going to enjoy this, but probably later tonight
and in the morning, it's all San Antonio.''
</P>
<P>
   There won't be much time to rejoice, to be sure.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers flew to San Antonio on Saturday night, will practice
there today and will open the conference semifinals against the
Spurs at the Alamodome on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   But if they had five minutes on the plane, between wheels-up and
deal-'em, let's hope they toasted themselves with plastic bottles
of spring water.
</P>
<P>
   From where you and I sat, watching the No.4 seeds embarrass the
No.5 seeds on their home court, it looked like an accomplishment
worth saluting.
</P>
<P>
   Not everybody was certain they'd get this far _ not 20 days ago
when the self-same Rockets handed the Lakers their sixth defeat in
eight games, when Glen Rice was lost in the offense, when defense
seemed to be an afterthought, when fans were pining for Eddie Jones
and _ it had come to this _ Elden Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   You know what happened next. A team meeting. A Rice arrival. A
defensive revival. A four-game winning streak to end the regular
season.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as some of us waited for old habits to return just as
quickly, the young Lakers continued to play hard and smart, and
embarrassed the veteran Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, it turned out they not only didn't need Jones and
Campbell, they didn't need Rice when all their other weapons were
working.
</P>
<P>
   They took command of the game shortly after learning that Rice
would have to watch from the bench because of stiffness in the
shooting elbow that required surgery in January.
</P>
<P>
   Without thinking about it, they also sent a timely message to
Rice, since the victory came a day after he publicly pleaded for
changes in the offense to get him more shots.
</P>
<P>
   Between Shaquille O'Neal (a game-high 37 points) and Kobe Bryant
(24, including 13 in a row in the first half), with timely shooting
by Derek Harper and Robert Horry, Rice had plenty to cheer.
</P>
<P>
   After weathering the eight lead changes in the fourth quarter to
win Game 1, addressing their defensive shortcomings to run away
with Game 2, and emphatically answering the questions that followed
the Rockets' Game 3 victory, the Lakers have reached not just the
second round but a new level.
</P>
<P>
   The big obstacle might not have been the Rockets, an
uncomfortable combination of age and inexperience, but the bad
habits and self-doubts that could have been left over from the
regular season.
</P>
<P>
   It's not enough, and they know it, as their subdued demeanors
indicated. Maybe we're getting carried away and all the Lakers have
really done is set up their fans for disappointment in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   But the Lakers won a playoff series and put the regular season
behind them Saturday. (begin ital)That's(end ital) cause for
celebration. &QL;

SUNS PINPOINT BIG NEEDS  
 OFF-SEASON COULD SEE SEARCH FOR TOUGH GUY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - First order of business for the Suns this off-season:
Look up the Dallas Mavericks in the Rolodex. Or maybe Don Nelson is
already on speed dial.
</P>
<P>
   After all, in 1996 the Mavericks took A.C. Green and his
contract off the Suns' hands and in return gave them an All-Star
point guard, Jason Kidd, as part of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   And last summer the Mavericks gave the Suns a first-round draft
pick for Steve Nash that landed Phoenix in the draft lottery. Nash
signed a big contract extension with Dallas and then had a
forgettable season.
</P>
<P>
   Given all the criticism Nelson has taken in Dallas over the
lottery pick, he might not be accepting calls from Phoenix. But
it's time for the Suns to start wheeling, and possibly dealing, in
the wake of another early playoff exit.
</P>
<P>
   Where do they go from 27-23 and a three-game sweep at the hands
of the Portland Trail Blazers en route to a fourth straight
first-round playoff departure?
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to be tougher, that's the No. 1 thing,'' Suns Coach
Danny Ainge said. ``We need some interior defense and some interior
offense. If you watch the teams that are successful in the
playoffs, they have at least one guy they can go to who is going to
make the defense double-team.''
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, those big, tough interior players are rather
expensive and everybody else wants them, too. The Suns also hope to
add athleticism in the process, not just size and bulk.
</P>
<P>
   The club has two first-round draft picks, the Mavericks' choice
which will fall anywhere from one to 11 in the draft, depending on
where the Suns are drawn, and they have their own choice, No. 16 in
the first round.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns owe Chicago a first-round pick to complete the Luc
Longley deal, which they must hand over this year or in 2001. The
Suns must let the Bulls know by May 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``The known is better than the unknown,'' said General Manager
Bryan Colangelo, indicating the team is likely to keep the 16th
pick.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the team has both salary cap exceptions available, the
mid-range exception of about $2 million and a $1-million cap
exception.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, any team in the league that's over the salary cap _
as the Suns are _ can sign as many players to minimum contracts as
the team wants. Those minimums, which rise with years in the
league, can go up to $1 million for a 10-year veteran.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made the playoffs, but another first-round exit is not what
we have in mind any year, much less this one,'' said Colangelo.
``But we've got a chance to build on all the positives we did
achieve.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to add athleticism and toughness, and we can address
at least one of those with the first pick. With the cap exceptions
we have, we'll be able to add some pieces. The timing part is
waiting to see who falls through the cracks, the Rex Chapmans and
the Cliff Robinsons.''
</P>
<P>
   First, however, the club hopes to re-sign their own top free
agent, forward Clifford Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Signing Cliff is one of our top priorities,'' Ainge said.
``And that's easier said than done with the kind of year he had.
You can have a plan, but there are 29 teams trying to plan.''
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of free agents available, and some great
players should they decide to exercise early termination clauses in
their contracts _ such as Shaquille O'Neal of the Lakers, David
Robinson of the Spurs and Penny Hardaway of the Magic.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns, however, are not in position to bid on the big-time
free agents this summer. Their only hope would be to convince a
player to sign for less than market value, and give them the big
payoff a few years down the line.
</P>
<P>
   More likely, the Suns will be looking through cap exceptions,
draft picks and trades.
</P>
<P>
   (The draft got better with the recent additions of Rhode Island
forward Lamar Odom and Duke forward Corey Maggette.)
</P>
<P>
   The Suns also may be helped by an overload of point guards in
this summer's draft, including Arizona's Jason Terry, Maryland's
Steve Francis, UCLA's Baron Davis, Utah's Andre Miller and Duke's
William Avery.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns have Jason Kidd, so depending on how high they land in
the draft with the Dallas pick, they could have the flexibility of
trading up or down to a team in need of a playmaker, getting a
forward or shooting guard along with another pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, we're the ones trying to be creative to move up,''
Colangelo said. ``This year we might be hearing from the teams
trying to be creative.''
</P>
<P>
   Ainge believes the quickest method of making significant
improvement is through trades. However, he knows it also is the
most difficult way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we're going to get a lot better with a
19-year-old from the draft, who might be a star someday but isn't
yet,'' Ainge said. ``But it's very difficult to pull those (trades)
off.''
</P>
<P>
   The Suns have a lot of forwards _ some of whom would have to be
signed before they could be traded, but the only player on their
roster with blockbuster value is playmaker Kidd and he's an
untouchable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a logjam of forwards that are not great athletes,''
Ainge said. ``But it's not a simple as adding athletes and losing
everything you have now.''
</P>
<P>
   Ainge believes guard Rex Chapman will bounce back from his
disappointing season, and said he's got a better feel for his
personnel and how to make it work around Kidd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm definitely not planning on burying Rex Chapman,'' he said.
``We still have big plans for him in the future. At some time, Rex
is going to have to take a diminished role as a third guard, but I
don't know if that's next year. A lot depends on his health.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned a lot about Tom Gugliotta and Luc Longley this
season, and they learned a lot about playing with Jason.''
</P>
<P>
   And Ainge said he liked the club's three rookies, Gerald Brown
(who has his option in his contract for another season), Toby
Bailey and Pat Garrity, who all got some time despite having no
summer league to develop, a brief training camp and virtually no
regular practices during the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, Pat played better than any of them when he had an
opportunity to play,'' Ainge said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved what Randy (Livingston) brought from a toughness
standpoint. I wasn't afraid to put him in against maybe the best
defensive guard in basketball (Greg Anthony). I'm excited about our
young guys.''
</P>
<P>
   So is the rest of the organization, but club President Jerry
Colangelo and his son Bryan never have remained dormant in the
off-season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is happy that we've been eliminated in the first round
four years in a row,'' Jerry Colangelo said. ``That's not
satisfactory. But there's a real commitment to turn this around.'' &QL;

ACE BOUNCES BACK  
 JOHNSON, D-BACKS' BATS SUBDUE ROCKIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Every time Randy Johnson pitches for the Diamondbacks,
he says he likes to build on what he did in his previous start.
</P>
<P>
   He said that after giving up six runs and a career-high 13 hits
on Monday against Montreal, ``I had a lot of building to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The left-hander began Saturday's start against the Colorado
Rockies and went in the opposite direction, giving up a leadoff
home run to Neifi Perez.
</P>
<P>
   Then he quickly turned things around _ and put the Diamondbacks
on top of the NL West. Johnson gave up just two hits the rest of
the way and struck out 11 while getting more than enough support
from his offense in a 9-2 victory in front of 40,853 at Bank One
Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to losses by the Giants and Dodgers, the victory gave the
Diamondbacks a share of the division lead _ tied with the Giants
(21-16) _ for the first time in their two-year history.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, meanwhile, improved to 4-1 with his third complete game
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been able to make my pitches a lot of games,''
Johnson said. ``There's always one inning that things don't go the
way you want them.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to make perfect pitches, but you realize that's not
going to happen. So getting ahead of guys (in the count) is
important. That's what I did today. I pitched the way I wanted
to.''
</P>
<P>
   He did it with his trademark fastball, which reached the upper
90s on numerous occasions. Yet his other pitches, particularly his
slider, make him more effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot more there than just a good arm,'' Diamondbacks
Manager Buck Showalter said. ``For those of us who saw him early in
his career, to see how far he's come with his command . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Damian Miller, who had three of Arizona's 16 hits,
including a solo home run in the seventh inning, said the way
Johnson's slider moves down and in on right-handed hitters, ``You
can forget about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Diamondbacks center fielder Steve Finley can't forget about
facing Johnson last season in the National League playoffs when
Finley was with San Diego and Johnson was with Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been on the other side, and I know what it looks like, or
better yet, don't know what it looks like because I never really
saw it,'' Finley said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson gave up an unearned run, primarily because of his
fielding error, in the third inning as Colorado took a 2-1 lead.
The Diamondbacks scored twice in the fourth on a run-scoring
ground-rule double by Travis Lee and a groundout by Miller, then
opened things up with a five-run fifth against right-hander Darryl
Kile (2-3).
</P>
<P>
   A two-run homer by Finley, his eighth of the season, was the key
ingredient.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you give a guy like Randy a lead like that, it's usually
lights out,'' Finley said. ``There are only a few pitchers around
who you can say that about.''
</P>
<P>
   The homer was Finley's third in a week. He also had a
fourth-inning single. He raised his average to .232. Is that a sign
that he is starting to emerge from his early-season struggle?
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope so, but I'm not going to worry about it,'' he said.
``I'm going to take it as it comes, day by day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that's so great about this club is that we all chip
in. Call it ham-and-eggin'. Everybody picks up the slack, and it
puts everybody at ease. We can beat you a lot of different ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Every Arizona position player had at least one hit. Miller and
Tony Womack had three each.
</P>
<P>
   Left fielder Luis Gonzalez was among four players with two hits.
He increased his club-record and personal-best hitting streak to 27
games with a single that drove in Womack with Arizona's first run
in the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman Matt Williams also had a pair and became the first
man in the league to drive in 40 runs. He didn't drive in his 40th
last season until the club's 83rd game June 30.
</P>
<P>
   Womack continued to turn on the speed, grabbing the league's
stolen base lead with his 19th and 15th in a row.

COLANGELO TO RAISE FUNDS FOR DEMOCRAT BRADLEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF BARKER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Politics, it seems, isn't like sports. You don't
have to root for just one team.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix sports mogul Jerry Colangelo, a registered Republican,
said Friday that he will host a fund-raiser on June 24 at Bank One
Ballpark for Democratic presidential candidate Bill Bradley, the
former New Jersey senator and basketball star.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, it might seem an odd plan: Bradley heading into
Republican-dominated Arizona, into the back yard of GOP
presidential candidates John McCain and Dan Quayle.
</P>
<P>
   Both McCain and Quayle have previously received financial help
for their campaigns from Colangelo, who is president of
basketball's Phoenix Suns and managing general partner of
baseball's Arizona Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Colangelo said there is no conflict. Like team-oriented players,
everyone seems to know exactly where they stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is, Bill knows I'm a registered Republican and
knows that I'm actively supporting John McCain and that I've been
of some assistance to Dan Quayle,'' Colangelo said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Colangelo helped Quayle by hosting a fund-raiser at
the sports executive's home. Meanwhile, Colangelo contributed
$2,000 to McCain's presidential campaign during the first quarter
of 1999, according to Federal Election Commission records.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Dan I was committed to John some time ago, but I said I
would help him,'' Colangelo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And Bill Bradley came to see me (more than a year ago) to talk
about his aspirations. We talked about differences, to some degree,
from a political point of view. And yet, because I've known him for
some time and respect him a great deal and feel that he would make
a very viable candidate on the other side, I told him I would be of
some help.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not uncommon, especially among wealthy contributors, to
donate to more than one candidate for the same office, even those
of different political stripes. Conversely, candidates frequently
accept donations from executives with opposite viewpoints on the
issues of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel this is awkward at all,'' Colangelo said.
</P>
<P>
   Colangelo said he has known Bradley since Bradley's playing days
with the New York Knicks in the late 1960s and 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's sports links are playing a large role in his push for
the Democratic nomination. A few weeks ago, Willis Reed and Dave
Debusscherre, both former Knicks teammates, joined Bradley at a New
York fund-raiser. Former Chicago Bulls Coach Phil Jackson, also a
teammate on the Knicks, has been accompanying Bradley on the
campaign circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Colangelo's fund-raiser will coincide with the visit of slugger
Mark McGwire and the St. Louis Cardinals to play the Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of these political fund-raisers are in hotels, and
they're lunches or dinners,'' Colangelo said. ``Somebody said,
`What about doing something a little different?' Rather than a
sit-down dinner, it's going to be an informal, hot-dogs event _
more of a `Baseball with Bill' or something.''
</P>
<P>
   The event will begin at a microbrewery adjacent to the ballpark.
Guests will likely migrate to the St. Louis game afterward. &QL;

GONZALEZ AND LUCK: THE MIDAS TOUCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Sometime after another day in the sun and another
cruise-control victory, someone delivered the news to Luis
Gonzalez:
</P>
<P>
   Charismatic won the Preakness.
</P>
<P>
   Which, of course, happened to be the name of the horse Gonzalez
drew in the blind clubhouse pool.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's just say he won more than a dollar,'' equipment manager
Chris Guth said.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, luck is fleeting. Not prone to sit down and stay a
while.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez has fortune in a stranglehold.
</P>
<P>
   ``He also won the Kentucky Derby (pool),'' Guth said. ``With a
31-1 shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Which means he's one win removed from the Triple Crown. And if
the streak is still alive when the gates open at the Belmont . . .
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-one years ago, Gonzalez was a 10-year-old growing up in
Tampa. He was a huge fan of the Cincinnati Reds. And, yes, he
remembers when Pete Rose slapped together a 44-game hitting streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course,'' Gonzalez said. ``He's my favorite player.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, just four pitches into his first at-bat, Gonzalez'
hitting streak reached 27 games. It is now tied for the
third-longest streak of the decade, and if he reaches 30, it will
qualify as a national event. The media will multiply and descend,
hover over every at-bat. A writer from ``Sports Illustrated'' is
already combing the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't realize there weren't that many players with streaks
of more than 20 in the '90s,'' Gonzalez said. ``But I'm just having
fun with it.''
</P>
<P>
   A single today, and he's halfway to DiMaggio.
</P>
<P>
   ``That streak is unbelievable,'' Gonzalez said. ``You play 162
games, and he got 56 straight. No one's come close to that.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the Diamondbacks crushed the Rockies, and the story
lines are everywhere: The redemption of Jay Bell. The smoldering
Matt Williams. The catalyst spark of Tony Womack. The intense
leadership of Randy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   For now, they are a five-tool team. They are 14-4 at Bank One
Ballpark. They are compelling, exciting, worth the price of
admission. And with this organization, that's saying something. If
the Diamondbacks don't go flat, they could carry the pulse of the
desert over the next few months, making up for all the playoff
games not won by the Suns and the Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   But for all of the unexpected drama, nothing compares to
Gonzalez. He is the left-handed power stick sorely missing from
last season's lineup. He is everything Karim Garcia will never be,
proof that Joe Garagiola Jr. doesn't spend his afternoons flipping
pencils into the ceiling. After all, the Tigers not only traded
Gonzalez for Garcia, they threw in an extra $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try not to talk about (Gonzalez' streak) too much,'' Manager
Buck Showalter said. ``But he's swinging the bat just like a
three-hole hitter should.''
</P>
<P>
   This is Gonzalez' fourth team in as many years, but he is no
journeyman. Rather, a player who is just starting to peak. He is
also widely known around the major leagues as one of the nicest men
in the game, and if this is the work of good karma, so be it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know with these things,'' Gregg Olson said.
``Whenever I win at cards, I pitch terrible. Whenever I lose at
cards, I pitch well. You can guess that I won a lot of money early
in the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez doesn't know what to think. He remembers a streak back
in 1997 that lasted 23 games. He remembers a fluke at-bat against
Todd Worrell, and a ground ball that somehow weaseled through his
wickets. And now . . . 27 and counting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, everything has been falling in,'' Gonzalez said.
``You have to have a lot of luck involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, or you could never explain this:
</P>
<P>
   In the eighth inning on Saturday, a section of BOB was
designated as the subject of a daily contest. Anyone who catches a
line drive in that area would win $5,000 on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, Gonzalez ripped a foul ball down the right-field
line, screaming into the designated section, plucked out of midair
by a lucky fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel really good about that, helping a guy walk out of here
with $5,000,'' Gonzalez said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if he can only keep luck strapped to the chair for a little
while longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are guys who want me to go looking for wallets with
them,'' Gonzalez said. ``Or go to Vegas with them.'' &QL;

NO WORD ON SCHOENFELD, BUT COYOTES MAY JUST KEEP HIM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's been almost two weeks, about the time Coyotes General
Manager
 &UR; Bobby Smith said it would take to determine Coach  &UR; Jim Schoenfeld's
future in the organization.
</P>
<P>
   But it's going to take a little while longer. And time might
actually be on Schoenfeld's side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a lengthy meeting with Jim last week,'' Smith said,
``and I told him we'd meet again, probably within the next two to
three weeks, to resolve the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   An interesting choice of words, considering Smith suggests
Schoenfeld's job status shouldn't ``be an issue'' at all. Smith
said it had become one ``because of the team's elimination, No. 1,
from another first-round playoff loss and, No. 2, because of Jim's
comments after Game 6.''
</P>
<P>
   Schoenfeld, who has one year remaining on his three-year
contract, predicted the Coyotes would win Game 7 against the St.
Louis Blues, saying, ``I would tell you I would stake my job on it,
but that's already been done, so I'll just say we're going to win
Game 7.''
</P>
<P>
   Was there ever a mandate from above that clearly tied
Schoenfeld's security to a first-round Phoenix victory, something
the franchise hasn't accomplished in eight straight postseason
trips? No one will say, although Schoenfeld's post-game comments
after Game 6 increased the building speculation that some type of
ultimatum might exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked Jim about his remarks,'' Smith said, ``and he
maintained to me they were merely an effort to take pressure off
the players. . . . I don't know. I thought it was a curious thing
to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Ditto with Schoenfeld's ``unlike them, we've got points to
waste'' quote after a particularly nasty game with the Mighty Ducks
of Anaheim. The Coyotes went on to lose 11 of 13 games as the Ducks
battled back from a 15-point deficit in the standings to pull
within two points of Phoenix in the race for the No. 4 playoff seed
in the Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he had completely understood Schoenfeld's frustration
and that the coach's comments were simply ``an angry, emotional
reaction'' after a chippy game against a heated rival.
</P>
<P>
   So Schoenfeld won't get canned over a couple of remarks. And
it's hard to blame him for the team's first-round exit when the
Coyotes were so short-handed against the Blues, even though they
blew a 3-1 series lead.
</P>
<P>
   The real question should be whether Smith and owner  &UR; Richard
 &UR; Burke are comfortable with Schoenfeld's coaching style. Is he
getting the most out of his players, or is he crimping some of
their styles, at least offensively, with his punishing brand of
physical hockey? Players should be able to adapt, but this past
season's collection should have been able to produce at better than
12 percent on the power play, too.
</P>
<P>
   They scored 205, 18th in the 27-team NHL. But they only gave up
197, a team record for fewest in a season. Twenty clubs gave up
more. Does the system really need to be changed? If so, can
Schoenfeld adjust if he is retained?
</P>
<P>
   ``I have confidence Jim can coach any number of styles,'' Smith
said.
</P>
<P>
   Call it an educated guess or simply a hunch, but Smith will make
a brief statement within the next several days to announce that
Schoenfeld will return next season as coach. &QL; 
Bam Bam Barnaby &QL; 
He's at it again. Bad Boy  &UR; Matthew Barnaby, the guy who once
threatened to take a run at his own goalie ( &UR; Dominik Hasek), &UR; flew
off the handle the other day in Toronto during Pittsburgh's playoff
series with the Maple Leafs.
</P>
<P>
   After getting heckled by a fan at the Air Canada Centre, he
swung his stick at the walls and ceiling in the runway leading from
the visitors' bench to the locker room. The incident caused between
$200 and $300 in damage, and the Leafs said Barnaby, now with the
Penguins, can expect a bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been sent anything,'' Barnaby said. ``And if I do
get something, I'll be sending it right back. There's no chance of
me paying it.''
</P>
<P>
   Penguins Coach  &UR; Kevin Constantine agrees with Barnaby about the
area in question at the arena. There just isn't enough room between
the players and fans, he said, and someday, the incidents could
become much worse. &QL; 
Broadcast alert
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes' television and radio broadcast teams likely will
remain intact for at least the next few years to come.
</P>
<P>
   Television play-by-play man  &UR; Doug McLeod and color commentator
 &UR; Charlie Simmer, &UR; along with veteran radio voice  &UR; Curt Kielback and
first-year analyst  &UR; Jimmy Johnson, &UR; were offered multiyear pacts
Monday, and all are expected to agree to terms at some point this
week.
</P>
<P>
   There were come concerns the team might lose McLeod to the
expansion Minnesota Wild, where he once was the voice of the North
Stars, but McLeod has told team executives he planned to stay in
the Valley for the time being.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, whose NHL playing career was cut short a year ago with
the Coyotes because of post-concussion syndrome, made major strides
in his first season in the booth. Don't expect him to remain in
broadcasting forever, though. Johnson shows aspirations of being
NHL coaching material and, perhaps down the line, NHL management. &QL; 
Sutterville
</P>
<P>
   Another Sutter brother has joined the coaching ranks. This one,
though, will also own the team he plans to coach.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, former NHL center  &UR; Brent Sutter, who recently retired
after 17 seasons spent between the Islanders and Chicago
Blackhawks, purchased the Red Deer (Alberta) Rebels, a Canadian
junior team in the Western Hockey League. The price tag was $3
million (U.S.) and Sutter, one of six brothers to play in the NHL,
will be the team's head coach as well.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Darryl Sutter coaches the San Jose Sharks, and  &UR; Brian Sutter
coaches the Calgary Flames. Both were among finalists to coach the
Coyotes in recent years. &QL; 
Just wondering
</P>
<P>
   Why did the Florida Panthers raise their ticket prices for the
sixth straight year? Know what it costs for two season tickets in
the club-level area? Try $7,740. Who can afford that nowadays?
</P>
<P>
   Does  &UR; Mark Recchi's &UR; new five-year, $25 million contract with the
Philadelphia Flyers set the standard for this summer's crop of
unrestricted free agents? Perhaps, but San Jose's
 &UR; Vincent Damphousse won't get nearly that much, and Colorado's  &UR; Theo
 &UR; Fleury will get more.
</P>
<P>
   Would the Coyotes be interested in veteran
 &UR; Lance Pitlick, who unexpectedly became an unrestricted free agent
and likely won't re-sign with the Ottawa Senators? Count on it.
Pitlick is a great leader who always leaves it all on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   Will the Edmonton Oilers be able to sell 13,000 season tickets
by the NHL's May 31 deadline in order to receive $2.5 million
(U.S.) in relief under the league's Canadian currency equalization
plan?
</P>
<P>
   Who will the Los Angeles Kings hire to replace Coach  &UR; Larry
Robinson, whose contract was not extended? Many think it will be
former Sabres Coach  &UR; Ted Nolan, who was unceremoniously canned two
years ago after winning the Jack Adams Trophy. But don't bank on
it.
</P>
<P>
   How is it that Penguins superstar  &UR; Jaromir Jagr was able to
shake off that pesky groin injury so quickly? Toronto Coach  &UR; Pat
Burns suspects it was never that bad to begin with, saying, ``You
don't skate like he's skating with a groin injury.''
</P>
<P>
   Jagr credits acupuncture for his speedy recovery. &QL;

JORDAN STILL NOT OUT OF OWNERSHIP PICTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Reports out of Charlotte, N.C., are that the talks between
 &UR; Michael
 &UR; Jordan and Hornets owner  &UR; George Shinn are over and there will not
be a deal for the sale of the club to Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations broke off last week because Jordan, to nobody's
surprise, insisted on control of business and basketball decisions.
Shinn offered 100 percent control over the basketball operation,
but wanted equal say in business decisions. Jordan wanted both.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would always confer (on decisions),'' Jordan told the
``Charlotte'' ``Observer.'' ``The issue was how to resolve
deadlocks.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to blame Jordan for wanting total control. After all,
he's offering more than $80 million for half the team. And having
control of basketball decisions doesn't mean much if he doesn't
control the money, which will determine what the basketball
operation can do.
</P>
<P>
   Shinn is notoriously cheap. The club has lost stars such as
 &UR; Alonzo
 &UR; Mourning, Larry Johnson, Vlade Divac and  &UR; Glen Rice because Shinn
would not pay them the big contracts it takes to keep players of
that value.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, who reportedly has a net worth of $500 million, even
offered to buy Shinn out entirely for $165 million _ $5 million
more than Shinn has said the club is worth. He paid $32.5 million
for it 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Shinn turned the offer down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have agreed to a 50-50 split, but ultimately my
decisions had to be it,'' Jordan told the ``Observer.'' ``He wanted
to keep the business (control). It wasn't about money. I offered to
buy him out. It was about control, and we never were able to get
that resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   So it's over, right?
</P>
<P>
   Something says maybe not. Shinn is fighting accusations of an
alleged sexual assault, and he has run the franchise pretty much
into the ground. The team wants a new arena, and Shinn will never
bolster support for one.
</P>
<P>
   And there's nothing more that NBA Commissioner  &UR; David Stern
would like to see than Jordan as an owner in the league _ and Shinn
in the background.
</P>
<P>
   So Shinn needs Jordan. Nobody else is going to give him $80
million and not have control, or an agreement to eventually get it.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA wants Jordan, who's presence would immediately improve
the worth and visibility of the Hornets.
</P>
<P>
   And Jordan has the money, corporate backing and leverage to make
a deal to his terms.
</P>
<P>
   Stern has rekindled dead negotiations before. He can do it
again. &QL; 
Payton's Place &QL; 
The ``Seattle Times'' reported that  &UR; Gary Payton wants improvements
in the SuperSonics or he wants out of Seattle. Payton later denied
he said that, and the paper stood by its report.
</P>
<P>
   But there is little question that Payton is unhappy after his
club missed the playoffs for the first time in his career in  &UR; Paul
 &UR; Westphal's &UR; first season as coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``If things don't improve, I'm done with it,'' the ``Times''
quote Payton as saying. ``I've had articles written about me saying
I'm a joke for this, a joke for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, take me off this team, and we'll see what the joke is.
People are blaming me _ as always. Well, take me off this team, and
it'll be different. It'll be a lot different.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fans know. I come out every night and play. I've been good to
Seattle, good to my teammates for nine years. I've never said
anything negative.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father is always telling me I don't need to get into it
with anybody. But I'm starting to get to the point where i don't
care about that anymore. I've always tried thinking about being
around guys, respecting them and not hurting their feelings.
</P>
<P>
   ``But guys haven't thought about my feelings, and I'm starting
to see that. I've been taking it for four or five years, and it's
getting bad for me. So I'm going to go in there and tell the guys
what I want. If it's not what they like, then get rid of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Priorities &QL; 
Dallas Coach/GM  &UR; Don Nelson said his first priority is re-signing
free agent power forward  &UR; Gary Trent in the off-season, and his
second priority is getting former Suns forward  &UR; Cedric Ceballos
under contract.
</P>
<P>
   Ceballos, who makes his off-season home in the Valley, suffered
two broken wrists in a game this season _ and finished the game
before sitting out the remainder of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Give it to me! &QL; 
 &UR; Shaquille O'Neal of the Lakers has a termination clause in his
contract, but nobody could pay him more than the Lakers. So he's
not going anywhere, right?
</P>
<P>
   One wonders after what O'Neal told the ``Houston Chronicle.''
And with the money he's already made in the game, movies, music
recordings and videos, who knows?
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal wants to win and, as you can tell, he'd rather do it NOW.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know a lot of people like to use the word `Patience,' but I
don't have any patience,'' O'Neal said. ``I wasn't born with
patience, and I don't have any patience now. I like to get (stuff)
done now, but I guess we have to be patient with one another and
just learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaq was just getting warmed up here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not that type of person. I'm the type of person that, if

now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same with championships. But that's just the type of
person I am. Maybe I'm wrong for not having patience. I know it's
going to be hard, and I'm going to have to have patience. But I
don't like it.''

TROUBLE STILL FOLLOWS COWBOYS LIKE SHADOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Former Coach  &UR; Barry Switzer got most of the blame. When he left
the Dallas Cowboys 16 months ago, their image problem was supposed
to go away.
</P>
<P>
   But after former Cowboys offensive tackle  &UR; Mark Tuinei died 10
days ago from taking a combination of heroin and a stimulant, the
franchise is reeling again.
</P>
<P>
   Tuinei, who played a team-record 15 seasons, had been retired
for only nine months. A current player, reserve fullback  &UR; Nicky
Sualua, was with him when he died.
</P>
<P>
   Sualua didn't immediately call 911 when Tuinei lost
consciousness almost right away after taking the heroin, according
to Plano, Texas, police. Instead, Sualua performed CPR on his
friend, then drove to Tuinei's house in Plano and remained in the
car with him overnight. Finally, the next morning, when Tuinei
wasn't breathing, Sualua called 911.
</P>
<P>
   Switzer's replacement,  &UR; Chan Gailey, can't be held responsible
for the death or Sualua's poor judgment. He never even coached
Tuinei. He has been around Sualua for only one season.
</P>
<P>
   But controversy with the Cowboys never seems to end.
</P>
<P>
   Early in Gailey's first training camp, he had to endure
``Scissorsgate,'' the affair in which offensive guard  &UR; Everett
McIver suffered a deep cut to the neck in a dormitory incident.
</P>
<P>
   What other team has had a player get hurt during haircuts?
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have been determined to clean up their act _ no more
havens for players to bring strippers for sex and drugs _ so they
passed on Marshall wide receiver  &UR; Randy Moss in the first round of
the 1998 draft. Moss killed them and became an All-Pro his rookie
year.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have received much criticism for bypassing Moss to
take North Carolina defensive lineman  &UR; Greg Ellis, but Irvin told
Moss not to blame the team. He said Moss should blame Irvin for his
numerous off-the-field problems scaring off the team.
</P>
<P>
   Tuinei's death is a tragedy. Why would he experiment with heroin
when, at 39, he had so much life ahead of him? In fact, he had just
been hired as an offensive line coach at his old high school in
Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Tuinei was one of the Cowboys' most popular players. Offensive
lineman  &UR; Dale Hellestrae, a Scottsdale native, said the only time
he ever saw Tuinei in a bad mood was after he spent a night
sleeping in a hotel bathtub to escape defensive tackle  &UR; Leon Lett's
snoring the night before a game.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Tuinei is dead, and Lett's future with the club is in
doubt.
</P>
<P>
   The ``New York Times'' reported earlier this spring that Lett
had another positive drug test, a substance-abuse violation that
could cause him to be suspended for, at minimum, a year.
</P>
<P>
   Switzer can't be blamed. He's long gone, enjoying retirement in
Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's Gailey's turn to find out how tough it is to coach the
Cowboys, and he doesn't even know whether he'll have his best
player, cornerback  &UR; Deion Sanders, who still is recovering from a
toe injury.
</P>
<P>
   There have been some media reports that the team could release
Sanders for salary-cap reasons. Others say he could miss anywhere
from a month to half a year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Cowboys aren't void of talent and should contend for
a playoff spot. But the stain on their franchise might not be wiped
clean for years. &QL; 
Golf world &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Leland Hardy, agent for Saints rookie running back  &UR; Ricky
 &UR; Williams, should be tired of golf by now. He played 10 days with
team officials before Williams agreed to an eight-year, $16.215
million deal Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Hardy and team officials decided to play each day until they
came to contract terms.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the golf was played at the Dancing Rabbit Golf Club in
Philadelphia, Miss., where Saints Coach  &UR; Mike Ditka is a member.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the eight years are up, Williams' contract could be
way below market value. He said he has no plans to renegotiate
after a few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a throwback player,'' Williams said. ``I'm not pro free
agency. I'm not going to get into a deal wanting to go somewhere
else. With the contract, I'm going to be able to make great money
if I'm playing well after four years. So that shouldn't be an
issue.'' &QL; 
Comeback kid &QL; 
Mesa High School alum  &UR; Robert Holcombe got the Rams excited last
season when he rushed for 84 yards and two touchdowns in his first
game, a 20-17 loss to the Cardinals last September.
</P>
<P>
   But by the end of the season, he had gained only 230 yards and
had a 2.4-yard average.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams were so down on Holcombe, they traded for Indianapolis
running back  &UR; Marshall Faulk the week of the draft. But Coach  &UR; Dick
 &UR; Vermeil, after seeing Holcombe perform during their recent
minicamp, thinks the second-year pro is back in their plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robert Holcombe is a different kid today than he was a year
ago,'' Vermeil said. ``He's calmed down a little bit. He's so wound
tight, so intense that sometimes it's a negative. I think he's much
more aware, more understanding of how you've got to run the ball in
the National Football League. I've been impressed with his
improvement.'' &QL; 
Tough negotiator &QL; 
There's no wonder late Jets owner  &UR; Leon Hess was able to get
Coach &UR; Bill Parcells away from the Patriots two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't play poker with someone who negotiates oil contracts
with  &UR; Moammar Gadhafi,'' a club official said last week.
</P>
<P>
   Hess, who owned the Amerada Hess oil company, went face to face
with Gadhafi many years ago in an oil deal. Hess said that during
the talks, one of Gadhafi's guards put a revolver on the table.
</P>
<P>
   Hess, recalling the incident, said later, ``And, uh, I'm still
here.'' &QL; 
Short shots &QL; 
Former Cardinals linebacker  &UR; Jamir Miller, who signed a one-year,
$1.3 million deal with the Browns last week, told the Cleveland
media he thought he was as valuable to the Cardinals' defense as
quarterback &UR; Jake Plummer was to the offense.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL is making a killing selling licensed dreadlock wigs in
honor of Williams, the Heisman Trophy-winning running back from
Texas. &QL;

FOX MAKES MOST OF LATEST START 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - More dirt. More sweat.  &UR; Andy Fox was fired up.
</P>
<P>
   He was back in the Diamondbacks' lineup Saturday, starting at
shortstop in place of  &UR; Tony Batista.
</P>
<P>
   It came on the heels of Fox's three-hit performance as a starter
on Wednesday, including a two-run homer in the ninth inning that
helped Arizona rally for an 8-6 victory over Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andy's been swinging the bat well,'' Diamondbacks Manager
 &UR; Buck
 &UR; Showalter said. ``We've got to get him out there for another game.
But Tony will be back Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox started 122 games at six positions in 1998, but he has had
to take a different approach this season, particularly at the
plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, you're not going to have four at-bats in a game, much
less start two games in a row,'' he said. ``You can't afford to
work on something with your swing or wait to see what a pitcher
has, maybe even until your next at-bat. You have to make sure you
get into the (batter's) box and be ready. It's more immediate, more
result-oriented.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can work on things during batting practice, but the
biggest thing is the speed difference in the game. You just have to
combat it the best way you can.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox singled in his first at-bat Saturday. He was at his best in
the fifth inning when he stroked an opposite-field RBI single
through the hole between third base and shortstop, and went to
second on the throw to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   When Colorado catcher  &UR; Henry Blanco tried to get him at second,
he threw the ball into center field, and Fox advanced to third. &QL; 
Catch-22 situation &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Showalter continues to alternate catchers  &UR; Kelly Stinnett and
 &UR; Damian Miller. Yet Stinnett is hitting .157 with one home run and
two RBIs while Miller had three hits and two RBIs Saturday,
including a solo homer in the seventh inning, to give him a .326
average with three homers and 15 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure Kelly is pressing a bit, and there's nothing wrong
with that,'' Showalter said. ``We know he wants to make more of a
contribution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to keep both of them fresh. How many guys catch over
100 games any more? Not many. The most important thing is the
catching, the receiving. Our two guys block the ball better than
anybody in baseball.'' &QL; 
Avoiding disaster &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Diamondbacks TV analyst  &UR; Bob Brenly's heart jumped into his
throat Friday night when he accidentally knocked a lava lamp being
used in a ``Disco Night'' promotion off the ledge in front of him.
It would have landed in the crowd if not for a wire screen that
runs across the top of advertising signage just below the press
level.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just happened to hit it with my hand. I thought, `Oh, no,'
'' Brenly said. ``I got lucky.''

SAME OLD PROBLEM  
 DODGERS PLAY DOWN TO LEVEL OF OPPONENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   No matter how many face lifts the Los Angeles Dodgers receive,
they always seem to have the same identity as their recent
predecessors, who couldn't seem to shake the tag of chokers.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the Dodgers showed signs of imploding once again, a
trait this club has taken on for most of the past five years.
Second baseman
 &UR; Eric Young called a team meeting the day after the Dodgers became
the first club this season to lose a series to the Florida Marlins,
holders of the game's worst record.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not time to panic or anything like that,'' Young said.
``That's not what this is about. We know we've got a good club and
we can win this (division). But there are things we're doing that
we need to do better, stuff you can't do if you're a contending
club. It's not one guy, or even one thing. It's a lot of little
things that add up.''
</P>
<P>
   Nice enough, but Young didn't hit into the heart of the problem
quite the same way left fielder  &UR; Gary Sheffield did last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should be playing better than we are,'' said Sheffield, who
has spent one year and one day with the Dodgers. ``We're too
lackadaisical, and it shows. I know we're not intimidating anyone
right now. We haven't showed anybody any reason to be afraid of us.
We did the first six games, but there's been nothing since that.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the thing about the Braves. They've done it for so many
years. When teams play them they think, `Man, they're good.' But
when you don't play with a lot of intensity, you're going to get
beat and teams are going to be saying, `They're not that good.' We
have to change that philosophy. We just have to want it. How bad do
we want it? To me, it doesn't seem like we want it that bad, like
teams are going to give it to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Division-leading San Francisco rarely leads the league in any
statistical categories yet won the National League West in 1997 and
lost a one-game playoff for the wild-card spot last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has nothing to do with rankings, it's attitude,'' Sheffield
said. ``Watch the Giants and the way they play the game, and watch
our team and the way we play the game, and you can see who wants
it. I watch the Giants play, and it's exciting. They're up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to be honest about it. They do all of the little
things. They make all of the plays. They score four runs when they
should have scored only one _ they get the bunt down, they take the
extra base on a guy, they take out the second baseman (on a double
play).''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers entered their weekend series in St. Louis with a
14-14 record since starting the season 5-1, which included a
three-game sweep over the Diamondbacks. Los Angeles was 10-4 when
facing a club with at least a .500 record and 9-11 against losing
clubs, a sure sign of playing down to its opponent's level. &QL; 
Trivial question &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With the new slew of ballparks built in recent years and under
construction, identify the oldest major league stadium still in
use. &QL; 
Head games &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The somewhat surprising Giants, who are playing their final
season on Candlestick Point, aren't about to leave without trying
to squeeze one more playoff appearance into the old wind-blown
park.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants, who host the Diamondbacks for a three-game series
starting Monday, are 13-7 at their home park and have not been
ashamed about trying to mess with their opponents' minds during
these early-season games, which have been colder and windier than
most in recent memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``This place sucks,'' Atlanta's  &UR; Ryan Klesko said after the
Braves lost two of three to the Giants last week.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco catcher  &UR; Brent Mayne did his part during the
Braves series, engaging in some light chatter with most every
hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every guy who came up, I said to him, `Isn't this terrible?'
'' Mayne said. ``I think it got into their heads. They said, `Yeah,
I can't believe you play here every day. It sucks.' I guess I just
reaffirmed the obvious in their minds.'' &QL; 
Heads up! &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Early last week, erratic reliever  &UR; Mark Wohlers did little to
dispense of the notion that he cannot find the plate. Cincinnati
pitching coach  &UR; Don Gullett found an old inflatable batter to stand
up next to home plate while Wohlers worked on his control.
</P>
<P>
   ``He nicked him a few times, and he got him good once,'' Gullett
said with a laugh. ``We call him Pitcher's Pal, but if he could
talk, I'm sure he wouldn't think that's his name right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, however, Wohlers visited with clinical psychologist
 &UR; Richard
 &UR; Crowley, who helped former Dodgers second baseman  &UR; Steve Sax find a
way to throw to first base and also has helped  &UR; Steve Blass, the
original ``can't-find-the-strike-zone pitcher,'' who is finally
able to play catch with his kids and grandkids.
</P>
<P>
   After just one session with Crowley, Wohlers threw a majority of
strikes during a bullpen session.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't throw one bad ball in 12 minutes,'' Gullett said.
``What he did today was the best he's done. Unbelievable.'' &QL; 
The shifty Athletics
</P>
<P>
   When Oakland third baseman  &UR; Olmedo Saenz was forced to leave
last Tuesday's game in Detroit because of a knee injury, Athletics
Manager
 &UR; Art Howe reached into his bag of tricks to to help preserve the
victory in the ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Howe moved the versatile  &UR; Tony Phillips in from the outfield to
start the inning at third base and placed slick-fielding infielder
 &UR; Jorge
 &UR; Valendia at second base when a left-handed hitter was batting. When
a right-hander stepped into the batter's box, Howe switched
Phillips and Valendia.
</P>
<P>
   Twice during the inning Howe made the players swap spots.
Valendia, the better defensive infielder, wound up making the
assists on the second and final out of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Howe said, ``I had to do something to get us on ESPN. That was
the only way to do it.'' &QL; 
Bombs away
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland's three-inning, 18-run uprising last weekend was
simply too impressive not to be dissected once again. To recap: The
Indians trailed Tampa Bay, 10-2, heading into the bottom of the
sixth at Jacobs Field when they turned up the heat.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians sent 33 batters to the plate in just the sixth,
seventh and eighth innings while scoring four, seven and seven
runs, respectively. Cleveland had 16 hits in the three innings to
demolish the Devil Rays, 20-11. And don't forget, the Tribe did not
bat in the bottom of the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been involved in some wild games in my career, but never
one where we came from so far behind to win by so many,''  &UR; Travis
Fryman said.
</P>
<P>
   It was so crazy that Cleveland Manager  &UR; Mike Hargrove had  &UR; Rich
DeLucia warming up and planned to insert him into the game in the
eighth to pitch out the string and preserve the rest of his
pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   But once the Indians made a game of it, Hargrove sat DeLucia,
basically a mop-up man, and had closer  &UR; Mike Jackson begin warming
up. But the more runs the Indians scored, the less likely there
seemed a need for Jackson. So Jackson sat back down and DeLucia
warmed up again and wound up pitching a scoreless ninth. &QL; 
Trivial answer &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's a bit of a trick question, because it's actually a tie.
Boston's Fenway Park and Detroit's Tiger Stadium (then called Navin
Field) opened April 20, 1912. With the Tigers scheduled to move
into Comerica Park next season, Fenway Park will assume the role of
oldest major league stadium. Chicago's Wrigley Field is next on the
list, having opened in 1914. &QL; 
THE RANKINGS &QL; 
 &UR; TOP OF THE ORDER &QL; 
 &QL; 
1. ClevelandDespite his 5.88 ERA, Tribe is 6-0 in &UR; Dwight Gooden
starts.  &QL; 
2. HoustonThey remain relatively obscure, but Astros have all the
pieces firing.  &QL; 
3. NY YankeesAnaheim remains the one club undaunted by the Yankee
mystique.  &QL; 
4. San FranciscoBeat Atlanta in a series for the first time in
three years.  &QL; 
5. AtlantaLost a series last weekend for the first time; then lost
another.  &QL; 
6. ArizonaIs it too early to start the  &UR; Matt Williams for MVP
campaign?  &QL; 
7. NY MetsBack East after a troubling trip through Arizona and
Colorado.  &QL; 
8. TexasMay regret not pulling away while the rest of the division
is ailing.  &QL; 
9. OaklandCame off a most impressive 8-2 road trip and getting
strong pitching. &UR; BOTTOM OF THE ORDER &QL; 
 &QL; 
30. FloridaEntered the weekend without having won consecutive
games.  &QL; 
29. MontrealConfidence was greatly shaken during three-game sweep
in Arizona.  &QL; 
28. MinnesotaQuick, name two Twins? Didn't think you could.  &QL; 
27. BaltimoreBeating cupcakes like Chicago and Detroit doesn't
erase the O's holes.  &QL; 
26. San DiegoAt least the Padres have  &UR; Tony Gwynn's assault on
3,000 hits.  &QL; 
25. DetroitManager  &UR; Larry Parrish wants to see more offense from
his lineup.  &QL; 
24. ColoradoDemoted the second member of its rotation last week;
not a good sign.  &QL; 
23. CincinnatiAmazingly, Reds just added a sixth reliever last
week.  &QL; 
22. SeattleHappy to have SS  &UR; Alex Rodriguez back in the lineup. ON
THE RISE &QL; 
 &UR; Philadelphia Phillies: Terry Francona, considered one of the
brighter up-and-coming managers in the game, is making quite a name
for himself and the Phillies so far. This club has a solid young
nucleus that includes third baseman  &UR; Scott Rolen, center fielder
 &UR; Doug
 &UR; Glanville, catcher  &UR; Bobby Estalella and first baseman of the future
 &UR; Pat
 &UR; Burrell. Ace  &UR; Curt Schilling sports a 2.80 ERA, and  &UR; Carlton Loewer
and Atlanta-castoff  &UR; Paul Byrd show signs of belonging in a
big-league rotation. The results are piling up as they leapfrogged
the Mets for second place in the NL East last week. &QL; 
GOING SOUTH &QL; 
 &UR; St. Louis Cardinals: Forget  &UR; Mark McGwire: This club's problems
have been exposed in recent weeks. The pitching staff is giving up
way too many walks, constantly falling behind in the count and
becoming vulnerable because of that, pitching coach  &UR; Dave Duncan
said. The overall staff ERA was 5.01 entering the weekend series
against the Dodgers at Busch Stadium, where the Cardinals were 6-10
before the weekend, compared with 11-6 on the road. St. Louis' best
pitcher is
 &UR; Kent Bottenfield, who needs one more victory to reach a career high
of six. &QL; 
OVERHEARD &QL; 
Philadelphia Phillies reliever  &UR; Yorkis Perez, making quite an
astute observation while sitting in the bullpen and watching
another high-scoring game at Colorado's Coors Field last weekend, a
game eventually won by the Phillies, 10-8: ``Man, whoever scores
the most runs in this game is going to win.'' &QL; 
OUT OF LEFT FIELD &QL; 
After spending a grand total of five games in the minor leagues
after being drafted last June, pitcher  &UR; Jeff Weaver has made the
meteoric rise to the big leagues in Detroit. Weaver digested and
produced everything the club threw at him during spring training.
Now that he has started six games, he has a 3-3 record with a
respectable 3.27 ERA to go with it. In Weaver's three losses, he
has given up nine earned runs in 17 innings while striking out 16
and walking just five. The Tigers have managed to score four runs
in those three defeats. Tigers teammates have taken to calling
Weaver ``Roy,'' which is short for Rookie of the Year. &QL; 
THE HIT LIST &QL; 
 &UR; It could have been a lot harsher: During Baltimore's visit to
Cleveland last week, a plane circled over Jacobs Field with a
banner that read, ``Albert &AMP; Art _ Now Balti-Morons.'' It was
clearly a dig at former Indians outfielder  &UR; Albert Belle and  &UR; Art
Modell, who took Cleveland's football team to Baltimore a few years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; With his kind of practice, you'd think he had this
 &UR; thing down: One of the strangest injuries ever occurred last week
when Texas'  &UR; Juan Gonzalez strained his right hamstring during a
home run trot. He actually came out of the game because of the
injury.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A bit too much partying, perhaps?: The Los Angeles Dodgers
entered this weekend with a 5-0 record in games played on Saturday
but 0-4 (they had one rainout) when playing on Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Flashback: Doug Ault.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; If he's this mad, maybe there's something to this
 &UR; story: Seattle's  &UR; Ken Griffey Jr. was incensed when he learned
about a Cincinnati columnist's assertion that the perennial
All-Star may be headed to his hometown of Cincinnati once his
contract expires in 2000 because he visited his father,  &UR; Ken
Griffey Sr., for some batting tips during day off.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; What if his nickname had been Mooner?: Florida Manager
 &UR; John Boles is one person in the game still allowed to call Los
Angeles GM  &UR; Kevin Malone by his college nickname, Hoghead. &QL; 
EXTRA BASES &QL; 
Texas'  &UR; Rafael Palmeiro did the unthinkable last week when he
passed  &UR; Cal Ripken Jr., as the major league leader in games played
during the 1990s. Palmeiro entered the weekend series with 1,401
games to Ripken's 1,398.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's four-time Cy Young Award winner,  &UR; Greg
 &UR; Maddux, is 5-5 with a 4.28 ERA and has given up seven home runs in
his past 12 starts dating back to Sept. 1 last year. His current
4.57 ERA this year is his highest ever after seven starts, and that
counts his rookie season in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   When he played for Cleveland,  &UR; Albert Belle hit .333 with 68
home runs and 181 RBIs in 746 at-bats when playing at Jacobs Field.
In 56 at-bats at Jacobs Field as an opposing player, Belle is
batting .214 with one home run and 10 RBIs. Belle has also left 32
runners on base in the 14 games he has played in Cleveland since
leaving after the 1996 season.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati's perennial All-Star shortstop,  &UR; Barry
 &UR; Larkin, has nearly 13 years of major league service yet has never
hit a grand slam. In 5,826 at-bats entering the weekend series, he
is 18 for 76 (.237) with 63 RBIs when batting with the bases
loaded.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he won three of his five decisions and posted a 3.03
ERA,  &UR; Ramiro Me ndoza was sent to the New York Yankees bullpen to
make room in the rotation for  &UR; Hideki Irabu. The move stems more
from a necessity in the Yankees suddenly vulnerable bullpen than
anything else.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego's  &UR; John Vander Wal needs one pinch-hit to become the
14th player ever to record 100 pinch-hits in a career. Now that
he's starting, though, it might be difficult for him to achieve the
mark.  &UR; Manny Mota is the career leader with 150 pinch-hits. &QL; 
THE RUMOR MILL &QL; 
Ready to throw in the towel, the San Diego Padres appear prepared
to make just about anyone on their roster available via trade.
Among the more desirable players might be  &UR; Chris Gomez,
 &UR; Ruben &UR; Rivera,  &UR; John Vander Wal,  &UR; Jim Leyritz,  &UR; Phil Nevin and
everyone in the bullpen except closer  &UR; Trevor Hoffman.
</P>
<P>
   Having seen the necessity to trim to a four-man rotation, the
Seattle Mariners are desperately looking to make a trade to acquire
a pitcher. On the trading block are outfielders  &UR; Butch
 &UR; Huskey and  &UR; Matt Mieske. Most of the Mariners talks have centered
on Boston and Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   The struggling Florida Marlins are considering massive roster
moves that could see as many as seven players demoted to the minor
leagues. ``You can't continue to spin your wheels at this level
without their being some repercussions,'' said Manager  &UR; John Boles.
</P>
<P>
   The Minnesota Twins, still looking to pare salary, appear
willing to part with relievers  &UR; Eddie Guardado,  &UR; Mike Trombley and
 &UR; Rick Aguilera, who would need to waive his no-trade clause in
order to be dealt.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be surprised if left-handed starter  &UR; Kent Mercker is
removed from St. Louis' rotation very soon. Mercker has not been
able to get past five innings in any of his six starts. He entered
his weekend start with an 8.02 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Former Atlanta infielder  &UR; Mark Lemke is expected to sign a
contract with the independent league New Jersey Jackels this week.
So what? Well, Lemke wants to become a pitcher. He has been
fiddling with a knuckleball with Hall of Famer  &UR; Phil Niekro. &QL;

BELCHER TAKES STEP FORWARD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ Tim Belcher might have solved his problems after
giving up just two runs and three hits in 61/3 innings Friday night
against Tampa Bay. It was his second victory of the season, and the
first since April 16.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Belcher figured out, though, will stay his little
secret for now. He already left the ballpark when reporters were
allowed into the clubhouse after Friday's game, and Saturday, he
politely declined reporters' requests for interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Still, one start does not mean Belcher is out of the woods. His
ERA remains the worst on the staff at 8.78. But it was a step in
the right direction, said catcher Matt Walbeck.
</P>
<P>
   ``He threw strikes, he kept his fastball down and he threw a
nice split-finger,'' said Walbeck, who caught Belcher on Friday.
``He worked both corners and kept people off balance. Most
importantly, he kept the ball down.''
</P>
<P>
   Belcher's next start will be Thursday in Baltimore. Walbeck
might get the chance to catch Belcher again for that game and
wouldn't mind if he was Belcher's regular catcher. With three
catchers on the roster, playing time is at a premium.
</P>
<P>
   Walbeck has already become Omar Olivares' regular catcher. Todd
Greene usually catches for Steve Sparks while Charlie O'Brien works
with Chuck Finley. Neither Belcher nor Ken Hill seem to have needed
a regular batterymate.
</P>
<P>
   ``With three catchers, it's difficult to keep everybody sharp,''
Walbeck said. ``At the same time, it keeps everybody rested. I've
never been on a team that had three catchers, but if that's how
(manager) Terry (Collins) wants to do it, that's fine. It's easier
to get prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   Trying to fit in: The Angels acquired pitcher Mark Petkovsek
from the Cardinals last December not knowing exactly what role he
would play. They just knew he could pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Petkovsek has been both starter and reliever during his six-year
major league career. He prefers to start, but out of the bullpen,
he's 3-1 with a 1.56 ERA in 14 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came over here, it was the same situation as St. Louis
_ whatever and whenever the opportunity was, I like the
challenge,'' he said. ``You could say starting opportunities are
not here this year. That's the way it goes. But I didn't have any
preconceived expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   So Petkovsek has become a middle man, usually pitching an inning
or two at a time but capable of going more.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the team has a good streak going, it's easy to see how
everything pans out,'' Petkovsek said of relievers' roles. ``But
when you're struggling everything looks confusing.''

DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED PAIR MEETING PARENTING CHALLENGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KARINA BLAND  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's an evening just like any other for Mary Begaye and her
husband, Ken. They go for a walk after dinner near their Flagstaff
home, holding hands in the dimming light, flanked by their sons,
ages 13 and 12.
</P>
<P>
   Mary asks the boys if they have finished their homework. They
assure her they have, knowing full well she won't check it. She
wouldn't understand it if she did.
</P>
<P>
   Ken and Mary are mildly mentally retarded, adults whose minds
are more like those of young teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   They have become a rare success story, a tribute to an era that
is becoming more enlightened about the needs and abilities of the
developmentally disabled. Forty years ago, they would have been
forcibly sterilized. Twenty years ago, Mary's babies would have
been quietly put up for adoption.
</P>
<P>
   Today, with the help of a consultant supplied by the state
Department of Economic Security, they face the challenges of
rearing two adolescent boys who are not retarded, Alvin and
Patrick.
</P>
<P>
   It's a love story.
</P>
<P>
   Ken and Mary met in Flagstaff, Ariz., during a job-training
program for people with developmental disabilities. Ken says it was
15 years ago. Mary says it was just 10, though their older son,
Alvin, is 13. Numbers aside, she knows one thing for certain.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is my first love,'' she says, smiling at a blushing Ken.
``I thought, `He's a good, nice gentleman.' I liked the way he
smiles and he talks. I told him, `You know what? We need to get
together.' ''
</P>
<P>
   They dated, talking long walks to a store for snack food. They
married in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   His parents came from Tuba City for the wedding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told her we would live together forever,'' Ken says.
</P>
<P>
   Mary says the words ``my husband'' with great pride. Ken says
his wife is ``a good woman.''
</P>
<P>
   There is an air of innocence about them, of young teenage love,
devotion and silliness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fight, but we don't get divorced,'' Mary says. ``We talk
about our problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The Begayes are by no measure typical of mentally retarded
people who become parents. Most are single mothers who live with a
parent or other relative who does most of the rearing of the child.
Seldom are the fathers involved. Sometimes, they are not even
known.
</P>
<P>
   With the end of forced sterilization and a huge decline in
institutionalization, the number of mentally retarded parents is
rising, though experts disagree on how many of the estimated 7.5
million developmentally disabled Americans have kids. By one count,
120,000 babies nationwide are born each year to mentally retarded
mothers.
</P>
<P>
   And as many as 40 percent of the children end up in foster care,
more often from neglect than abuse. Sometimes, they are taken as
soon as they are born, turned into state Child Protective Services
by hospital staffers who assume the child won't be well cared for
because of the mother's mental capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Ken, a Navajo, is short with a barrel chest and lots of wavy
black hair. At 45, he still has the shy smile of an adolescent boy.
When he talks, it is after much thought, and he speaks
rhythmically, punctuating his sentences with ``mmm hum,'' like the
character Billy Bob Thornton played in the movie ``Sling Blade.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary, who is Apache, is tiny, too. ``I'm chubby,'' she says
laughing. Her long black hair is twisted up on her head. Her dark
eyes are small and close together, her smile big and quick. She is
38.
</P>
<P>
   She never had any doubts about her goal in life. ``I wanted to
be a mother,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Mental retardation _ still the proper medical term although not
considered politically correct _ has many causes, from illness in
pregnancy to lack of stimulation in infancy. Only 30 percent of
cases are hereditary.
</P>
<P>
   And because almost 90 percent of mentally retarded people are
only mildly affected _ meaning they are only a little slower than
average _ advocates say that, given the right support and
instruction, most mentally retarded parents can care for and rear
their own children.
</P>
<P>
   Ken and Mary have the same desires, the same need for intimacy
as other adults. They both wanted a family. It is a natural desire
not limited to people who score higher on I.Q. tests, says Roger
Deshaies, assistant director of the state DES developmental
disabilities division.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like anyone else, they can be married and be successful or be
married and be failures,'' he says. ``They can be excellent parents
or terrible parents, just like anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   In the warmth of her living room, Mary brings out a half dozen
tattered photo albums, showing off pictures of her and Ken's
wedding day, of the boys as babies, of faraway cousins.
</P>
<P>
   Ken points to one of his mother. On their wedding day, he says,
she told him: ``Don't ever fight with your wife. If you do, I'm
going to spank you. Mmm hum. That's what she told me.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken named their first son after Alvin the Chipmunk, the cartoon
character, Mary says. Patrick was born a year later.
</P>
<P>
   Mary proved herself a good mother. She kept the boys clean and
their diapers changed. She followed a feeding schedule by watching
the clock and counting the bottles the boys drank each day.
</P>
<P>
   When Alvin was 10 months old, DES hired Becky Raabe, a nurse and
family support consultant, to watch over the Begayes. Raabe taught
Mary how to keep the children warm by wrapping them in blankets,
not pushing their cribs up against the furnace. She reminded Ken
that the kids couldn't be left alone. She taught them about putting
the boys in ``time out'' when they behaved badly instead of
spanking.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, Raabe stops by twice a week and calls almost daily.
She is the family's house mother, teaching Ken and Mary about
rearing children and good nutrition, hygiene, budgeting and house
cleaning.
</P>
<P>
   Mary remembers telephone numbers that Raabe has to look up in
her day timer. Yet, the couple will always need reminders, Raabe
says, about keeping the house clean, making sure the boys wear
coats in the cold and helmets when they ride their bikes. They need
help filling out paperwork for things such as food stamps and
paying their taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Raabe doesn't make decisions for the family but guides Mary and
Ken in making them.
</P>
<P>
   They will never be able to provide the same guidance as normal
parents. But some parents born with greater abilities do far worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a team, they work really well together,'' Raabe says.
</P>
<P>
   The hardest thing for Raabe to teach Ken and Mary is how to
discipline their children. They understand that their children
should not steal or play with fire. They know not to let them ride
their bikes in the street.
</P>
<P>
   But Raabe is not sure if they understand the more subtle
consequences of their boys' behavior. If the boys run in and out of
the house unchecked, yelling at the top of their voices, for
example, neither Ken or Mary seems to notice. That same behavior,
though, will get the boys in trouble at school.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're oblivious to some of this stuff,'' Raabe says.
``They're very tolerant of the chaos and the commotion whereas the
rest of us might not be.''
</P>
<P>
   The hardest thing about rearing two boys, Ken says, is ``how to
teach them what's right and what's wrong. And not to be too shy.
Mmm huh. You've got to talk to your kids. Let them stay in school,
so they can win lots of trophies.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, the boys are respectful of their parents. Most of the
time, they do what they are told. Other times, they pay their
parents no mind.
</P>
<P>
   Alvin is lanky and taller than both his parents. His shiny black
hair is cut like his brother's with heavy bangs. Patrick could be
Alvin's twin, though he is shorter and moves faster. He talks for
both of them.
</P>
<P>
   Though Patrick and Alvin did not inherit their parents'
retardation, the boys' lives are different than other children's
because of it.
</P>
<P>
   They lag in school.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick is considered ``normal,'' although he gets tutoring in
math and reading. Alvin, although not born developmentally
disabled, is in special education.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, the boys' days are filled with the things of other
families _ school, homework and watching television, basketball and
dinner at 6.
</P>
<P>
   Still, their parents can't always read the notices they bring
home from school or the directions on the back of over-the-counter
cold medicine. Sometimes, the house is ill-kept.
</P>
<P>
   And Mary or Ken might say that something happened last year when
it was really just two months ago. Neither could make change for a
$20 bill.
</P>
<P>
   But make no mistake: The Begayes love their boys, and the boys
clearly adore their parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``She spoils me,'' Alvin says, talking about the cars and
firetrucks his mother has bought him over the years and the meals
she makes.
</P>
<P>
   Ken nods toward Alvin's three bowling trophies on a bookcase in
the living room. Mary talks proudly of her sons' accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   They say nothing about the fact that they are mentally retarded,
and their children were not born that way. It is simply how things
are.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have dreams. They love their children so much, and they
want their children to have opportunities. They don't limit what
their children do,'' Raabe says. ``They just want them to be the
best.''
</P>
<P>
   Because neither Mary or Ken reads very well _ though they both
graduated from high school _ they give any letters from the boys'
schools to Raabe. But they proudly attend all parent-teacher
conferences, open houses and school events.
</P>
<P>
   Alvin is in the seventh grade at Flagstaff Middle School. His
academic difficulties stem more from the environment he grew up in
than genetics, Raabe says. He wants to be a mechanic or
firefighter.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick is in the sixth grade at Kensey Elementary School. By
all measures, he is normal, though he gets some tutoring in math
and reading. He says he wants to be an animator and an
archaeologist _ ``digging for stuff and going to new places and
finding stuff that you never knew existed.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrick gets himself and his brother up every morning for
school. The boys get their own breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   In the small kitchen with the washer in one corner, Ken lines a
pan with foil while Mary washes the chicken before covering the
pieces with flour and black pepper. He puts it in the oven.
</P>
<P>
   She washes fresh broccoli and puts water on to boil for
macaroni. The cupboards and refrigerator are full of healthy food _
rice, fruit, vegetables, pasta _ and very little junk food.
</P>
<P>
   The boys come back, and Alvin grabs four bananas, peeling one
and eating it with the other three hanging on his shoulder. He eats
them all and then eats three pears, one after another.
</P>
<P>
   The Begayes live on fragile finances _ welfare, disability
assistance and Mary's two part-time jobs. Ken cannot work. In
addition to being mentally retarded, he has epilepsy.
</P>
<P>
   On Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, Mary starts work at Goodwill
Industries at 9 a.m., though the bus gets her there a half hour
early.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sit around and drink coffee and chit-chat until it's time
to start work,'' Mary says.
</P>
<P>
   It is Mary's favorite part of the workday. She puts the lunch
Ken made her _ a bologna sandwich and fruit _ in the refrigerator,
plops an ice cube in her coffee and talks with her co-workers, who
are also developmentally disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Ken receives about $300 a month from Supplemental Security
Income, the federal disability program for the poor. They receive
food stamps. The rent on their house is about $400 a month.
</P>
<P>
   The money Mary earns is put into an account managed by the
county fiduciary, along with the $500 Alvin receives from SSI. From
that account, Mary receives a weekly allowance.
</P>
<P>
   Raabe manages the rest, making requests for additional money for
things such as clothes, shopping or going out to eat. Raabe takes
Mary grocery shopping every week. Ken and Mary used to manage all
of their own money, but, at the end of the month, little was left
to pay bills. Without Raabe's oversight, they spent freely and gave
money to friends.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Mary or Ken's family lives nearby or helps out. They
would be on their own except for Raabe.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, though, they do resent her telling them what to do
all the time and how to spend their money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, they get mad at me sometimes,'' Raabe says. ``We've
joked over the years, `You can divorce me.' ''
</P>
<P>
   It is a voluntary program. The Begayes can pull out at any time,
but they don't. And, sometimes, Mary calls Raabe ``Mom.''
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, Ken and Mary seem to know that the life they lead is
better than what it could have been. They have more freedom than
some other developmentally disabled people they know. They live
like anyone else in their neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   While Mary is work, Ken stays at home with the boys. He has a
load of laundry in the washer. The kitchen and living room are
tidy.
</P>
<P>
   ``My Mom told me, `You don't be lazy.' Mmm huh. `Get up and cook
for your wife,' she told me,'' Ken says.
</P>
<P>
   He also has been drawing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a Cherokee woman listening to the eagles. Mmm hum,''
he says, holding the pencil drawing to the light. ``They fly across
the full moon. Mmm huh.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken is teaching his sons to draw and weave baskets. He is
teaching them to speak Navajo and hoop dance. On the weekends, they
make fry bread.
</P>
<P>
   ``My Mom told me to teach them,'' Ken says. ``Mmm hum.''
</P>
<P>
   He wants them to be proud of their Indian heritage.
</P>
<P>
   The family lives in a public housing project nestled among the
pine trees, though neither he or Mary is sure how long the family
has been there. Maybe four or five years, Mary says. Theirs is a
two-bedroom house right next to a small park.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to get our own place, so no one will tell us what
to do, and we can have a dog and a garden,'' Mary says.
</P>
<P>
   The couple has qualified for Home of Our Own, a federal program
that provides developmentally disabled people with long-term,
low-interest fixed mortgages. Soon, they can buy a $75,000 house.
</P>
<P>
   Ken wants a fireplace.
</P>
<P>
   At the park, the boys pile into a plastic car on sturdy metal
springs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where's your driver's license?'' Mary jokes. Neither she or
Ken can drive.
</P>
<P>
   The boys make parachutes out of string and plastic grocery bags.
They toss them into the air. One lands near Mary's feet and she
throws it back to Patrick.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those kids always make you laugh. They are always busy, busy,
busy,'' Mary says.
</P>
<P>
   It is a such a different life than in the 1920s when the U.S.
Supreme Court upheld laws that prevented retarded people from
having kids. Some states even let doctors forcibly sterilize
retarded adults. And even after the Supreme Court reversed itself
in 1942, parents of retarded children continued to have them
sterilized.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, 200,000 mentally retarded people nationwide lived
in public institutions. By 1994, that figure was 65,000.
</P>
<P>
   Mentally retarded children entered public schools for the first
time in 1975 when it became illegal for schools to turn them away.
At the same time, advocates successfully pushed for a broad range
of rights, including sexual relationships, parenthood and
employment.
</P>
<P>
   As the boys get older, they'll find they know more than their
parents, Raabe says, and the normal rebellion of adolescence could
become a big problem.
</P>
<P>
   The boys' futures include algebra, research papers and midterms,
things that their parents likely won't understand and won't be much
help with.
</P>
<P>
   The boys face dating and broken hearts and the lure of drugs,
alcohol and gangs. They have important decisions to make that will
have lasting consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Already into adolescence, Alvin and Patrick are growing up fast.
The question is, can they grow beyond their parents without leaving
them behind?
</P>
<P>
   Patrick is a staunch defender of his parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``They take care of me, and they tell me to go to school and get
good grades in school,'' Patrick says. ``They want me to be
smart.'' &QL;

ELBOW GREASE DOES THE JOB FOR LAKERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Glen Rice figured the Lakers couldn't win without
involving him more in the offense. It turned out, happily for all
parties, the Lakers could win without even having Rice in uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Rice's right elbow, the same one that underwent surgery in
January, was sore and swollen Friday night. He tried to warm up and
shoot before Saturday's Game 4, but the elbow wouldn't cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   Already trying to rebound from a lopsided Game 3 loss, the
Lakers now had lost their best shooter and the third prong of their
offense.
</P>
<P>
   It took three players to compensate, but that trio ensured the
Lakers a 98-88 victory Saturday and a series win.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Fox started in Rice's place and scored nine points. Robert
Horry and Derek Harper came off the bench to combine for 25 points,
eight rebounds and eight assists.
</P>
<P>
   That's all the Lakers needed to avoid a trip back to L.A. for
Game 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``They gave us what we needed today,'' Derek Fisher said. ``We
missed Glen's 18 points a night. And those guys made up for it.
Harp stepped up big. JR (Reid's) defense was amazing. Rick stepped
up. Robert stepped up. Guy after guy, those were the types of
things we talked about. Each guy on this team is capable of helping
contribute.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice has been listed as day-to-day, and his status is unclear
for Monday's game _ the conference semifinals opener in San
Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Glen came to me, he kind of had a tear in his eye, because he
wanted to play,'' Shaquille O'Neal said. ``I told him, `Don't worry
about it. I need you during the long run, not the short run.' I
kind of had a meeting with Kobe, Rick and Rob and said we all got
to step our game up tonight. We did.''
</P>
<P>
   A sense of anxiety could have easily set in, considering the
circumstances and the 14-point loss to Houston in Game 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pushed right past it, because nobody really knew it was
coming,'' Derek Fisher said of the loss of Rice. ``We didn't really
have time to adjust, we just had to go play.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Lakers felt comfortable relying on their three former
starters. Fox and Horry were the starting frontcourt last season
when the team won 61 games. Harper started most of this season and
most of his 16-year career.
</P>
<P>
   So it wasn't surprising to see any of them make the clutch plays
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Fox and Horry both defended against Scottie Pippen, who
destroyed the Lakers with 37 points in Game 3 but had a quiet 19
this time out. Harper stayed step-for-step with Brent Price, who
managed just five points after burning the Lakers with his 3-point
shooting two days earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Huge. Huge,'' coach Kurt Rambis said of the group.
</P>
<P>
   Fox found out he was starting less than an hour before tipoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``The adrenaline was going, rushing, but I felt comfortable,
really comfortable,'' he said. ``That's the way it's going to have
to be at certain points throughout the course of this playoff run
here. Guys are going to be asked to make big plays other than Kobe
(Bryant) and Shaq (O'Neal) and Glen. ... It's got to be a total
12-man effort to go further than the first round.'' &UR; !dlim!!end! &LR;  &QL;

MODANO LIFTS DALLAS PAST ST. LOUIS TO A 3-2 LEAD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ At least you can't fault the Stars' timing.
</P>
<P>
   Playing their biggest game of the playoffs last night before a
hungry crowd of 17,001 at Reunion Arena, the Stars resurrected
their moribund power play and shot down the St. Louis Blues, 3-1,
in Game 5 of their best-of-seven Western Conference semifinals
series.
</P>
<P>
   The 2-for-5 performance with the man advantage came at a time
when the pressure was highest _ and it clearly sent the hiss of a
relief valve surging through the Stars and their fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was pretty much must-win,'' said Stars center Mike
Modano, who set up one power-play goal and one shorthanded score.
``We needed this tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory gives the Stars a 3-2 lead heading into Game 6
tomorrow in St. Louis. A loss would have put them on the brink of
playoff elimination going into Kiel Center, where they are 0-5-1 in
their past six games, including Games 3 and 4 of this series.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that we don't think we can win up there, but we don't
ever want to force an elimination game,'' said Stars center Joe
Nieuwendyk, who scored his team-leading sixth playoff goal. ``We
needed this one for a lot of reasons, to get the lead, to put the
pressure on them, to take control of the series.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars have done just that, and they've answered a few
questions that have been dangling over their heads _ questions that
were placed there by fans and media before Game 5. Still, Stars
coach Ken Hitchcock said the team shouldn't start believing it has
answers just yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our power play was good, our goalie was excellent, that's
about it,'' Hitchcock said. ``We have to play a lot better if we
expect to win in St. Louis.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock didn't like the fact the Stars were outshot, 31-16,
that Belfour had to put up another impressive performance to stake
the Stars to a win. The coach wasn't pleased that the Stars escaped
by about an inch from a potential goal by Blues' rookie sensation
Jochen Hecht with just under a minute remaining _ the goal was
disallowed on video replay because of a skate in the crease. And
mostly, Hitchcock said, he wasn't happy that his team's performance
was uneven after it took a 2-0 first-period lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to play at a lot higher level of determination, and
all of our players know that,'' Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   While the Stars struggled in attack time, they also did a lot of
things right. They had only 12 giveaways compared to 15 for the
Blues. They also dished out 54 hits _ led by nine from captain
Derian Hatcher _ to 41 for the Blues.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, they took an early lead thanks to special-teams
play and then played simple hockey the rest of the night. The Stars
avoided the turnovers that the Blues have feasted on, and they
played physical when the puck stayed in their end for long periods
of time.
</P>
<P>
   The end result was a good dose of ``Stars hockey'' _ get an
early lead, extend that lead with the power play and sit on that
lead the rest of the game. It was a style that helped the Stars go
51-19-12, including 40-7-7 when scoring first.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars had that 2-0 first-period lead on goals by Jere
Lehtinen and Jamie Langenbrunner. Once they did, they were then
able to avoid high-risk plays the remainder of the night.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Nieuwendyk gave the Stars a 3-0 lead when he deflected in a
Derian Hatcher shot at the 10:52 mark of the second period. That
proved crucial when the Blues' Scott Young scored to make the score
3-1.
</P>
<P>
   It proved even more soothing when Blues rookie Hecht appeared to
have a goal with 57.3 seconds remaining to cut the deficit to one
goal. However, Hecht's goal was disallowed on video replay because
the back edge of his skate was in the goal crease.
</P>
<P>
   The same rule took away a potential game-winning goal from the
Stars in Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, bad rule for us. Last game, bad rule for them,'' Hecht
said. ``Next game, who knows?''
</P>
<P>
   What the Stars know is that next game will be played with at
least a cushion _ a margin for error. The Blues lost theirs last
night.

HELLING GIVES BULLPEN A NEEDED DAY OF RELIEF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Rick Helling's first pitch this season
produced a keepsake for a spectator with a $15 seat at The Ballpark
in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit's Juan Encarnacion hit the first of 11 home runs Helling
surrendered in his first eight starts this season.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-game winners _ the fraternity Helling joined last year _
don't surrender a home run for every four innings pitched.
Twenty-game winners keep the ball within the playing field and
relievers in the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Helling produced that exacta during last night's 8-1 victory
against the Baltimore Orioles at The Ballpark. The Rangers' fourth
consecutive victory and sixth in the past seven games moved the
defending American League West champions six games above .500 for
the first time this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed a ballgame like this from one of our starters,''
said manager Johnny Oates, whose bullpen pitched four or more
innings during four of the previous seven games.
</P>
<P>
   Helling (4-4) scattered six hits and two walks in his
eight-inning appearance and retired 13 of 14 batters after
surrendering a second-inning, run-scoring double to Orioles third
baseman Cal Ripken.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of nights here are tough nights for a pitcher,'' Helling
said. ``This is definitely a hitter's park. The ball usually flies
out of here because of the jet stream. I was just focused on
keeping the ball down. Tonight was probably the best night for me
in terms of keeping the ball down.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I got beat, I wanted to get beat on ground balls and line
drives. I didn't want to get hurt on long fly balls. The way the
wind was blowing, you could really get hurt on a long fly ball to
right-center field. I didn't want to get beat on one pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore's Juan Guzman _ who recorded four strikeouts and
allowed only two hits _ matched Helling for four innings before his
lower back stiffened.
</P>
<P>
   That forced Baltimore manager Ray Miller to turn to left-hander
Doug Johns, whom the Orioles recalled Friday from Triple-A
Rochester. Johns (0-1) would emerge as the loser after designated
hitter Rafael Palmeiro deposited a 2-0 fastball into $15 seats at
The Ballpark with his three-run homer in the sixth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro enters this afternoon's series finale 6-for-10 with two
home runs and six runs batted in against the Orioles, who he left
in the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm doing my job, man,'' Palmeiro said. ``Just doing my job.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers continued to pummel the Orioles' bullpen _
particularly right-hander Mike Fetters and left-hander Jesse Orosco
_ while Oates' bullpen relaxed.
</P>
<P>
   Left fielder Rusty Greer, catcher Ivan Rodriguez and third
baseman Todd Zeile collected run-scoring singles during the
Rangers' four-run seventh inning, and right fielder Roberto Kelly
forced in the final run by drawing a bases-loaded walk.
</P>
<P>
   Oates summoned right-hander Tim Crabtree to pitch a scoreless
ninth inning after Helling's 122-pitch performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal as a starting pitcher is to throw a complete game
every night,'' Helling said. ``That's not always going to happen.
In fact, it usually doesn't. I just try to give the team as many
innings as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bullpen has been going out there a lot lately. When we
went to a four-man rotation, they started getting a lot of innings.
They're still getting a lot of innings. They need some nights where
they don't have to do that.''

LAKERS HAVE LITTLE TIME TO CELEBRATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The chest bumps and high fives and shouts were
contained to the basketball court. By the time the Lakers walked
off the Compaq Center floor and into the locker room, the
celebration of their first-round playoffs triumph was over.
</P>
<P>
   The San Antonio Spurs, owners of the Western Conference's best
regular-season record, await at the Alamodome. And the Lakers have
no time to bask in whatever glory a first-round win affords them.
</P>
<P>
   Satisfaction? Pride? Any feeling of accomplishment after a rough
season?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not really,'' Rick Fox said. ``It's obviously a step in the
right direction, but walking off the floor and walking into here
(the locker room), it was rather quiet. We felt like we hadn't
accomplished a whole lot, which is the right attitude. We haven't
done anything, really. A couple extra dollars of playoff share, but
that doesn't amount to anything.''
</P>
<P>
   It certainly won't if the Lakers can't get past the Spurs, the
NBA's hottest team the last two months and a favorite to win the
West.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers had owned the Spurs for most of the last two seasons,
winning six straight. But the last meeting _ the Lakers' first
since the Eddie Jones-Glen Rice trade _ was a disaster, a 108-81
Spurs blowout on April 24 at the Alamodome.
</P>
<P>
   That loss came during the Lakers' late-season funk. Two days
later, the Rockets routed the Lakers as well, and that prompted the
team meeting that spawned a six-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a totally different team right now,'' said Fox, noting
the Lakers' dedication to winning with defense. ``I don't want
everyone to start praising us for it, because that's the kiss of
death for us. But I definitely give kudos to everyone in this
locker room for recognizing where our wins are gonna come from and
then going out and making it the focal point of our game plan.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a mindset they'll need to counter MVP candidate Tim Duncan
and fellow Twin Tower David Robinson. The Spurs advanced with a 3-1
series victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're gonna have to continue to do a lot of the things we did
in this series,'' coach Kurt Rambis said. ``We're gonna have to
step it up defensively. They're playing very well as a team and
they do a great job of putting you in situations where you have to
guard all five guys. They obviously have two very quick, agile,
mobile big men who do a lot of damage inside and outside.''
</P>
<P>
   Also: Talk about curses. The Rockets have inexplicably lost 15
straight games (playoffs an regular season) on NBC and 19 of their
last 20, dating back to the 1997 playoffs. . . . After being
outrebounded by 12 in Game 3, the Lakers lost the rebounding edge
by a less-damning four on Saturday. Scottie Pippen still hurt them,
grabbing nine rebounds in the first quarter and finishing with 17
(nine offensive). . . . The Lakers and Rockets have split the six
playoff series they've played _ in the last five series, the winner
advanced to the Finals on three occasions.

ROOKIE DEBUTS WITH TWO GOALS AS BURN DEFEATS SAN JOSE, 2-1
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BLANE BACHELOR 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Anyone who attended last night's Burn game in hopes of
seeing San Jose Clash forward Raul Diaz Arce add to Major League
Soccer's all-time career scoring record may have felt let down.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for the Burn, Diaz Arce continued his scoring slump
with miss after miss. Even better for the home team and its fans
was who found the back of the net: Burn rookie Bobby Rhine. In his
first MLS start, the former University of Connecticut standout
notched both goals to lead the Burn to a 2-1 victory at the Cotton
Bowl in front of 16,372 fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very emotional game for me,'' said Rhine, who was
joined in his first start with fellow rookie Paul Broome. ``First
because Thursday, my grandparents happened to come down for the
weekend, and, by luck, I was fortunate enough to start the game.
For them to be here is as big a thrill for me as scoring was.''
</P>
<P>
   In the second of the three-game series between the teams,
scoring could have been much higher. They combined for 25 total
shots, trading near misses. The Burn snapped a two-game losing
streak.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz Arce's missed shots could have been decisive goals for the
Clash (5-4). His first opportunity would have given San Jose the
lead in the fourth minute, but his close-range volley slammed off
the crossbar. A second-half miss would have given the Clash the
go-ahead goal.
</P>
<P>
   The Burn, instead, took the early momentum on Rhine's
ninth-minute score. In a combined effort from Rhine and Oscar
Pareja on a give-and-go play, Rhine first headed down a ball to
Pareja. Former Burn player Joey Martinez was an unlucky pawn in the
play, as Pareja's pass beat Martinez and set up Rhine perfectly for
the goal.
</P>
<P>
   From there, San Jose began to bolster its offensive output, with
a more pressing attack. The Clash came through with the equalizer
from Wade Barrett in the 32nd minute.
</P>
<P>
   Burn leading scorer Jason Kreis didn't score, but he had a hand
in the winning goal. He directed a shot off a 25-yard free kick
past a two-man Clash wall. Rhine was in perfect position for the
rebound after San Jose goalkeeper Joe Cannon couldn't hold onto the
ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this level, mistakes that we made tonight are going to be
punished, and we got punished both times,'' Clash coach Brian Quinn
said. ``First on Joey's ball and then when the wall broke down. The
other problem, obviously, is that we have to finish our chances.''

Preseason promise ends with a postseason thud
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JONATHAN FEIGEN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
A season that began with championship hopes riding into town in a
white stretch limousine and a police escort rode off
unceremoniously Saturday in a truckload of bricks.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets' season came to a crashing first-round playoff halt,
possibly taking the career of Charles Barkley with it, when the Los
Angeles Lakers rolled to a 98-88 win Saturday at Compaq Center,
clinching their NBA Western Conference playoff series three games
to one.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA championship dreams that swelled to expectations with
Scottie Pippen's celebrated arrival and the rejuvenated health of
Hakeem Olajuwon and Barkley did not last one week of the postseason
when the Rockets' shooting touch left them and they could find
nothing to replace it.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets needed a late run to make even 31 of 87 (35.6
percent) of their shots. And their frontcourt legends never could
dominate enough to slow a Lakers charge driven by Shaquille
O'Neal's most unstoppable offensive game of the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got beat by a better team. I really believe that,'' Barkley
said, the results too clear to debate the few points that might
have changed things Saturday or in the series. ``I know people
around here like to make excuses and live in the past. The Lakers
just have a better team than we do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers left little doubt. Their playoff victory, taken
fittingly for this odd season on the Rockets' home court, was so
clear, Barkley said he is close to announcing his retirement, his
hopes for a first NBA championship apparently out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Realistically, we are going to be a year older next year and I
don't know what we can do,'' Barkley said. ``We have some great
guys, but the big question is how good can we be? I'm leaning
toward retirement. That is what is realistic. I'm not going to play
just for money. I want to win.''
</P>
<P>
   But as Saturday's game for playoff survival slipped far beyond
the reach of mere will, which was enough Thursday to have prolonged
the series, winning seemed far from the Rockets' reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought we could go all the way, if only we could get out
of the first round,'' Olajuwon said. ``I look at the rest of the
teams out there and when you see them, you know you can compete at
any level with them. But the team that we're playing here,
especially for myself, is different. You are more on the defensive.
You have to contain and just push. When you see the way Shaq is
playing now, they are hard to beat.''
</P>
<P>
   As the season ended, Barkley's right eye was blackened from
Thursday's contact with Brent Price, Pippen had blurred vision in
his right eye and a sore back from a collision with J.R. Reid, and
Olajuwon was treating a sore left knee.
</P>
<P>
   Though the three combined for 57 points, that was 10 less than
Barkley and Pippen put up in the Rockets' series win. And neither
Barkley nor Pippen could command the double teams needed to help
the Rockets' shooters, who until the meaningless last two minutes
could make just four of 27 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   But the Lakers, playing without Glen Rice, who was out with a
sore right elbow, could ride O'Neal to 37 points despite missing
nine free throws. Kobe Bryant, their rapidly developing prodigy
guard, had playoff career highs of 24 points and eight assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me and Scottie and Hakeem would have had to reach way back in
our past to match that,'' Barkley said. ``We were able to do it in
one game. We weren't able to do that for more than one game.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the inability of the Rockets' latest Big Three to
reach back to recreate their glory days will prove the season's
epitaph.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very tough,'' Pippen said. ``I know everything is going
to reflect back to me, that maybe I wasn't the answer, that Scottie
couldn't carry them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was probably the biggest piece of the puzzle, the one they
were looking forward to making this season easier, and it was in
fact very difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Pippen could not alone be blamed. But that was the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen brought Thursday's energy and urgency, but made just six
of 23 shots to finish with 19 points to go with 17 rebounds.
Barkley was solid, but could no longer dominate, making seven of 13
shots for 20 points. And Olajuwon found his touch late, but spent
most of the day, as he had most of the series, locked in a losing
battle with O'Neal and a mismatch of mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't change his style,'' Olajuwon said. ``When you're the
only shot-blocker in there, there's nothing you can do. And when
he's making those shots, it's over. You can't give him anything
near the basket because then it's a dunk. You can't move him. You
just have to make him work for his shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just have to look at it from a basketball point of view
where he has all the advantages and he uses them.''
</P>
<P>
   The same could have been said for the Lakers as a whole
Saturday. But for all their troubles, the Rockets made one
significant run and late in the third quarter, after trailing by 17
in the first half, had a shot to tie the score. With Olajuwon,
announced as doubtful for the second half, making three tough
jumpers and Michael Dickerson nailing a 27-footer to beat the shot
clock, the Rockets were within three eight minutes into the half.
</P>
<P>
   Twice Sam Mack, who replaced Pippen after his violent collision
with Reid left him with blurry vision, had open 3s to tie the
score. But fittingly for the game, the series and the season, they
came up short. By the end of the quarter, the Lakers led by seven.
And within minutes of the fourth quarter, O'Neal was rolling and
the lead was back to 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a couple plays we had it there, we could have made
an extra pass or a shot and the crowd would have gone crazy and got
us even more pumped up,'' Barkley said. ``But we never could finish
those plays.''
</P>
<P>
   And though the opportunities were there, they never could finish
the season with the promise with which it began. It ended instead
with one postseason win and a frustrating conviction that it could
have been much more.

Preseason promise ends with a postseason thud
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JONATHAN FEIGEN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
A season that began with championship hopes riding into town in a
white stretch limousine and a police escort rode off
unceremoniously Saturday in a truckload of bricks.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets' season came to a crashing first-round playoff halt,
possibly taking the career of Charles Barkley with it, when the Los
Angeles Lakers rolled to a 98-88 win Saturday at Compaq Center,
clinching their NBA Western Conference playoff series three games
to one.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA championship dreams that swelled to expectations with
Scottie Pippen's celebrated arrival and the rejuvenated health of
Hakeem Olajuwon and Barkley did not last one week of the postseason
when the Rockets' shooting touch left them and they could find
nothing to replace it.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets needed a late run to make even 31 of 87 (35.6
percent) of their shots. And their frontcourt legends never could
dominate enough to slow a Lakers charge driven by Shaquille
O'Neal's most unstoppable offensive game of the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got beat by a better team. I really believe that,'' Barkley
said, the results too clear to debate the few points that might
have changed things Saturday or in the series. ``I know people
around here like to make excuses and live in the past. The Lakers
just have a better team than we do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers left little doubt. Their playoff victory, taken
fittingly for this odd season on the Rockets' home court, was so
clear, Barkley said he is close to announcing his retirement, his
hopes for a first NBA championship apparently out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Realistically, we are going to be a year older next year and I
don't know what we can do,'' Barkley said. ``We have some great
guys, but the big question is how good can we be? I'm leaning
toward retirement. That is what is realistic. I'm not going to play
just for money. I want to win.''
</P>
<P>
   But as Saturday's game for playoff survival slipped far beyond
the reach of mere will, which was enough Thursday to have prolonged
the series, winning seemed far from the Rockets' reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought we could go all the way, if only we could get out
of the first round,'' Olajuwon said. ``I look at the rest of the
teams out there and when you see them, you know you can compete at
any level with them. But the team that we're playing here,
especially for myself, is different. You are more on the defensive.
You have to contain and just push. When you see the way Shaq is
playing now, they are hard to beat.''
</P>
<P>
   As the season ended, Barkley's right eye was blackened from
Thursday's contact with Brent Price, Pippen had blurred vision in
his right eye and a sore back from a collision with J.R. Reid, and
Olajuwon was treating a sore left knee.
</P>
<P>
   Though the three combined for 57 points, that was 10 less than
Barkley and Pippen put up in the Rockets' series win. And neither
Barkley nor Pippen could command the double teams needed to help
the Rockets' shooters, who until the meaningless last two minutes
could make just four of 27 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   But the Lakers, playing without Glen Rice, who was out with a
sore right elbow, could ride O'Neal to 37 points despite missing
nine free throws. Kobe Bryant, their rapidly developing prodigy
guard, had playoff career highs of 24 points and eight assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me and Scottie and Hakeem would have had to reach way back in
our past to match that,'' Barkley said. ``We were able to do it in
one game. We weren't able to do that for more than one game.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the inability of the Rockets' latest Big Three to
reach back to recreate their glory days will prove the season's
epitaph.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very tough,'' Pippen said. ``I know everything is going
to reflect back to me, that maybe I wasn't the answer, that Scottie
couldn't carry them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was probably the biggest piece of the puzzle, the one they
were looking forward to making this season easier, and it was in
fact very difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Pippen could not alone be blamed. But that was the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen brought Thursday's energy and urgency, but made just six
of 23 shots to finish with 19 points to go with 17 rebounds.
Barkley was solid, but could no longer dominate, making seven of 13
shots for 20 points. And Olajuwon found his touch late, but spent
most of the day, as he had most of the series, locked in a losing
battle with O'Neal and a mismatch of mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't change his style,'' Olajuwon said. ``When you're the
only shot-blocker in there, there's nothing you can do. And when
he's making those shots, it's over. You can't give him anything
near the basket because then it's a dunk. You can't move him. You
just have to make him work for his shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just have to look at it from a basketball point of view
where he has all the advantages and he uses them.''
</P>
<P>
   The same could have been said for the Lakers as a whole
Saturday. But for all their troubles, the Rockets made one
significant run and late in the third quarter, after trailing by 17
in the first half, had a shot to tie the score. With Olajuwon,
announced as doubtful for the second half, making three tough
jumpers and Michael Dickerson nailing a 27-footer to beat the shot
clock, the Rockets were within three eight minutes into the half.
</P>
<P>
   Twice Sam Mack, who replaced Pippen after his violent collision
with Reid left him with blurry vision, had open 3s to tie the
score. But fittingly for the game, the series and the season, they
came up short. By the end of the quarter, the Lakers led by seven.
And within minutes of the fourth quarter, O'Neal was rolling and
the lead was back to 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a couple plays we had it there, we could have made
an extra pass or a shot and the crowd would have gone crazy and got
us even more pumped up,'' Barkley said. ``But we never could finish
those plays.''
</P>
<P>
   And though the opportunities were there, they never could finish
the season with the promise with which it began. It ended instead
with one postseason win and a frustrating conviction that it could
have been much more.

Streaking Astros deck Giants 10-5
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By CARLTON THOMPSON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
The San Francisco Giants can only hope the low-scoring games that
once epitomized baseball at the Astrodome will be on the agenda
tonight when the Astros turn back the clock by wearing uniforms
replicated from the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the amount of muscle-flexing the Astros have been
doing lately, most of them are probably close to busting through
the seams of their current threads. The Astros will have to worry
about that later; for now, they're too busy making alterations on
the earned run averages of opposing pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   They cut up Mark Gardner and the Giants 10-5 Saturday night in a
game that wasn't as close as the score indicates.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Hampton pitched five no-hit innings and won his fifth
consecutive decision, while Craig Biggio and Jeff Bagwell combined
to drive in seven of the Astros' 10 runs. Biggio was 4-for-4 and
reached base in each of his five plate appearances.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros have won 12 of their last 15 games, including five in
a row _ their longest winning streak of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I like is that we're starting to gain some
confidence,'' Bagwell said. ``When you do that, good things tend to
start happening. We know we can score some runs, and when that's
the case _ and your pitching holds the other team down _ you're
going to have a lot of chances to win games.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros have been winning games at a clip better than almost
every team in baseball. Their 23-12 record is second only to
Cleveland (26-9) in the majors. It also matches the best 35-game
start in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some satisfaction in it (the Astros' record) in the
sense that this team has not lost its intensity,'' manager Larry
Dierker said. ``I was a little worried about that in spring
training.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we were a little sluggish when we got off to the
slow start early this season, but from the second week on, our
intensity and our concentration have been exceptional.''
</P>
<P>
   He could have just as easily been talking about Hampton, who has
rebounded nicely from a bad season debut. The Astros have won seven
of his eight starts, and Hampton has been locked into a zone over
the last four.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton's .267 opponents' batting average over his first four
starts was impressive, but the fact opponents are hitting just .154
against the lefthander in his last four starts is downright
dominant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had stretches like this in the past,'' said Hampton, who
improved to 8-0 against the Giants in his career. ``But the
difference is I made the mistake of looking too far ahead back
then. Now, I'm only concentrating on my next start. It's fun to be
in a groove like this. You feel like you're going to get a win
every time out.''
</P>
<P>
   That must be the flip side of how Giants starter Mark Gardner is
feeling these days. The veteran righthander lost his fourth
consecutive decision and is still looking for his first victory of
the season. Meanwhile, he watched the Astros boost his ERA to 10.88
with Saturday's shellacking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bad luck and bad pitches make for a bad start,'' Gardner said.
``But it will turn around.''
</P>
<P>
   Gardner faced the minimum number of batters through the first
two innings, but the Astros sent seven batters to the plate in the
third when they converted two hits, a walk and a hit batsmen into
four runs. The biggest blow was Bagwell's 10th homer of the year _
a three-run blast into the pavilion in left-center field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't kill it,'' Bagwell said of his first home run since
May 5. ``It just barely made it, but I'll take it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell's home run ended the Astros' homer drought at three
games, the longest of this season and last season. Of course, the
Astros proved they could overpower their opponents without the long
ball during their homerless streak when they held a 32-14 scoring
advantage on their opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Biggio rediscovered his home-run stroke in the fifth inning when
he yanked a three-run blast over the left-field wall. He had gone
15 games and 63 at-bats without a homer before he unloaded on
Gardner, who ranks among the National League leaders with nine home
runs allowed in just 22 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell and Ken Caminiti scored on Carl Everett's single to
right in the fifth inning, although Caminiti's run was aided by
Ellis Burks' error in right field.
</P>
<P>
   Giants catcher Scott Servais ended the no-hit drama with a solo
home run to lead off the sixth inning. It was the first home run
Hampton had allowed since April 29, a span of 27 innings. The
Giants added another run in the inning on Jeff Kent's sacrifice
fly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was aware of the no-hitter, but you really don't start
thinking about that kind of stuff until the seventh or eighth
inning,'' Hampton said. ``My location wasn't as sharp as I would
have liked. It was good early, but I got out of rhythm, and
fortunately I was able to find it again. I actually made a couple
of mistakes over the middle of the plate. I had pretty good stuff,
but it was nothing extraordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants added three runs off Brian Williams in the eighth
inning, but Scott Elarton squelched the comeback bid with 1
scoreless innings to close out the game.

Lakers' bench helps Rockets take a seat
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JEROME SOLOMON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
According to the shouts of one Rockets fan Saturday, Robert Horry
stinks.
</P>
<P>
   ``You weren't saying all of that when I was helping put those
two banners up there, were you?'' Horry responded, after draining a
3-pointer and keeping his wrist in post-shot position, leaving the
smoking gun raised high for all to see.
</P>
<P>
   According to Horry, the fan then shut up.
</P>
<P>
   Forgive him, Horry. Forgive him and the other 16,284 who made up
a sellout crowd at Compaq Center.
</P>
<P>
   It must have been difficult for them to remember the banners you
helped the Rockets win, when you were so busy making sure the
Rockets would not add to that collection this year.
</P>
<P>
   Horry, who left Houston in a trade following the 1995-96 season,
had a playoff game like those he was accustomed to having when he
was part of the Rockets' championship seasons (1993-94 and '94-95),
hitting five of seven shots, including 2-for-4 from the 3-point
line, for 12 points with two blocked shots in 27 minutes off the
bench.
</P>
<P>
   Horry was part of a trio of Lakers reserves who proved to be the
difference as the Lakers clinched the best-of-five first-round
series with a 98-88 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``In shootaround today, I was shooting it pretty good and I just
wanted to come out and try to do the things the team needed,''
Horry said. ``We need everybody to step in, fill their roles and
get the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   Derek Harper, who had not had a double-figure scoring game since
March 26 (23 games ago), came in to spell Derek Fisher at point
guard and scored 13 points. And Rick Fox, who averaged less than
six points in 19 minutes of play in the first three games of the
series, stepped into the starting lineup for an injured Glen Rice
and hit four of nine shots in 33 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Harper, Fox and Horry combined to score 34 points, 18 more than
their combined average in the first three games.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just want to step up,'' said Harper, who is in his 16th
season. ``I've been in this situation a lot. I feel comfortable and
confident out on the basketball court. I've been resting the latter
part of the season and I just feel good. I feel like I can go out
and contribute.''
</P>
<P>
   Harper was running the offense when the Lakers took control in
the second period and built a 17-point lead at 47-30, and he was on
the floor the entire fourth period to help Los Angeles keep the
Rockets at bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about me, it's about all of us collectively,'' Harper
said. ``It was an opportunity that (the bench) took advantage of,
more than anything. It's nothing against (Fisher) or nothing
against anybody else. Those guys have played well. My hat's off to
the whole team because lately we've been playing as a team. We've
really been together and the factor that we're together, that's
what's helping us be successful as a team.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles has been on a perfectly timed roll of late,
beginning with four games remaining in the regular season. But the
contribution of its reserves has been unsteady.
</P>
<P>
   In the series opener, Horry, Harper and Fox played a combined 63
minutes but managed only five points among them.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's production was welcomed and could not have come at a
better time. Rice, who averaged 18.7 points in the first three
games, had a sore elbow that caused him to miss the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers missed him, of course, but not much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've (started) before,'' Fox said. ``I think veterans in this
league welcome the opportunity to set the tone in the game and to
feel the rhythm of it from the start. For me, the adrenalin was
going.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way it's going to have to be at certain point
throughout the course of this playoff run. Guys, other than Kobe
(Bryant) and Shaquille (O'Neal) and Glen, are gonna be asked to
make big plays. Tonight it was Harp and tonight I had to step in
and start. It's gonna be a total 12-man effort for us to be able to
go further than just past the first round.''

Hakeem hands over torch to O'Neal
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By MICHAEL MURPHY &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
For most great pro athletes, the hardest part of their career is
passing the torch. They need the ability to step back, push aside
the ego and acknowledge they are no longer the best at what they
do.
</P>
<P>
   Hakeem Olajuwon is not one of those.
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon, a certain Hall of Famer, was the NBA's dominant center
for many years, using a unique blend of quickness, strength and
footwork to present incredible matchup problems for every team.
</P>
<P>
   But after Saturday's 98-88 loss to the Los Angeles Lakers in
Game 4 of the Western Conference opening-round series before 16,285
at Compaq Center, a game that eliminated the Rockets from the
playoffs, Olajuwon was telling everyone what had become obvious:
Shaquille O'Neal is the best player in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``His strength and his size are definitely a problem,'' Olajuwon
said. ``You have to give him a lot of credit. Even when you beat
him (with a move), he can recover. He is very quick to recover.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a fan of the big man, so when I see the way Shaq has
developed, and the way he is still developing, it brings joy to me.
I am happy to see that because I can see now where he is definitely
the best big man in the league, and he still has a tremendous way
to develop. Definitely he is the best. There is no question about
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially after O'Neal's 37-point, 11-rebound game Saturday.
Just about everyone on the Rockets took a turn at guarding O'Neal,
who responded with a variety of shots that was staggering. The jump
hook in the lane. The spinning fallaway. The soft kiss off the
glass.
</P>
<P>
   And, yes, the trademark, leg-splayed power dunk that leaves the
backboard vibrating for what seems hours.
</P>
<P>
   No defense worked. And it wasn't just Saturday's game. O'Neal
averaged 29.5 points in the four games, leaving little but mangled
bodies in his wake.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing with Shaq is that even though I know what he is
going to do, I still cannot stop him,'' said Olajuwon, who finished
with 18 points and 10 rebounds Saturday. ``I know when he is
shooting that shot (the turnaround in the lane), I can't jump
because I'm bracing myself (against O'Neal's body) just to hold him
(away from the basket). So when he shoots, I can only hope that he
misses. I've not experienced that against any other player _ until
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon remembers when he was the dominant force in the NBA,
when he was the one making opposing centers look foolish with their
efforts to stop him. Remember David Robinson in the 1995 Western
Conference finals? Remember when Olajuwon scored at will over
O'Neal in the '95 NBA Finals, when the Rockets swept the Orlando
Magic for their second straight NBA title?
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a different style of basketball back then,'' Olajuwon
said. ``We had different teams, different styles. When you look at
it now, you can see the maturity and the experience he has
developed. He has more polish, and he is passing the ball better.
And he's stronger and bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon paused and laughed at that last line. Stronger and
bigger. As if that's possible.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, back then, when he wore a Magic jersey, O'Neal was a
mere 300 pounds. He now tips the scales at almost 335 pounds, and
it's all muscle.
</P>
<P>
   ``You understand what I'm saying?'' Olajuwon said. ``He's
bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon just shook his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``The style of basketball that I played back then was different,
too,'' Olajuwon said. ``Back then, it was more like a free-lance,
creative scheme, where I was real comfortable. We did not do that
in this series, except for the first game (a 101-100 Lakers victory
where Olajuwon scored 22 points on 10-of-13 shooting). Other than
that, we did not play that style.''
</P>
<P>
   And they're not likely to. Olajuwon, 36, understands he is on
the downside of his career. Teams are no longer built around him.
What O'Neal, 27, can only dream of are memories for Olajuwon. He
has enjoyed the view from the top, so coming down isn't so
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere between 1995 and Saturday, O'Neal passed him on the
climb up those same heights, and Olajuwon thinks there is nothing
but better things ahead for the massive Lakers' center.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of areas where he can improve, where he can
become a unique big man in the history of the game,'' Olajuwon
said. ``He can get (to the point) where nobody of that size could
do that many things. He creates so many different problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``My game is fakes and agility, but he has all these same
things, plus size. I have to give him credit, and I must wish him
well to continue to develop to be a better player.''

Rockets can only watch as Lakers, time zip past
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOHN P. LOPEZ &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was about growing up and growing old.
</P>
<P>
   It was about knowing when it's time to pitch the keys to the
kids and letting them stay out as late as they want. It was about
staring right into those bright, hungry eyes and remembering when
you used to see that look in the mirror every day.
</P>
<P>
   It was about seeing Shaquille O'Neal scream and watching Kobe
Bryant bounce and skip off the floor and remembering when that was
you.
</P>
<P>
   When it was you slashing, cutting, jumping and playing. When it
was you going behind the back, twisting your body in mid-air and
dunking. When it was you posting up, lofting shots mere inches
above outstretched arms. When it was you blocking shots, slamming
dunks, laughing on the opponent's floor and moving on in this NBA
championship race.
</P>
<P>
   It was about knowing when someone else's time has come. And
wondering if yours has passed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were just better than us,'' Rockets forward Charles
Barkley said of the Lakers. ``I really believe that Me and Scottie
and Hakeem would have had to reach way back in the past to match
them.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't just Lakers 98, Rockets 88 Saturday at Compaq Center.
It was time passing by and torches being passed.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets' season is over. They will return a year from now
probably with almost the exact roster that took the floor Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But what they and the Lakers both had to realize in the wake of
a playoff series that belonged to Los Angeles from the moment
Pippen stumbled in Game 1 and the Lakers stood tall, was that these
are teams headed in different directions.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley may retire; it seems he is leaning that way and he will
tell us soon. Olajuwon certainly has at least one, maybe two or
three terrific seasons left in him. Given a training camp and more
time, Pippen may find a comfortable place in the Rockets system.
</P>
<P>
   There also may be a new rookie joining the team and maybe a
free-agent acquisition or two. And certainly Cuttino Mobley and
Michael Dickerson will only improve.
</P>
<P>
   But will it make a difference? This is the brink of the Lakers'
era, and this series showed why.
</P>
<P>
   For one impressive, memorable day _ Thursday night _ the Rockets
reached back and grabbed their glorious days out of the air. The
Rockets showed these giddy kids exactly how it was done when they
were kings.
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon played dreamy. Barkley defied odds and even the 7-1,
330-pound O'Neal for 23 rebounds. Pippen slashed and dunked with
remarkable ease.
</P>
<P>
   But that was just one day. This series-clinching Lakers effort
was reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Old guys don't get better, they get older,'' Barkley said.
``This ain't golf. There's no senior tour. Let's face it, we're
going to be a year older next year.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Lakers still will only be getting better.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were younger, more athletic,'' Olajuwon said. ``They were
faster. They were stronger inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing epitomized the way this series broke and the way the
Lakers made a bold step past the Rockets than O'Neal working inside
against Olajuwon like he was just another big man trying to hang
on.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing said more about the development of Bryant as a
Jordanesque kind of player than the way he drove past Pippen at all
the critical moments, including a behind-the-back dribble and drive
to the hoop in the decisive fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal backed Olajuwon under the basket almost at will. He
blocked four of Olajuwon's shots, which maybe never has happened
before.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's playing on a different level,'' Olajuwon said of O'Neal.
``It's all about advantages. He's the best big man in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant, taking advantage of shooting guard Glen Rice's absence
in the game because of injury, blasted to 13 first-quarter points,
setting the standard for the game and playing better than anyone
the Rockets had.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Game 3, Scottie threw the first punch,'' Bryant said.
``They made a statement. But today, we had more energy, and they
had to match us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets didn't. More significantly, they couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, when the Rockets swept the Orlando Magic in the
NBA Finals and Olajuwon was unmatched in the game, O'Neal could do
nothing about it. He was just a kid. He tried to keep up with the
master of spinning in the post, faking and pumping around O'Neal,
Dream-shaking. But he couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday and throughout the series, it was all O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to tell you a secret,'' O'Neal said. ``When a guy is
your idol, you learn everything he does. You respect him. Hakeem
has always been my idol, and that was the difference. I knew what
he was doing out there, and I didn't go for the first fake.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal was better. For some legends such as Olajuwon that is
something that is impossible to admit, but this was so obvious and
Olajuwon was so classy about the reality of it all.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal practically shot Olajuwon's age, scoring 37 points and
slamming down so many big baskets in Olajuwon's face down the
stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never happened (to me) before,'' Olajuwon said.
</P>
<P>
   Time has passed. O'Neal and Kid Kobe are growing up. The Rockets
are growing old.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know around here people like to make excuses and live in the
past,'' Barkley said. ``But they were just better than us.''

Retirement would beat losing for Barkley
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By DALE ROBERTSON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If he's gone, and everything seems to indicate he is, Charles
Barkley failed to achieve his sole objective as a Rocket.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley didn't come to Houston for the bucks, the golf courses
or, despite his own joking to the contrary, our famous array of
``gentlemen's'' clubs. He wanted to be a Rocket, forcing a trade to
make it happen, because he honestly thought he had a better chance
to claim an NBA championship here than anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   And he will choose not to return for one reason only: Because he
doesn't believe he can win a championship here.
</P>
<P>
   Money? The Chuckster doesn't need it, even though he became a
veritable pauper by NBA standards in 1999, playing for the
veteran's minimum of $1 million _ and feeling immensely thankful
for the privilege.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got $30 million in the bank,'' Barkley said Saturday after
the Lakers had eliminated the Rockets from the playoffs in what may
have been the last game of his 15-year, Hall-of-Fame career. ``If I
spend all that, I deserve to be broke.''
</P>
<P>
   Golf? Who cares? There are roughly 120 courses in the Phoenix
area, where he makes his permanent home.
</P>
<P>
   No, the sole source of Barkley's motivation was his desire for
that elusive ring. It always has been, first in Philly and later in
Phoenix. He is as driven and tunnel-visioned an athlete as ever
played this or any other sport. If you don't believe that by now,
shame on you for not paying attention.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley most assuredly didn't come to Houston to win us over, to
make us like him. I've come to know the guy pretty well and I can
assure you he wastes not a second worrying about how people view
him. What you see is what you get, take it or leave it.
</P>
<P>
   Well, what you saw against the Lakers, if you were paying
attention, was the consummate warrior on display, a 36-year-old
knee-surgery rehab patient sell out as totally as an athlete can.
Although he finally showed signs of fatigue in Saturday's 98-88
defeat, his 20 points led the Rockets and his nine rebounds gave
him 55 for the four games, or 13.8 per.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Rudy Tomjanovich to reflect on Barkley's grand finale, if it
was indeed one, and he brings up the end of the second game, when
Barkley wasn't even playing because the Lakers were hopelessly
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charles was on the bench cheering for the second-teamers,''
Tomjanovich said. ``The guy just has such amazing energy and
enthusiasm.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley's Game 3 heroics _ 30 points, 23 rebounds in a Rockets
rout _ made for one of the finest performances in playoff history,
his or anyone else's. He literally willed himself into having such
a monster series and, although the Rockets may be going home for
the summer, he goes with them knowing he didn't leave a bit of
himself, not a DNA molecule, unspent.
</P>
<P>
   Which is essentially the problem, a big part of the reason why
he suspects retirement is the right choice for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You win with talent, not will power,'' he said. ``And that
(what he accomplished against the Lakers) was far more about will
power than it was talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't get better when you get older. I've got to be
realistic. I'll be 37 years old and next year is gonna be a full
season, a full six months, not three. I've got to know we've got a
chance, or I don't want to put myself through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that, under the Bird exemption, Houston could pay him
up to $14 million in 1999-2000. Repeat after me: It's not about the
$$$. Barkley is not your greedy, money-grubbing clich of an
athlete. He's as against the grain as they come.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd just be leaving more to my freeloading relatives to fight
over when I die,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Charles will speak with Rudy T and basketball veep Carroll
Dawson at some future date, hoping they can tell him what he wants
to hear, that the Rockets will be able to improve themselves in
some way to make another title run viable. As they are currently
constituted, Barkley said with his typical candor, he doesn't
consider them contenders.
</P>
<P>
   He loves the team, in respect to its mix of locker-room
personalities. But he doesn't love its prospects for going the
distance, for climbing the mountain that has taunted him since he
reported to the Sixers as a pudgy, already brash rookie in the fall
of 1984.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see us getting better,'' he said, ``and we obviously
weren't good enough as it was. I'm just being realistic when I say
I'm leaning toward retirement. I don't want to hang around to be
pretty good. I want to win.''
</P>
<P>
   These Rockets couldn't because the backcourt was too young and
perhaps the fabled frontcourt was too old. Still, the Chuckster
leaves satisfied. As he's wont to tell us, his life has been the
good life. He wouldn't trade it for any he's aware of.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want a championship,'' he said recently, ``but I don't need
a championship because I know I did everything I could personally
do to get one.''
</P>
<P>
   And, if this is it, if it never happens, so be it. Just don't be
dumb enough to accuse him of piking, or not caring. We've seen lots
of athletes come and go in Houston. None cared more, or had a
bigger heart. Not a one of them.

Belfour's heroics carry lackluster Stars past Blues
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By BILL SULLIVAN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
DALLAS _ The situation called for something special, and a two-goal
victory seemed to suggest that the mandate had been met.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Hitchcock's scowl said something completely different.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our power play was good, our goalie was excellent and that's
about it,'' the Dallas Stars coach said after his team's 3-1 win
Saturday night over the St. Louis Blues gave the Stars a 3-2 edge
in this best-of-seven NHL Western Conference semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   And the downside?
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know is that if we're going to win another game in this
series, we will have to play a lot better for 60 minutes than we
did tonight,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, this was hardly the sort of emphatic statement the
regular season's best team wanted to make in a must-win Game 5 of a
second-round series.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas was outshot 31-16, including a 25-9 margin over the final
two periods. The Stars needed Ed Belfour to turn back 30 of those
shots as much of the final 40 minutes were played in the Dallas
end. After going up 2-0 in the first 9 minutes, 43 seconds, the
Stars basically retreated into a defensive shell and tried to
withstand the attack of the quicker, faster Blues.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas did barely. And things would have been a good deal more
tense at the end had Jochen Hecht's goal with just under a minute
to play not been waived off after replays showed Hecht had part of
a skate in the crease.
</P>
<P>
   So the Stars retain home-ice advantage going into Monday night's
Game 6 at St. Louis. That didn't mean they left themselves or
anyone else particularly impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The second period was a bad period for us,'' said center Mike
Modano, who assisted on two goals. ``We put a lot into the first
and ran out of gas in the second.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the middle of the game on, Eddie made some great saves.
He made it easier for the defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Belfour, and some strong special teams work, would be the
difference in this one.
</P>
<P>
   A paltry 1-of-21 on the power play coming into the game, the
Stars finally cashed in on two of them in the first 10 minutes. The
first, however, came with St. Louis skating with the man advantage.
</P>
<P>
   With Jamie Langenbrunner in the box, Modano picked up a turnover
in the neutral zone and was off on a rush down the right side.
Spotting Jere Lehtinen breaking in from the left, Modano set up
Lehtinen for a wrist shot that gave goalie Grant Fuhr no chance.
</P>
<P>
   In need of a quick start, Dallas had just that with a 1-0 lead
only 3:47 into the game, and doing it in a shorthanded situation
only added to the lift.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after, the Stars finally made something happen on a
power play of their own. Again, Modano was the catalyst, finding
Langenbrunner sitting on Fuhr's doorstep and hitting him with a
perfect pass that Langenbrunner directed in at 9:43, making it 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour kept it that way as the Blues outshot the Stars 8-1 in
the first nine minutes of the second period. He held on long enough
for Dallas to add another power-play goal _ a Joe Nieuwendyk
deflection of a Derian Hatcher blast at 10:52 _ but the three-goal
lead lasted less than a minute as Scott Young got an unassisted
goal when he banged a shot through Belfour's legs at 11:19.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the way, only that disallowed goal by Hecht would
get past Belfour, and the Blues gave the winning goalie his due.
Still, as they headed home, they had every reason to be confident
about earning a return for a Game 7 here Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though we lost tonight, we played hard,'' defenseman Al
MacInnis said. ``Special teams were the difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a better situation than after the first two games
here.''
</P>
<P>
   And to hear Hitchcock tell it, the Stars can either plan for a
more inspired effort Monday night, or plan for Game 7 two days
later.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we played tonight isn't going to be good enough to win
the fourth game in this series,'' he said. ``We're going to have to
play better, and we know that.''

PRONGER'S STRUGGLES HURTING BLUES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ St. Louis defenseman Chris Pronger looked annoyed.
</P>
<P>
   He had just seen his Blues start slowly, play poorly and fall
easily in Game 5 _ a 3-1 loss that has them a single defeat away
from beginning a summer of golf.
</P>
<P>
   He had himself partially to blame, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has got to play better than he did tonight,'' Blues coach
Joel Quenneville said.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis' chances for upsetting the Stars relied on solid play
from Pronger and Blues defenseman Al MacInnis. So far, Pronger and
MacInnis have played anything but.
</P>
<P>
   MacInnis has a pair of assists in the series despite averaging
better than 35 minutes a game. It's a far cry from his three-goal,
six-assist performance in St. Louis' opening-round series against
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   He has been struggling to unleash his well-documented slap shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I think he's getting shots,'' Quenneville said. ``I
think we need a little more traffic. He'll find a way. He's got a
lot of shots on net. He's just missed, too, so find a way to get
them through and that's a dangerous weapon for us again.''
</P>
<P>
   Pronger has simply been struggling.
</P>
<P>
   He has one assist, despite averaging in excess of 36 minutes a
game. He's also a minus-4 this series. In layman's terms, he's been
on the ice more when the Stars have scored than when the Blues
have.
</P>
<P>
   He played a big role in Dallas' shorthanded goal that opened
scoring less than four minutes into Game 5. Pronger allowed Stars
center Mike Modano to slip by him along the boards, and a couple of
seconds later that mistake ended up in the Blues net. Modano
whipped a pass to Jere Lehtinen for an easy goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Scotty \RYoung\S was going to get the puck back,''
Pronger said. ``I just kind of was flat-footed there, and I didn't
get my body in front of him enough and he squeezed by.''
</P>
<P>
   Young had been looking for Pronger to bang Modano in the boards,
but Pronger didn't. He just didn't seem to be the same player,
offensive or defensively.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, offensively, you can look at the power play,''
Quenneville said. ``It hasn't scored at the rate it has all year or
in the previous series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that'll sum it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Pronger and MacInnis lead St. Louis' power play, which has been
less than beneficial. The Blues are 2-for-25 with a man advantage
in this series.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key to a very talented player is pressure,'' Modano said.
``The less time you give them to make plays, the more often you
force them into a play they're not comfortable making, force them
to make a play that's a little more creative.''
</P>
<P>
   Said MacInnis: ``Our power play has struggled most of the
series. It's got to be better.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't say it, but for the Blues' power play to be better he
and Pronger have to be better, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al's been good,'' Quenneville said.
</P>
<P>
   A second passed, maybe two, and he realized just how bad that
sounded. It sounded like an indictment of Pronger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prongs has been good, too,'' Quenneville quickly added. ``It
was just one of those nights. He's a top player. He'll bounce
back.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blues need it to be soon, very soon.

MODANO SHINES FOR THE STARS IN CRUNCH TIME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The puck dropped, and in the most important period of
their most important game of this exceedingly important season, the
Stars took control.
</P>
<P>
   The puck dropped, and in the opening 20 minutes of this acutely
important game, Mike Modano stepped center stage.
</P>
<P>
   He wears the spotlight well. Never mind the grumbles about the
balky power play.
</P>
<P>
   These are the nights when the Modanos of the NHL are supposed to
shine. And Modano's first period provided enough luster that the
Stars were able to follow the silvery path home.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars' 3-1 victory, aided by two highlight-reel Modano
assists, does not necessarily mean the war with the irksome St.
Louis Blues is over. Tomorrow night's Game 6 in St. Louis will not
be Ed Belfour Appreciation Night.
</P>
<P>
   But it's so close _ again _ that on a warm spring night, the
Stars can almost smell ... well ... Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Kielbasa, right? Or maybe it's those infernal tire plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've worked the whole season for the home ice,'' Modano said.
``And so far it's been a real factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``But now the pressure is on them'' tomorrow night.
</P>
<P>
   With a conspicuous sigh, the Stars eased that grip from around
their own necks last night. Top-seeded teams with Stanley Cup
ambitions aren't supposed to back themselves against second-round
walls.
</P>
<P>
   But 10 minutes into Game 5, it was obvious that the change of
scenery had re-energized the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first period was real key,'' Modano said. ``We were all
real pumped up. We wanted to grab the lead and go with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were able to get the shorthanded goal, and things kind of
rolled from there. We had chances the whole period.''
</P>
<P>
   The dominating 20 minutes staked the Stars to a 2-0 lead and
enabled them to muck through a fickle second period.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got an extended lead early in the hockey game and became
far too protective,'' said coach Ken Hitchcock, the occasional
perfectionist. ``Once they got the momentum buildup, we had a heck
of a time stabilizing.''
</P>
<P>
   From the cheap seats, however, it looked like old-time Stars
hockey. With a two-goal lead clenched between their teeth, the
Stars seemed content to check and grind the visitors into
submission.
</P>
<P>
   Pointing to the night's biggest difference, the Blues' Blair
Atcheynum said, ``Special teams was the key for them. Being down a
couple of goals is hard against this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Of all the Stars' special-teams heroes on this night, none
seemed more special than Modano.
</P>
<P>
   His first assist came when the Stars were shorthanded, less than
four minutes into the game, and was born of prime-time effort.
Working along the boards, Modano was able to pull the puck away
from St. Louis' Chris Pronger and steam in on Al MacInnis. The
defenseman seemed to anticipate Modano shooting, but instead Modano
laced a crisp pass across to a closing Jere Lehtinen.
</P>
<P>
   The next assist came on, of all things, a power play.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were paying a lot of attention to Brett \RHull\S, and he
was in the middle of the ice,'' Modano said. ``And I was able to
get the pass across to Jamie \RLangenbrunner\S. It's all about
getting the puck and throwing it toward the net.''
</P>
<P>
   It is Modano's burden, of course, to be expected to do these
sorts of marquee things. When the power play chugs along at less
than a 10 percent clip, it is Modano who is asked what's wrong.
When the Stars let the series come home in a 2-2 knot, it is Modano
who is pressed for answers.
</P>
<P>
   Last night, on such an important night, he had them.

   ST. LOUIS _ The demons of Chan Ho Park were more subtle this
time. More painful, too.

<P>
   Park didn't get grand slammed over the head by the St. Louis
Cardinals the way he did three weeks ago. In Saturday night's 8-5
loss to the Cardinals in front of 48,308, Park also appeared to
lose his nerve.
</P>
<P>
   Park baffled manager Davey Johnson when he turned away from his
fastball to begin the sixth inning. Five batters and four runs
later, Park had finessed his way out of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little alarmed when he started the inning with a
curveball and a change,'' Johnson said. ``He had had a good
fastball to that point. But here's a guy with a 95-mph fastball
trying to nibble. He didn't go after them.''
</P>
<P>
   On the bright side, Fernando Tatis, who set a major-league
record April 23 by hitting two grand slams in the same inning, only
went 1 for 2 with a walk against Park on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But there was little other than that.
</P>
<P>
   This is the same Park who started slowly last season, but
responded by going 4-0 in July with a 1.05 ERA and finished 15-9.
</P>
<P>
   But this is also the same Park who allowed three late-inning
home runs last Sunday in a loss to the lowly Florida Marlins. By
failing to get out of the sixth, Park (3-3) raised his ERA to 5.32.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't explain it, but I am not going to lose confidence over
it,'' Park said. ``I will continue to work hard and I will be
ready. I will throw more fastballs next time.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Dodgers could have moved into first place with a
victory, a bigger concern is the shakiness of their No. 2 starter.
Although Park has won 29 games the past two seasons, Dodgers
officials signed free agent Kevin Brown because they didn't think
Park was ready to be the ace of the staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevin will help these guys,'' Johnson said. ``Park is young.
He'll be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Until the fifth, Park wasn't sharp, but he was settling down. He
allowed seven base runners in the first three innings, then retired
the next eight batters in a row.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers had spotted him a 4-1 lead. Gary Sheffield extended
his hitting streak to seven games by doubling and scoring in the
fourth and doubling home another run in the fifth. Adrian Beltre
made it 4-1 in the top of the sixth with a two-out RBI single that
scored Mark Grudzielanek and chased Cardinals starter Kent
Bottenfield.
</P>
<P>
   But Ray Lankford opened the sixth with a single to right, went
to second on a single by Tatis and scored on a base hit by Eric
Davis. One batter later, pinch-hitter J.D. Drew drove a two-run
double into the right-field corner.
</P>
<P>
   Drew, the highly touted rookie who has been injured and
struggling, has been bothered by a sore right thigh. He was removed
for a pinch runner, but he wasn't the only one to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Drew's ball barely got back to the infield when Johnson started
his walk to the mound.
</P>
<P>
   Park was gone and suddenly Bottenfield, who allowed nine hits
and made 119 pitches in six innings, had a chance to be the winner.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, the Cardinals weren't through. Shawon
Dunston, whose throwing error cost St. Louis Friday night's game,
batted for Bottenfield and singled home the fourth run of the
inning. The Cardinals also got two runs on an eighth-inning home
run by Joe McEwing off Mike Maddux.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Park) had a good fastball, but suddenly he stopped using
it,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Park's reluctance to go after hitters is similar to a problem
today's starter Ismael Valdes faced the past few seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes was ridiculed by teammates for being timid, but this
season he has been the Dodgers most consistent starter, going 4-1
with a 3.21 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I made just bad pitches,'' Park said. ``I need to use
the breaking ball more than I have. I'm still learning and I will
get better. I have no doubt about that.''

BAD LUCK HAUNTING ANGELS' HILL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ Ken Hill must have walked under a ladder, or maybe a
black cat crossed his path. How else could one explain the Angels
pitcher's recent bad luck?
</P>
<P>
   Hill _ called the key to the staff by manager Terry Collins
before the season started _ continued to pitch effectively Saturday
night, but once again had nothing to show for it in a 3-1 loss to
the Tampa Bay Devil Rays before 36,939 at Edison Field. The Angels'
winning streak ended at four.
</P>
<P>
   Hill (1-3) went 72/3 innings _ his longest outing of the season
_ and gave up three runs and six hits. It was the fifth time in his
past six starts he's gone at least seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   During that stretch he has only one victory, and that came when
the Angels scored 17 runs. In the other games, the offense has been
lacking.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels' lack of offense had a lot to do with Devil Rays
starter Tony Saunders (3-3), who gave up only one unearned run and
three hits in eight innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels entered the game 5-1 against teams that started a
left-handed pitcher, including 3-0 at home. As a team, they were
hitting .305 against lefties compared to .261 against righties.
</P>
<P>
   The left-handed Saunders rendered those numbers meaningless by
baffling the Angels hitters. The Angels' only run through seven
innings came on their only hit through seven _ Mo Vaughn's two-out,
RBI single in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Devil Rays shortstop Kevin Stocker made a bad throw after
fielding Andy Sheets' grounder earlier in the inning. Sheets took
second on a walk to Randy Velarde and scored on Vaughn's
ground-ball single up the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Hill threw well, but couldn't handle Jose Canseco. Canseco was
the only Devil Rays batter to get a hit until Fred McGriff singled
in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Problem was, Canseco had three of them.
</P>
<P>
   Canseco doubled in the first inning but was left on base. In the
fourth, he singled to lead off the inning, went to third as Hill
walked McGriff and Herbert Perry, and scored when John Flaherty hit
into a fielder's choice.
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth, Canseco led off with a single, went to third on
McGriff's single and scored on a sacrifice fly by Perry to give the
Devil Rays a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Hill took it into the eighth inning, but ran out of gas. Perry
ripped an RBI double to center to score Quinton McCracken, knocking
Hill out of the game and giving the Devil Rays a 3-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels finally appeared ready to get to Saunders in the
eighth after Matt Walbeck led off with a double, and one out later
went to third on Darin Erstad's infield single.
</P>
<P>
   But with Vaughn on deck, Velarde hit a 2-0 pitch to Stocker at
shortstop, who started a rally-killing double play.

SHEFFIELD BREAKS .300 MARK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Gary Sheffield, who missed most of spring training
with pain in his surgically repaired right shoulder, had three more
hits Saturday, moving his average over .300 for the first time this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield doubled and scored in the fourth and doubled home Eric
Young in the fifth inning of the Dodgers' 8-5 loss to the St. Louis
Cardinals. He also singled home Young in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   It was his club-leading 14th multi-hit game of the season and
extended his hitting streak to seven games (12 for 28 over that
period). He also has hit in 10 of his last 11 (18 for 45), raising
his average to .308 (41 for 133).
</P>
<P>
   And though he wasn't pleased with his move to left field in
spring training, Sheffield hasn't committed an error in 35 games
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Grudzielanek wakes up: After three days on the bench last week,
Mark Grudzielanek appears to finally be stirring offensively. For
the second consecutive night, Grudzielanek had two hits and his
fourth-inning single scored Raul Mondesi to give the Dodgers a 3-1
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers manager Davey Johnson went with Jose Vizcaino at short
after Grudzielanek opened the season with just two hits in 33
at-bats with runners in scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a slow process, but I think I'm coming out of it,''
Grudzielanek said. ``In Montreal, I worked out of things by
playing. I don't know if taking a couple of days off will really
help.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort to miss start: With an off-day Monday, Johnson expects
to skip fifth starter Darren Dreifort in the rotation. Dreifort,
who had a no decision in last Wednesday's 3-2 victory over Chicago,
has been bothered by a sprained right ankle.
</P>
<P>
   By skipping Dreifort, Kevin Brown will pitch Thursday night
against Houston at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``His leg isn't that serious,'' pitching coach Charlie Hough
said of Dreifort. ``It is more of a precaution.''
</P>
<P>
   Suggestion: Third base coach Rick Dempsey is an old friend of
Angels struggling right-hander Tim Belcher dating back to their
seasons with the Dodgers a decade ago. Dempsey has watched Belcher
struggle this season and called him Saturday morning after Belcher
defeated Tampa Bay on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is still pretty grumpy about the whole thing so I just hung
up,'' Dempsey said. ``I know what he's doing wrong. I keep telling
him, `Show me your number.' He has to turn his body more during his
windup.''

A GREAT TRADE FOR RED SOX 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Pretty good. If the Red Sox can build the new Fenway
they showed us Saturday, it could be their best move since they
bought a beefy, 19-year-old southpaw from the International League
Baltimore Orioles in 1914.
</P>
<P>
   It was with no minor skepticism that I went to Fenway for the
long-awaited unveiling of the Sox' new ballpark model. I am a
person of old cars, old clothes, old houses, and old friends. Like
a lot of New England hardball fans, Fenway Park reminds me of
simpler, better times. For me, sitting in an empty Fenway is like
kneeling in the brick Cambridge church where my father was baptized
in 1914.
</P>
<P>
   Surprise. The Red Sox have thought things through this time.
They have addressed most of the concerns of the fandom. If they can
do what they say they are going to do, they'll be going new _
without going modern.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, there are obvious hurdles. It seems a tad presumptuous for
any private business to announce its intention to build a new
facility on property that currently belongs to other folks. There's
bound to be a steam plant or contaminated soil somewhere on the
proposed site. Guardian-at-the-gate Thomas Finneran is sure to bust
their chops when state-subsidized infrastructure costs are
negotiated. Neighborhood groups and the ``Save Fenway'' zealots no
doubt will be singing songs and carrying signs when the ballclub
attempts to pave paradise and put up a parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   But once you get past the obvious concession that old Fenway
isn't forever, you'll see that this plan looks pretty good. In
fact, it's almost too good to be true. Maybe that's the catch.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox promise there will be no corporate name attached to
the new park. In 1999, this is an incredible giveback to the fans.
Virtually every other new stadium and arena has sold its name to
the highest bidder. I was prepared for Gillette Field or Nike Park.
The Sox have spared us.
</P>
<P>
   Fenway's unique field dimensions are being duplicated in the new
park. This is surprising. For decades we've been lectured about the
unfair game created by Fenway's quirks. It's too friendly to
righthanded hitters and too tough on lefty hurlers. Scarce foul
territory hurts pitchers and the wall is unfair to line drive
hitters. The Sox build teams that can't win on the road. The 1949
Red Sox went 61-16 at home but only 35-42 on the road and lost the
pennant by one game.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Williams last August said, ``When they tear it down, I think
it will be a good thing. I've seen too many great performances get
cut in the heart by a bloop hit someplace. Sometimes, the
configuration of the ballpark just makes it unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   It sounds like Ted will be unhappy that the dimensions are being
duplicated, but general manager Dan Duquette said, ``Our fans
indicated they liked the dimensions of Fenway Park.''
</P>
<P>
   Imagine. Listening to the wishes of the fans.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox also said they plan to build without requesting fans to
buy personal seat licenses. Again, this is rare in professional
sports in 1999. You can be sure Bob Kraft will go the PSL route,
just like every other owner who has demand for his product.
</P>
<P>
   Happily, the proposal even calls for some preservation of the
1912 facility we've come to love. Parts of the Wall and
hand-operated scoreboard will stand forever, as will the original
Fenway main entrance with its tapestried red brick facade featuring
decorative diamonds, mosaics, and keystone arches. You'll be able
to stand in front of the old Fenway and gaze at the new one across
the street.
</P>
<P>
   Lastly, be mindful that the Sox are doing us all a favor by
attemping to build near the present site. The new home plate will
be 206 yards from where Nomar Garciaparra stands in the batter's
box today. This means the new park will be near the Citgo sign,
Kenmore Square, the hospitals, and the colleges. It will not be in
Foxborough, or Auburn Hills, or Landover, Md. It will be downtown
where it belongs.
</P>
<P>
   More good news. The Sox said they may put a ladder on the new
left field wall. They said there will be a red seat to commemorate
where Teddy Ballgame's 502-foot homer would have landed in the new
park. They said they'll give Elizabeth Dooley (every game since
1944) seats to match her box 36A location. They said that Helen
Robinson, switchboard operator since 1941, will take calls in the
new park.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there should be no urgency about the final days of
old Fenway. The Sox plan to play there at least through the 2002
season, which means a minimum of three years to take the kids
inside for one last look. Since this is Boston, home of the Big
Dig, it's possible we can keep going to Fenway for another 10
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox effectively have trained three generations of fans
to be cynical. In this spirit, we submit that maybe they'll bollix
the whole deal, like Kraft in Southie. But Saturday they had all
the right answers.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving Fenway isn't going to be easy for a lot of us, but if
the Sox can do what they say they'll do, it'll be their best move
since they brought Babe Ruth to the old ballpark when the old
ballpark was the new ballpark in 1914.

<P>
   BOSTON _ Fortunately for Leland Hardy, he's a man with six
tongues and no chin.
</P>
<P>
   If it were otherwise, Hardy might not have been on a fancy
Louisiana golf course the last week negotiating Heisman Trophy
winner Ricky Williams's contract with New Orleans Saints capologist
Terry O'Neill. It's more likely he'd be negotiating his own deal
with Don King or Bob Arum to arrange a far more dangerous meeting
for himself with the likes of Lennox Lewis or Evander Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen years ago, Hardy was a recent graduate of the Wharton
School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania who spoke six
languages and was working in General Motors's executive training
program. Like many young men, he also harbored dreams of athletic
glory, and those dreams led him to the world-renowned Kronk Boxing
Club in Detroit, home of Thomas Hearns and Emanuel Steward.
</P>
<P>
   The boxing ring might seem an odd training ground for a future
corporate executive, investment banker, adviser to tennis's
Williams sisters, and eventually chief negotiator for the all-time
leading rusher in college football history, but so it has been for
Hardy, whom Steward remembers as a young man always living in two
worlds. One was the corporate world of designer ties and starched
shirts. The other was the dank, sometimes corrupt world of boxing
reptiles and no shirts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leland was always very business-conscious,'' the Hall of Fame
boxing trainer recalled from his office in Detroit. ``The first
time I met him in 1984 he was a little bitty amateur down at the
Nationals, but he organized a boxer's union and they elected him
president.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardy had only recently entered the ring, having boxed for the
first time while a sophomore at Indiana (Pa.) University on a dare
when a Golden Gloves team from a local prison showed up at the
school's gym. Hardy took on a former offensive lineman in the
heavyweight fight and, as he remembers it, ``I was shoe-shining the
guy, moving, jabbing. I'd never put on gloves, but I looked
spectacular that night. That's how I caught the bug.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon he was the Pennsylvania state amateur champion and on his
way to the Nationals, where he met future world champion Frank
Tate. Both were unhappy with the conditions the amateurs faced and
decided to form their short-lived union. Steward agreed to help and
Hardy never forgot it.
</P>
<P>
   After taking two years off to complete his graduate studies at
the Wharton School, Hardy ended up in Detroit, fighting for Kronk
and investigating overseas manufacturing facilities for General
Motors. It was the start of two roads that led him to Ricky
Williams and an agent's life.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were really only three months when I was a full-time
boxer,'' Hardy recalled. ``That was after I left Emanuel and went
to fight for Ray Leonard's boxing team. Other than that, I was
always a student or working in business.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon after Hardy left Leonard, he headed for New York to strike
out on his own, working for the investment banking firm Bear,
Stearns and fighting what New York boxing-scene fixture Johnny Bos
recalled as ``one of the greatest fights in the history of the Felt
Forum.''
</P>
<P>
   It was March 30, 1989, and Hardy was in with a tough kid named
Ike Padilla. Hardy was coming off a first-round knockout loss at
the hands of Eddie Cruz and was 1-2-1, with both defeats coming by
KO. This did not bode well for him against Padilla, a Bronx
heavyweight who was 3-0 with three knockouts. But some nights are
magic. Now let Bos tell the rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were five knockdowns in three rounds,'' said Bos, the
excitement rising in his voice. ``Ike's down. Ike's up and Hardy's
down. Hardy's up and Ike's down. They didn't have such good chins,
but they were there to fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leland ends up stopping Padilla in the third and he got two
more good knockouts after that. Then things didn't go so good for
him. It was always feast or famine with Leland in boxing, but he
was an exciting fighter. If he had a decent manager with some
originality, he might have been built into an attraction. You've
got to hope he does a better job managing Ricky Williams's career
then he did managing his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seriously though, Leland's a bright guy. When I heard he was
off representing athletes, I wasn't surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither was Hardy after he was stopped by Pete Wabuda and Lusran
Taramov in back-to-back fights in 1990 that dropped his official
record to 4-4-1. The Taramov fight was his last, a fourth-round TKO
in Japan that convinced him the corporate world was the place for a
200-pound heavyweight with dynamite in his hands but china in his
chin.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there are days when Hardy forgets that those four losses
were all by knockout and remembers only his four professional wins,
which all came by KO as well. He recalls them because that's what
he's still seeking  &UR; today &LR; : a spectacular victory for his latest
creation, a sports agency for Master P, the rapper who is backing
him with funding from his highly successful No Limits recording
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went as far as I could as a fighter,'' Hardy recalled. ``I
took two years off to go to the Wharton School but right after I
got out I went back to boxing. Fourth of July, 1986. I gave myself
a shot and managed my own affairs but eventually I knew it was time
to move on and here we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Move he has, to corporate America. Now he is trying to meld
together two other diverse endeavors _ hip-hop music and the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody gave me a shot to be an agent,'' Hardy said. ``I always
felt it would take an alignment between sports and the hip-hop
culture to get my chance. I tried it with Puff Daddy and LL Cool J
but they never quite understood the power of their medium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, with Master P, we have six NBA players and Ricky and we
just signed Laron Profit from Maryland. He's our first client who
didn't come from another agency, and we believe he'll be a No. 1
NBA pick. We're moving now.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardy understands from both his athletic background and his
business sense that it's the heavyweights who generate the big
capital, and Williams is as much a heavyweight as anyone coming
into the NFL in recent years. Saints coach Mike Ditka risked his
future on Williams when he traded his entire draft this year and
the heart of it next year to get him.
</P>
<P>
   Because of that, there's No Limit to what this contract will
mean to the Saints, to Williams, and to Hardy, a heavyweight who
was always willing to take big risks for the shot to land a
knockout punch.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's important for us is the structure we build around
Ricky,'' Hardy said. ``If we do all the right things, who knows
where it could lead? Isn't this what every retired fighter is
supposed to be doing?''
</P>
<P>
   Only if they have his kind of chin _ and his kind of head for
business, too.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Football fans can often be ``out there,'' and Patriot fans
historically have gone farther out than most, but few have taken
their loyalty as far out as Dan Barry plans to. Barry is an
astronaut from South Hadley who will be aboard the space shuttle
Discovery later this month. Each astronaut is allowed to take a
personal item into space, and Barry called the Patriots recently to
ask if he could take a team banner on his flight. The launch is
scheduled for May 27 . . . The NFL Management Council has decided
to give the Indianapolis Colts a break. After the death of
third-round choice Brandon Burlsworth in a car accident the week
after the draft, Indianapolis will not have its rookie pool figure
lowered by the value of that slot. This was not the case a year ago
when the Oakland Raiders lost second-round choice Leon Bender,
because he had signed a contract before his death . . . The death
of former Dallas Cowboys tackle Mark Tuinei from heroin and a
stimulant known as Ecstasy brought back to mind something Patriots
assistant coach Dante Scarnecchia has often said to his players:
``There's a game of football and a game of life, and to be
successful you've got to win at both of them.'' Somebody should
have reminded Tuinei that his life didn't end when his football
career did after the 1997 season . . . Patriots safety Chris Carter
has not attended any of the offseason conditioning workouts in
Foxborough because he's back at the University of Texas working on
a medical degree. That's a better use of his time . . . Kansas City
Chiefs tackle Glenn Parker spent a week as an intern at the Robert
Mondavi winery in Napa, Calif. Parker, who developed an interest in
wines while growing up in California and had it rekindled by some
French-Canadian hockey players he got to know while playing in
Buffalo, spent part of the week tasting 40-50 wines. ``I learned to
spit,'' Parker said. ``I can tell you, drinking is much better than
tasting.'' Parker got the internship through the league's
continuing education program, which has placed more than 300
players in internships this offseason and seen another 100 return
to school to finish their undergraduate degrees or pursue graduate
ones . . . Children are always trying to come up with something
unusual for Mother's Day, but Patriots quarterback Drew Bledsoe and
his brother, Colorado University quarterback Adam Bledsoe, went
over the top this year. They gave their mother laser eye surgery.
The idea was Adam's. The bill went to Drew. Fair enough.

   The Chiefs' signing of 42-year-old Warren Moon as backup to
Elvis Grbac already has Kansas City newspapers speculating on a
quarterback controversy. Moon only added to it when he said at a
press conference to announce his arrival in Kansas City that, ``I
know that Elvis Grbac is the man. Quarterback controversies only
come when one guy doesn't do well and the other guy does well. I'm
very confident he's going to play well. If that doesn't happen,
then that's where I step in.'' Sounds to me like a controversy
that's about two losses away from happening . . . Longtime league
officials remain mystified that University of Miami running back
Edgerrin James has yet to hire an agent to represent him in
negotiations with the Colts. James, surprisingly, was the fourth
player, and first running back, taken in last month's draft but is
the only first-rounder without an agent. Ed German, James's
half-brother and a medical student, is ostensibly in charge of
negotiations and has hired former Florida state attorney Tyrone
Williams and federal lobbyist Pierre Rutledge as advisers. Neither
is certified by the NFL Players' Association to represent players,
so someone else is likely to be hired, at least as a figurehead.
``This guy's interviewed about 100 agents,'' an agent said. ``He
seems to want people to work for him for free. That's not work.
That's charity.'' German wants an agent to accept a fee of $50,000
or less to negotiate a multimillion-dollar contract. Considering
that the league slots draftees and the teams basically divide their
rookie salary pool in a way that gives the bulk of it to the No. 1
choice, James's value is already well-established. Based on that,
I'll do the deal for him for $40,000 . . . Some guys will do
anything to get something for nothing. The laser eye surgery
performed on Colts running back Keith Elias was carried live on the
Internet at ahn.com. last week. The one-hour procedure, an
alternative to wearing contacts or prescription goggles, corrects
nearsightedness, farsightedness, and astigmatisms . . . Here are
two early leaders for the 1999 Rookie All-Name Team that headline
writers will be rooting for: Sirr Parker, a running back out of
Texas A&AMP;M whom the Chargers plan to convert to wide receiver, and
Geoff Noisy, a wide receiver who signed with the Bengals.

GALAXY LOSES IN SHOOTOUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM BARRERO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA -- Patience is the buzz word lately when it comes to
the Galaxy under new coach Sigi Schmid.
</P>
<P>
   But that served little solace Saturday night as Los Angeles
suffered its most bitter defeat of the young season.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a season-high 20 shots, the Galaxy couldn't make any of
them count in a 1-0 shootout loss to the Tampa Bay Mutiny at the
Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of 11,378 -- which whistled and bristled at every wasted
scoring chance in the final minutes -- watched Tampa Bay outscore
Los Angeles, 4-2, in the shootout as the Mutiny stole a point and
kept the Galaxy from earning a precious three that looked like such
a sure thing early in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Musa Shannon's shootout goal was the difference for the Mutiny
after the Galaxy's Ezra Hendrickson sent a low right-footer that
goalkeeper Scott Garlick got a piece of before glancing off the
left post to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know about everyone else, but I've reached that
point,'' said Galaxy goalkeeper Kevin Hartman, referring to not
being satisfied with simply creating scoring chances. ``I don't
think anyone is in dispute that we're creating chances, but that
isn't enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``People just have to step up and put the ball into the net.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the 20 shots were numerous near misses, including two
headers on goal by midfielder Maurico Cienfuegos, a shot off the
cross bar by Joe Franchino and a chance from 10 yards out that
Welton fired directly at Garlick three minutes into the game.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Galaxy -- the same way it did in a 2-1 loss at Kansas
City a week ago -- dominated the flow of the game and appeared much
more cohesive than at any time this season.
</P>
<P>
   Cienfuegos, for one, seemed to flash much of the form of last
year when Los Angeles set MLS scoring records and humiliated
opponents with its potent offense.
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, the Galaxy also made Tampa Bay midfielder Carlos
Valderrama a non-factor as wave after wave of offense made its way
upfield.
</P>
<P>
   Galaxy defender Steve Jolley was one who was able to find plenty
of positives in terms of looking ahead to what appears to be coming
for the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds funny, but for the first time all year, I felt like
we were clicking on all cylinders,'' Jolley said. ``When this thing
(scoring drought) blows over, we're going to start thrashing teams
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't dominated a team like that in a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be true, but the Galaxy's scoring funk allowed Tampa
Bay to leave Los Angeles with its first win ever after four losses.
</P>
<P>
   But Schmid said he sees the team coming along.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like I've said before, you gotta give us at least 10 games,''
Schmid said. ``Today we played better than we did last week. ...
Sometimes in soccer, it just doesn't go in for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Hartman, the few times he was challenged, made sure of that from
a defensive standpoint.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy keeper was brilliant, stopping Shannon on a
point-blank chance in the second half and tipping away first-half
blasts by Jefferson Gottardi and Mauricio Ramos.
</P>
<P>
   In the shootout, Cobi Jones and Clint Mathis matched Tampa Bay's
Pete Marino and Jorge Salcedo for a 2-2 tie.
</P>
<P>
   R.T. Moore put the Mutiny ahead with a left-footer that bounced
under a diving Hartman. Then came the key break for Tampa Bay, when
Cienfuegos fired one directly at Garlick, setting the stage for
Shannon's game-winner.

DUVAL-WOODS MATCH A TV SHOW WITHOUT DRAMA 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM McCABE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ David Duval and Tiger Woods will go head-to-head Aug. 2
in a made-for-TV prime-time event. The winner gets $1.1 million,
the loser $400,000. Wow. Have a little plastic excitement with your
graphite and titanium.
</P>
<P>
   The folks at IMG and ABC have themselves a sure-fire ratings
hit, or so they think, but what they don't have is an event with
merit. It will make Duval richer. It will make Woods richer. It
will make the game poorer. It's nothing more than ``Shell's
Wonderful World of Golf,'' but at least those folks had the decency
to promote their show as an exhibition between intriguing
personalities with some sort of exotic golf course as backdrop.
</P>
<P>
   The people behind Duval-Woods, though they deny it is their
intention, are selling a ``once and for all'' match-race concept, a
la Ruffian vs. Foolish Pleasure, because by now everyone has heard
the tired debate about which player should be ranked No. 1. Woods
was there for a long time but Duval overtook him after a torrid
stretch of golf.
</P>
<P>
   Head-to-head battles between the game's best players are what we
look for each week but rarely witness. That is because they must
happen spontaneously; they cannot be invented. We would all love to
see Duval and Woods shoot it out, but in the US Open, or the
British Open, or the PGA, or any of those Buick events, for that
matter, just so long as there is some legitimate pressure and
competition thrown into the mix. This Aug. 2 proposal makes the
Senior Skins game feel like a Ryder Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Every once in a while, the golf gods smile on us and present a
gift: Snead-Hogan at Augusta National, Palmer-Hogan-Nicklaus at
Cherry Hill, Nicklaus-Miller-Weiskopf at the '75 Masters,
Watson-Nicklaus at Turnberry in '77. All of them classic
confrontations, none of them staged out of greed.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if they want to add a little spice, how about this? The
loser has to agree to play the Greater Milwaukee Open, John Deere
Classic, and B.C. Open in each of the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pressure? What pressure? All Justin Thompson had to do was eagle
the par-5 18th at Sterling CC to give his team a victory in the
recent New England Division 1 college championships. No problem.
``He hit driver, 3-wood, and holed out a sand wedge,'' said
University of Rhode Island golf coach Tom Drennan, still a bit numb
after the dramatic victory. It enabled the Rams to edge Connecticut
by one shot and run their mark to 253-0 against New England
competition since April 1997. The dramatic eagle also vaulted
Thompson into a playoff with Yale's Eddie Brockner, which the URI
sophomore won on the fifth hole. URI is host team for this week's
NCAA East Regional championships at Rhode Island CC in Barrington,
and the 23-team field includes such powers as Georgia Tech (Matt
Kuchar you know, but teammate Bryce Molder may be better), Florida
(with Steve Scott), and Clemson (John Engler and Jonathan Byrd are
ranked nationally in the top five). URI, UConn, and Yale are the
New England representatives, and while he concedes his team is an
underdog to get one of the top 11 spots into the national event,
Drennan says, ``We have realistic expectations going in. I wouldn't
predict, but these guys surprise me all the time.'' Three
Massachusetts products _ Jim Salinetti from Stockbridge, Josh
Hillman from Greenfield, and Joey Pohle of Williamstown _ are at
the heart of Drennan's club . . . One team that won't be at Rhode
Island CC is the University of Virginia, which means no homecoming
of sorts for James Driscoll, the two-time Massachusetts Amateur
champion. Driscoll, a junior, ``was a little off this spring,''
said Virginia coach Mike Moraghan. ``He had two Top 10 finishes and
always had one or two good rounds, but never really put it all
together.'' . . . Wake Forest did not make the field, either, but
senior Michael Capone of Cranston, R.I., did earn an individual
spot.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In his tribute to Gene Sarazen Wednesday, Arnold Palmer raised a
good point: ``They probably should have just called it the Sarazen
wedge.'' Sarazen, of course, invented the sand wedge back around
1931. He got the idea, of all things, from an airplane ride with
his friend Howard Hughes. Sarazen spent many summers in Lake
Sunapee, N.H., though he lived most of his final years in Marco
Island, Fla., where two of his closest friends were Ken Venturi and
Pat Bradley . . . It was also a sad week for Ben Crenshaw, whose
father died after a long fight with thyroid cancer. Charlie
Crenshaw accompanied his son to The Country Club in 1968 for the US
Junior Amateur, Ben's first competition outside of Texas, which is
another reason why the place will hold special meaning for the US
Ryder Cup captain come September. In March, the Francis Ouimet
Scholarship Fund announced a $50,000 scholarship in Charlie
Crenshaw's name, and when he told his father the news, ``you
wouldn't believe how happy that made him,'' said Ben . . . It
appears as if Mark Calcavecchia has a partner for the JCPenney
Classic: Danielle Ammaccapane. The LPGA Tour veteran criticized
Karrie Webb, Annika Sorenstam, and Se Ri Pak for lacking
personality and not doing more to promote the Tour. Webb and
Sorenstam were offended, and rightfully so, because it's absurd to
think they should try to be what Nancy Lopez used to be. The LPGA
Tour may have problems, but Webb and Sorenstam certainly aren't
among them. Ammaccapane, meanwhile, should take a lesson from
Calcavecchia, whose ill-advised comments at the Masters (he said
that Palmer should stop playing in the event) touched off a barrage
of criticism. A Palmer spokesman said Calcavecchia had sent a
letter of apology, though he did not say what the letter said. ``I
took some heat for my dumb remarks, mostly from my wife, Sheryl,''
Calcavecchia told Golf World . . . The weather is getting warmer,
so perhaps there's no need for chicken soup. But with Father's Day
approaching, you may want to think about ``Chicken Soup for the
Golfer's Soul,'' a delightful compilation of 101 stories that has
just hit bookstores. More than 4,000 stories were submitted, said
Mark Donnelly, who with his wife, Chrissy, had the tough task of
narrowing them to 200. A panel of 40 then pared the list to 101.
Why golf for the latest in the `Chicken Soup' series? ``Most of the
lessons we need in life we learn on the golf course. Golf is
something people need,'' said Mark, an avid golfer (as is his
wife). ``In this fast-paced world, isn't it interesting that such a
slow-paced sport is our favorite?''

CHARISMATIC EARNS SHOT AT CROWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ And now the improbable of all thoroughbred
improbables _ a claiming horse winning the Triple Crown. It's
possible, if not likely. Secretariat just may be tossing in his
grave.
</P>
<P>
   Charismatic, unloved, unrespected, and unbelievable, Saturday
swooped where no horse at Pimlico Race Course has swooped in the
last few days, on the far outside of a track that has had an
extreme inside bias, and easily, comfortably, and convincingly won
the 124th Preakness before a record crowd of 100,311.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is on to Belmont Park for Charismatic and a shot to win
the Triple Crown, something no colt has accomplished since Affirmed
in 1978. It's the third straight year a 3-year-old has a chance to
do it: Real Quiet missed by a nose last year and Silver Charm
failed by less than a length in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-eight horses have won the first two jewels of the Triple
Crown, but only 11 have been up to American racing's greatest
challenge. And D. Wayne Lukas, Charismatic's trainer, has felt for
weeks that it would be the Belmont Stakes where Charismatic would
run his best.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told (owners) Bob and Beverly Lewis before the Derby, back
in March, that I didn't know about the Derby and I didn't know
about the Preakness, but that I'm looking forward to the Belmont,''
said Lukas. ``It's his style of running. Now the monkey is really
on my back. I said we've got a Belmont horse and now we've got to
prove it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dismissed at 31-1 in Louisville, ignored at 8-1 Saturday,
Charismatic now will be certain to go off as the favorite in three
weeks at New York. A truly amazing tale for a horse who twice was
entered in claiming races _ racing's blue-collar basement _ and now
is only a mile and a half from greatness.
</P>
<P>
   Not since 1953, when Dark Star upset Native Dancer, one of the
great horses of the century, has a Kentucky Derby winner gone off
at such high odds in the Preakness. Dark Star was 11-1 in the
Preakness (won by Native Dancer); Charismatic's 8-1 odds were the
second highest for a Derby winner in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Lukas had slipped out of the spotlight, which
he so loves, as trainer Bob Baffert garnered media attention
everywhere. But now he's back in the limelight, having won the
Derby, Preakness, and Belmont 12 times ``except, I've never won all
three with the same horse,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When Lukas walked onto the Preakness track with Charismatic
prior to the race, he told jockey Chris Antley: ``He's as ready as
human hands can make him.'' And when the race was done, Charismatic
home by a most comfortable 1 1/2 lengths, Lukas pointed to the
watch on his arm and told the tale of how he had bought it 14 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   It's a Triple Crown watch and each of the hour hands has the
silks of the 11 previous winners, said the trainer. ``But there are
no silks for 12 o'clock high,'' said Lukas. ``I just want to see
the green-and-white colors (of Charismatic) for 12 o'clock high.''
</P>
<P>
   Charismatic paid 18.80 to win as he easily disposed of Menifee,
the 2-1 favorite, completing a generous perfecta of $47.60 for the
same finish as the Derby. Badge, a 58-1 outsider almost caught
Menifee for place, completing a $2,049 trifecta.
</P>
<P>
   The two most disappointing horses in the race were Godolphin
Stable's Worldly Manner, which was able to reach fourth on the far
turn but retreated to finish 35 lengths back, and the filly
Excellent Meeting. Her trainer, Baffert, had talked her up all week
but she was pulled up in distress with breathing problems before
the final turn and was walked off the track.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I might have pulled the trigger too soon,'' said Pat
Day, the jockey on Menifee, ``and then in the far turn I got in a
little tight and lost my position briefly.'' And, in his most
significant words, Day added, ``We got near the winner but we
couldn't make up any ground in the last 16th.''
</P>
<P>
   For sure, Charismatic would have no worries from Menifee at
Belmont and, of the horses he trounced Saturday, only Badge and
Stephen Got Even seem to be threats. As usual, though, there are
any number of newcomers, as many as 12 new steeds, who are
considering Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not that Charismatic won the Preakness that was
impressive, it was the way he won it. It had been next to
impossible to be on the outside of the Pimlico track for days, as
the horse closest to the rail benefited in race after race. And as
the early races Saturday at Pimlico were run, friends came to Lukas
and alerted him.
</P>
<P>
   But if the inside were the place to be, ``We weren't going to be
there,'' said Lukas. He could not change his horse's style now and
he wasn't going to tell Antley to ride any differently. ``We were
going to have to close from the outside,'' said Lukas. ``In
basketball, if you press, then when you get to a big game, you
press. In football, if you run off tackle, then you run off
tackle.''
</P>
<P>
   Charismatic pressed, Charismatic ran, and Charismatic now can
claim greatness after nobody claimed him for $62,500.

NEAR DISASTER AT PIMLICO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ A tragedy was narrowly averted Saturday at Pimlico
Race Course when a man stepped onto the track during the seventh
race as eight horses bore down on him an eighth of a mile from the
finish of the $200,000 Maryland Breeders Cup Sprint. Jockeys
maneuvered their horses to avoid the man.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I turned for home, I couldn't believe my eyes,'' said
jockey Jerry Bailey, whose Yes It's True was leading at the time
and eventually won the race. ``I thought I saw a man standing on
the track. And, as I got closer, I realized it was.''
</P>
<P>
   The man had climbed an 8-foot wire fence in the infield, veered
across the turf course, and made it onto the main track, slightly
inside the eighth pole. He was standing on the track for at least
15 seconds as the horses charged out of the final turn and headed
for the finish line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been in the middle of anything like that,'' said
Pat Day, the jockey on The Trader's Echo. It was a comment echoed
by other jockeys.
</P>
<P>
   D. Wayne Lukas, the trainer of Yes It's True, said ``that's why
those guys (jockeys) are so great. They didn't panic.''
</P>
<P>
   Security officers quickly apprehended the man, with one officer
throwing him to the ground and putting his face into the dirt. He
was taken into custody. Police identified him as a 23-year-old male
and said he has been taken to a local psychiatric facility.
</P>
<P>
   Artax, the overwhelming 4-5 favorite was bearing directly down
on the man until the last instant, when Jorge Chavez swerved to the
inside and the man took a small step to the outside. A shaken
Chavez said the man ``hit me on my (right) leg'' as Artax swooped
by. Actually, the man threw a handful of dirt that missed Artax and
hit Greenspring Willie, compromising his chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody could have been killed,'' said Chavez. ``(The man)
could have been killed, my horse could have broke down, anything
could have happened. It was very dangerous out there for the horses
and jockeys and everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pimlico stewards studied the videotapes over and over and
determined the man had thrown a fistful of dirt at Artax and
impeded him. The stewards, after much discussion, declared Artax a
non-starter and hundreds of thousands of dollars were returned to
bettors who had backed Artax.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez was among several jockeys who said Pimlico should have
had security guards along the infield fence, behind which were as
many as 50,000 fans. Pimlico CEO Joe DeFrancis said the track had
more than 1,000 Baltimore police officers, National Guardsmen, and
other security personnel ``and there's nothing you can do if a
suicidal person'' is determined to get on the track.
</P>
<P>
   The most famous such incident in the United States came at
Suffolk Downs July 4, 1966, when Ted Luppino, a mental patient,
jumped into the path of Happy Voter and Taunton as the horses
galloped to the wire of the Mayflower Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   The horses pinwheeled the man, who was not hurt.

MENIFEE BACK FOR SECONDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ No respect. Charismatic just doesn't get any respect
at all.
</P>
<P>
   For some reason, finishing second in the Kentucky Derby makes a
horse more popular than winning it. Saturday marked the third
consecutive Preakness that the Derby runner-up was favored over the
Derby winner, and the third consecutive time the Derby winner won.
</P>
<P>
   But Saturday marked the largest gap in the odds as Derby
runner-up Menifee was 2-1, and winner Charismatic was 8-1.
Charismatic won easily Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Now Charismatic, who has been haunted by the ghost of being a
former claimer, will get some respect. And the Menifee camp is left
to ponder the dilemma of being second best.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to run through a seam, and I couldn't get through,''
said Pat Day, who was aboard Menifee. ``I had to back out and make
another run. He made a nice run through the stretch, but we didn't
close any ground on the winner. My congratulations go out to the
winning team.''
</P>
<P>
   Menifee is a handsome animal and he worked well at Churchill
Downs prior to shipping to Pimlico. His trainer, Elliott Walden,
exuded a quiet confidence that the media picked up on, and Menifee
became the horse to beat. The favorite did run well, but he was no
match for Charismatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charismatic just handed us a beating,'' said Walden. ``I
really can't make any excuses, although Pat said he thought he had
to sit a little longer around the turn than he would have liked.
There was a hole he was trying to get to, but it just closed up.
Charismatic ran a great race. Menifee really ran his heart out, but
we just got beat. It hurts to be second again, but not as bad as if
we had lost only by a head. The pace was really quick in there and
I think, after the last two days, a lot of the riders were thinking
that they needed to be on the rail, the way the speed has been
holding up. It's very possible that a lot of the riders overgauged
the track.''
</P>
<P>
   Walden also trained Victory Gallop, who gained a measure of
revenge over Real Quiet last year when he denied him the Triple
Crown by catching him at the wire to take the Belmont Stakes by a
nose. However, Walden isn't sure he wants Menifee to take a third
swing at Charismatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as my plans, it would look kind of funny if I didn't
run in the Belmont, because Real Quiet beat us pretty good here
last year. But the winner today won with a little more authority
than I really like to see my horse get beat with.''
</P>
<P>
   Charismatic didn't get enough respect in Baltimore, and,
perhaps, trainer Bob Baffert got too much. Baffert trained both
Silver Charm and Real Quiet, but this Triple Crown season has been
a disaster for him. All three of his entries ran out of the money
in the Derby, and Saturday his filly, Excellent Meeting, pulled up
at the three-eighths pole, suffering from a breathing problem.
Excellent Meeting took a pounding while running fifth in the Derby,
and several of Baffert's opponents mentioned they thought two weeks
was to soon to run a filly who had been in such a rough race.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time I got halfway down the backside, she had just
fallen out of the bridle,'' said Kent Desormeaux, who rode
Excellent Meeting. ``She was out of the picture, and had no hope.
At the three-eighths pole, I backed off her, and tried to save her
as best I could.''
</P>
<P>
   Baffert, whose reputation has recently taken a beating, was left
to explain what happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she has equine asthma,'' he said. ``Kent said he had
no horse going down the backstretch. I think when he snatched her
up on the first turn, he might have displaced her palate. She's
fine at the barn. She was doing too good to come into the race and
run the way she did. Now, we'll just have to regroup.''

COURSE CORRECTION BY COMMITTEE 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The ongoing atrocities perpetrated on the NBA viewing
public this season have not gone unnoticed by those who move and
shake the league. (How could they?) Changes are in order.
</P>
<P>
   A special committee consisting of commissioner David Stern, his
deputy, Russ Granik, his generalissimo, Rod Thorn, and several
influential owners will meet during the playoffs and throughout the
summer to recommend potentially sweeping changes. The game you see
next season may look a lot different. As they say in Besancon,
where Bruce Bowen did have a jump shot, vive la difference!
</P>
<P>
   While nothing specific has been recommended, or even debated,
look for the following issues to be addressed.
</P>
<P>
   --Defenses: The NBA may finally be willing to give the zone a
chance. No one can figure out the illegal defense rules anyway, and
simply allowing any and all forms of defense would be a challenge
to coaches everywhere. But the main impetus is this: The easiest,
most effective way to beat a zone is to advance the ball and get it
to the basket before the zone can be set up. That's one theory,
anyway. However, the prospect of Shaquille O'Neal lurking in the
lane would militate against a lot of drives and slashes and force
teams to take outside shots. That's not all that different from the
way it is now.
</P>
<P>
   --The shot clock: There are a number of ways to wiggle this one,
ranging from reducing the time to not resetting it after certain
plays.
</P>
<P>
   --The lane: One obvious issue is already on the books, the
three-second violation. Referees will be told to enforce it. They
did it with the hand check and the players got the message. The
same could be true for this one. (Then again, they could also
enforce palming, but that might make games last longer than the
director's cut of ``Doctor Zhivago.'') The lane itself is also up
for discussion. Should they adopt the international lane? Or should
they extend it by a foot on either side?
</P>
<P>
   --Coaching: This is one thing the league can't adjudicate, but
it is almost universally recognized that coaches are responsible
for the dumbing down of the offense. The way the movers and shakers
see it, the players will adjust to any changes. So will the
referees. The goal is to ensure that the coaches are forced to do
it.
</P>
<P>
   The good news here is that there are people who matter who see
what we've seen and are equally mortified. They see a decade-long
decline in scoring, a dilution of talent brought on by expansion,
not-ready-for-prime-time players leaving college too early, and
overzealous coaches determined to extract every last tick out of
the 24-second clock.
</P>
<P>
   The key is that the committee is a relatively small one. The
normal route is for the Competition and Rules Committee to
recommend changes, but that's a 29-member body with a lot of
individual agendas that can make the process unwieldy and, by
extension, uneventful. This committee is smaller and has the
authority to recommend changes and then browbeat the other owners
with ``Easy Dave'' Stern holding the hammer. It is determined to do
just that.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Did anyone else happen to notice that the Celtics averaged more
points a game, shot a higher percentage, and held opponents to
fewer points and a lower field goal percentage while Kenny Anderson
and Antoine Walker were out? We were all trumpeting the Anderson
Factor prior to this season, noting how the team and Walker
benefited from his presence. Well, in the nine games they missed
(counting the Washington game in which Walker was hurt), the
Celtics benefited from their absence (sse chart). So who needs 'em?
We've already mentioned that Rick Pitino should be pushing Anderson
westward to the cap-friendly, point-guard-starved Clippers in
exchange for Lorenzen Wright in a sign-and-trade. Maybe the
Clippers would go for that only if, say, Walker were included for
LA's No. 1 pick and another body. That would enable the Celtics to
draft Steve Francis, Lamar Odom, or whomever and eliminate two big
problems: the big salaries of Anderson and Walker and the obvious
fact that their three best players play two positions . . .
Speaking of soon-to-be NBA point guards, UCLA sophomore Baron Davis
has decided to enter the draft and should be a top five pick.
Ex-Bruin Bill Walton, who still bleeds blue and gold, was horrified
by the decision. ``It's a huge mistake,'' Walton said. ``Here's a
very talented player and a nice young man who hurt his leg and came
back too soon. He struggled at the college level physically and his
team couldn't even beat Detroit Mercy in the NCAA Tournament. And
now he figures he's going to be an NBA star? These young players
get such bad advice. It's sad. It hurts all levels of basketball.
He's obviously got game, but are we talking about one of the very
best players? He's not there yet. He's walking away from the most
important asset that he'll ever have _ the ability to train his
mind at UCLA. If it was another school, like USC or Notre Dame, I
could understand. In that case, he'd be making the right choice.''
. . . As this was being written, Odom and Duke's Corey Meggette
were still fence-straddling regarding entry into the draft. Has
there even been a situation in which the consensus No. 1 waited so
long? A sleeper who's making big strides is high schooler Jonathan
Bender from Picayune, Miss. ``He's got a chance to hit the top
six,'' said Celtics general manager Chris Wallace. Bender is a
6-foot-11-inch, 210-pounder who has committed to Mississippi State,
which, of course, means nothing. Wallace said Bender is not in the
same class as Kevin Garnett or Kobe Bryant but is better than the
recent high schoolers such as Jermaine O'Neal, Al Harris, and
Rashard Lewis. The other high school entrant, Leon Smith of
Chicago, is probably a late first-rounder, Wallace said. ``He's got
a pro body,'' Wallace said of the 6-11, 250-pound Smith . . . The
Celtics not only will lose their first-round pick (unless it's in
the top three), but they also don't have their own second-round
pick, either. They are slated to pick 37th, but the Knicks have
first dibs on that choice courtesy of the Chris Mills deal. If the
Knicks don't want it _ and Wallace thinks New York will take it _
then the Grizzlies can take it thanks to the Tony Massenburg deal.
The Celtics won't go away empty-handed. They have the 55th pick,
from Orlando through Denver, courtesy of the Eric Williams deal.
That ought to keep the suits waiting in breathless anticipation . .
. Hey, Dave Checketts, we know that the Madison Square Garden
tenants aren't exactly championship regulars. But don't you think
four banners for the 1993-94 Rangers is a bit over the top? Can you
imagine if the Celtics did that? (They actually did at one time,
then pulled down all the division and conference banners.) The
1993-94 Rangers have banners for winning the division, conference,
regular season (best record), and, oh yes, the Stanley Cup. The
last one should be sufficient.
</P>

   He says he's not going through withdrawal, but we don't believe
him. For the first time since he arrived in Chicago in 1985, GM
Jerry Krause is a man without a playoff team. And this isn't the
same as, say, Pete Babcock or Jerry Colangelo missing out. The
Bulls not only made it, they stuck around for a while. (In the two
years prior to their first title, they made it to the conference
finals.) ``It's different,'' Krause says. ``But if it was the same
team, and we were having this conversation . . .'' Krause says the
season went about as he expected, which is hard to believe until
you factor in their injuries. Brent Barry, Ron Harper, Mark Bryant,
and Toni Kukoc all missed time, and we saw what they can do when
they're healthy: beat the Celtics. ``We knew it would be rough. But
you do what you have to do and grin and bear it. That's life. We
lost Michael Jordan. He not only was a superstar on the court, but
he was a superstar in the locker room and people don't talk about
that. Guys depended on him in that room.'' Krause said his
rebuilding plan _ he says he has one, but will go no further _ has
not taken a hit with all the re-signings this season. The reason:
He feels that only a certain special player can play the triangle
offense that the Bulls still use and plan to keep using. ``I read
about all these lead guards who we lost,'' Krause said, referring
to Stephon Marbury, though not by name. ``Well, we never had a lead
guard here. We never had anyone dominate the ball unless the whole
thing broke down and we needed Michael in the last 10 seconds. You
have to have a high basketball IQ to play the triple post. Dennis
Rodman had a basketball IQ of about 300. He was unreal. Off the
court, his IQ is for you to debate. But on the court, it's unreal
how quickly he picked it up.'' Many of the ex-Bulls have said their
problems in adjusting to their new teams has been the triangle, or
lack thereof. No one else plays it because it does require patience
and learning. Few teams have the inclination for either . . . The
Suns came back to America West Arena down, 0-2, to the Trail
Blazers and, for the first time since 1985, did not have a playoff
sellout. They weren't alone. The Magic didn't sell out either of
the first two games against the Sixers, the Timberwolves had empty
seats for the first game against the Spurs, and the Pistons
couldn't even draw 15,000 in the 22,000-seat Palace of Auburn Hills
for their first playoff game against the Hawks . . . Suns boss
Colangelo said the year was ``a downer'' and added that his team
was up against it right from the start. ``They changed the rules
and one of our players (Antonio McDyess) was heisted,'' he said.
``Then, we underachieved. We were overmatched by Portland in terms
of athleticism and depth. We have a lot of work to do.'' In
describing the player he wants, Colangelo freely admitted that
McDyess fits the description (young, athletic, powerful). He's
still steamed at the way that went down. He said the team now has a
better feel for Tom Gugliotta ``and what we need around him. We
need to complement him.'' Googs is what he is, and the Suns found
out he cannot defend in the post. Brian Grant bludgeoned him in the
Portland series. Still, Phoenix has a lottery pick (Dallas's,
thanks to the Steve Nash deal) and will send Jason Kidd to Secaucus
for good luck.

RED SOX ARE FIRST-RATE 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-BLUE JAYS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ First place in May isn't listed on anybody's resume.
It almost certainly won't be remembered by John Valentin, who can
be excused if he doesn't recall anything about Saturday's game,
including his decisive two-run double in the Red Sox' 6-5 win over
the mistake-ridden Blue Jays, after twice taking shots to the head.
</P>
<P>
   But for the Sons of Jimy Williams, winners for the eighth time
in nine games, a first-place tie with the Yankees on a Sunday in
May is still infinitely preferable to taking the 10-count before
they've even laced on their gloves.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox' win, coupled with the Yanks' fifth straight loss, drew
the teams even at 20-15 and represented the latest the Sox have
been in first place since the Sons of Kevin Kennedy won the
American League East title in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   It also gives added juice to this week's three-game set against
the Yankees that begins Tuesday in Fenway Park, as if the teams
need anything extra to ensure a full house on Yawkey Way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody picked us to do anything in this division,'' said Mike
Stanley, whose two-run pinch homer in a three-run seventh was
another catalyst to the Sox' first win in 12 games in which they
had trailed after six innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every publication you read already was conceding them the
division title,'' Stanley said. ``They won 125 games last year, and
after adding (Roger) Clemens, everything you read said they're
better, and all they'd have to do is put their gloves out and the
same thing was going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it just doesn't work that way. They're still a
phenomenal team, no matter what they're doing right now. But it
will be important for us to see how we match up, see how we play
against them. It's not a make-or-break series, but it will give you
a good barometer.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentin could have used an icepack after taking a
95-mile-an-hour fastball from Blue Jays righthander Roy Halladay
off the earflap of his batting helmet in the first inning. He
turned at the last moment to avoid what could have been an
unspeakable outcome. ``Oh, he hit me good,'' Valentin said. ``It
had my ears ringing, but luckily it didn't hit me in the head.
That's why I was able to stay in the ballgame, but it was scary.''
</P>
<P>
   Then in the seventh, while beating out an infield topper to
third baseman Tony Fernandez that was generously scored a base hit,
Valentin was clotheslined by Toronto first baseman Carlos Delgado,
who was pulled into Valentin's path by Fernandez's off-line throw.
</P>
<P>
   That shot left Valentin, whose helmet cut into his nose, hunched
over with his eyes watering for a few moments, but again he waved
off trainer Jim Rowe and manager Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to go home,'' Valentin said. ```I quit. This game's
over.'''
</P>
<P>
   Soon enough, it would be. But first, Valentin came around to
score on rookie Brian Daubach's ground-rule double to draw the Sox
within a run, 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   Then after Stanley, pinch hitting for Reggie Jefferson, followed
with a his home run off Blue Jays reliever Dan Plesac in the
seventh to give the Sox a 4-3 lead, Valentin doubled home Darren
Lewis (walk) and Trot Nixon (bunt that was played into a single by
Blue Jays reliever Billy Koch) in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Those runs proved the difference as the Blue Jays scored twice
in the inning off Sox relievers Mark Guthrie and Derek Lowe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it turned out good that I stayed,'' Valentin said.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays used three pitchers _ Halladay (21), Koch (24),
and ex-Sox farmhand Peter Munro (23) _ who were still in diapers
when 36-year-old Sox starter Mark Portugal borrowed his first
lighter. But it was 25-year-old outfielder Shannon Stewart who was
most guilty of being an excitable boy.
</P>
<P>
   With the Jays down a run with two on and their best two hitters,
Shawn Green and Delgado, due to hit against Guthrie in the seventh,
Stewart attempted to steal third while the ball was still in
Guthrie's glove _ and the pitcher was looking right at him.
</P>
<P>
   ``That wasn't a good move,'' said third baseman Valentin, who
was awaiting Stewart's arrival, ball in glove, after Guthrie turned
and tossed it to him. ``Obviously, he thought maybe I was
daydreaming.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart said he noticed how far off the bag Valentin was playing
the lefthanded batting Green.
</P>
<P>
   ``I messed up,'' Stewart said. ``I'll take it like a man. I was
looking at Valentin, and he wasn't paying attention. I didn't look
at the pitcher, but (teammates) told me he was looking right at
me.''
</P>
<P>
   The win went to John Wasdin, who pitched 1 1/3 innings of
scoreless relief and is 2-0 since his return from the minors, but
not before the Blue Jays got a look at Tom Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox closer, tested in his first save opportunity since
coming off the disabled list last Monday, returned to his familiar
point-to-the-sky routine, setting down the Blue Jays in order in
the ninth for his fourth save, first since April 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been playing good ball and getting good pitching,''
Valentin said. ``Now with Flash coming back, we should be stronger
in the bullpen.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there are still two games to be played on this side of the
border before the Bombers arrive. But from Block Island to
Wilbraham, you know what they're thinking over their morning
bagels.
</P>
<P>
   Gentlemen, start your barometers.

PLAYERS WOULD ADD HOMEY TOUCHES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Turnover being what it is in the big leagues these
days, a new ballpark in five years will have little impact on most
of the Red Sox now in uniform. Think about it: John Valentin is the
only player who has been on the current roster that long.
</P>
<P>
   ``New ballpark?'' outfielder Damon Buford said. ``I'll have to
ask Nomar to leave tickets on Sundays.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox were given a videotape preview of the Fenway of the
Future before Saturday's game here with Toronto, a computer
simulation providing details of John Harrington's dream edifice.
</P>
<P>
   And while they may not be around when the place actually opens,
that didn't prevent some suggestions of what they'd like to see
included in the team's new home.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Jimy Williams, for example, endorsed the concept of
incorporating some of Fenway's finest features in the new place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I have the best shower in baseball,'' said Williams,
proving that Jimywocky isn't dead. ``I'll take that shower I got
and put it in the new park. The rest of it, I'll leave up to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've only been here a couple of years. There are other people
in the organization who are more involved. Their opinions are
important. Not mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman Jeff Frye said he'd like to see a swimming pool
in the ballpark. Not one for the fans, like they have in the
bleachers in Arizona. But a lap pool for the players, like the
Texas Rangers have at the Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's at the end of the dugout, about 20 feet wide and 4 1/2
deep,'' Frye said. ``You'd be surprised how useful it is,
especially for rehabbing.
</P>
<P>
   Buford lobbied for a Jacuzzi. Also for therapeutic purposes?
``For whatever,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Jason Varitek would like to see the Sox have a weight
room similar to the gym-sized ones now included in the recently
opened ballparks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The design we saw was beautiful,'' Varitek said. ``A lot like
Fenway. A little different, but with the same quirks.''
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Martinez raised his eyebrows when asked what it would be
like to pitch the first game in the new Fenway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who says I'm pitching the first game?'' Martinez said. ``Five
years from now, who knows where I'll be?''
</P>
<P>
   If the plan really is to keep the same outfield dimensions as
the old ballpark, Martinez obviously wasn't consulted. One's man
charm is another man's aggravation, especially if that man is a
pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't agree with having the same dimensions,'' Martinez
said. ``Three fifteen in the (left-field) corner? Come on.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need a regular park, a normal park. If they're going to
tear that one down, then make it a normal park, a regular park. The
dimensions have got to be like Atlanta or Colorado in the outfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leave Fenway Park there. Let it be a relic.''
</P>
<P>
   Nomar Garciaparra said he likes the ``old-school feeling'' of
the new parks like Camden Yards. ``If they can preserve that,
outstanding,'' Garciaparra said.
</P>
<P>
   ``More seats will mean more fans can enjoy what we're doing,''
Garciaparra said. ``Fenway right now is limited. I'm sure when
we're sold out there are some people who get locked out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will I miss (the old Fenway)? Definitely. But I've always said
what makes Fenway a special place is the fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Old hand Valentin said sure, he'll miss what Hatteberg described
as the ``great lore'' of the old ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   ``But just because a new ballpark is being made, that doesn't
mean there isn't going to be any history in the new place,''
Valentin said. ``They're putting a lot of the old park in the new
place. And there will be more room.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Hatteberg said, that's what it all comes down to.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you go to the new yards,'' he said, ``you realize we just
don't have enough room. It's just an old yard. They did a great job
with what they had, but it was lacking compared to other places.''

QUIRKS WERE WHAT MADE FENWAY 
</HEADLINE>
 PARK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Fenway Park is certainly unlike any other place where
major league baseball is played.
</P>
<P>
   It's the only park with a ladder in fair territory. It's the
only park where a ball can be in play while it's rattling around
the frame of a garage door. It's the only park where the shortstop
has to run to left field in case a ball down the line bounces off
the low fence that juts out from the third base box seats. It's the
only park where a pop fly can be a home run, and a potential line
drive home run can turn into a single. It's the only park where you
can hit a 302-foot homer. It's the only park with the initials of a
former owner and his wife in Morse code on the scoreboard. And it's
the only park with no true upper deck.
</P>
<P>
   The quirks have alternately entertained and tortured Red Sox
fans for most of this century. Old-timers remember Duffy's Cliff, a
grassy embankment in front of a smaller left field wall. The new
wall (finished in 1934) has contributed thousands of memorable
moments, none more painful than Bucky Dent's three-run homer that
killed the Red Sox in the 1978 playoff game and would have been an
out in any other stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always loved Fenway Park,'' Hall of Famer Carl Yastrzemski
said later. ``But that was the one moment when I hated the place.
It was the one moment when the wall got back at us. I still can't
believe it went in the net.''
</P>
<P>
   American League officials in the past have indicated that new
ballparks must have foul lines measuring at least 325 feet, but the
Sox plan to stick with 302 down the right field line and 310 to
left. Saturday they said they were unaware of any restrictions
governing field dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   So there will still be a Green Monster in left and Pesky's Pole
in right (lovable Johnny Pesky claims to have hit eight of his 17
career homers down the right field line at Fenway). And there will
still be less foul territory than any ballpark. The Sox claim some
box seats in the new park will actually be 5 feet closer to home
plate.
</P>
<P>
   They even said they might put a ladder on the new left field
wall. The ladder has been a soure of amusement over the years. It
enables the grounds crew to fetch balls hit into the screen, but
it's tough on left fielders who don't know where to go when a fly
ball ricochets toward center or toward foul territory. A Jim Lemon
ladder shot confused Ted Williams and Jimmy Piersall and led to an
inside-the-park-home run in the 1950s. In '63, Clydesdale slugger
Dick Stuart turned the same trick with a ladder shot that bounced
off the head of Cleveland outfielder Vic Davalillo.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore Orioles players and coaches used to laugh when their
left fielder, Curt Motton, would get lost while a ball rattled
around the doorway in the left-field corner. It's impossible to see
what's happening in the corner from the visitor's dugout and Earl
Weaver would say, ``We thought Curt got lost down there.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Palmer recalled, ``Don Buford had a ball go through his legs
twice in left field. It skipped through once, then he turned
around, and it came off the Wall back through his legs again.''
</P>
<P>
   The Buford trick will be possible in the new Fenway. The new
park is supposed to have similar dimensions and foul territory _
but it's not likely to have garage doors or cliffs in the outfield.
</P>
<P>
   The new park will be laid out with the same compass, which means
the sun will set in the eyes of the right fielder and fans on the
first base side will be hotter on sunny days. And there will still
be right-field bullpens _ always fun for fan interaction and
spectacular, diving-over-the-wall catches.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, it's doubtful that there will be a 20-lane bowling alley
under the new ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   It was the estimable Roger Angell who in 1975 observed that in
Cincinnati, 50,000 fans watched the World Series while in Boston,
35,000 participated in the Fall Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the quirks may not move across the street, but if the
Sox do what they say they're going to do, Boston ball fans should
still be active participants at Red Sox home games.

OVER THE HUMP _ NOW LET'S GET OVER WALL
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Care to rhapsodize about Fenway? I'm ready.
</P>
<P>
   So what do you want? The Dave Kingman home run off Reggie
Cleveland about which there is no verification of a return to
earth? Any one of the 25 vicious Frank Howard line drives _ home
runs in every other park in the world, from the Tokyo Dome to
Yellowstone _ that smashed into the wall and became singles? The
time Curt Motton chased the ball around in the left field doorway
as men ran madly around the bases? The altitudinous fly balls to
left-center that would have been outs anywhere else but wound up as
stand-up triples? The balls that roll around the fence in right,
sometimes going for inside-the-parkers?
</P>
<P>
   I have never seen a ball hit the ladder attached to the
scoreboard, but people say it's happened. I've seen speedy men
thrown out at home trying to score from second on a single that
wasn't hit all that sharply because Yaz was playing so shallow. And
how can I think about the wall and not think about Yaz, and vice
versa? The nights when the wind was blowing out and a 12-5 led in
the seventh wasn't safe. The night in '75 when the wind was blowing
in and a Lee May smash to left that appeared headed for the Kansas
City room at the Hilltop barely made the warning track (I know
Gammons remembers this one).
</P>
<P>
   The ballpark has intimacy, and, of course, it should, since it
was built at the time the Titanic sank and in those days there was
no other way to go. Of course, it's not the same ballpark it was
when the grand ship went one-on-one with the iceberg, and let no
one pretend it is. Fenway as we know it is a mere 65 years old. Tom
Yawkey remade it to his liking as soon as he bought the team.
</P>
<P>
   So if you want to get out the ticket stubs and prove you were
there when Joe Cronin won both ends of a doubleheader with pinch
homers, or the afternoon when the Red Sox rang up a modern-record
29 runs against the St. Louis Browns, or perhaps that even more
amazing day in 1953 when the Sox put up the all-time ``crooked
number,'' as Roger Clemens would say, that being 17 runs in one
inning against the Tigers, that's cool. If you've got the programs
and the scrapbooks and the giant-sized tissue box, that's just
fine. We can have a pleasant chat about Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   I love Fenway, too. But there is nothing contradictory about
loving Fenway and pining for something new and efficient. Put me
down with the progressives. I'm looking forward to sitting in Son
of Fenway, and sooner, rather than later.
</P>
<P>
   I've said it before, and I'll say it again: Fenway Park was
built in 1912 for tiny people born in the 19th century.
Furthermore, it is overrated as a place to see the game. Many
thousands of seats down the first-base line and all the way out to
the bleachers stink. Left field is, by and large, OK, but there are
pole problems everywhere, which the Fenway Preservationist Society
always seems to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I realize I am in an extreme minority here, but one thing I
did not like about the plan unveiled by the Red Sox Saturday was
this business about maintaining the dimensions and, of course, the
left field wall, a.k.a. the Green Monster. It's a monster, all
right. It has more to do than anything else with the Red Sox being
0 for 81 in world championships since World War I. Can't anyone
else see this?
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the wall, the Red Sox have never been able to
construct a balanced team capable of playing equally capable
baseball, home or away. With its current configuration, Fenway
distorts both statistics and, more importantly, perceptions of
reality on behalf of players, managers, and fans. In general terms,
I'm all for asymmetry. To a point. But Fenway is way over the line,
punishing lefthanded power hitters while rewarding the Felix
Mantillas of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Not to sound too uppity, but I thought that intelligent people
had come to this conclusion a long time ago. It really never dawned
on me that anyone charged with constructing a new ballpark in
Boston would be foolish enough to allow gooey fan sentiment to
overrule good judgment until a couple of years ago. That's when I
first heard that any new architectural plan would include retaining
the lovable, but deadly, 37-foot wall.
</P>
<P>
   It is all so typically Boston and, indeed, New England to wallow
in history and become trapped in it, rather than to celebrate
history while keeping it in its proper place. Boston needs a new
ballpark; all reasonable people understand that. What Boston does
not need is to construct a new park that will maintain the heavy
odds against this team ever winning anything. Repeat: Fenway, as
configured, has been an organizational curse.
</P>
<P>
   So give me new. Give me something modern and funky that isn't
Camden Yards, isn't Jacobs Field, isn't The Ballpark, isn't Turner
Field, and isn't Coors Field _ Good Lord, anything but Coors Field.
Give me a ballpark with, oh, a 12- or 15-foot wall in left as a
polite homage to Fenway and fences elsewhere that will allow
fielders to make the ever-popular bring-'em-back-alive leaping
catch Ken Griffey makes look so ridiculously easy. Give me some
ins-and-outs. Give me some modest asymmetry. Give me the retired
numbers and fan-friendly interactive stuff (see Atlanta). Give me
what the FleetCenter refuses to; namely, a thorough reflection of
the team's rich (and tortured) history.
</P>
<P>
   They say we'll be in whatever we're going to get by 2003, and I
say, excuse me, but isn't this Boston? Land acquisition to build in
the desired area will be, shall we say, intriguing (wait 'til the
D'Angelos name the price to surrender their interests).
</P>
<P>
   But whether it's 2003, 2013, or in time for the Yankees on
Tuesday, it can't come soon enough. Fenway is cramped, generally
uncomfortable, and, worst of all, counterproductive if your
ultimate interest is to see the team win. We are in desperate need
of a new park, and I do mean new. Sixty-five fruitless years of
this foolish wall is enough.

<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ A jury here has awarded a Mexican company more
than $624 million after finding Wal-Mart and a Wal-Mart subsidiary
acted with malice when it broke a partnership deal to distribute
groceries throughout Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, jurors will return to court to decide how much
Wal-Mart and its subsidiary should pay in punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   The jury verdict on Friday came after four hours of deliberation
in the case that has been tried in state District Judge Martha
Tanner's court for five weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In an extraordinary telephone call from her chambers Friday
afternoon, Tanner and lawyers for both sides attempted to convince
editors at the San Antonio Express-News not to report on the
verdict until after next week's decision on punitive damages, even
though the verdict was handed down in open court.
</P>
<P>
   Tanner indicated she was concerned that publicity about the
verdict might sway the jurors when they take up the issue of
punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   After Express-News attorney Thomas G. Coghlan discussed the
matter with the judge and the lawyers for both sides, Tanner
decided not to take court action blocking the release of the jury's
verdict. Coghlan said Tanner then issued a gag order forbidding
participants in the case from discussing the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   The action comes six years after Valores Corp. of Monterrey,
Mexico _ Mexico's second-largest wholesale grocery distributor _
filed a breach-of-contract suit accusing Wal-Mart and its
subsidiary McLane Co. Inc. of reneging on a deal to be its partner
in a wholesale grocery distribution operation in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   McLane, based in Temple, Texas, is the nation's largest
wholesale grocery distributor to convenience stores and has annual
sales of more than $8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Valores, owned by Gilberto De Hoyos and Jose Chapa, does much of
its business with mom-and-pop stores and in home delivery.
</P>
<P>
   During the trial, Robson Walton, the chief executive officer of
Wal-Mart and the son and heir of the late Sam Walton, testified
that the Valores deal ``had not been finalized'' even though McLane
issued a news release announcing its new joint venture with
Valores.
</P>
<P>
   The jury found that McLane had in fact agreed to the deal with
Valores but failed to live up to the agreement and breached its
fiduciary duty to Valores.
</P>
<P>
   The panel concluded that Wal-Mart knowingly participated in
McLane's breach, intentionally and willfully interfered with the
McLane-Valores deal and that McLane and Wal-Mart acted with malice.
</P>
<P>
   The damages _ the exact sum Valores had sought _ were based on
future earnings Valores claimed it would have achieved had the
partnership held together for 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   According to Ricardo Cedillo, a lawyer for Valores, the Mexican
firm and McLane agreed on Sept. 9, 1991, to create a 50-50
partnership to be named Chapa-McLane S.A.
</P>
<P>
   McLane was the recognized leader in distribution technologies,
said Valores lawyer Kendall Montgomery of Houston. ``McLane was to
provide the know-how, and Valores was providing the know-who,''
Montgomery said.
</P>
<P>
   McLane issued a news release announcing the joint venture on
Nov. 11, 1991, and by late spring 1992 architectural plans for a
new distribution center in Monterrey were 95 percent complete,
Cedillo said. The groundbreaking was set for July 1, 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The day after the press release went out, Wal-Mart received a
complaint from another major Mexican company, CIFRA, Mexico's
largest retailer.
</P>
<P>
   CIFRA had its own joint venture with Wal-Mart to create a chain
of Sam's Club warehouse stores and CIFRA president Henry Davis
expressed concern about the McLane project to Robson Walton,
according to documents filed in the case.
</P>
<P>
   From that point on, Cedillo argued, Wal-Mart executives were
telling officers at McLane to ``slow the documentation _ don't go
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   In closing arguments, defense attorney Seagal V. Wheatley
portrayed Drayton McLane, McLane's chairman and CEO, as
enthusiastic about the potential of the North American Free Trade
Agreement when he turned his attention to starting a partnership in
Mexico in 1990. McLane owns the Houston Astros baseball team.
</P>
<P>
   But Wheatley claimed that as talks progressed, it became clear
to McLane it would never happen.
</P>
<P>
   Wheatley tried to convince jurors that the deal fell apart for
reasons that had nothing to do with actions by Wal-Mart's CEO.
</P>
<P>
   On June 3, 1992, in what Cedillo referred to as the ``doomsday
meeting,'' Valores was told by Wal-Mart and McLane officials that
the Chapa-McLane venture would not proceed.
</P>
<P>
   That same day, McLane vice president Robert Hudspeth forwarded
to Wal-Mart vice president Harry Johnson an outline of information
developed from the Chapa-McLane project that would be used to
develop a new company called McLane de Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   With the list of Valores' clients and their needs in hand,
McLane de Mexico became a Valores competitor, but the venture
failed within several months, Cedillo said in closing arguments.

advisers are calling the first major policy speech of his campaign
Sunday. The topic of the Iowa address is education, an issue always
near the top of voter concerns. (Mollison, Cox News Service).

   HBCU-FUNDING _ ATLANTA _ While individual contributions to
historically black colleges and universities have been up over the
last decade, they still pale in comparison to the millions given
annually to traditionally white institutions. Perhaps, said William
H. Gray, president and chief executive officer of the United Negro
College Fund, but that's not necessarily a fair comparison. (Byrd,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   ISRAEL-VOTE (Jerusalem) _ In a stunning turn of events, two
minor party candidates withdrew from the prime minister's race on
Sunday, paving the way for what polls predicted what be a
conclusive victory on Monday by Labor Party leader Ehud Barak. By
Deborah Sontag.
</P>
<P>
   ISRAEL-U.S. (Los Angeles) _ The Clinton administration has
maintained a studied public neutrality in the Israeli campaign for

candidate. By James M. Broder.
</P>
<P>
   SAFRICA-POLITICS (Uppington, South Africa) _ If South Africa's
second post-apartheid election campaign has offered any surprise at
all, it is the fuss that the Democratic Party has engendered. The
party and its antecedents, which traditionally represented wealthy,
English-speaking white liberals, consistently opposed apartheid and
were small but nagging irritants to the former white supremacist
Afrikaans-speaking regime. But even the ANC, which is expected to
coast to victory, perhaps with a two- thirds majority, has turned
its guns on the DP. By Suzanne Daley.
</P>
<P>
   IRAN-ARABS (Cairo) _ With his first foray into the Arab world,
Iran's president is taking a crucial step in a process of reaching
out to other countries. It is every bit as significant, but also as
tricky, as the rapprochement he has begun with the West. By Douglas
Jehl.

referendum to grant the country's indigenous population equal
rights.

<P>
   RUSSIA-PENSIONS (Ludony, Russia) _ Russian debts are a funny
business, as big Western banks have learned to their horror and
chagrin. A pensioner here long ago stopped trying to figure out
when she will get her money. As she sees it, retrieving a pension
from the backlog that has piled up at the regional administrative
center of Pskov is sort of like a lottery. Either your number comes

software start-up or a new planeload of Asian tourists, whose
financial troubles continue to keep them away in droves. No, the
biggest fish is David Hasselhoff, the head-lifeguard of
``Baywatch,'' which is to begin filming here in July, rechristened

PROCTER &AMP; GAMBLE JUMPS THAT DOMAIN GUN

<TEXT>
<P>
   Febreze, a new Procter &AMP; Gamble product that neutralizes pet
odor, has been the target of animal rights activists who believe it
is dangerous to pets.
</P>
<P>
   The company is so worried about rumors spread via the Internet,
says Advertising Age, that it has registered the following domains,
to prevent anyone else from using them: febrezekillspets.com;
febrezekillsdogs.com; febrezekillsbirds.com; febrezesucks.com; and
ihateprocterandgamble.com.

<P>
   &UR; MORE ON FINE ART ANALYSIS: THE MONA LISA &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Turning from last week's argument against over-analyzing
paintings, Personals stumbled upon  &UR; Joseph Harriss &LR; ' Smithsonian
magazine essay on &UR; Leonardo DaVinci &LR; 's Mona Lisa.
</P>
<P>
   Harriss presents theories a-plenty: Mona Lisa's closed-mouth
smile, for instance, was thought to be because her teeth had been
blackened by ``16th century style mercury treatment for syphilis
... A Danish doctor found that the model had congenital palsy
affecting the left side of her face, backing up his theory by
pointing out that she had the typically large hands of such
patients. After due study, an orthopedic surgeon in Lyons, France,
decided that Mona Lisa's semi-smile resulted from her being
half-paralyzed either from birth or as the result of a stroke; one
indication of this ... was that her right hand looks relaxed but
her left hand is strangely tense.''
</P>
<P>
   Using a computer, &UR; Lillian Schwartz &LR;  of Lucent Technologies
reversed a self-portrait of Leonardo and juxtaposed it with the
Mona Lisa's face. Noses, mouths, foreheads, cheekbones, eyes and
brows all lined up, leading Schwartz to conclude that the artist
began with a portrait of a woman, who became unavailable in the
midst of his painting, whereupon he used himself _ without his
beard _ as a model.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HE FINAL TALLIES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   - Politically-minded movie fans frustrated by the TV camera's
quick sweep over the audience when  &UR; Elia Kazan  &LR; received his award
at the Oscars, will turn to a definitive analysis of the response,
in Brill's content:  &UR; Warren Beatty &LR; ,  &UR; Meryl Streep &LR; ,
 &UR; Helen Hunt  &LR; and  &UR; Kurt Russell  &LR; were among the nine people giving a
standing ovation;  &UR; Nick Nolte &LR;  and  &UR; Ed Harris &LR;  were shown sitting
silently; two shots showed a mix of standers and sitters, and two
showed  &UR; Steven Spielberg  &LR; and  &UR; Kate Capshaw &LR; , seated and
applauding.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers would have thought the protest was a dud, which was what
many newspapers concluded. Daily Variety's  &UR; Army Archerd &LR;  told
Brill's Content, though, that the shots were misleading, and only a
quarter of the audience had risen for Kazan.
</P>
<P>
   - Members of the restaurant workers union picketed a fundraiser
last week for the writers' group PEN at Cipriani's, a fancy New
York restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   According to reports in the New York Post and Daily News:
 &UR; George Stephanopoulos &LR; ,  &UR; Gay Talese &LR; ,  &UR; Thomas Cahill &LR; ,  &UR; Paul &LR; 
 &UR; Newman &LR; ,  &UR; A.E. Hotchner &LR; ,  &UR; Paul Auster &LR;  and  &UR; Spalding Gray  &LR; refused
to cross the line.

 &UR; Doctorow &LR; ,  &UR; Ben Bradlee &LR; ,  &UR; Alan King &LR; , &UR; Salman Rushdie &LR;  and  &UR; Arthur &LR;

worry about crossing a line'' _ crossed.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FLASH &LR;
</P>
<P>
   -  &UR; Susan  &LR; and  &UR; Gary Woodward &LR; , the parents of  &UR; Louise &LR; 
 &UR; Woodward &LR; , who was convicted of killing a baby in her charge, have
been charged with making an allegedly fraudulent claim on the fund
that was supposed to pay for her legal bills. The Woodwards are now
separated, says the Daily Telegraph, which says that one charge
involved an invoice for accommodation during Louise Woodward's
trial. The couple actually stayed in the home of a friend.
</P>
<P>
   - &UR; Wen Shi &LR; , a research doctor at UCSF, noticed when he visited
the immigration office in San Francisco last week that ``Aliens''
was playing on the waiting room TV.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHO SAID WHAT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``(Her work) is a cross between the floating surrealist &LR; 
 &UR; imagery of Marc Chagall, the biomorphic forms of Paul Klee and &LR; 
 &UR; the light touch of Alexander Calder. ... She's the art world's &LR; 
 &UR; best secret.'' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  - New York curator  &UR; Baird Jones &LR;  on the paintings of

time he was 24, once saw his life unravel in swift and ignoble
steps, a descent that transformed him from hero to cad while he was
still just 25. But if his resume was suddenly crowded with
offensive, unwholesome and disturbing demerits, it did not stop the
Giants from believing there was a better Collins if examined in the
whole. While other NFL teams ignored Collins' availability, the
Giants on Feb. 19 signed the troubled Collins to a four-year,
$16.9-million contract and set about helping him bring order in a

   NEW YORK _ Marvin S. Winter, a Manhattan real estate developer
for more than 50 years, died on Friday at New York University
Hospital in Manhattan. He was 78 and had homes in Manhattan and
Delray Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was heart failure, said his son James, of Rye
Brook, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Winter, whose father, Benjamin, was a prominent real estate
developer in New York City early in the century, was born on Aug.
21, 1920, in Manhattan. He was graduated from Washington and Lee
University in Lexington, Va., in 1941.
</P>
<P>
   After college and service in the Army, Winter entered the family
business and expanded it into the commercial and residential real
estate markets in Chicago, Philadelphia, Miami and other cities.
</P>
<P>
   His holdings in Manhattan included 800 Fifth Avenue, at 61st
Street, a commercial and residential building constructed on the
site of the former Dodge mansion; 730 Fifth Avenue, at 57th Street,
known as the Crown Building, and 210 Central Park South.
</P>
<P>
   Winter was also a founding director of the Community National
Bank of Staten Island, which was later sold to Chemical Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his son James, Winter is survived by his wife, Eleanor;
two other sons, Benjamin of Rye, N.Y., and Douglas of Highland
Park, Ill.; a daughter, Karen Miller of Sudbury, Mass.; two
sisters, Ethel Schanzer and Natalie Ballen, both of Manhattan, and
10 grandchildren.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Geoffrey Wigoder, a broadcaster, scholar and editor of Judaica,
died on April 9 in Jerusalem. He was 76.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a brain hemorrhage after a fall, said Andre Balog,
a friend and colleague.
</P>
<P>
   Wigoder was born in Leeds, England, and earned degrees in
medieval Jewish history at Trinity College, Dublin, and Oxford
University. He also attended the Jewish Theological Seminary in New
York, where he met his future wife, Devorah MacDwyer. The couple
immigrated to Israel in 1949 and settled in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   By the early 1950s Wigoder was overseeing the overseas
operations of Israeli radio, and in the 1960s and '70s he worked as
a correspondent for the British Broadcasting Corp. and The
Yorkshire Post, at one point making daily broadcasts about the
trial of Adolf Eichmann.
</P>
<P>
   He also collaborated with Cecil Roth, a scholar of Judaica at
Oxford and Hebrew University in Jerusalem, on the one-volume New
Standard Jewish Encyclopedia. The two scholars then began work on
what was to become the 16-volume Encyclopedia Judaica. When Roth
died in 1970, Wigoder took over as editor in chief. An updated
version of the entire work was published on a single CD-ROM last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Wigoder's credits also include ``The Encyclopedia of the Jewish
Religion,'' ``Jewish Art and Civilization'' and ``The Story of the
Synagogue.'' His ``Dictionary of the Jewish-Christian Dialogue''
was commissioned by the Paulist Press in New York in 1995. He also
lectured at Hebrew University, where he founded Israel's first oral
history department, and was one of the founders of the Museum of
the Jewish Diaspora in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife; two sons, Meir and Shimshon, both of
Tel Aviv; a sister, Thelma Ruby of London, and two grandchildren.

ROSEMARY VALAIRE, 68, BALLET TEACHER AND DIRECTOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (js) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rosemary Valaire, a ballet teacher and a director of the
Westside Ballet of Santa Monica, Calif., and a former dancer with
the Royal Ballet of England, died on May 7 at her home in Los
Angeles. She was 68.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a brain tumor, said Jim Brunet, director of public
relations at the Westside Ballet.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Valaire, whose original surname was Feuerheerd, joined the
Royal Ballet in 1946 and performed with the company on its first
tour in the United States in 1949. She moved to Los Angeles soon
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967 she began to teach at the Westside School of Ballet in
Santa Monica and became co-director of Westside Ballet with Yvonne
Mounsey, its founder. Ms. Valaire's students included Monique
Meunier and Jock Soto, principal dancers with the New York City
Ballet.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Valaire was also known for reconstructions of ballet
classics. She worked with Mary Skeaping on American Ballet
Theater's 1976 production of ``The Sleeping Beauty,'' which she
also staged for several other companies in the United States and
abroad. Other reconstructions by Ms. Valaire included ``Swan
Lake,'' ``Coppelia'' and ``Les Sylphides.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Valaire's marriage to Stephen Weiss ended in divorce. She is
survived by two daughters, Claudia Petursson of Kirkland, Wash.,
and Alison Tunney of Santa Monica; a son, Andrew Weiss of Los
Angeles; a sister, Patricia Troop of London, and six grandchildren.

phenomenon. Not one of you wrote in! So, we'll do it.

   Top 5 Reasons We Hate Star Wars
</P>
<P>
   1. Mark Hamill's whiny, wooden acting.
</P>
<P>
   2. Carrie Fisher's free-floating British accent.
</P>
<P>
   3. The films' contributions to the dumbing-down of cinema.
</P>
<P>
   4. We're forced to read ``serious'' articles about the religious
implications of The Farce,
</P>
<P>
   uh, we mean The Force.
</P>
<P>
   5. One word: Ewoks!

</P>
<P>
   Queen Amidala's handmaidens are so shrouded in robes that it's
hard to recognize them, but one is played by actress/director Sofia
Coppola, daughter of Francis Ford Coppola, George Lucas' old friend
and colleague.

Disney-cute Gungan, who helps the Jedi knights on their adventure,

you-sa'' gibberish talk is hard to understand.
</P>
<P>
   DARTH MAUL (played by Ray Park) _ He's the coolest character,
although he's on screen less than 10 minutes. He's an evil Sith who
battles the Jedi knights with a two-sided light saber. He's already
the most popular toy from the movie. When you see it, you'll know
why.

 &HT;    `It's only a movie' Right!
 &HT;    By Dave Larsen
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ ``Star Wars'' creator George Lucas said ``The
Phantom Menace'' is ``only a movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Try telling that to the hundreds of people who have spent the
past six weeks camped outside movie theaters in New York and Los
Angeles to be the first to buy tickets for ``Star Wars: Episode I _
The Phantom Menace,'' which opens Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   For those fans and the tens of thousands who lined up last
Wednesday in Dayton and other cities to purchase advance tickets
for the first new ``Star Wars'' film in 16 years _ along with the
45,000 who attended the Star Wars Celebration two weeks ago in
Denver and the estimated 2.2 million people who will take Wednesday
off from work to see the film _ ``The Phantom Menace'' is much more
than a movie.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth installment in Lucas' mythic sci-fi series is a
cultural phenomenon. The highly anticipated first prequel to the
original trilogy is projected to break box office records next
weekend and gross as much as $400 million domestically.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Berger, a University of Dayton senior and president of
the UD Fantasy and Science Fiction Appreciation Club, said Lucas is
trying to be modest and cushion sky-high fan expectations by
putting the heavily hyped film in perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that it's more than just a movie,'' said Berger, 21,
who has seen the original trilogy 15 times. ``It's the breeching
point between the generation that hadn't seen the `Star Wars'
movies on the big screen and the generation that had.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucas expects a backlash, given the stellar anticipation for his
film.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am fully aware that some fans, unfortunately, have got
themselves into a situation, both in the fact that they've gotten
much older and the film is really for young people, and the fact
that they have these amazing expectations about the film, which the
film can't possibly meet,'' he said last week in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The filmmaker is also aware of the so-called ``Star Wars flu.''
The Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that up to 2.2
million people will take off from work Wednesday for the ``The
Phantom Menace's'' premiere, costing companies in the United States
more than $300 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I heard the same thing happened when `Godzilla' came
out, so I don't know what that actually means,'' Lucas said. ``I
think it has more to do with people not wanting to go to work than
just going to the movies. But I'm a little surprised at the amount
of attention the film has gotten. We have actually tried very hard
to not let the film be over-hyped, but it kind of got out of
control and got over-hyped anyway. There's not much you can do
about these things, really.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucas said the enthusiasm of people waiting in lines and
snatching up merchandise is just a spontaneous reaction from fans
who have enjoyed the ``Star Wars'' movies and want to repeat that
enjoyment. The 30 members of the UD sci-fi club all lined up for
opening-day tickets. ``There are some people who've got tickets for
every showing,'' Berger said. ``Like the 10 o'clock, the one
o'clock, the three o'clock, the five o'clock, etc., etc.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Phantom Menace's'' cast members are somewhat taken aback
by the hysteria surrounding the film. Natalie Portman, who plays
Queen Amidala and only saw the original ``Star Wars'' after being
offered the role, thought it was going to be just another big
action movie. ``I thought it was going to be like `Independence
Day' or one of those kinds of things that a lot of people see,''
she said. ``But I didn't realize it was going to be like the event
of the decade that people are calling it now.'' Portman said she
would have been a lot more intimidated and pressured while making
the movie had she known how much hype was going to be created
around it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole culture around it is kind of fascinating and strange
to me,'' said Liam Neeson, who portrays Jedi Knight Qui-Gon Jinn.
``Not because of the quality of the films. It's something in the
psyche in all of us as human beings that we at once recognize these
incredible mythological stories that are fairy tales. And fairy
tales exist because they help to bring a very complex world into an
understandable kind of form that helps us through life. And they
seem to be, these films, successful all over the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The original trilogy _ ``Star Wars'' (1977), ``The Empire
Strikes Back'' (1980) and ``Return of the Jedi'' (1983) _ has
grossed almost $1.8 billion worldwide, including the 1997 reissues.
The first film opened in limited release on 50 screens, topping
``Jaws'' as the all-time box office champ six months into its
yearlong theatrical release.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, ``The Phantom Menace'' will open at 12:01 a.m.
Wednesday on 5,000 screens in 2,950 theaters. Although the film is
opening in fewer locations than ``Godzilla'' (3,310 theaters) or
``The Mummy'' (3,210), industry analysts predict it will break
records for the biggest single day, weekend, five-day and
first-week box office tallies. Currently, ``The Lost World:
Jurassic Park,'' holds those records, with grosses of $26.1
million, $72.1 million, $98.8 million and $104.9 million,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen if Lucas can top the $600 million domestic
gross of the reigning king of the box office, ``Titanic.'' The
director again played down the expectations, saying the film's
chances of beating the original ``Star Wars'' ($460 million) are
slim to none.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even think it will beat `E.T.' ,'' which made $399
million, Lucas said. ``I expect it to be one of the Top 10 grossers
of all time, and if it wasn't, I would probably be very
disappointed. But it's not the end of the world. I think the film
will make its money back even if it wasn't one of the Top 10
grossers.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucas doesn't see it as a contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a movie,'' he said. ``I made it because I enjoy making
the movies. I hope it does well. I really don't have any interest
or desire to be No. 1 or win an Academy Award or count how many
good reviews I get as opposed to how many bad reviews I get. That's
not what it's really all about. It's about the process of making
the movie.

 &HT;    Author fills in details of `Star Wars' saga
 &HT;    By Scott Eyman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ In a cozy house in Flamingo Park in West
Palm Beach, a woman sits applying mortar to the cracks of the Jedi
legend.
</P>
<P>
   For the last year, Jude Watson has been writing a series of
``Star Wars'' novels for young adults, published by
Lucasfilm/Scholastic.
</P>
<P>
   The books carry titles such as ``Jedi Apprentice,'' ``Captive to
Evil'' and ``Amidala Journal.'' ``Jedi Apprentice,'' for example,
is a prequel to the prequel _ Obi Wan Kenobi is 13 years old in
Watson's books, whereas he's about 25 in ``The Phantom Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a great deal of freedom within the parameters,'' says
Watson. ``I can take the characters to any planet, I can give them
any adventures. But essentially the story has to be about a
13-year-old kid coming of age.''
</P>
<P>
   Before she embarked on the series that spins off ``The Phantom
Menace,'' Watson saw the script, which was little help because so
much of the impact of the ``Star Wars'' films is purely visual.
Slightly more helpful were some line drawings of the characters and
costumes.
</P>
<P>
   Still not enough. So she did what a resourceful, desperate
writer is supposed to do _ she got on the Internet, checked out the
official Star Wars Web site and took a look at some stills.
</P>
<P>
   Watson's husband is a curator at the Norton Museum of Art. She
got the ``Star Wars'' job because she's been writing for 14 years,
and has published about 70 books, mostly in the young adult
category, but some historical fiction as well, written under a
variety of pseudonyms.
</P>
<P>
   Watson did a series spinning off the popular TV series ``Saved
by the Bell'' under the name Beth Cruise, chosen by her publishers
because Cruise relates to Tom Cruise, and Beth is a solid ``best
friends'' name.
</P>
<P>
   Watson works for two editors, one at Scholastic, the other at
Lucasfilm. Of the two, the one at Lucasfilm is probably the most
important.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my book, I had Natalie Portman's character (Queen Amidala)
be of royal lineage, but when the manuscript went in, it came right
back. They'd checked with George Lucas, and he said, `No, she grew
up on a farm.' He's got the whole thing in his head. So, you
adjust.''
</P>
<P>
   Is she prepared for all ``The Phantom Menace'' hype? ``I hadn't
thought about the popularity issue until this month, as the
enormous publicity machine crawls forward. But the fun of it is the
characters.''
</P>
<P>
   Books such as Watson's, essentially commissioned as marketing
spin-offs, are done on a flat-fee basis, with no royalties paid.
That's the downside; the upside is that the flat fee is generous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really need an agent. The price is the price, and they
own things like foreign rights. I don't like writing for hire, but
for Lucasfilm, I'll make an exception.''
</P>
<P>
   The young adult market is increasingly difficult; now, 12- and
13-year-olds read Stephen King and Danielle Steel, just as their
parents do. The ``Star Wars'' books _ Watson has done five so far _
arrived at a good time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing about writing for kids is the letters; they all
say, `You're my favorite writer,' or `Your books are my favorite
books.' I always answer the letters with the pseudonym I used for
the book.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so she's read the script of the new film, and she knows how
it ends. But does she know what Paul Harvey would call the rest of
the story?
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, I know,'' she smiles. ``Ewan McGregor ends up becoming
Alec Guinness.

TIDBITS FROM A PUBLISHING EDITOR WHO LED A CHARMED LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds : Publication notes appear at end of review.)  
(DW) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As Michael Korda notes in his engaging memoir of a life in
publishing, the daily chores of a book editor do not make for
dramatic narrative. So readers may come away without a clear notion
of exactly what Korda, the editor in chief of Simon &AMP; Schuster, has
been doing to earn his pay over the past 40 years or so, except for
poring over manuscripts for hours on end and lunching out five days
a week. Fortunately, he admits to being a born speed reader, and
the book is evidence of his talents as a lunch guest.
</P>
<P>
   Having already shown his agreeable way with an anecdote in
``Charmed Lives,'' the best seller about his famous family of
Anglo-Hungarian Jewish movie makers, Vincent, Alex and Zoltan
Korda, as well as Auntie Merle Oberon, he now turns to men with
names like Simon, Schuster, Shimkin, Schwed, Schulte and Snyder,
who helped run Simon &AMP; Schuster from its years as a cottage
industry through its many ever-expanding incarnations, carrying
along Korda with them.
</P>
<P>
   His account of the jostlings for control and the changes that
swept book publishing between the 1950s and 90s are enriched by
shrewd assessments of big players like Charles G. Bluhdorn of Gulf
&AMP; Western, who swallowed up Simon &AMP; Schuster after swallowing up
Paramount. Korda delivers a lot of information about the book
business very lightly, with diverting asides about the celebrities
he has encountered, including the likes of Harold Robbins and
Irving Wallace, Truman Capote and Tennessee Williams, Richard Nixon
and Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Their appearances give the author an opportunity to display his
skills as a raconteur. Here is his quick description of Robbins,
whose novels sold in astronomical numbers in the 1950s and 60s:
``He wore a silk shirt, open to the navel, exposing a thick mat of
chest hair and several gold chains. His hairy wrists were adorned
with chunky gold bracelets and a gold watch, so that every time he
moved them he clinked and clanked.''
</P>
<P>
   Korda reports that on one occasion the novelist, who didn't like
writing but did like the money, knocked off the first half of a
novel, took a break of a few months to spend his advance in
partying, then returned to the second half, which his editor soon
discovered had little do do with the first half. When Korda offered
to stitch the parts together lest readers find themselves
perplexed, Robbins told him, in a colorful phrase, what they could
do. The book was published as written and nobody complained.
</P>
<P>
   Laugh lines abound. Korda reports this exchange between Capote
and the famous agent Irving Lazar as, with the help of their Hermes
pocket diaries and Cartier gold pencils, they tried to get together
for lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Capote: ``Lunch with Jackie, cocktails with the Paleys, dinner
at the Bombolanas, you know them, Irving, surely. That's it for
Tuesday.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazar: ``Lunch with the Princess Borbon y Parma, cocktails with
Marietta Tree, dinner at Lenny Bernstein's _ that's it for
Wednesday.''
</P>
<P>
   He also describes an eerie tour of Richard Nixon's home in New
Jersey, where, he assures us, the former president kept referring
to himself as a distant presence: ``This is the desk at which Nixon
wrote all his books.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Korda tells of his success in writing his own
books while advancing in the Simon &AMP; Schuster hierarchy. He managed
without apparent strain to accommodate himself to whoever was in
charge at the moment, even finding kind words for Richard Snyder,
who ran the company during his ascendance and whose personality and
methods of operation were not widely beloved in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   One nonadmirer of Snyder, Henry Robbins, a much respected editor
who was brought to Simon &AMP; Schuster to give the house some literary
quality, is treated with untypical roughness by the smooth Korda.
He writes, in what comes across as wry distaste, that Robbins took
himself and literature seriously and ``was inclined to confuse
them'' and tells of Robbins' throwing a soup plate at Barry Diller,
an emissary from the publisher's West Coast masters. ``I'm not
going to sit here and listen to some goddamn movie person tell us
how to publish books!'' he shouted and walked out.
</P>
<P>
   Good for Henry, who I must reveal here was my editor for a time
at Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux. Many mourned his premature death. It
seems to me what Korda portrays as a stiff-necked pretension to
guardianship of literary values was in fact a principled editorial
stance that never found much of a place at Simon &AMP; Schuster or in
the Korda career as he himself describes it. You don't become
editor in chief by throwing soup plates at the boss.
</P>
<P>
   But this is more a book about personalities than about
principles. For example, there's Tennessee Williams arriving at
Lutece late for a lunch date and ``missing the fact that there were
two or three steps in front of him, took a nosedive straight to the
floor, landing in a heap just short of our table.'' When he was
brushed down and guided to his chair, Williams said: ``Ah believe
ah'll have a vodka. Better make that a double.''

CARTER REUNITED WITH LOST TREASURE 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ That trademark laugh in his voice, and his ring back on
his finger, John Carter couldn't help but state the obvious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unbelievable!'' said Carter. ``Good stuff like this doesn't
happen to me. Other people, yeah, but not me _ it's usually the bad
stuff that happens to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter, the former Bruins forward who lost an eye to a freak
on-ice accident earlier in the '90s, recently was reunited with the
NCAA championship ring he lost some 13 years ago while swimming in
the Mystic Lakes that separate Arlington and Medford.
</P>
<P>
   The diamond-studded ring, a keepsake from Carter's days at RPI
and its national title in 1984-85, slipped off his hand when he was
swimming in the summer of '86. All these years later, Jim
O'Connell, a certified scuba diver for some 25 years, found it
while testing equipment this spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw something sparkle in the muck, in about 30 feet of
water, and I thought, `Well, well, I've got something here,' ''
said the 40-year-old O'Connell, who grew up on the lakes and now is
a facilities manager for Genome Therapeutics, a biotech company in
Waltham. ``I'd just bought some new gear, and when I found it, my
immediate thought was, `Hey, I just paid for the gear.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Upon closer examination, however, O'Connell, only a casual
hockey fan, soon realized that the owner would be easy to find. In
near-showroom condition, the ring carried Carter's name and RPI's
record on the front. A friend of O'Connell's at work soon was in
touch with Carter's sister, and within days O'Connell was handing
the ring back to its rightful owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still in awe,'' said the 36-year-old Carter, whose story
was first reported in the Woburn Times and subsequently carried
nationally on wire services. ``I'm getting calls from all over the
country about this . . . Kansas City and Wisconsin . . . people
think it's really something. So do I. He's a good guy, giving it
back like that.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell didn't ask for a reward, but Carter gave him $50.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, who played for the Bruins from 1985-86 to 1990-91 and
who currently is a mental health worker at a state hospital by
night, this spring completed his first season of coaching hockey at
Nichols College. The club finished 8-15-1 (there were no rings) and
Carter hopes for improvement next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough Division 3 hockey,'' he said. ``We only had 28 kids
out last year. But we finished OK. We won five of our last six
games and it looks like we've got 65 kids who are coming out.
You're always looking for that diamond in the rough.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes they're there, as O'Connell can testify.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most valuable thing I've ever found, by far,'' said
O'Connell, who was diving that day with his brother, Ken. ``It's a
beautiful ring, all diamonds. I picked it up and said, `This is a
beauty, and it will pay for all this gear.' But as the hours went
on, I realized, `Well, hey, I won't get rich, but I guess I've got
a great story.' ''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No knowing officially whether Brian Sutter will be back as
Flames coach, but signs point to his return. General manager Al
Coates is on record as saying he'll recommend to the owners that
Sutter be brought back (the club holds the option) . . . The water
only grows murkier in Pittsburgh, where unresolved bankruptcy
proceedings leave the league not knowing how to proceed with
scheduling and a litany of other key issues (player contracts,
etc.). Another possible new suitor, Mark Cuban, entered the picture
a couple of weeks ago. Cuban is the founder of Broadcast.com and
grew up in suburban Pittsburgh. Former superstar Mario Lemieux
submitted a plan, endorsed by the NHL, to bankruptcy court, and
Cuban might join the Lemieux group. At least one other group,
headed by investment banker Chip Gesner, formerly of Connecticut,
could enter a bid this week. Cuban has the deep pockets preferred
by the NHL. Last month, Yahoo agreed to buy Broadcast.com for $5.7
billion, and Cuban's cut was approximately $1.2 billion. NHL
commissioner Gary Bettman said last week that there is another
buyer willing to step in and pay off all creditors _ to the tune of
some $85 million _ and move the team out of town. The mystery man?
Paul Allen, owner of the Seattle Seahawks and co-founder of
Microsoft . . . The Rangers could make offseason bids for Theo
Fleury and/or Vincent Damphousse, both of whom are unrestricted
free agents. Coach John Muckler has scouted both of them during the
playoffs. Meanwhile, Damphousse and the Sharks didn't make it out
of the first round _ they were losers to Fleury's Avalanche _ which
means the Habs must settle for a second-round pick in 2000 as
compensation for sending Damphousse to San Jose. The deal had the
Habs getting a first-rounder this year if the Sharks made it to
Round 2 . . . Abe Pollin's sale last week of the Capitals,
according to insiders, will leave Dick Patrick, the club's
president, with an 8 percent ownership interest in the ongoing
venture. If the club's final sale price (yet to be determined,
because it's part of a Capitals-Wizards-MCI Center package) is
upwards of $90 million, Patrick's stake could be worth $7 million
or more. Pollin is selling because he had too much money tied up in
the building. His accountants told him to diversify his holdings .
. . Got to love the way former Canuck Ivan Hlinka keeps his Czech
Republic squad running strong. As at the Olympics, the Czechs edged
Canada in a shootout at the World Championships and Hlinka swapped
netminders in the middle of the shootout. Now there's nerve,
bringing in a goalie who hadn't blocked a single shot for 60-plus
minutes. Hlinka, 49, also coached the Olympic squad in '98, winning
the gold medal with Dominik Hasek and Jaromir Jagr. Hlinka was
among the first Europeans to find their way to the NHL. His former
Canucks teammate and countryman, Jiri Bubla, now runs a cleaning
service in Vancouver . . . In case you're wondering, former Bruin
Rosie Ruzicka did not play for the Czechs at the Worlds.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's a good bet around the Red Wings that Chris Osgood will be
in net Sunday when the Winged Wheels resume their series with the
Avalanche. The king of practical jokers, Osgood, sidelined by a
knee injury, the last few days has been lathering up phones with
Vaseline _ a real earful when Wings trainers answer their calls . .
. Voters in Arizona hit the polls Tuesday to decide whether an
aging mall on the Phoenix/Scottsdale line will be rezoned as a
stadium district, for the purposes of building the Coyotes a new
home. The referendum is expected to pass, but it no doubt would
have had more momentum behind it if the Coyotes hadn't been pushed
out of the first round by the Blues . . . Pierre Turgeon's sudden
injection of grit _ not to mention a couple of dramatic overtime
goals _ has all but guaranteed that the Blues will bring him back
for at least one more year. As the season wound down, Turgeon's
return looked doubtful, but now the Blues have virtually no choice
but to make him at least a qualifying offer (at minimum, a match of
his current $4.6 million salary) . . . Ted Leonsis, who must be
approved by the NHL as the new majority owner of the Capitals, says
he'll let kids sit in his owner's box at the MCI Center, preferring
himself to sit in the stands. A man of the people, who happens to
have about $1 billion from his America Online holdings . . . ``You
can't coach size,'' says Vancouver GM Brian Burke. With that in
mind, the Canucks last week finally came to contract terms with
6-foot-4-inch, 210-pound blue liner Bryan Allen, their No. 1 pick
(fourth overall) in last June's amateur draft. Even if Allen
doesn't make it next season, look for the Canucks to deal a
defenseman or two for help up front. The likeliest candidates:
Bryan McCabe and Adrian Aucoin . . . One big problem in the Red
Wing attack right now is the loss of Igor Larionov, who is down
with what is being called a dislocated finger (with a cast the
length of his forearm?). No Larionov means they're without their
top quarterback on the power play.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Thrashers, ready to do business this fall after
stocking their lineup in the June expansion draft in the Hub, still
haven't picked a coach _ a sure sign that the top candidate
probably was coaching in the NHL this season . . . Ted Nolan would
be a logical candidate for the Los Angeles and Atlanta openings (he
was the first to submit cover letter and resume to Kings GM Dave
Taylor). Nolan has not returned numerous messages on his home
answering machines left by the Globe and at least one other major
paper . . . Jacques Demers is considering hiring fired Kings coach
Larry Robinson, the former Montreal great, to work as an assistant
in Tampa. Demers, GM and coach of the Bolts, already has three
assistants on the job, including former Boston University star John
Cullen . . . Devils center Petr Sykora bolted overseas to play in
the World Championships when the Devils were knocked out of the
playoffs. By the time he arrived in Norway, he was too late to
practice with the Czechs, so he jumped on the ice with the Slovaks.
The next day, he helped the Czechs hammer the Slovaks, 8-2. ``I
guess that happens,'' said Czech winger Martin Rucinsky, ``when
you've got dual citizenship.'' . . . Speculation is bubbling again
that Oilers boss Glen Sather could be recruited to run either the
Sharks or Kings. It's possible, but only if Sather grows tired of
trying to remain competitive with such a tight budget in Edmonton.
His other lucrative business ventures up north, including extensive
realty holdings in Banff, also would make it difficult to leave . .
. Dominik Hasek's agent, Rich Winter, calls rumors of a Hasek trade
in the offseason an ``absolute lie.'' Added Winter, ``I know for
sure he'll retire as a Sabre.'' Hasek will pocket $15 million over
his next two seasons and the club holds an option that would pay $9
million in 2001-02.

   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ The Columbus Crew took a significant step into
the future Saturday night. And they did so at the expense of the
Revolution, taking a 2-0 victory in the first match at their
soccer-specific stadium, before a festive, sellout crowd of 24,741.
</P>
<P>
   Jamaica-born Jeff Cunningham consecrated the field with a
spectacular 10th-minute goal and set up Stern John for a
58th-minute header as the Crew remained in first place in the
Eastern Conference. The Revolution fell to fifth place with 7
points in eight games.
</P>
<P>
   But the main attraction on a windless, 70-degree night was the
Crew Stadium, a $28.5 million construction which was completed in
less than 10 months. Lamar Hunt, the Crew's major investor, acted
quickly to build the facility at the Ohio State Fairgrounds after
two previous initiatives failed.
</P>
<P>
   Several prospective investors and other MLS groups participated
in related activities during the week, and indicated they will try
to duplicate the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the intimate atmosphere was comparable to some European
stadia, though lacking roofing. Fans, some sitting within 8 feet of
the playing field, were involved, and some were passionate enough
to fling a couple of paper cups onto the field after a
controversial decision by referee Brian Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, this was a celebration, a tribute to Hunt, who
personally conducted tours during the week, and spent
Saturday &UR;  &LR; night polling fans about the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``The atmosphere was incredible,'' Revolution striker Joe-Max
Moore said. ``The field was in great condition, the dimensions are
perfect, and I'll look forward to playing here, even though the
crowd is like a 12th man for Columbus. My hat is off to Lamar Hunt.
He is a man of vision.''
</P>
<P>
   The Crew were emotionally charged at the start and took control
early. Columbus kept possession for the first two minutes as the
Revolution simply followed passes, becoming spectators themselves.
And the Crew capitalized as John stripped Ted Chronopoulos in the
Revolution end, and found Cunningham on the right side of the
penalty area.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham made an excellent first touch, allowing him to turn
quickly and fire into the upper far corner of the net, leaving
player-coach Walter Zenga no chance.
</P>
<P>
   That appeared to awaken the Revolution, who soon began dictating
the action. Paulo Dos Santos, starting at right back in place of
Mike Burns (hamstring strain), Edwin Gorter, Ivan McKinley, and
Giovanni Savarese had the best chances to tie. Mark Dougherty saved
Dos Santos's 25th-minute, left-footed blast and, seconds later, a
close shot by Johnny Torres off a corner.
</P>
<P>
   The Crew went into a counterattack mode, with Jamaican
midfielder Andy Williams keying the offense. John, the MLS's
leading scorer last year with 26 goals, shot high in the ninth
minute of the second half, then headed in four minutes later to
clinch the victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``After it was 1-0 we started to play and we played some good
soccer,'' Gorter said. ``We had some good possessions and we were
dangerous on set pieces. But you get yourself in trouble when you
lose the ball in silly ways, and we did that more than once. They
have one or two of the quickest players in the MLS, and eventually
they are going to score if you give them those kind of chances.''
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution have struggled with injuries this season and they
were missing starters Imad Baba (groin), Richard Goulooze (calf),
and Burns, and midfielder Jair entered late because of a stomach
virus. John Harkes made his Revolution debut, playing 15 minutes
after recovering from a sprained right knee ligament.
</P>
<P>
   But Harkes could not rescue the Revolution, which lacked a
finishing touch despite having Moore and Savarese.

<P>
   BOSTON _ It has been a season in which the youthful Northeastern
crew (only two seniors) has been experimenting at stroke. After a
disappointing sixth-place finish in the Eastern Sprints last week,
Northeastern coach Buzz Congram made a couple of moves in his
varsity heavyweight boat.
</P>
<P>
   First, he put last year's stroke, senior Bill Plifka, who
returned for the first time this season from a shoulder injury, in
the No. 7 seat. Then he promoted freshman Austin Eichelberger from
the novice boat to the varsity, putting him in the fourth seat.
</P>
<P>
   However, Congram's maneuverings managed only the same results.
Saturday, in the 30th annual Burk Cup on the Charles River, the
University of Pennsylvania, which finished third in last week's
Easterns, crushed Northeastern by open water, 5 minutes 54.02
seconds to 6:02. Penn (5-1) led by two-thirds of a boat in the
first 500 meters and kept it there until the 1,500-meter mark,
where the Quakers pushed it to more than a length and cruised home
to victory.
</P>
<P>
   Northeastern (2-3) hopes its experimenting at stroke is over,
with Plifka returning to his old post in two weeks for the IRA
Championships on the Cooper River in Camden, N.J. Now it's a matter
of getting better and faster.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a little shaky,'' said Congram. ``We went with a new
lineup to see if we could get a little more horsepower in the boat.
It seemed at the sprints, we didn't have enough and it didn't quite
work out that well against Penn. In the next two weeks, before the
national championship, we'll see if we can work out a few of the
bugs.''
</P>
<P>
   This latest NU boat, which was put together Wednesday, looked
out of synch, showing its lack of practice together. ``That's not a
lot of time and they kind of rowed that way, very rough and not
real good,'' said Congram. ``It was a gradual thing for Penn's
speed throughout. Overall, it's faster and it had a more efficient
rhythm.''
</P>
<P>
   Northeastern wasn't smooth from the start. ``It was kind of
scrambled,'' Plifka said. ``The catches weren't there. It was a
little bit rushed. We just haven't rowed together to get a good
rhythm going. The longer we practice, the better we're going to
get.''
</P>
<P>
   For Penn, the event served as a good tuneup for the IRAs. ``We
were pleased with the race, but we've got our work cut out for us
in two weeks at the IRAs,'' said Penn coach Stan Bergman, whose
boat has five lettermen (including coxswain) from last year's team.
``We had a good start against Northeastern and that's one of the
things we've been trying to work on. We actually had a pretty good
sprint and we're trying to make a better move in the middle of the
race.''
</P>
<P>
   The Quakers are led by senior stroke Garrett Miller, who won the
Crash-B sprint college championships the last three years and was
second in the internationals in February at the Reggie Lewis Track.
He has been on the US national world championship team the last two
summers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was probably our best start of the season,'' said Miller of
Saturday's race. ``We've done a lot of work on it in the past, to
the point where it's slowly becoming our strong point. Once we got
open water, you get where you can relax a lot more with our boat
picking up.''
</P>
<P>
   Penn had to work hard to place third at the Easterns. ``We were
fifth going into the last 300 meters and we had a good sprint,''
said Bergman, whose team was fourth in the IRAs last season.

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ In a stunning turn of events, two minor party
candidates withdrew from the prime minister's race on Sunday,
paving the way for what polls predicted would be a conclusive
victory in Monday's elections for Labor Party leader Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
   At noon, Yitzhak Mordechai, the Center Party leader and former
defense minister, reluctantly ended his ambitious candidacy as the
first Sephardic Jew to run for prime minister. He endorsed Barak,
and reiterated his party's central tenet: that, above all, Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his former boss, must be defeated.
</P>
<P>
   And Benny Begin, leader of an ultra-nationalist coalition, also
pulled out of the race. A right-wing purist who felt that Netanyahu
had betrayed his supporters by turning over West Bank land to the
Palestinians, he declined to throw his support to the prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
   In the final hours before Monday's voting, the political ground
shifted consequentially. It turned what had been a five-way
contest, with a run-off scheduled for June 1, into a one-round
showdown between Barak, 57, and Netanyahu, 49, leader of the
conservative Likud Party. Azmi Bishara, the first Israeli Arab ever
to run for prime minister, quit the race on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Without Mordechai in the race, most polls showed Barak, a
kibbutz-born, highly decorated former general, definitively leading
the prime minister _ by as much as 10 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Many Israelis, however, are cautious about such polls,
particularly in light of the 1996 election, when Shimon Peres, then
the Labor Party leader, was predicted to win but eventually lost by
the slimmest of margins to Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   A cautious, almost dispassionate strategist, Barak has been very
hesitant to show too much optimism lest his voters grow complacent
and stay home on Monday. But on Sunday he gave a particularly
rousing speech, draping a get-out-the-vote message with a
triumphalist appeal to Israeli national pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the millions who wish to see the love of Israel re-created
among us, I say to everyone _ now,'' Barak said. ``This is the
time. We can once again unify our country.''
</P>
<P>
   For his televised appearance, Barak spoke at a campaign rally in
a plowed potato field outside Raanana, where Barak signs were
planted every few feet like crop markers. Behind him stood hundreds
of Israeli flags, well-scrubbed children on the shoulders of
smiling Israelis, and an ethnic rainbow of cheering supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu, in stark contrast, assumed the stance of a fighter,
punching his opponent even as he pleaded with defectors from his
party to return. In a televised press conference inside the prime
minister's office, he attacked Barak as an Arab sympathizer and a
leftist. He sat flanked by three of his ministers, including
Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon, and behind him stood several men
wearing signs taped to their shirts: ``We came home to Likud.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I must ask everyone in the national camp not to repeat the
mistake made in the '92 elections,'' Netanyahu said, referring to a
split in the right wing that ensured the victory of the late
Yitzhak Rabin, the Labor Party leader at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu continued: ``We must give the left no possibility of
establishing an Arab state in the heart of Israel, on the outskirts
of Tel Aviv, which would endanger all of us here and our very
existence.''
</P>
<P>
   At Netanyahu's press conference, he was virtually heckled by the
reporters, who challenged his right to hold what amounted to a
small campaign rally in his government office. It was apparently
unprecedented here in Israel for an incumbent to mix his two roles
in such a fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Mordechai's somewhat quixotic candidacy has provided several
turning points in this campaign _ especially a television debate
last month in which Mordechai skewered the prime minister, tainting
his reputation as both unflappable and a wizard of the small
screen.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, by bowing out, Mordechai made his greatest impact yet.
If he had continued his candidacy, which was expected to receive
about five or six percent of the vote, there would likely have been
a run-off.
</P>
<P>
   And the dynamics of the campaign would have been reborn in a
two-week, face-to-face contest between Barak and a sitting prime
minister who is believed to be a master of direct political combat.
</P>
<P>
   This would have been especially true if an expected shift
occurred in the parliamentary vote, solidifying a center-left
majority and galvanizing some swing voters to return to Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   As Mordechai's standing in the polls plummeted, he spent the
last few weeks denying that he would withdraw. Sunday, ashen-faced
and with black circles under his eyes, Mordechai said grimly that
he had reached his decision in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   Mordechai said he chose to pull out partly because he was scared
that Netanyahu would resort to divisive and even dangerous
electioneering tactics _ and that he would be indirectly
responsible for what transpired.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tremble and I am worried about what will happen if these
elections continue another two weeks,'' he said. ``As a responsible
man, I cannot shoulder the fear that things could end up in
bloodshed.''
</P>
<P>
   Mordechai, who was dismissed as defense minister in January by
Netanyahu, said he had been shown incontrovertible data just Sunday
morning that proved he could not ``reach the target.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he urged his supporters to switch allegiances to Barak,
he offered a somewhat tepid endorsement. He referred to Barak's
lack of political experience, and said, ``I'm familiar with his
limitations.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Stiff on the public stage, loose and irreverent in private,
Barak is a former army chief of staff who advocates moving quickly
forward in the Israeli-Palestinian peace effort. He is a hawkish
dove, in the model of Rabin, but also a champion of secular
democracy in a country where religion and state are naturally
entangled.
</P>
<P>
   Hailing Mordechai's decision to quit, Barak embraced the Center
Party as an ``important part of any government we will set up after
the elections.'' Both he and Mordechai denied that any deal between
them had been struck, but it is probable that Mordechai would join
his Cabinet in a senior position.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show Mordechai's supporters to be defecting mostly to
Barak.
</P>
<P>
   But Netanyahu claimed that Mordechai's followers were tying up
his phone lines and swarming his offices, so eager were they to
switch their loyalties to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people driving here from all over the country _ we
can't even make room for them _ saying they've had enough, they're
coming home,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bishara, the Israeli-Arab candidate, withdrew without
endorsing Barak, Netanyahu charged that his withdrawal from the
race was coordinated with Labor ``with the blessing and support of
Yasser Arafat,'' the Palestinian leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``To reach an agreement with Bishara is to reach an agreement
with anti-Zionist forces, and I think that will really be reflected
in Barak's coalition,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Weary of a bitter, divisive campaign, many Israelis cheered
Mordechai's and Begin's withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have always been in favor of a short campaign,'' said Natan
Sharansky, the Russian immigrant leader whose constituency
represents a swing vote now split between the two candidates.
``Political mud is not medicinal. If we can cut two weeks of
political mud, it will contribute to the health of the country.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The pleasant weather in the Northeast will be eroded by an
increasingly moist onshore flow. A large area of high pressure,
with a central pressure near 30.50 inches, is stationary just south
of Nova Scotia. At the same time, a weak ocean storm is drifting
northward between Cape Hatteras and Bermuda.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure difference between these weather systems will
transport ocean-cooled air inland from Virginia to Cape Cod. As the
moist air is heated from below while moving inland, a deck of
clouds will form. Air ascending the east slopes of the Appalachians
will produce overcast skies from the northern Smoky Mountains to
the Poconos.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, sunshine and very warm weather are likely across the
interior Northeast as breezes begin to blow from the southwest.
Readings may rise into the 80s in northern New England.
</P>
<P>
   Several clusters of thunderstorms will erupt ahead of a cold
front crossing the Middle West. Hail and flooding rains are
possible in Illinois, Wisconsin and eastern Missouri. A few
powerful storms should form in southern or eastern Texas.
Thundershowers will be scattered across the Mississippi and lower
Ohio valleys.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly sunny and very warm conditions will dominate the interior
Southeast and Florida. Active sea breezes may trigger isolated
thunder near the coast.
</P>
<P>
   Clouds and showers will mark another surge of chilly air from
the North Pacific. It will be dull, damp and cooler in most of
Washington, Oregon and western Montana. Dry weather is likely from
the western Dakotas into the central Rockies and across the
Southwest. The deserts will be rather hot.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: Midnight Sun
</P>
<P>
   For nearly a week, the sun has shone all the time along the
north coast of Alaska. Last Monday marked the start of nearly three
months of continual daylight at Barrow, the northernmost point in
the state. Since then, each day has seen the midnight sun become
visible a few miles farther south. By June 21, the sun will shine
for 24 hours as far south as Kotzebue on Alaska's west coast and
the northern sections of the interior Yukon Valley. The marvelous
geometry of the earth's tilted axis of rotation adds a brilliant
dimension of continuous sunshine to these harshest climate zones in
the world.

 &HT;    Israeli election to be decided today among two remaining
candidates
 &HT;    By Larry Kaplow
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The Israeli election for prime minister narrowed to
just two candidates Sunday, with incumbent Benjamin Netanyahu
trailing badly in polls behind his old army commander, Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
   Two other candidates dropped from the race on the eve of today's
vote, eliminating any prospect of a June 1 run off election.
</P>
<P>
   Israelis now face a clear choice.
</P>
<P>
   Right wing Netanyahu, confrontational toward Israel's Arab
neighbors and allied with Jewish fundamentalists, appears to be
outflanked by the left-wing Barak and his largely secular
followers, who favor rapid progress in the negotiations with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, a 57-year-old former general and Israel's most decorated
soldier, confidently approached the end of a campaign that
commentators say is run with the discipline of a military
operation.
</P>
<P>
   At a small rally in a sunny field near Tel Aviv on Sunday, he
continued his theme of togetherness and economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are only two ways in this country,'' Barak declared.
``Netanyahu's way, which has led to this stalemate, and our way,
which will bring change and bring unity and bring love for
Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   The picture was starkly different from a news conference held
earlier Sunday by the combative, 49-year-old Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   Seated behind a table in the crowded prime minister's office, he
accused Barak of making a deal with Israel's Arab enemies in order
to win Arab votes. He also singled out members of the Israeli media
he said were biased and accused Barak of financing his campaign
with ``illegal money.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to deals he claims Barak made with the withdrawing
candidates, particularly an Arab candidate, Netanyahu said, ``This
is a very sad moment in the history of Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak denied all the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Despite polls that shown Netanyahu trailing, he said he would
win because voters would resent Barak's maneuvers.
</P>
<P>
   While polls in Israel are famously uncertain _ voters boast
about lying in surveys _ they have played a key role in this years
race. As minor candidates have seen their poll numbers slip, they
have dropped from the race hoping to help one of the front-runners.
</P>
<P>
   In the closing hours of the campaign, Barak 's lead appears
substantial.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli pollster Hanoch Smith said a survey of 1,000 voters
conducted Thursday and Saturday showed Barak beating Netanyahu 54
percent to 46 percent in a one-on-one race. Other polls have had
similar figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's already bigger than I can believe,'' Smith said. ``It was
expanding the last few days.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak's eight point lead would be a landslide in a country known
for close elections. In 1996, for example, Netanyahu beat Shimon
Peres by less than 1 percent of the nearly 3 million cast.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's standing was bolstered by the weekend's withdrawals of
trailing candidates.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Arab candidate Azmi Bishara withdrew from the race
and his Arab supporters were expected to support Barak. Another
minor contender, extreme right-wing candidate Benny Begin, dropped
out Sunday and his voters will likely favor Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   But, Barak benefited heavily Sunday from the dramatic withdrawal
and endorsement of the trusted former general Yitzhak Mordechai.
</P>
<P>
   Mordechai had been Netanyahu's defense minister before he
accused his boss of being habitually dishonest and endangering
Israel with his aggressive style.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing his poll numbers sliding and fearing political turmoil in
a country known for bitter politics, Mordechai said he wanted the
race to end in a quick Barak victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tremble and I am worried about what will happen if these
elections continue another two weeks,'' Mordechai said. ``As a
responsible man, I can not shoulder the fear that things could end
up in bloodshed.''
</P>
<P>
   Mordechai was applauded by his supporters, even as some wept.
</P>
<P>
   (Optional cut)
</P>
<P>
   Their new Center Party claims to be a moderate alternative
between the left wing of Barak and the right wing of Netanyahu.
But, mostly, they said their goal was to oust Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   Though he was polling in single digits, if Mordechai had
remained in the race, he would likely have caused a runoff and
given Netanyahu two weeks to catch up.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Mordechai's voters had previously supported Netanyahu's
Likud Party. They abandoned the prime minister when Mordechai left
him, and pollsters predict the bulk will now vote for Barak.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu urged his former supporters to ``come home.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his office had been ``flooded'' with Mordechai voters
now coming back to Netanyahu and he produced a few such voters at
his press conference. One burly man wore notebook-sized
hand-written taped to his chest claiming, ``I'm coming home.''
</P>
<P>
   Avraham Burg, a member of the Israeli parliament in Barak's
Labor Party, told Israeli television that Netanyahu's press
conference was ``strange.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's telling people to come home,'' Burg quipped. ``It's kind
of like a homeless person asking people into his living room.''

   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ After more than 50 days of bombing and
with his troops still entrenched in Kosovo, President Slobodan
Milosevic is prepared for a settlement, so long as the process can
be portrayed as negotiation and not capitulation, Yugoslav
officials and analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   There is a consensus that Milosevic has the political room to
maneuver over Kosovo and to redefine almost any negotiated outcome
as a victory to preserve his own grip on power.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what I know of Milosevic, there is no line in the sand,''
said Dusan Mihajlovic, the leader of New Democracy, now a
self-described pro-Western opposition party that once was part of
Milosevic's government. ``Milosevic himself is the line in the
sand.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic is described as frustrated by the slow pace of the
mediating effort by the Russian special envoy, Victor Chernomyrdin,
adding to Belgrade's already deep mistrust of Moscow's intentions.
</P>
<P>
   Independent analyst Bratislav Grubacic said the difficulty in
resolving the crisis will be to find a solution that saves face for
all sides involved. For Milosevic, a senior Yugoslav official said,
the key will be to underline Serbia's sovereignty over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav officials make no secret of their annoyance with the
Russian envoy, who failed to arrive in Belgrade last Sunday as
expected. Instead, after NATO's bombing of the Chinese Embassy
here, Chernomyrdin chose to fly to Beijing and then to Moscow for
talks with Chinese and American officials. He is now expected to
arrive here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Goran Matic, a powerful minister without portfolio of the
Yugoslav United Left party of Milosevic's wife, Mirjana Markovic,
said in an interview: ``Russia is following its own interests,
trying to get back into good graces with the West. Every NATO bomb
that drops on Yugoslavia has a Russian stamp on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Yugoslav officials and analysts, including another senior
politician, Milan Bozic, and Grubacic, believe that Milosevic is
likely to turn down any first proposal made by Chernomyrdin almost
on principle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The inner circle believes that Milosevic will accept a
compromise solution, but it must be a negotiation and not a
capitulation to terms,'' Grubacic said. ``He must be seen as a
respected negotiator. The struggle is to define a way for all sides
to be able to declare some form of victory while allowing foreign
troops into Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be important for Milosevic to keep at least some token
Yugoslav army and police forces along the borders with Albania and
Macedonia, even if they are ``shadowed'' by international forces,
one senior Yugoslav official said.
</P>
<P>
   It will also be important, the official said, that Milosevic
feels that a deal protects himself and his family.
</P>
<P>
   Bozic believes that the turmoil in Russia after President Boris
Yeltsin fired his prime minister will give Milosevic another reason
to dismiss a first offer by Chernomyrdin. ``The Russians are in
disarray, and he can tell Chernomyrdin to come back when they are
serious,'' Bozic said.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav officials regard the chaos in Russia as a more serious
obstacle to peace than the bombing of the Chinese Embassy in
Belgrade, because they believe that Beijing will not veto any
proposal agreed upon by Moscow and Washington. Still, some Yugoslav
officials believe that Milosevic's close ties to Beijing may help
keep pressure on the Russians to do more than ``be a postman for
the Americans,'' one official said.
</P>
<P>
   They note that Yeltsin and Milosevic do not like each other.
That distrust stems from early Belgrade support for the attempted
coup by conservative Communists against former Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev in August 1991. The coup's failure eventually
brought Yeltsin to power in a dissolved Soviet Union, the very kind
of dissolution that Milosevic then feared for Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The officials also cite Moscow's support for the fundamentals of
the draft agreement hammered out in Rambouillet, France, that
Belgrade refused to sign.
</P>
<P>
   Mihajlovic said he thinks Milosevic will not, in the end, miss
``this chance for peace.'' The alternative, Mihajlovic said, ``is a
burned land and an invasion by ground troops that would mean
occupation and further destruction, but even that would not have to
mean the end of Milosevic.''
</P>
<P>
   Mihajlovic believes, like many Yugoslavs, that Milosevic's
calculus depends on his political survival, and that ``peace will
bring him a thousand problems,'' including a further economic and
international isolation of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   But Milosevic can still portray himself as ``a new Prince Lazar,
the defender of Kosovo'' _ the Serb emperor who died in the famous
defeat by the Turks in 1389, but who shaped Serbian national myths.
By this logic, fighting for so long and so stubbornly against 19 of
the world's most advanced nations is itself a form of victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most Serbs think that what NATO wants from us is wrong, and
that NATO does not have the right to ask it of any nation, no
matter what we've done in Kosovo,'' said Ljiljana Smajlovic, a
journalist who warned before this war that Milosevic would rather
be bombed than capitulate to NATO's demands. ``Most people believe
that, but Milosevic has a lot of latitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Radomir Diklic, director of the independent Beta news agency
here, said that Milosevic has many strengths, which include the
willingness of the Yugoslav army and the Serb population to fight
in defense of Kosovo and their homeland. ``He knows, in a way, that
Serb lives are easy to spend, and that the lives of American and
NATO troops are very, very expensive,'' Diklic said.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, Milosevic is counting on the continuing refusal
of President Clinton to sanction a costly ground invasion. The
Yugoslav army is being hurt by NATO bombing in Kosovo, but not hurt
so badly that it will completely withdraw, Diklic said.
</P>
<P>
   Aleksa Djilas, a historian and sociologist who follows
Milosevic's career, also thinks the West will find it too
expensive, both in blood and money, to mount a ground invasion.
``They'd have to pave Albania,'' he said, referring to the backward
state of Europe's poorest country. And he noted that opposition to
ground troops is strong among most European members of NATO, save
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he says, Milosevic is feeling pressure from the bombing.
``He's a Balkan strongman and not a good guy, but he's not a
monster, either,'' said Djilas. ``His strategy for 12 years was to
preserve Serbia from bombing and Serbian kids from getting killed.
I think the West pressed him into a corner with its ultimatums and
he doesn't know how to get out.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides miscalculated and counted on a short war, Djilas
said. He remembered Gore Vidal once writing that for Americans,
``Winning is not enough _ others must lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Djilas mused, ``Can we have a solution where NATO wins and we
don't lose?''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   That is the outcome being floated to any Westerner who will
listen by one of the wealthy associates of Milosevic and Mrs.
Markovic, Bogoljub Karic, a minister in the Serb government. Karic,
like Matic last month, speaks of trying ``to do everything to make
NATO look like winners,'' so long as Serb sovereignty over Kosovo
is absolute and no foreign troops enter without agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic is also looking to the future, associates say. He is
considered likely, in the event of a negotiated solution that
brings in foreign forces under a U.N. mandate, to drop the
ultranationalist Radical Party and its leader, Vojislav Seselj,
from the Serb government, the analysts and officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Seselj, who opposes any foreign troops in Kosovo, was the right
wing to a government of national unity, where the left wing was the
Serbian Renewal Movement of the former democratic opposition
leader, Vuk Draskovic.
</P>
<P>
   When Draskovic was fired from the federal government for too
openly criticizing the political parties of Milosevic and his wife,
Seselj's access to the state media was also restricted. But Seselj
was interviewed Friday night decrying noted democratic opposition
leaders, including Draskovic, as ``traitors.''
</P>
<P>
   The most prominent opposition leader, Zoran Djindjic, head of
the Democratic Party, has fled Serbia, seeking shelter in
Montenegro with its embattled anti-Milosevic president, Milo
Djukanovic.
</P>
<P>
   They were fiercely attacked last week as traitors by the state
television, a charge Seselj echoed. Djindjic is thought to have
done his political future considerable harm by fleeing, while
another leader, Vuk Obradovic, head of Social Democracy, remained.
But Djindjic says he feared for his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It raises the question of who is the real opposition here,''
said Mihajlovic. ``In general, democracy is in danger of being the
collateral damage of the NATO bombings. But political life will
begin again after the war stops.''
</P>
<P>
   That is why Milosevic, having intimidated or destroyed his
democratic opposition and the independent media, is expected by
analysts to move to the middle, fire Seselj and portray himself as
a sensible moderate who defended Serbia's honor and territory as
best he could in the face of a united Western world.
</P>
<P>
   A few seasoned Serb observers are concerned that Milosevic will
reject a good deal, in order to have to accept a worse one later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sooner or later, everyone knows that foreign troops will enter
Kosovo, there will be a form of protectorate before new elections,
most Serb forces will be withdrawn and a large number of refugees
will return,'' said a senior journalist at state television. ``And
in some strange way, Kosovo will stay inside Yugoslavia but be
outside of it, and it will seem farther away from Belgrade than
Northern Ireland seems from London.''
</P>
<P>
   He shrugged. ``Now it's just a matter of the time and the price,
and of how many people have to die while we're waiting.''

NOT EASY BEING GREEN: KERMIT TAKES STAND ON COASTAL BILL

   WASHINGTON _ He's friendly, fuzzy and as green as they come. But
when Kermit the Frog joined top members of Congress to promote a
measure that might encourage offshore oil drilling, some
environmentalists were hopping mad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kermit the Frog is selling out the coast? How embarrassing!''
said Richard Charter, co-chair of the National OCS Coalition, an
organization helping to shape policy on outer continental-shelf
drilling. ``I'm sure Kermit doesn't know about some of the time
bombs in this bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Conservationists don't dispute that parts of the bill authored
by Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., would actually save ponds and lily
pads by redistributing oil royalties and allocating states $900
million for land and water conservation.
</P>
<P>
   But environmentalists say there is a catch. Under Landrieu's
Conservation and Reinvestment Act, states that allow drilling near
their coast would get a bigger chunk of money to deal with the
harmful effects of oil production.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics see that provision, called coastal impact
assistance, as an incentive that would tempt states searching for
cash to encourage more drilling and put their coastlines at risk
from a spill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Kermit would like that,'' said Lori Williams,
vice president for ocean programs at the Center for Marine
Conservation, which opposes Landrieu's bill.
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Club and other environmental groups are so unhappy
with the impact assistance that they switched their support and
endorsed competing legislation that does not link funding to a
state's proximity to offshore drilling.
</P>
<P>
   Kermit leaped into the political dispute Wednesday when the
internationally beloved Muppet was made available for satellite
television interviews from Washington alongside Landrieu and Sens.
Trent Lott, R-Miss., the majority leader, and John Breaux, D-La.;
and Reps. Billy Tauzin, R-La., and Chris John, D-La., sponsors of
the House version of the coastal measure.
</P>
<P>
   During lighthearted chats with newscasters in New Orleans,
Dallas, Tampa and other cities in Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi,
Florida and California, Kermit and the politicians talked about the
potential environmental benefits of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Rich Masters, a spokesman for Landrieu, conceded that some
environmental organizations have reservations about the measure,
but said a ``huge'' number of conservation advocates back it as a
way to funnel money to their causes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Practical environmentalists see this as a great vehicle to
fully fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kermit, who is said to have a home in the Mississippi
marshlands, never meant to get bogged down in a political battle,
said his handlers at the Jim Henson Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as Kermit's participation, it's merely about protecting
the environment,'' said Jeff Cusson, director of domestic public
relations at the Los Angeles-based company. ``It's merely in
support of saving the wetlands.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the company didn't do a lot of research about the bill
because its chief concern was raising awareness about wetlands
loss. Kermit has already been a spokesfrog for the Louisiana
Department of Natural Resources in its statewide Save the Wetlands
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists credited the bill's backers with getting
Kermit on board.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's actually pretty creative,'' Williams said. And
while the marine conservationist said there were flaws in the bill,
``We think there's potential there.''

SO MANY TV PILOTS, SO FEW YOUTHS TO STAR IN THEM  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Australia, England, Wash., Texas, Ky., Fla., Calif.)   By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Robert Hutchinson had done a few television
commercials as a middle school student here, then lost interest in
acting. But he did a few more commercials recently and then,
hearing about more opportunities for young people, decided this
spring, as a 16-year-old, to try for a part in a pilot for a new
television show.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was not prepared for what happened next.
</P>
<P>
   He was quickly invited to several auditions and then, with
little testing, given a leading role in a pilot for a series
focused on teen-agers for the WB network, ``Minor Threat.'' It was
one of two offers he received.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot to happen so quickly, but I think I can handle
it,'' he said. ``A lot of my friends _ girls, too _ have been doing
really well making pilots this year. I'm just taking it a step at a
time.''
</P>
<P>
   He was far from alone. The profit-starved television networks
are in a fever to develop fall series that attract younger
audiences that advertisers pay a premium to reach, and Hollywood
has been suffering an acute shortage of actors and actresses in
their teens and 20s for the pilot season.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Letterie, the WB casting chief, said that her company,
produced about 15 pilots focused on younger characters, and that to
cast all the parts she often had to take big leaps on untested
talent because of the intensity of the competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be a lot more willing to take a risk now,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The networks and casting agents have been signing up
inexperienced actors, making deals with young people after a
minimum of testing and throwing previously unheard of sums at
teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   Marcia Shulman, a senior vice president and head of casting at
20th Century Fox Television, said actors in their late teens and
early 20s were getting roughly $20,000 an episode for a prime-time
series, compared with about $7,500 just a couple of years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Just for making the pilots they are frequently being paid about
$40,000, she added, compared with no more than $10,000 a few years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Shulman added that most casting directors have been widening
their networks of scouts to places they would not have considered
before. Ms. Shulman said she has been in touch with talent scouts
in London for the first time, as well as in Seattle, Austin,
Houston, Louisville, Orlando and Miami.Seattle, Austin, Houston,
Louisville, Orlando and Miami.
</P>
<P>
   For another pilot, a drama called ``Eli's Theory,'' WB went all
the way to Australia to find Rel Hunt, who plays a 16-year-old
tough. He was in such demand, Hunt said, sounding incredulous
still, that he auditioned for three pilots a day this spring and
eventually received several offers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just seems every second pilot is about young people here,''
Hunt said. ``I feel really lucky. It's a great time to be a
teen-ager in this business.''
</P>
<P>
   Carly Pope, an 18-year-old from Vancouver who had never done
television but landed the lead in a pilot for a high school drama
called ``Popular,'' added: ``I'm still just trying to wrap my brain
around what's been going on. There's tremendous opportunity. My age
group has a kind of monopoly now.''
</P>
<P>
   Something like 110 pilots have been produced this year by the
four major broadcast networks and the two nascent ones, and perhaps
40 will make it onto the fall schedules. Most scheduling
announcements will be made this week.
</P>
<P>
   Young actors figure prominently in about 25 to 30 of the pilots,
far more than at any time in the past, television executives said.
</P>
<P>
   Money, of course, is driving this trend. Advertisers are paying
big premiums for spots on shows that appeal to younger viewers,
generally the 18- to 49-year-old group, but mostly the younger end
of that age bracket. The models for the new wave of series are
several successful shows like ``Dawson's Creek,'' ``Buffy the
Vampire Slayer'' and ``Felicity,'' all on WB.
</P>
<P>
   Advertisers reportedly pay about $200,000 on average for a
30-second spot on ``Dawson's Creek.'' The same length spots on
``Nash Bridges,'' on CBS, go for about $105,000, according to
Advertising Age, even though ``Nash Bridges'' is watched by 13.4
million viewers, according to Nielsen Media Research, compared with
5.25 million viewers for ``Dawson's Creek.'' But the WB show's
viewers are, like its actors, significantly younger than those for
``Nash Bridges.''
</P>
<P>
   The new youth-oriented shows frequently take place in high
schools and are about the difficulties of young people fitting in
with their peers or their families. The theme of youthful
alienation takes a literal turn in ``Roswell,'' a drama pilot for
Fox Broadcasting about teen-agers who are space aliens searching
for their origins.
</P>
<P>
   Fashions always change from season to season, as medical dramas
replace police dramas, for instance, or workplace sitcoms push
family sitcoms aside. But rarely has there been such a big
generational shift, both in the casting and content of the shows.
</P>
<P>
   That was evident in one scene in a Fox high school drama called
``Get Real,'' in which an incredulous boy pointedly tells his
amazed high school chums, ``Paul Newman, that salad dressing guy,
is, like, this famous actor.''
</P>
<P>
   Judy Savage, an agent who specializes in young actors and
actresses, said, ``It was almost a war, just a frenzy this year.''
She said she placed her clients on an extraordinary 17 pilots this
season. ``And before, when you cast the kids you had to cast the
parents,'' she added. ``But a lot of these shows are just about
teens.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Grushow, the president of 20th Century Fox Television,
which produced ``Get Real,'' said his network had to drop one pilot
because it could not round up enough actors and, in one instance,
resorted to an open casting call to find fresh young faces.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has always been a limited talent pool, but this has made it
much, much worse,'' he said. ``There's too much production and not
enough talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Helen Mossler, a senior vice president and head of casting at
Paramount Network Television, said her studio produced two youth
pilots, one for CBS and one for NBC, but had to drop a third
because it could not cast the lead parts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The minute they walk in the door, if they're any good, you
structure a test deal because you know if you don't in five
minutes, someone else is going to offer them something,'' Ms.
Mossler said of the young actors.
</P>
<P>
   Another sign of the times is that many pilots are being filmed
with young actors who have already done other pilots, a practice
called taking an actor in a second position. In other words, the
studios are taking a risk, since they can move forward with their
show only if the actor's first pilot is rejected.

<P>
   ``There was a time in this business when you'd never test a
person for second position,'' said Ms. Mossler. ``Now we are
testing for second position. We will even test for third position.
These are desperate times.''
</P>
<P>
   Making the shortages worse is the fact that teen-age feature
films are also hot. Movies like ``Never Been Kissed,'' ``Varsity
Blues'' and ``10 Things I Hate About You,'' to name just a few,
have also soaked up many of the younger actors on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Cami Patton, who cast a pilot called ``Grapevine'' for CBS, said
the rush of teen-age movies had created a sort of anti-television
snobbery.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were kids I'd never heard of who said they wouldn't do
television, just features,'' she said. ``And the truth is, they can
get away with it. It's never been like this before.''

CHINESE LIBERALS HOPE ANGER AT EMBASSY BOMBING CAN BE USED FOR
THEIR CAUSE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BEIJING _ In assessing the impact of last week's nationalistic,
anti-American outburst on their cause, Chinese liberals and
political dissidents say there may be more immediate hard-line
attitudes from the country's leaders, but hope that the outburst of
activism will galvanize a generation forced to keep quiet for the
last 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   In the near term, NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia and the deadly
attack on China's embassy in Belgrade have caused some Chinese to
question the sincerity of American ideals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people will feel disillusioned about Western values, and
that will make it more difficult for people like myself who lean
toward them,'' said Yu Jie, a 26-year-old author of essays of
social criticism and a graduate student at Beijing University.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because they have no choice, many democracy advocates
are searching for a silver lining in the week's tumult, hoping that
political passions reawakened for the first time since the
Tiananmen Square pro-democracy demonstrations of 1989 may
eventually turn their way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had been said that people these days didn't care about
politics,'' said Wang Yongqing, a 57-year-old longtime dissident.
``But these events show that there is still a lot of passion about
the fate of the country,'' he said from his home in the southern
city of Hangzhou, where he and others are struggling to keep alive
the banned China Democracy Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether this turns out to be a force for good or not we'll
have to wait and see,'' Wang said.
</P>
<P>
   An anguished mix of emotions has coursed through those who
actively promote democratic values in China, ranging from liberal
scholars pushing the boundaries of tolerated discourse to the
smaller core of dissidents who court prison by posing a frontal
challenge to Communist Party rule.
</P>
<P>
   All say they shared the general anger and hurt over the bombing
of a Chinese Embassy by a supposed friend. But many also felt deep
chagrin as the patriotic fury of university students, traditional
harbingers of change here, was directed not at China's political
shortcomings but at the evils of the U.S. government, the main
champion of human rights.
</P>
<P>
   A leading liberal scholar said that ``those young faces looked
the same'' as those during the huge student-led demonstrations of
1989. He added: ``Everything looked the same: the emotions, the
clothes, the banners. Except the slogans were different.''
</P>
<P>
   This scholar, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he hoped
that Americans would not overreact to the anti-American outburst,
which he regards as shallow and stoked by propaganda. ``The
students found a target for releasing aggression that had
accumulated over 10 years,'' he said. Since the crackdown in 1989,
he said, ``students have had no place to express their voice, to
speak out on their dissatisfactions with society.''
</P>
<P>
   Another liberal, an editor who was active in the 1989 movement
who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said, ``The
demonstrations have helped train the students in street politics,
and the long-term repercussions for the government are dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   In conversations in recent days, liberals and open dissidents
all were quick to note that the government had skillfully
manipulated public emotions through its control of the media, and
that alternate voices were suppressed.
</P>
<P>
   Yet many also acknowledged that the diet of inflammatory news
was so effective because it tapped into genuine nationalistic anger
that reflected the widely held view here that the United States
aims to prevent China from taking its rightful place as a world
power. This feeling could veer in unpredictable directions.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, political conditions were tightening this year
even before the bombing of the embassy in Belgrade. As June 4
approached _ the 10th anniversary of the smashing of the Tiananmen
Square demonstrations _ anyone known as a leader from that period,
and many of today's liberal intellectuals, were warned not to speak
with foreign journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, the fledgling China Democracy Party was nearly
extinguished as three leaders were given long prison sentences.
Sporadic arrests and trials of dissidents have continued.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the economic reforms of the last 20 years, allowing more
private enterprise and foreign contacts, have seen Chinese gain
steadily more freedom in their personal lives. They have more
access to outside information than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   In private seminars and in some scholarly journals there is
lively, if carefully worded, debate about political alternatives.
It is too soon to tell whether those limited discussions may now be
curbed.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, national leaders stressed that they intended to
continue China's economic opening to the West, seen as vital to
China's modernization.
</P>
<P>
   But the bombing of the embassy in Belgrade may have strengthened
hard-liners in the Communist Party and its military, who already
felt that President Jiang Zemin was too cozy with the United
States. If China takes a more aggressive and anti-American
international stance, many liberals worry about harmful fallout for
domestic freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   Politics at the top remains opaque to outsiders, and no clear
evidence has surfaced of a serious split in the leadership, which
even before last week did not hesitate to stamp out any open
challenges to Communist Party rule.
</P>
<P>
   In coverage of the embassy bombing, the memorial services for
the three people who were killed and other events over the last
week, the official media have featured Jiang as the resolute
national leader. He may be scrambling to avoid appearing soft on
the West, particularly if party leaders who are more prone to
confronting America abroad and clamping down at home have been
strengthened.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the Communist Party is mounting new attacks on
Western ideas about human rights. Sunday's issue of the popular
newspaper Beijing Youth Daily carries an essay that reads,
``Chinese will have to emancipate themselves from the modern
superstition of blindly copying the West and blindly yielding to
the values of the United States.''

IN CHINA, A QUIETER ANGER LINGERS OVER EMBASSY BOMBING 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Anger continued to percolate here Sunday over the NATO
bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, even as both Chinese
and American officials gave signs that the height of the crisis had
passed.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the Chinese newspapers all carried front-page
articles about President Clinton's Friday night phone call to
President Jiang Zemin, who had refused to accept earlier calls from
Clinton since the bombing. And on Sunday, the People's Daily
featured stories about the need to strengthen China, rather than
about American ``imperialism'' and revenge.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Prime Minister Li Lanqing told a visiting diplomat Sunday
that the Chinese government still firmly supported ``reform and
opening up.'' That is the catch phrase used to describe the
pro-Western, market-oriented economic policies of the last 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Sunday, the U.S. ambassador to China, James
Sasser, who has worked hard at nurturing closer ties with Beijing,
said the relationship between China and the United States was not
lost and could be repaired over time. He noted that there had been
many points of contact between the countries in recent years, from
joint-venture businesses to military exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bridge is superficially still quite damaged, but it's
structurally sound,'' said Sasser, who spent four days stuck inside
the embassy here during the protests. ``There are a lot of things
that are still in place here, even though there's got to be a time
to get over things, a time of healing on both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, five days after the end of angry demonstrations that
left both the U.S. and the British embassies in shambles, the roads
of the leafy embassy district were filled with the usual mix of
cars, bikes and pedicabs. The police presence was still heavy,
though, and several blocks around the damaged U.S. Embassy remained
closed.
</P>
<P>
   The official New China News Agency on Sunday pointedly wrote
about American businessmen and tourists visiting Beijing,
apparently in an attempt to emphasize that visiting Westerners
would be safe. The U.S. Embassy in Beijing will partly reopen on
Monday, although many areas will remain temporarily closed _
including its busy visa section, which was damaged by stones in the
protests.
</P>
<P>
   But it is hard to overstate the quiet rage directed at the U.S.
government that still burns inside many Chinese and that found
protean displays this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Two quickie books on the embassy bombing, which killed three
Chinese, are already out and have become instant best sellers.
Their titles, ``Chinese People Cannot be Pushed Around'' and
``China Cannot Be Bullied,'' give a sense of the popular mood.
</P>
<P>
   China's state-run television stations substituted old home-grown
films, or even Yugoslav war epics, for the many American movies and
sitcoms usually on China's airwaves. CCTV-5, the central
government's sports channel, replaced popular National Basketball
Association games with Filipino basketball, noting that because of
the bombings the network had pulled ``certain shows.''
</P>

<P>
   At one university campus, about 20 percent of students scheduled
to take the English proficiency exam required by Western companies
and American universities did not show up on Saturday, according to
the Beijing Youth Daily.
</P>
<P>
   But the mood seems to have shifted away from one that mixed
anger, xenophobia and a desire for revenge to a more
forward-looking impulse _ a shift that has been actively promoted
by China's leaders and the government-run press in the last two
days.
</P>
<P>
   The news media have been urging students to convert their angry
energy into hard work and study in order to build a stronger China,
and several have advocated continuing the ``road of opening up and
reform.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday night at Beijing University, where students
organized anti-American protests last week, there were still many
impromptu discussions about the meaning of the bombing and how
China should proceed.
</P>
<P>
   Students say they are angry that the Western press has not
carried more about the Chinese people who died in the bombing _
newspaper and news service employees whose pictures now adorn
campus bulletin boards.
</P>
<P>
   Also, many students refuse to believe that the bombing was a
mistake. It is inconceivable that the world's highest-tech army
could commit such a blunder, they say.
</P>
<P>
   Most are sure that it was an intentional act by NATO or the
United States or at least some faction of the American command that
wants to see China undermined. The latest Internet ``news'' from
China is that a B-2 bomber flew straight from the United States to
bomb the Chinese Embassy, without NATO's knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the pure anger is increasingly tinged with pragmatism.
``I think the hatred will be deeply rooted in the young
generation's hearts _ though it is not toward the American people
but the American government and its values,'' a student at Beijing
University said this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   But he added that most students would still support the current
policy of engagement with the West, adding, ``They understand that
the reform and opening is good for them individually as well as for
China.''

IN A DEGAS SHOW, IMPRESSION OF NEW ORLEANS' TANGLED PAST

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Charles Musson, an engineer for an oil company
here, stood in front of a portrait of a child at the New Orleans
Museum of Art, astonished. The painting, of a well-groomed
dark-eyed boy of 9, dates from 1855. The painter was Edgar Degas,
then 21. The subject was Degas' brother Rene.
</P>
<P>
   Musson, 47, is Rene's great-grandson and thus perhaps in the
most direct line of descent from the painter himself, who never
married or had children. But if the thread that connects him to art
history is slender, it is also vivid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both my daughters look exactly like him,'' Musson said. ``Same
nose, same eyes, everything.'' It might well be said that the same
oblique but penetrating relationship exists between Edgar Degas and
New Orleans, the city where his mother was born and which, despite
only a single visit by the artist, now claims him as one of its
own.
</P>
<P>
   It is a relationship underscored by the exhibition Musson was
viewing, ``Degas and New Orleans: A French Impressionist in
America,'' which presents roughly 40 of his works and is the
centerpiece of Louisiana's celebration of 300 years of French
presence here. Both by what it includes and leaves out, the show
resonates with the character of a boisterous, mysterious city where
tangled social currents can flow unnoticed for generations.
</P>
<P>
   Sex, money, politics, race. They were all roiling concerns in
Degas' extended family, whose members were the focus of his work
during his visit here in the winter of 1872-73, and who, to judge
from the paintings, he saw in a troubled light: the men engaged in
business, fending off financial calamity; the women in melancholy
isolation at home, the children in seemingly aimless play.
</P>
<P>
   But there was even more going on than Degas portrayed. Almost
spookily, one of his paintings foreshadowed disaster in his
brother's marriage, a rupture so severe that Rene's descendants
would renounce the Degas name. (Rene spelled it De Gas.) And what
Edgar didn't paint was nearly as telling; a branch of the family,
living within the city then and now but only peripherally addressed
by the museum show, was black. In subsequent years, that line of
the family had a split of its own.
</P>
<P>
   The museum ``chose to embrace one opportunity and in doing so
missed another,'' said Christopher Benfey, a cultural historian who
has written at length about New Orleans. ``It's a very interesting
show about a very interesting detour in the history of French
Impressionism. The opportunity it misses is the degree to which the
Degas visit was a complex New Orleans story involving all the
divisions within the city.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago a book by Benfey, ``Degas in New Orleans,'' set
the city astir by revealing that a branch of the Degas family in
this city is descended from a black woman, Constance Vivant, who
had six children with Vincent Rillieux, a brother of Degas'
maternal grandmother. One of the children, Norbert Rillieux, became
a prominent engineer responsible for advances in sugar refining.
</P>
<P>
   Benfey's book went on to point out the membership of several of
Degas' close relatives here, including Rene, in the Crescent City
White League, a fundamentally racist group bent on wresting
political power from the more diverse (if no less corrupt)
post-Civil War carpetbaggers.
</P>
<P>
   That the mix of race, family and politics at least obliquely
concerned the family at the time of Degas' visit seems
indisputable; and that the family would not know of Norbert
Rillieux, given his achievements, is unlikely. Degas himself wrote
frequently in his letters home about black people observed in the
street, black women taking care of white children.
</P>
<P>
   But with the exception of one partly obscured figure in one
painting, he didn't paint them. In his book Benfey argued there
were psychological implications to this disjunction, and he
recalled that argument in a catalog essay for the exhibition, which
runs to Aug. 29. ``In summary, the exotic for Degas hit a bit too
close to home,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond this and other catalog references the exhibition pays
scant attention to the racial context of the New Orleans paintings.
And although several Musson descendants were invited to the museum
opening and gala, no effort was made to locate and invite the
descendants of Vincent Rillieux and Constance Vivant, some still in
the city and listed in the phone book. It was not until after the
opening that their identities became known to museum officials, who
then invited them to a reception of their own, to be held later
this month.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the Rillieuxes nor the Mussons knew of each other before
Benfey's book; they have still never met. And in interviews,
several Rillieuxes, all aware of their ancestor Norbert, seemed
happier to be invited in the end than they were angry to have been
excluded initially.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't really upset,'' said Dolores Rillieux Turner, a
special education teacher. ``It bothered me in a way. I think we
should have been recognized, but not to the point where I was
upset.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, Ms. Turner said, the more pressing split in the family
was not between the Rillieuxes and the Mussons, but between the
light-skinned Rillieuxes and the dark-skinned Rillieuxes, who over
the course of generations have never reconciled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's some story,'' said Edwina Rillieux, whose husband,
Sidney, is Dolores' brother, and who has traced the family history
as far back as Edmonde Rillieux, Norbert's younger brother. ``My
husband had white cousins who lived within walking distance of us,
and we didn't know them. My husband and his brothers and sisters
don't know too much about his daddy's side. It was a hush-up thing
in the family.''
</P>
<P>
   Museum officials seemed puzzled by the suggestion they were
insensitive. The Rillieuxes were never part of the research for the
exhibit because they had no direct connection to Degas' art, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are an art museum, not a history museum,'' said Sharon
Litwin, the assistant director for development. ``We focused on the
lineal descendants of Rene De Gas. We couldn't and didn't focus on
lateral parts of family and their association because they didn't
have any art.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``There's a great deal of research still to be done,
and I hope it will be done, by the appropriate institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, half of a six-figure grant from the financial
services company, Lazard Freres, that supported the exhibition went
to Dillard University, a historically black institution here, to
underwrite a summer symposium on the Afro-Creole community in New
Orleans. Michael L. Lomax, the president of Dillard, who is also a
new museum board member, was critical of the exhibition
nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a long history of interracial mixture in this
city, but it's not something discussed or acknowledged very much,''
he said, speaking carefully about what he obviously considered a
delicate matter. ``So in one sense it's not unusual that the
Mussons had an Afro-Creole side of the family with descendants
alive today. And it's not unusual that it's not acknowledged. What
gives it an unreal quality now is that there's a been a book
written about it. It seems highly unusual that only part of the
story is told. In an otherwise superb exhibition, it isn't really
acceptable that the African element of the French presence here is
not acknowledged.''
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   Edgar Degas arrived here at the end of October 1872. He was 38
and not yet famous, having only begun to explore his great
subjects: the dancers, the horse races. He came here to visit his
uncle, Michel Musson, who had rented a mansion on Esplanade Avenue.
Edgar's own brothers, Achille and Rene, had preceded him across the
ocean, and Rene had not only joined Michel's cotton business but
also married his daughter, Estelle.
</P>
<P>
   Before he returned to Paris the following March, Edgar worked on
two dozen or so pastels, drawings and paintings, 17 of which are in
the exhibition. Virtually all are indoor scenes (he was having
trouble with his eyes, which pained him in the harsh winter light),
and only one is an acknowledged masterpiece: ``A Cotton Office in
New Orleans,'' lent by the Musee des Beaux-Arts in Pau, France.
</P>
<P>
   But the portraits of unidentified invalids and particularly of
his cousins, Michel's three daughters _ Mathilde, Desiree and
especially Estelle _ show a side of Degas that has rarely been so
scrutinized. The paintings are not merely pensive; they are,
overall, very sad and created not only with intellect but also
empathy.
</P>
<P>
   Estelle, who lived until 1909, led a tragic life quite nobly.
Several of Edgar's studies of her are included in the exhibition,
the first of which dates to 1865, in France. She was in mourning
after her first husband had been killed in the Civil War, leaving
her alone and pregnant at 20. This, along with several later
paintings, shows Estelle as beautiful but grim; in two different
pictures she is portrayed in a corner, hemmed in by furniture and
competing for the viewer's attention with a vase of flowers; in
another, she is posed on a couch, off center, looking away into the
distance. She always seems to be bearing great trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Estelle is the heroine of this exhibit,'' said Gail
Feigenbaum, the museum's curator of painting and the show's chief
curator.
</P>
<P>
   It was in France that Estelle and Rene fell in love, and he
brought her back to New Orleans. Shortly thereafter she lost her
eyesight; then, five years after Edgar's visit, Rene left her and
their children for a neighbor, America Durrive Olivier, who was
married herself and with whom he returned to France and had a
second family.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal split the family; Edgar and Rene did not speak for
years, and the surviving children reclaimed their mother's maiden
name, Musson, as their own. Rene's two sets of children were
reportedly unaware of each other, and when he died in 1921, the New
Orleans family sued the French family for its share of the
inheritance.
</P>
<P>
   The rift is recalled in a painting titled ``Children on a
Doorstep,'' which provides a view through the back doorway of the
house on Esplanade. It is both an eerie and eerily prescient work,
in which children are distractedly playing but none of the faces
are as cleanly etched as that of the family dog, and in which the
house visible through the door is the Oliviers'.
</P>
<P>
   The Esplanade house, where as many as 18 people were living
during Degas' visit, has been out of the family's hands since 1885.
In 1920 a real estate developer split it in two. Despite the public
attention now focused on the artist, it is a private organization,
the Edgar Degas Foundation, which receives no government or museum
funds, that is renovating the site for public view. Its founder,
David E. Villarrubia, an airline pilot, is renting upstairs
bedrooms to tourists to pay for the renovation.
</P>
<P>
   The painterly gene has not traveled the generations well; few in
the family are artistically inclined. One who is, Emma Glenny, a
great-granddaughter of Rene and Estelle, lives in Baton Rouge, La.
``I'm a potter,'' she said. ``How can you be a painter in this
family?''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless the slender connection endures. ``The first thing I
ever drew was a galloping horse,'' Ms. Glenny said. She was
referring to one of Degas' bronze sculptures that she grew up with
in the home of her grandfather Gaston Musson. He was the son of
Rene who, after his father's absconding, discarded the family name.
</P>
<P>
   The sculptures, a set of 10 wax figures _ horses, dancers,
bathers and a woman holding a basin _ were bronzed after Degas'
death in 1917. There were three such sets, one of which was made,
at Rene's direction, for the American side of the family. Of the 10
figures, the museum has one, a small walking horse, a gift from
Gaston Musson; the rest were sold to collectors before his death in
1953. They constitute the sum total of Degas' works that devolved
to the family in America.
</P>
<P>
   Gaston's grandchildren remember playing with them and recall
that when company came, their grandfather, to show off, would flip
cigar ashes into the basin. In any case, no one in the family got
rich from the sale of the bronzes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been able to authenticate this,'' said Edmund
Martin, Gaston's grandson, a retired advertising man who lives in
Lynchburg, Va., ``but I think it was for $750 each.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter from here to a friend in Paris, Degas wrote,
``Louisiana must be respected by all her children, and I am almost
one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   And so he almost remains. In the end, it seems, the artist's
legacy in New Orleans has something of the ineffable quality of New
Orleans itself. As Charles Musson remarked, looking at the portrait
of Rene but thinking of his daughters, ``I'm amazed at how we
haven't lost the look.''  &QL;

`MACARTHUR': THE GENERAL AT THE CENTER OF THE STAGE

<P>
   For Douglas MacArthur, ``theater of war'' was more than just a
casual image. Throughout his often brilliant, often contentious
career, he saw himself at stage center, the protagonist of battles
against his country's enemies and his own military and civilian
superiors. With his orotund phrases (``Let no heart be faint. Let
every arm be steeled.''), selected props (the riding crop, the
battered cap, the corncob pipe) and an affection for the
first-person singular (``I shall return''), he was never the model
American general, yet for many he was an inspiring leader of
American forces through momentous decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``MacArthur,'' the four-hour portrait that begins Monday on
``The American Experience,'' tells his story from his years at West
Point at the turn of the century and his courageous service in
World War I through his early defeats and ultimate victories in
World War II to the confrontations with the White House that ended
his military career. Although far from uncritical, Austin Hoyt's
carefully balanced approach does justice to MacArthur's tactical
abilities even as it takes account of a political obtuseness that
at times verged on megalomania. Along the way are glimpses of him
as an affectionate father and something of a ladies' man, with a
mistress called Dimples.
</P>
<P>
   By the outbreak of World War II, MacArthur had already had an
eventful, controversial career. His use of force in 1932 to disband
World War I veterans who marched on Washington to demand their
bonuses brought him a worrisome reputation as an aspiring general
on a white horse. President Franklin D. Roosevelt called him one of
the most dangerous men in America.
</P>
<P>
   MacArthur's main aide during his time as Army chief of staff was
Dwight D. Eisenhower, an officer of strikingly different
temperament and style. MacArthur would later deride Eisenhower as
``the best clerk I ever had,'' to which the man who became his boss
cracked back, ``I studied dramatics under MacArthur for seven
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of Monday's two hours is given to the ordeal of America's
early defeats by Japan on Bataan and Corregidor. Tuesday night
brings a sharp look at military politicking as MacArthur, who led
the war against Japan, fought against giving precedence to the
European front. After fulfilling his promise to return to the
Philippines in victory, he showed new qualities in the occupation
of Japan. Although President Harry S. Truman called him in his
diary `` Prima Donna, Brass Hat, Five-Star MacArthur,'' he was
widely praised for his success in setting Japan on the road to
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's two hours also cover the Chinese entrance into the
Korean War, which sent U.S. troops on a 300-mile retreat.
MacArthur, courting Truman's Republican critics, went public with
his complaints about the conduct of the war and, in a memorable
confrontation between military and civilian authority, was
dismissed. As the newsreels of cheering crowds and admiring members
of Congress confirm, his return home was triumphant. But in his try
for the 1952 Republican presidential nomination, voters showed a
strong preference for his less flashy, less unsettling sometime
clerk.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, MacArthur's son, Arthur, turned away from family
tradition, did not enter West Point and went on to study
literature, opera and theater, which may be taken as a tribute to
his father, the performer.

A FESTIVAL OF MYSTERIES IN NEW YORK  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In 1841 Edgar Allan Poe wrote ``The Murders in the
Rue Morgue,'' inspired by events in New York City, thus becoming
the father of the crime fiction genre and insuring the city's place
on the literary mystery map.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend 300 scholars, academics and fans of mystery fiction
will gather at the New-York Historical Society to honor Poe and
celebrate New York's crime fiction legacy at the first New York
Festival of Mystery, called ``Murder in the City.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted a fan conference and an academic conference,'' said
Harold Augenbraum, the director of the Mercantile Library of New
York and an organizer of the festival. ``This will cross the two.''
</P>
<P>
   The conference will include symposiums on traditional authors
like Poe and S.S. Van Dine as well as contemporary writers. On
Sunday walking tours will visit sights mentioned in the fiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an S.S. Van Dine story, a character takes a taxi from
Irving Place up to Grand Central Station, where the murderer is
hiding at a gate on the street,'' Augenbraum said. ``You read about
a location in a story, then you go out, and there it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Tickets to the event are $75 and can be ordered through the
Mercantile Library of New York at (212) 755-6710.

COMMENTARY: AN UNCIVIL WAR BETWEEN THE MUSICAL SPECTACLE AND
RITUAL  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MARGO JEFFERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There is certainly a civil war going on in the
American musical theater. On one side is the musical as a big
costly spectacle, mobilized to overwhelm the audience with sets,
special effects and choreography that alternates tableaux with
frenetic aerobics. On the other is the musical as a vocal and
physical ritual, featuring human beings with personality and
sometimes even character, people with voices and bodies that
receive and transmit rhythm and melody, whether singing and dancing
or walking and talking.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the struggle between the musical score as a
generic theme park or an entity as specific as any neighborhood. Of
course there is the individual song. Is it a cobbling together of
sure-fire phrases and harmonies?
</P>
<P>
   Or is it so exact in sound and shape that wherever it goes _
into a jazz club, onto a pop chart _ you know it? This tension
between adaptability and originality is what makes a popular song
classic.
</P>
<P>
   Now let's take two shows as examples of this war, extreme in
that they share the same subject but have nothing in common when it
comes to money invested, size or quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Civil War,'' currently on Broadway at the St. James
Theater, is a sluggish panorama meant to dramatize the war from the
viewpoint of Northerners, Southerners and slaves, with Frederick
Douglass thrown in as a tour guide, and the voice of Lincoln
sounding like that of a radio commentator. We see touching
19th-century photographs. We see strobe-lighted battles with
rolling bodies and smoking guns. We hear a score by Frank Wildhorn,
the man also responsible for ``The Scarlet Pimpernel'' and ``Jekyll
and Hyde.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Reunion'' had a cast of six, and a limited run in an Off
Broadway theater on Theater Row that is scheduled to close soon for
renovation. The production by Amas Musical Theater is actively
looking for new backers and a new space, both of which it richly
deserves.
</P>
<P>
   It is about the struggle of the North to mobilize politically,
militarily and emotionally, to decide, even as soldiers are dying,
just what it is fighting for and against. It has a frame that
reminds us just how obsessively _ from ``Uncle Tom's Cabin'' to
``Birth of a Nation'' to ``Gone With the Wind,'' ``Roots'' and
``Glory'' _ that we have turned our history into myth and show
business.
</P>
<P>
   The six characters in ``Reunion'' are members of a theater
troupe. Twenty-five years to the day after Lincoln was shot in
1865, they are presenting what the manager calls, with
blood-and-thunder gusto, ``A Musical Epic in Miniature ... the
story of the late war to save the Union, woven from the very words
of those engaged in that heroic struggle, bedecked with the
never-to-be-forgotten melodies of those tempest-tossed years.''
</P>
<P>
   The book is a documentary collage culled from multiple sources:
Lincoln and Douglass again, yes, but also soldiers, nurses,
journalists, slaves on the Underground Railroad, and Lincoln's
clever young secretary. Most especially there is his foe, in the
shape of an ally, the arrogant and imperial Gen. George McClellan,
who attempted his own kind of secession when he ran against Lincoln
for president in 1864.
</P>
<P>
   As for those ``never-to-be-forgotten melodies,'' they were sung
at the time, and you still know plenty of them: ``Steal Away,''
``Wasn't That a Wide River,'' ``Tenting on the Old Camp Ground,''
``Beautiful Dreamer,'' ``John Brown's Body'' and ``Battle Cry of
Freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   The show could easily have become a precious little artifact, a
museum piece in miniature. Instead it became a small packed theater
of war, a series of strategic encounters of history, minstrelsy and
melodrama; of music as entertainment, catharsis and patriotic gore;
of a small band of players and a vast national enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile ``The Civil War'' joins what I consider an infamous
band of musicals like ``Titanic,'' ``Miss Saigon,'' ``The Phantom
of the Opera,'' ``Beauty and the Beast'' and ``Sunset Boulevard.''
The spectacle becomes the story, and the music is a gaudy melange
of styles borrowed from others and adaptable, with some changes in
lyrics and orchestrations, to almost any story.
</P>
<P>
   Self-importance is what unifies the elements of Wildhorn's
score. The self-importance of third-rate musical theater
declamation; of faux-humble balladeers like Garth Brooks; of
spirituals sung with an air of ``I can be dignified but I can
display Negro abandon'' (though the presence of a calypso beat at
one point was baffling), and of 1960s rock guitar solos (meant here
to convey anguish on the battlefield).
</P>
<P>
   Let us say, then, about the big Broadway musical today what
Abraham Lincoln's secretary said about the United States during the
war: ``The world has seen its iron age, its silver age, and its
golden age. This is the age of shoddy.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly my point isn't simply that ``Reunion'' deserves a second
chance; it is that small, inventive musicals, with period or
original scores, with fictional or nonfictional books, must have
enough time and space and money to find their audience and not only
in New York. These are the kinds of works that can and should be
seen across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the most interesting ones I have seen in the last few
months are what I will call chamber musicals. There was ``Running
Man,'' produced by the Music-Theater Group in association with the
Here Arts Center in SoHo. It is a psychologically haunted family
elegy and romance, the tale of a lost son, a grieving daughter and
guilt-driven parents, with a book by the poet Cornelius Eady and a
complex, beautiful score by the jazz composer Diedre Murray. This
fall it goes to the new Prince Music Theater in Philadelphia, then
to the Brooklyn Academy of Music, followed by a national tour.
</P>
<P>
   There was ``Body of Crime II: A History of Women in Prison,''
produced at La Mama E.T.C. and, one hopes, bound for another space
soon. ``Crime'' is a puppet drama with music, and its creator,
Theodora Skipitares, is every bit as gifted and accomplished as
Julie Taymor of ``The Lion King.'' Her work is quite different
though.
</P>
<P>
   Large or small, her puppets have uncannily specific faces and
bodies, and sometimes those bodies open up to reveal even more
detailed interiors: visions of what these creatures are planning
and dreaming. She favors the documentary collage form, moving from
the Salem witchcraft trials to riots in Bedford Hills, N.Y., and
moving from rue to terror to wit.
</P>
<P>
   The score (music and lyrics) by Barry Greenhut contains some of
the smartest genre music I've heard recently: pungent and exact
renderings of 18th-century hymns, 20th-century blues and
extraterrestrial disco. (What's the difference between generic and
genre? Generic music repeats and dilutes; genre music reimagines.)
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime Broadway repeats and regurgitates whatever it
can gobble up from novels, history or movies. Look for ``Saturday
Night Fever'' this fall. Fasten your seat belts. It's going to be a
bumpy night.

<TEXT>
<P>
   HALEIWA, Hawaii _ The biggest economic fish caught in Hawaii
this year is not a new factory or a high-tech software startup or a
planeload of Asian tourists, whose financial troubles continue to
keep them away. The biggest fish is David Hasselhoff, the hunky
head lifeguard of ``Baywatch,'' which is to begin filming here in
July, rechristened ``Baywatch Hawaii.''
</P>
<P>
   To a state struggling through the seventh year of a sluggish
economy, the arrival of the ``Baywatch'' brand name _ the
syndicated show is seen in 140 countries and broadcast in three
languages in China alone _ is being heralded as a return to the
heady boom years when ``Hawaii Five-O'' and ``Magnum, P.I.''
symbolized Hawaii's international appeal and seemingly limitless
growth.
</P>
<P>
   The state Legislature appropriated $1.7 million to help build a
lifeguard station that will serve as a set in this sleepy surfing
village on Oahu's north shore, and a tank for filming underwater
shots, and Gov. Benjamin Cayetano himself negotiated concessions
from the Teamsters union to cut costs. The fight to win the show,
which was prepared to leave Los Angeles for Australia, was
front-page news for days this winter, and local television news
programs kept a nightly ``Baywatch watch.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got to help,'' said Mike Ells, as he and his young
daughter, Carly, ate a ``shave-ice,'' the delectable local version
of a snow-cone, on the back of his truck here one recent afternoon.
Ells, 49, came to Haleiwa from California 30 years ago to surf the
north shore's legendary waves, and now owns a business building
small trailers for boats and surfboards and renting electric
generators for construction. In 1990, he said, he had $2 million in
sales and 18 employees; last year, he had sales of $1.2 million and
a dozen workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``My generators don't rent because there's no projects to work
on,'' said Ells, who made sure he handed a prospectus offering his
services to the executive producer of ``Baywatch Hawaii,'' Gregory
Bonnan, at a town meeting one night to discuss the impact of
filming. ``I hope I can get some business out of it, that's for
sure,'' Ells said, grinning.
</P>
<P>
   Even Cayetano, who narrowly won re-election to a second
four-year term last fall after battling the economic downturn for
his entire tenure, cannot suppress a slight chuckle when the
subject of ``Baywatch'' comes up in an interview. But for the
governor and his colleagues in government, who hope the show might
generate $20 million for the local economy and produce 200 jobs,
those familiar red swimsuits and bronze skin are no laughing
matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Film and TV production has tripled in Hawaii since I became
governor,'' Cayetano said, and last year the Legislature passed a
bill giving special tax breaks to film and television productions
that come to Hawaii and use Hawaiian products or the state's name
in the show title. ``Hawaii has kind of overcome its image that
it's not an easy place to do business'' because of high costs and
union corruption, Cayetano said. ``It's a clean industry for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Baywatch'' deal was particularly attractive, Cayetano
said, because the show not only agreed to add ``Hawaii'' to its
name but offered a guarantee of two years' production here. ``It's
a very valuable piece of advertising for us,'' the governor said.
``We couldn't buy that kind of advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``Baywatch'' is still just a drop in the deep bucket of
Hawaii's enduring economic downturn, a downturn that many local
experts say portends permanent structural changes in an economy
that can no longer be expected to grow in the high single digits
each year, and that can no longer depend on tourism as the sole
engine of growth. Indeed, statewide hotel occupancy figures ticked
up just slightly for the second consecutive month in March _ after
a year of monthly declines _ but only because of an increase in
travelers from the mainland and Europe, and discounting at hotels
in Waikiki.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, local economists say, the state will be lucky to post 2
percent growth this year, and must look to diverse ``niche''
industries in fields from biotechnology to marine agriculture and
research if it is to prosper in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll never be the kind of employment engine that the visitor
industry was, or that the plantations used to be'' before the big
sugar and pineapple industries here were supplanted by lower-cost
competition from Central America and Southeast Asia, said Jack
Suyderhoud, a professor of business economics and associate dean of
the college of business at the University of Hawaii. ``But there
are some real prospects in diversified agriculture, by genetic and
seed companies that have latched onto the multiple growing season
here.''
</P>
<P>
   A larger conundrum, Suyderhoud said, is that Hawaiians have yet
to reach any real consensus as to what the future should hold in
terms of growth, and that each new proposal, whether for forestry
on the Big Island, new resorts or even film and television
production, brings an accompanying debate about its impact on the
environment and relaxed quality of life that drew many mainlanders
here in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the natural inclination is for people to want the best
of both worlds, which is wealth without the negative aspects of
wealth, like congestion and crime and the need to lock the door,''
Suyderhoud said. ``We as a community have had a really difficult
time deciding what we want.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In its annual session that just ended, the state Legislature was
heavily embroiled in political infighting, and the consensus view
of local critics was that it left the economy largely unaddressed,
though it did pass an excise tax cut intended to reduce the
``pyramiding'' pass-along effects of that tax on wholesalers.
Because of high transportation costs for consumer goods and fewer
economies of scale in an island chain whose total population is
just a bit over 1 million, the general rule of thumb is that
whatever costs $1 on the mainland costs $1.25 or $1.30 here.
</P>
<P>
   Bonnan, the ``Baywatch'' producer and creator, who retains his
30-year certification as a Los Angeles County lifeguard, said that
after 200 episodes shot in Santa Monica and Pacific Palisades,
Calif., it was time for a change of scene. But he said the show
could never have afforded to move here without the concessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Australia had made a significant proposal, and there it costs
about 62 cents on the dollar,'' said Bonnan, who was here last week
doing research and announcing the casting of three local hardbodies
_ two men and a woman _ as part of the show's new ensemble. ``This
is without a doubt one of the most expensive places, but the people
have made such a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Some locals in Haleiwa, which is no more than a wide place in
the Kamehameha Highway in Oahu that curves up to the north shore,
have worried that the filming will disrupt their own surfing and
patch of paradise, especially if tour buses come rumbling up the
road to show off the location to Waikiki tourists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it doesn't happen,'' said Ells, who has watched the
value of his house in nearby Mokuleia skyrocket from $135,000 in
1980 to $900,000 six years later and then plunge back down to
$450,000 now. ``But I'm willing to take the chance.''

<P>
   Jamie Shea, the NATO spokesman in Brussels, told reporters on
Sunday that Saturday night's sorties took out targets in Kosovo
including six Serbian tanks. NATO aircraft ``also focused on
armored vehicles, artillery pieces, other military vehicles, troop
concentrations, and military storage and command-and-control
facilities,'' Shea said at NATO headquarters. NATO also struck at
industrial facilities, including electrical power serving iron,
steel and copper plants, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Air defenses were relatively light, with just two surface-to-air
missiles fired as NATO flew 539 sorties, said Maj. Gen. Walter
Jertz, a NATO officer in Brussels. The pace of the air war was
somewhat lessened by bad weather, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of Defense William Cohen, appearing on the CBS News
program ``Face the Nation,'' said that it was still unclear what
happened near the Kosovo village of Korisa, where Serbian
government officials said that more than 80 civilians died in a
NATO air raid on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials have acknowledged attacking the site, saying that
the strike was directed against a military compound about 1,000
yards from the village, adding that the civilian casualties might
have been caused by Serbian commanders pressing refugees into the
area to serve as human shields.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether or not the Serbs moved in these refugees as human
shields is yet to be determined, but that's a very distinct
possibility,'' Cohen said. ``I think there's no level to which
((Yugoslav President Slobodan)) Milosevic and his troops won't sink
in terms of using these refugees as human shields and for other
purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   Shea said he could not corroborate an interview reported by a
German radio station in which an Albanian from Kosovo claimed to
have seen refugees herded by Serb forces into the area near Korisa,
where dozens of them were killed as they slept, apparently by bombs
dropped from NATO warplanes.
</P>
<P>
   But Shea said NATO believes, based on reports by Kosovar
Albanians, that civilians may be ``taken away and placed at
factories, at production plants, at airfields, at military bases,''
as so-called human shields.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of indications, but evidence is difficult,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shea also expressed concern at reports that the Yugoslav army
has been stopping refugees as they try to enter Albania from the
Yugoslav republic of Montenegro, whose government has leaned toward
the West and opposed Milosevic's tactics in Kosovo, despite being
Serbia's sole remaining partner in the Yugoslav federation that
Milosevic heads.
</P>
<P>
   On the CBS broadcast, Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, deflected questions about why Apache helicopters
sent to Albania weeks ago have not yet been deployed against
Serbian forces. The New York Times reported Sunday that the Apaches
have been withheld from action because senior Pentagon military
officers, fearing they would be too vulnerable, have resisted the
exhortations of Gen. Wesley Clark to deploy them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will be ready at any time that we are ready to use
them,'' Shelton said. ``Basically we will use them at a time and
place of our choosing.''

CHINESE LIBERALS HOPE ANGER AT EMBASSY BOMBING CAN BE USED FOR
THEIR CAUSE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (REPEATING for all needing to correct slug)  (rk) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ In assessing the impact of last week's nationalistic,
anti-American outburst on their cause, Chinese liberals and
political dissidents say there may be more immediate hard-line
attitudes from the country's leaders, but hope that the outburst of
activism will galvanize a generation forced to keep quiet for the
last 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   In the near term, NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia and the deadly
attack on China's embassy in Belgrade have caused some Chinese to
question the sincerity of American ideals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people will feel disillusioned about Western values, and
that will make it more difficult for people like myself who lean
toward them,'' said Yu Jie, a 26-year-old author of essays of
social criticism and a graduate student at Beijing University.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because they have no choice, many democracy advocates
are searching for a silver lining in the week's tumult, hoping that
political passions reawakened for the first time since the
Tiananmen Square pro-democracy demonstrations of 1989 may
eventually turn their way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had been said that people these days didn't care about
politics,'' said Wang Yongqing, a 57-year-old longtime dissident.
``But these events show that there is still a lot of passion about
the fate of the country,'' he said from his home in the southern
city of Hangzhou, where he and others are struggling to keep alive
the banned China Democracy Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether this turns out to be a force for good or not we'll
have to wait and see,'' Wang said.
</P>
<P>
   An anguished mix of emotions has coursed through those who
actively promote democratic values in China, ranging from liberal
scholars pushing the boundaries of tolerated discourse to the
smaller core of dissidents who court prison by posing a frontal
challenge to Communist Party rule.
</P>
<P>
   All say they shared the general anger and hurt over the bombing
of a Chinese Embassy by a supposed friend. But many also felt deep
chagrin as the patriotic fury of university students, traditional
harbingers of change here, was directed not at China's political
shortcomings but at the evils of the U.S. government, the main
champion of human rights.
</P>
<P>
   A leading liberal scholar said that ``those young faces looked
the same'' as those during the huge student-led demonstrations of
1989. He added: ``Everything looked the same: the emotions, the
clothes, the banners. Except the slogans were different.''
</P>
<P>
   This scholar, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he hoped
that Americans would not overreact to the anti-American outburst,
which he regards as shallow and stoked by propaganda. ``The
students found a target for releasing aggression that had
accumulated over 10 years,'' he said. Since the crackdown in 1989,
he said, ``students have had no place to express their voice, to
speak out on their dissatisfactions with society.''
</P>
<P>
   Another liberal, an editor who was active in the 1989 movement
who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said, ``The
demonstrations have helped train the students in street politics,
and the long-term repercussions for the government are dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   In conversations in recent days, liberals and open dissidents
all were quick to note that the government had skillfully
manipulated public emotions through its control of the media, and
that alternate voices were suppressed.
</P>
<P>
   Yet many also acknowledged that the diet of inflammatory news
was so effective because it tapped into genuine nationalistic anger
that reflected the widely held view here that the United States
aims to prevent China from taking its rightful place as a world
power. This feeling could veer in unpredictable directions.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, political conditions were tightening this year
even before the bombing of the embassy in Belgrade. As June 4
approached _ the 10th anniversary of the smashing of the Tiananmen
Square demonstrations _ anyone known as a leader from that period,
and many of today's liberal intellectuals, were warned not to speak
with foreign journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, the fledgling China Democracy Party was nearly
extinguished as three leaders were given long prison sentences.
Sporadic arrests and trials of dissidents have continued.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the economic reforms of the last 20 years, allowing more
private enterprise and foreign contacts, have seen Chinese gain
steadily more freedom in their personal lives. They have more
access to outside information than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   In private seminars and in some scholarly journals there is
lively, if carefully worded, debate about political alternatives.
It is too soon to tell whether those limited discussions may now be
curbed.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, national leaders stressed that they intended to
continue China's economic opening to the West, seen as vital to
China's modernization.
</P>
<P>
   But the bombing of the embassy in Belgrade may have strengthened
hard-liners in the Communist Party and its military, who already
felt that President Jiang Zemin was too cozy with the United
States. If China takes a more aggressive and anti-American
international stance, many liberals worry about harmful fallout for
domestic freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   Politics at the top remains opaque to outsiders, and no clear
evidence has surfaced of a serious split in the leadership, which
even before last week did not hesitate to stamp out any open
challenges to Communist Party rule.
</P>
<P>
   In coverage of the embassy bombing, the memorial services for
the three people who were killed and other events over the last
week, the official media have featured Jiang as the resolute
national leader. He may be scrambling to avoid appearing soft on
the West, particularly if party leaders who are more prone to
confronting America abroad and clamping down at home have been
strengthened.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the Communist Party is mounting new attacks on
Western ideas about human rights. Sunday's issue of the popular
newspaper Beijing Youth Daily carries an essay that reads,
``Chinese will have to emancipate themselves from the modern
superstition of blindly copying the West and blindly yielding to
the values of the United States.''

NEW YORK CITY BALLET: GREEK TRILOGY OF BALLET IN A STRAVINSKY
MINI-FESTIVAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ANNA KISSELGOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two straight weeks of Stravinsky's music is not what you
encounter in concert halls nowadays. But that is what the New York
City Ballet has been offering since Tuesday, when the company
returned to its repertory programs following the 10-day run of
``Swan Lake'' that opened its spring season.
</P>
<P>
   The second part of the City Ballet 50th-anniversary celebration
has been divided into mini-festivals. The one devoted to
Stravinsky, which ends at the New York State Theater on May 23,
opened with the so-called Greek trilogy of Balanchine-Stravinsky
ballets: ``Apollo'' (1928), ``Orpheus'' (1948) and ``Agon'' (1957).
Stravinsky wrote the last two scores for George Balanchine. The
score of ``Apollo'' was commissioned by the Library of Congress and
originally choreographed by Adolph Bolm with a cast that featured
Gene Kelly's ballet teacher, Berenice Holmes.
</P>
<P>
   The version that Balanchine rechoreographed for Diaghilev's
Ballets Russes was whittled down over the years by Balanchine
himself at City Ballet. Whether the dancers can make sense of this
reductive staging is anyone's guess.
</P>
<P>
   How it is danced is more important than what it says. Nikolaj
Hubbe, magnificent in his vigor and virility as Apollo, understood
this perfectly. The muses were all more awake than last fall.
Pascale van Kipnis as Calliope had power and grand gesture. Jennie
Somogyi as Polyhymnia was superb in her spring and perfect pique
turns into arabesque. Yvonne Borree as Terpsichore overcame some
prissiness to capture the seductive playfulness of her role. Hugo
Fiorato gave the limpid score some needed verve in his conducting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Orpheus'' also has a vestige of a narrative pretext. It is a
difficult work, more lyrical drama than conventional ballet. Few
dancers can master its moments of stillness and significant
gesture. But this time proved exceptional, with Nilas Martins in
full command of the title role.
</P>
<P>
   Everything was there in his performance: Orpheus' poignant grief
over the death of Eurydice, the spellbound demeanor in his voyage
to Hades, the struggle of a masked Orpheus as he gropes to find a
Eurydice that he is not allowed to see. Helene Alexopoulos was
splendid, sensual and clinging to her partner in the celebrated
convoluted duet. Charles Askegard was rightly taut in his debut as
Orpheus' guide, the Dark Angel.
</P>
<P>
   Balanchine and Stravinsky discarded storytelling in ``Agon,''
whose title is the Greek word for contest. Instead they created a
mythological world of the future. With its complex structures in
music and dance, ``Agon'' is still one of the company's most
avant-garde ballets. Monique Meunier and Jock Soto were sturdy
rather than electric in the acrobatic pas de deux, nonetheless
creating all the right astounding shapes.

 &HT;    GORE OFFERS TEACHERS CARROT AND STICK
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON - Teachers should get more money and be held to
higher standards, Vice President Al Gore said Sunday in what was
billed as the first major policy address of his presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should treat teachers like professionals, we should pay
them like professionals, and we should hold them to high
professional standards,'' Gore said in a commencement speech at
Graceland College, a Mormon-founded
</P>
<P>
   The financial incentives would include $10,000 hiring bonuses
and higher pay. The higher standards would be imposed through
tougher licensing tests and weaker tenure protection.
</P>
<P>
   The new teacher policies were at the heart of his long education
agenda. Its two dozen points included suggestions that states offer
voluntary pre-school programs for every child, and that parents,
teachers and students be required to sign a disciplinary pledge on
the opening day of school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every one of these proposals will be fully paid for within a
balanced budget,'' Gore said, though he did not estimate what they
would cost.
</P>
<P>
   His blueprint was far more detailed than that of his only
visible challenger for the Democratic nomination, former Sen. Bill
Bradley of New Jersey. Bradley has said he will offer specifics of
his own education program in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said the hiring bonuses would go to older people who switch
to the teaching profession and to young people who join a new
``21st Century Teacher Corps,'' and teach for four years in ``a
school that needs your help.'' Today, that school would probably be
in either an inner city or rural area, where recruiting qualified
new teachers is most difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Teacher unions that have backed Gore in the past already favor
better pay and bonuses as well as tougher licensing tests. But they
have offered only tepid support for programs that weed out weak
teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Many other items on Gore's long list of proposals repeated or
extended suggestions that President Clinton has sent to Congress
for approval this year. For example, Clinton wants the average
class size in early grades limited to 18. Gore said he would reduce
class size in higher grades to 20.
</P>
<P>
   One completely new proposal was Gore's suggestion for creating a
new volunteer army of tutors and mentors who would help children
on-line, rather than in person.
</P>
<P>
   However, the vast bulk of Gore's proposals have been tested by
reform-minded officials ranging from Richard Daley, the Democratic
mayor of Chicago, to two Republican presidential hopefuls, former
Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Gore endorsed efforts to make schools ``gun free,
drug free, safe and secure,'' encourage adults to volunteer as
mentors, run after-school and summer-school programs, stress
``civic'' and ``character'' education, and use tests to prod
schools toward efforts to narrow the gap between whites and other
students in drop-out rates and scholastic achievement.
</P>
<P>
   However, unlike Alexander, publishing heir Steve Forbes of New
Jersey and several other GOP candidates, Gore opposes the use of
tax-paid vouchers for students in private elementary and secondary
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander scoffed at Gore's proposals as so detailed that they
amounted to proposing creation of a ``national school board.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants teachers whose qualifications would be set in
Washington,'' Alexander told Reuters news service in an interview.
``It's a question of who knows what's best - Washington or the
local school boards, teachers and parents.''
</P>
<P>
   Ari Fleischer, spokesman for GOP presidential candidate
Elizabeth Dole, said, ``She will look at the vice president's
positions, but she won't comment on them in a partisan or negative
way. She doesn't think education should be a partisan issue.''

LIFE IN LUDONY ON $16 A MONTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Varfolomeyev, without last letter `a', for family name cq. ) 
(DW) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUDONY, Russia _ Another spring, this one cold and raw, finds
Aleksandra Varfolomeyeva in her one-story wood house on the road
halfway between Pskov and St. Petersburg. She lives here with her
husband, her 40-year-old son, six sheep, two cows, two calves, a
horse, a piglet and a dog named Fog.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Varfolomeyeva, a vivacious 75-year-old with a gap-toothed
smile beneath a bright purple kerchief, spent her working life on
the local collective farm, for which she receives a government
pension of 400 rubles a month. Last year, 400 rubles were worth
$66. Today, that same sum is worth $16 _ that is, when it is
actually delivered to her door, in cash, by the postman.
</P>
<P>
   There were months last year, after the ruble crashed, when the
money simply did not arrive, turning Mrs. Varfolomeyeva into one of
the Russian government's many creditors. It was not the first time
the government has borrowed money from its people; by last October,
the pension debt had ballooned to 30.5 billion rubles ($3 billion
at that time), owed to 38 million retirees.
</P>
<P>
   Russian debts are a funny business, as big Western banks have
learned to their horror and chagrin. But Mrs. Varfolomeyeva long
ago stopped trying to figure out when she will get her money. As
she sees it, retrieving a pension from the backlog that has piled
up at the regional administrative center of Pskov is sort of like a
lottery. Either your number comes up, or it doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people have gotten their December checks,'' she said,
shrugging off the whole business with a sigh, and reaching for the
vial of nitroglycerin pills she keeps in her sweater pocket for her
heart condition. ``They are the lucky ones. I got my November one
just now, but not December. Some got it, others have not _ that is
the way it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, since January, the Pskov district _ one of Russia's
poorest regions, set in an idyllic rolling countryside _ has been
paying each month and slowly digging its way through its backed-up
pensions. At this point, it has paid up most of November, some of
December and on orders from Moscow, is adding 12 percent to the May
checks. Nationally, the pension debt, now officially down to 17.5
billion rubles (about $750 million), continues to shrink.
</P>
<P>
   But then again, so too does the value of the ruble.
</P>
<P>
   Like most rural pensioners, Mrs. Varfolomeyeva has dealt with
the vanishing ruble by trying to do without it. She pays 50 rubles
a month for a canister of gas for cooking and 10 rubles a month for
electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, her cash expenses are down to a bare minimum _ animal
feed (which has tripled in price in the past year), bread, salt,
sugar, flour, matches, soap, medicine and the odd tin of herring,
best eaten with boiled potatoes and onions for a special treat.
These are the things she buys when the ``store'' rolls into town on
the back of a truck.
</P>
<P>
   She cannot remember the last time she took a bus anywhere, let
alone to the ancient Russian city of Pskov, which lies about 60
miles to the south. ``Bus?'' she said, with a question mark in her
voice. ``Who can take the bus? Where can you go with this money of
ours?''
</P>
<P>
   Her life is here, on the one-hectare plot _ a bit less than two
and a half acres _ surrounding her cozy ``izba,'' a traditional
Russian cottage that through a back door, past the family outhouse,
spills into a dark, low-ceilinged barn. The barn itself is no
bigger than a small American living room but it is big enough for
the horse, the two cows and their month-old calves.
</P>
<P>
   The latest addition was the piglet, still unnamed, that was
bought the day after May Day, for 580 rubles. When the
Varfolomeyevs bought a piglet last spring, it cost 200 rubles. That
pig eventually ended up in the larder, helping the family get
through a winter that many here and abroad had feared would bring
Russia to the brink of famine.
</P>
<P>
   There was no famine here in Ludony last winter, and it is
doubtful that anyone in the Varfolomeyev family will go hungry next
winter either. Besides the pig, there is a newborn lamb and the two
calves, which will either be sold or eaten after a summer feasting
on the wide open pastures that stretch out behind a back yard
cluttered with chopped wood, a horse cart and a combine belonging
to the collective farm.
</P>
<P>
   An Arctic chill over the May Day holidays postponed the planting
season here in northern Russia, but Mrs. Varfolomeyeva has given
her tomato plants a head start, by spreading them across the
windowsills, table tops and other available surfaces in her
living/bed room. Come summer, she will take up her post on the
roadside, selling vegetables from her garden to passing motorists.
</P>
<P>
   The vegetables bring in extra cash, as does the milk from the
two cows. One of these came to the family in lieu of salary for her
son, whose wages at the local collective farm, when they are paid,
amount to 70 rubles a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sorry to say that our collective farm is in very bad
shape, and their salaries are miserly,'' Mrs. Varfolomeyeva said.
``I tell him he has to keep us alive because when we die, he won't
be able to live.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Varfolomeyeva has three other children, including a
daughter who lives with her family down the road a piece, and other
relatives, including a sister-in-law who came rushing into her
house, seeking help to find a runaway horse.
</P>
<P>
   These local events tend to block out the outside world, although
the war in Yugoslavia has beamed its way into Ludony via
television. That is the one feature of modern life shared by a
majority of households _ including those, like the Varfolomeyev's,
that lack both running water and a telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Varfolomeyeva is not one to pay much attention to politics,
despite the changes that have convulsed her country over the last
10 years. She was born in this village, married here, worked here
her whole life, and in the last years, has come to realize that
when all is said and done, not much has changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, my dear, we have never lived a good life,'' she
said, as she gave a visitor a reassuring pat on the arm.

Deborah Sontag.
</P>
<P>
   HAWAII-BAYWATCH (Haleiwa, Hawaii) _ The biggest economic fish
caught in Hawaii this year is not a new factory or a high-tech
software start-up or a new planeload of Asian tourists, whose
financial troubles continue to keep them away in droves. No, the
biggest fish is David Hasselhoff, the head-lifeguard of

   WRESTLING-POLITICS (Glastonbury, Conn.) _ There may soon be a
parade of professional wrestlers who hope to duplicate last fall's
upset victory by Jesse Ventura, formerly ``the Body'' of the WWF
and now the governor of Minnesota. With huge built-in followings
and a sweaty instinct for pleasing the masses, these candidates
hope to tap voters' disgust with the same old political faces.

   DRUG-TRIALS-II (Whittier, Calif.) _ Dr. Robert Fiddes' Southern
California Research Institute was one of the most corrupt research
enterprises ever discovered by law enforcement. And the abuses of
this one doctor point to weaknesses in the new system that has
developed in recent years for testing experimental drugs, which,
for thousands of private-practice doctors, has become a sideline
for making money. Part two of a two-part series. By Kurt Eichenwald
and Gina Kolata.

<P>
   NETWORKS-SITCOMS-MEDIA (Undated) _ The network process of
picking sit-coms for the fall season is taking place with an even
greater sense of urgency this year. Faced with a continuing loss in
audience and an explosion in technological advances, led by the
drive to connect the television set with the computer, the networks
are attempting to transform themselves into far more versatile
institutions. By Bill Carter.

JOHN MINOR WISDOM, JUDGE WHO HELPED TO END SEGREGATION, DIES AT
93  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: La., Fla., Ala., Miss., Texas and Ga. )  By JACK BASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Judge John Minor Wisdom, the New Orleans legal scholar who wrote
opinion after opinion that desegregated courthouses throughout the
South and put blacks on juries, in the voting booth, in state
legislatures and in integrated classrooms, died Sunday morning in
New Orleans. He would have turned 94 Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Wisdom wrote the opinion that allowed James Meredith to attend
the University of Mississippi. In 1967 he wrote the majority
opinion in another case, U.S. vs. Jefferson County, that, as he
recalled, ``really started affirmative action.''
</P>
<P>
   His wide-ranging judicial opinions over more than four decades
kept public schools open in Louisiana when officials tried to close
them rather than integrate, ordered Florida to desegregate even its
reform schools and told sports authorities to desegregate the
boxing ring.
</P>
<P>
   He accomplished this after President Dwight D. Eisenhower named
him in 1957 to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, a
jurisdiction that then included six states of the old Confederacy _
Louisiana, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Texas and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   It was four judges of the 5th Circuit whose opinions helped
shape the civil rights laws of the 1950s and 60s, changing the
South. Wisdom was the last survivor of the men who came to be
called simply the Four, a term used in a dissenting opinion by a
fellow judge from Mississippi who saw them as destroyers of the Old
South that he cherished. The others were Eldred P. Tuttle of
Georgia, John R. Brown of Texas and Richard T. Rives of Alabama.
All but Rives were Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The judges of the 5th Circuit amplified the mandate of Brown vs.
Board of Education, the epochal Supreme Court decision of May 17,
1954, that nullified state laws and state constitutional provisions
allowing or requiring the segregation of black and white students
in public schools because of their race. Among the Four's
trail-blazing decisions of the 1960s, most of them written by
Wisdom, were the following:
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1961, they struck down Louisiana's school-closing law,
after the St. Helen Parish voted overwhelmingly to close its public
schools rather than submit to desegregation.
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1962, they agreed that James H. Meredith had been turned
down for admission to the University of Mississippi because of his
race and they ordered Ole Miss to admit him. In the opinion of the
court, Wisdom wrote that university officials had ``engaged in a
carefully calculated campaign of delay, harassment and masterly
inactivity.'' Meredith became the first black ever admitted to the
university and the first black to go to public school with white
students in accordance with the Brown decision.
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1963, they ordered the desegregation of all public parks,
playgrounds, community centers and cultural facilities in New
Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1964, they struck down the jury-selection system in Orleans
Parish in Louisiana because, as Wisdom wrote, it ``operated to
exclude all but a token number of Negroes'' from jury lists. He
noted that ``no black ever sat on a grand jury or a trial jury
panel in Orleans Parish.''
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1965, they ruled that Louisiana's voter-registration law,
because of its written test on the Constitution, discriminated
against poorly educated black voters. Wisdom wrote: ``A wall stands
in Louisiana between registered voters and unregistered eligible
Negro voters. The wall is the state constitutional requirement that
an applicant for registration `understand and give a reasonable
interpretation of any section' of the Constitution of Louisiana or
of the United States. It is ... the highest, best-guarded, most
effective barrier to Negro voting in Louisiana.''
</P>
<P>
   He concluded that ``this wall, built to bar Negroes from access
to the franchise, must come down.''
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1966, they ordered Florida to desegregate its reform
schools and declared that no state could legally maintain
segregation in any school, whatever its mission.
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1967, they affirmed that six states within their
jurisdiction had to integrate their public schools from
kindergarten on.
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1968, Wisdom made what he regarded as the most important
opinion of his career in U.S. vs. Jefferson, in which the court
overturned the so-called ``Briggs dictum.'' This was the belief,
widely held by conservative judges in the South, that the
Constitution did not require integration but merely forbade
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Wisdom expressed his ``nagging feeling that it is not how far
blacks have come that is important but how far they will have to
go.'' He advocated ``the planned organized undoing of the effects
of past segregation'' and set in motion the philosophical framework
for what would come to be known as affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote: ``To avoid conflict with the equal protection clause,
a classification that denies a benefit, causes harm or imposes a
burden must not be based on race. In that sense, the Constitution
is color blind. But the Constitution is color conscious to prevent
discrimination being perpetuated and to undo the effects of past
discrimination. The criterion is the relevancy of color to a
legitimate government purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   The 5th Circuit made these rulings at a time when die-hard
segregationists were using everything from violence to subtle
evasion to resist change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our court rapidly desegregated every place that could be
desegregated: Buses, hotels, restaurants, parks, barrooms and
athletic contests,'' Wisdom recalled in 1982. ``Our court had
strong opposition from six state legislatures and state governors,
year in and year out. One year the state of Louisiana had five
extra sessions of the Legislature, each one designed to overcome
decisions of the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senators, congressmen, governors and local politicians
eventually changed their attitude toward minorities,'' he
continued. ``This is not attributable to a change of heart but to
the Voting Rights Act of 1965,'' which, he noted, enfranchised
blacks ``previously disenfranchised by many ingenious devices.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, in awarding Wisdom the Presidential Medal of
Freedom in 1993, said that his opinions ``advanced civil rights and
economic justice, and his inspired words echo throughout many of
this century's most significant Supreme Court opinions.''
</P>
<P>
   John Minor Wisdom was born in New Orleans on May 17, 1905, the
son of Mortimer M. Wisdom and Adelaide Labatt Wisdom. His father
was a member of the city's elite and proudly remembered marching in
the funeral procession of Robert E. Lee in 1870. In 1925 the son
received his bachelor's degree from Washington and Lee University,
where he had an interest in literature. He studied literature for a
year as a graduate student at Harvard University, but then entered
the law school at Tulane University, where he graduated first in
his class.
</P>
<P>
   He formed the law firm of Wisdom and Stone with one of his
classmates, Saul Stone.

UNDATED: Saul Stone.   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wisdom practiced law in New Orleans throughout the 1930s, and
then joined the Army Air Corps in World War II, serving in the
Office of Legal Procurement. He was discharged with the rank of
lieutenant colonel.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his early legal work dealt with business law. He
strongly opposed so-called fair-trade laws, legislation that
permitted manufacturers to set the retail prices of their products,
ostensibly to protect small retailers from competition from big
discounters. He told those attending the American Fair Trade
Council meeting in New York in 1953 that they could ``never sell
the American citizen on the justice or logic'' of fair trade.
</P>
<P>
   Wisdom, a long-time Republican loyalist who served in the 1950s
as a national committeeman from Louisiana, worked hard to open
doors to the Republican Party in the South. In 1952 he broke with
the more traditional Southern Republicans, who strongly supported
the candidacy of the conservative Sen. Robert Taft of Ohio for
president.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier that year, he and Eldred P. Tuttle, a lawyer in Atlanta,
had met at the request of Herbert Brownell, Eisenhower's campaign
manager, to organize a campaign in the South to support Eisenhower
for the Republican nomination against Taft. Wisdom and Tuttle
became co-chairmen of the Southern Conference for Eisenhower, and
each led pro-Eisenhower delegations that won contested fights for
credentials at the Republican National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   As attorney general in the Eisenhower administration, Brownell
became an important figure in selecting federal judges, and both
Tuttle and Wisdom were eventually put on the federal bench.
</P>
<P>
   One of the earliest civil rights cases Wisdom received after his
appointment came in 1959, when the 5th Circuit voided a Louisiana
ban on boxing matches between blacks and whites. The court's
decision was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   In 1964 he dissented from the 5th Circuit's majority opinion,
which upheld the tradition of revealing the race of all candidates
for public office on the ballot. The Supreme Court ultimately
repudiated the majority decision and upheld his position.
</P>
<P>
   Though most of the 5th Circuit's ground-breaking decisions
concerning discrimination were made in the 1960s, there were many
significant cases in the 1970s. Among them was a 1972 decision
striking down a Louisiana law barring biracial adoptions. ``It is
obvious,'' Wisdom wrote in the decision, ``that the Louisiana
statute making race a decisive factor in adoption subordinates a
child's best interest in some circumstances to racial
discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   Wisdom wrote several landmark opinions in employment
discrimination cases. In 1979, the Supreme Court adopted the basic
reasoning of his dissent in Weber vs. Kaiser Aluminum and Chemical
Corp. to uphold a hiring plan intended to overcome the effects of
past discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Not all his major decisions concerned race. In 1974, he wrote an
opinion that found that psychiatric patients as a class had a
federal constitutional right to adequate treatment when such
patients were committed against their will to state institutions.
</P>
<P>
   But to the end he felt that no opinion drew more fully on his
intellect and imagination than U.S. vs. Jefferson, which took
almost a year to formulate.
</P>
<P>
   By requiring ``the organized undoing of the effects of past
desegregation,'' he placed an affirmative duty on school boards to
develop desegregation plans. Including a model school desegregation
order, he served notice that ``the only school desegregation plan
that meets constitutional standards is one that works.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals wrote in a 1979 book, ``The Supreme Court from Brown to
Bakke,'' that Wisdom in ``Jefferson'' and related cases
``transformed the face of school desegregation law.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the storms that attended his civil rights decisions, he
attained such stature that in 1969, he was mentioned as a leading
candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court. Moderate Republicans advanced
his name after the Senate rejected President Richard M. Nixon's
nomination of Judge Clement F. Haynsworth, a candidate Wisdom
opposed.
</P>
<P>
   But Nixon's attorney general, John Mitchell, scuttled the idea,
reportedly complaining that Wisdom was nothing more than a ``damn
left-winger.''
</P>
<P>
   Wisdom once told a reporter in the 1960s, when the 5th Circuit
was issuing its most contentious rulings, his dogs were poisoned
and a rattlesnake was thrown in his back yard.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the liberal views about race and civil rights, he
maintained memberships in private clubs and Mardi Gras krewes that
discriminated against blacks and Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people I see in these clubs are the guys I went to school
with and have known all my life,'' he said. ``I would not resign
from any such club.'' He said, ``They know how I stand on these
matters'' and ``I certainly wouldn't change their views by getting
out of the club.''
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Bonnie Mathews Wisdom, and two
daughters, Kathleen Mathews Wisdom and Penelope Stewart Wisdom
Tose. A son, John Minor Wisdom Jr., died.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, when he was 89, the 5th Circuit building in New Orleans
was named for him.

JOHN MINOR WISDOM, JUDGE WHO HELPED TO END SEGREGATION, DIES AT
93 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: La., Fla., Ala., Miss., Texas, Ga.)  (Eds: Longer version has moved.) 
 (DW) 
 By JACK BASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Judge John Minor Wisdom, the New Orleans legal scholar who wrote
opinion after opinion that desegregated courthouses throughout the
South and put blacks on juries, in the voting booth, in state
legislatures and in integrated classrooms, died Sunday morning in
New Orleans. He would have turned 94 Monday.
</P>
<P>
   He had remained active throughout the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Wisdom wrote the opinion that allowed James Meredith to attend
the University of Mississippi. In 1967 he wrote the majority
opinion in another case, U.S. vs. Jefferson County, which, as he
recalled, ``really started affirmative action.''
</P>
<P>
   His wide-ranging judicial opinions over more than four decades
kept public schools open in Louisiana when officials tried to close
them rather than integrate, ordered Florida to desegregate even its
reform schools and told sports authorities to desegregate the
boxing ring.
</P>
<P>
   He accomplished this after President Dwight D. Eisenhower named
him in 1957 to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, a
jurisdiction that then included six states of the old Confederacy _
Louisiana, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Texas and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   It was four judges of the 5th Circuit whose opinions helped
shape the civil rights laws of the 1950s and 60s, changing the
South. Wisdom was the last survivor of the men who came to be
called simply the Four, a term used in a dissenting opinion by a
fellow judge from Mississippi who saw them as destroyers of the Old
South that he cherished. The others were Eldred P. Tuttle of
Georgia, John R. Brown of Texas and Richard T. Rives of Alabama.
All but Judge Rives were Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The judges of the 5th Circuit amplified the mandate of Brown vs.
Board of Education, the epochal Supreme Court decision of May 17,
1954, that nullified state laws and state constitutional provisions
allowing or requiring the segregation of black and white students
in public schools because of their race.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, Wisdom made what he regarded as the most important
opinion of his career in U.S. v. Jefferson, in which the court
overturned the so-called ``Briggs dictum.'' This was the belief,
widely held by conservative judges in the South, that the
Constitution did not require integration but merely forbade
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Wisdom advocated ``the planned organized undoing of the effects
of past segregation'' and set in motion the philosophical framework
for what would come to be known as affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, in awarding Wisdom the Presidential Medal of
Freedom in 1993, said that his opinions ``advanced civil rights and
economic justice, and his inspired words echo throughout many of
this century's most significant Supreme Court opinions.''
</P>

UNOFFICIALLY, WHITE HOUSE SUPPORTS BARAK VICTORY

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Clinton administration has maintained a
studied public neutrality in the Israeli campaign for prime
minister. But it has made little effort to conceal its interest in
a victory for Ehud Barak, the Labor Party candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Burned by his all-but-open endorsement of Shimon Peres, the
Labor candidate in the 1996 Israeli election, President Clinton has
said nothing in public about the contest between the incumbent
prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu of the Likud Party, and his
chief challenger, Barak.
</P>
<P>
   But there is scant doubt in Washington or in Israel about
Clinton's preference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Officially,'' one senior White House official said, ``our
position is that Israel is a sovereign country, we don't meddle in
its internal affairs, blah, blah, blah. We're not messing around _
not that I'm aware of. But we're not completely dispassionate, I
won't kid you.''
</P>
<P>
   As the election turned into a two-way race in its closing days,
Clinton's advisers were increasingly optimistic that Labor's
candidate would prevail.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt now that it will be decided tomorrow and
little doubt about the outcome,'' one senior administration
official said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   He sounded pleased at the thought that Barak might win outright,
without the need for a runoff in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   There seems to be no affection between Clinton and Netanyahu,
who won three years ago despite _ perhaps in part because of _
Clinton's obvious tilt toward Peres. The Labor candidate was the
political heir of the slain Yitzhak Rabin, whom Clinton idolized.
</P>
<P>
   The president appeared with Peres in Israel and in the United
States during the campaign and repeated Labor Party electoral
slogans almost verbatim, an act of interference that offended many
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   So this spring, the White House has given no obvious signal of
its desire for victory by Barak, who is seen in Washington as more
likely than Netanyahu to reach accommodation with the Palestinians.
That goal is much desired by the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   The first round of voting takes place Monday, with Barak holding
an edge in most polls.
</P>
<P>
   The signs of Clinton's pro-Barak leanings are subtle but
unmistakable. The president has held several well-publicized
meetings with Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, over the past
five months, designed to dramatize the White House's commitment to
rapid progress on the Israeli-Palestinian peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
   An administration official said that moderate voters in Israel
were worried about the state of relations between the United States
and Israel, which have deteriorated during Netanyahu's tenure.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the administration has been sending signals to
those voters that things would improve if Barak were elected.
``Dropping obvious hints has clearly had an impact in Israel and
the polling shows that,'' the official said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Clinton sent a letter to Arafat last month containing the
American government's strongest endorsement yet of an eventual
Palestinian state on land once occupied by Israel. He also urged
quick resumption of stalled peace talks between the Israelis and
the Palestinians, a course that Netanyahu has resisted.
</P>
<P>
   The goal, administration officials said, is to strengthen Arafat
in his struggle against Palestinian extremists and to position him
for the restart of negotiations with what the White House hopes is
a new government in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has often expressed frustration with
Netanyahu's slow approach to carrying out agreements reached at the
Wye Plantation in Maryland last October under Clinton's direction.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, at a White House event honoring the late Rabin earlier
this year, proclaimed in Hebrew, ``We need friends of peace.'' It
appeared to be a clear endorsement of the approach the Labor party
and other liberal blocs in Israel take to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, three political consultants close to Clinton are
advising Barak, writing advertisements, plotting strategy and
taking polls. The three advisers _ James Carville, Robert Shrum and
Stanley Greenberg _ were instrumental in Clinton's 1992 election.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Carville said in an interview that Clinton did not approve his
work for Barak in advance, but that Carville regularly briefs the
president on the progress of the Labor leader's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm all for aggressive neutrality'' by the White House,
Carville said, speaking by telephone from the Labor Party ``war
room'' in Tel Aviv. ``As for the president, well, all politicians
have personal preferences, of course.''
</P>
<P>
   One administration official involved in Middle East policy said
that the White House has been consciously avoiding the error of
1996, when the tilt toward Peres may have backfired and helped
bring about the election of Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   ``The focus this time is not on personalities but on the peace
process,'' he said. ``We're emphasizing the sense of Israel's and
the United States' long-term security interests.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he added, ``It's clear what we would like to see
prevail. We've been quite subtle about it, but no one has
misunderstood what we were saying. It was clear from the start.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Richard N. Haass, director of foreign policy studies at the
Brookings Institution and director of Middle East affairs at the
national security council in the Bush administration, said the
Clinton White House had learned a lesson from 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they've been careful essentially to keep their heads
down,'' Haass said. ``They tilted heavily the last time toward
Shimon Peres and it clearly didn't help. They realize it would be
counterproductive to make the same mistake as last time. They don't
want to give Mr. Netanyahu the argument that only he can stand up
to U.S. pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically,'' he added, ``the administration has gone into a
crouch.''

FOR NEW YORKER WRITER, LIFE TAKES A PAGE FROM HIS NEW NOVEL  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kurt Andersen knows everybody.
</P>
<P>
   Andersen _ a staff writer for The New Yorker magazine, a former
editor of New York, a founding editor of Spy magazine, a former
writer for Time and a member of Manhattan's Harvard mafia _ stood
in the center of the front room at Da Silvano in Manhattan a week
ago in a shambling blue blazer and greeted the guests filtering in
to celebrate his sprawling, multilayered, 659-page behemoth of a
premillennial novel, ``Turn of the Century.''
</P>
<P>
   A social satire set in 2000 that skewers cyberspace, television,
Wall Street traders, marriage and the media, ``Turn of the
Century'' defies tidy plot summary. In short, it traces the lives
of George Mactier, the producer of a television program that merges
journalism and entertainment (it's called ``NARCS''), and his wife,
Lizzie Zimbalist, a computer software guru-on-the-rise and their
three Internet-wise children; the story ends when a hacker breaks
into the Reuters computer system and broadcasts the false news of
Bill Gates' death. Every character is online, refers frequently _
in a nod to the vogue established by Bret Easton Ellis novels _ to
designer labels, and carries a mobile phone _ if not a
global-access, $3,000 Iridium phone.
</P>
<P>
   So it seemed a fitting marriage of fiction and reality that
several guests in Da Silvano, their Nokia phones emitting merry
digitized melodies, resembled their fictional counterparts in
``Turn of the Century.'' In an upended Mobius strip version of the
book, Andersen's media fishbowl of a novel was being celebrated by,
well, the media fishbowl. His book party could have been a scene
broadcast on the E!2 network, a cable channel in ``Turn of the
Century'' that offers 24-hour coverage of celebrity cocktail
parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been several moments of art imitating life, life
imitating art, imitating life,'' Andersen said the next day over a
lunch of fried liver at Orso. The incident with the most intense
reverberation between fiction and reality, he said, was when Page
Six, The New York Post gossip column, noted that the column was
used in the plot of the novel. In the novel, Page Six prints an
item about the character George Mactier but misspells his name.
</P>
<P>
   ``And in the real-life item, they misspelled his name, too!''
Andersen said. ``It was pure bliss for me. It pleases me that the
fit between the plausible fictional hyperreality and actual reality
is confusing.''
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the telescoping interplay between fiction and
reality, another sociological theme Andersen addresses in the novel
is the notion that technology has turned adults into perpetual
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``People talk about the idea of community on the Internet, but
that is not what it is all about. It's about instantaneity and
getting what you want _ boom, boom, boom,'' he said, politely
pounding the table like an anxious child and drawing the concerned
eye of a waitress. ``When you want it, now, now, now. The salient
thing about children is that they are really impatient about
everything. Now as adults we have contrived to create a culture'' _
with cellular phones, real-time e-mail, wireless Internet access _
``where we always feel we should be able to get something right
now. It's a culture of permanent childhood.''
</P>
<P>
   The 150 people gathered for Andersen's party appeared to bring
together everyone _ that is, everyone important _ Andersen has
known since he moved to the East Coast from his native Nebraska in
1973. The gathering on one side of the room showed off Andersen's
Harvard resume: Conan O'Brien; James J. Cramer of TheStreet.com _
fictionalized in the book as Ben Gould, a hysterical, eccentric
Wall Street trader _ former Massachusetts Gov. William F. Weld;
Walter Isaacson, Time's managing editor. Closer to the trays of
skewered squid canapes stood the media crowd: Graydon Carter,
Vanity Fair's editor, with whom Andersen founded Spy; Harvey
Weinstein, co-chairman of Miramax Films, whom Andersen once
lambasted in Spy; and Charlie Rose, the PBS talk-show host.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the third strand of his world: Ann Godoff, the
editor in chief of Random House, and Andersen's public-relations
guru, Leslee Dart, a partner in the powerful Hollywood firm PMK.
(PMK rarely publicizes projects as trifling as books, but, as
Andersen explained, Ms. Dart is a friend.)
</P>
<P>
   Andersen knows so many people _ in worlds where marriages,
partnerships and college alumni connections bind people together in
a close-knit manner that at least appears to encourage favoritism
among the members of their intersecting clans _ that when Time
magazine published a review of Andersen's book last Monday, the
reviewer included these opening lines: ``I know Kurt Andersen.
Everybody knows Kurt Andersen.'' The author, Daniel Okrent, added,
``I just know him less well than everybody else does, so it falls
to me to review `Turn of the Century.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Cramer _ whose own world paralleled ``Turn of the Century'' as
he took TheStreet.com public last week and made over $200 million
for himself _ assessed the risks of inhabiting such a cozy
universe. ``There is this triple-loaded meaning in the Kurt
world,'' he said. ``When you're in that milieu, that Vanity Fair
slash Harvard slash Kurt party thing, you seem trapped by others in
a world that seems to be of interest to only 14 people.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, at least a couple of movie studios have expressed
interest in ``Turn of the Century.'' Michael Ovitz didn't show up
at Andersen's book party, but he was supposed to. Kathleen Turner
showed with the screenwriter Bruce Feirstein. (He went to Harvard,
too.)
</P>
<P>
   ``She was the one famous person I didn't know,'' Andersen said.
``She asked me to sign her book. It was one of those surreal
moments where I felt like I was in some specific, high-end Disney
attraction where you can feel like a celebrity for five minutes,
having flashbulbs go off in your face while you sign a book for a
famous actress.''
</P>
<P>
   But Andersen _ as George Mactier would have been _ was pleased
by the party's final moments: The last two people at the bar were
George Stephanopoulos and O'Brien.
</P>
<P>
   ``And you know it's been a really successful party if the last
people to leave are celebrities,'' Andersen said.

EFFORTS TO REINVENT THE LOS ANGELES TIMES FALTER

 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Mark Willes, the chairman and chief executive of
Times Mirror Co., began a corporate meeting last September by
asking dozens of his top lieutenants how they felt about the
company's financial goals. As he watched the results tallied on an
overhead projector, his easy smile faded.
</P>
<P>
   Using a five-point scale _ five for very optimistic, one for
very pessimistic _ the tally showed a lot of threes and fours.
Times Mirror's executives were dubious about the company's ability
to achieve its aims. A major reason, participants said, was the
lackluster performance of The Los Angeles Times, the engine that
generates 40 percent of corporate revenues.
</P>
<P>
   At a later session, executives of other Times Mirror newspapers
wondered out loud how the company could increase revenue 5 percent
annually and profits 10 percent annually if The Times could not
match that performance.
</P>
<P>
   Willes, a former senior executive of General Mills who strode
out of the cereal business into the newspaper industry four years
ago, cutting costs, closing New York Newsday and attaching rocket
boosters to Times Mirror's stock price, has always made journalists
nervous. His revolutionary talk of reinventing the business raised
the specter that profit motives would endanger the integrity of
their work.
</P>
<P>
   Those fears have largely subsided. These days, the questions
focus on the business decisions Willes has made since he appointed
himself publisher of The Los Angeles Times 18 months ago. Even by
Willes' lights, his campaign to reinvigorate the flagship newspaper
is in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Signs of that trouble abound. Circulation growth has been the
prime directive of the Willes era, and daily circulation has grown
by 40,000, to 1.1 million, since Willes joined Times Mirror. But in
the last year circulation was flat and in April it declined.
Profits in 1998 were supposed to increase by 3.6 percent; instead,
they dropped about 15 percent, to about $165 million, according to
two people with access to the company's budget summaries.
</P>
<P>
   His widely debated system giving each newspaper section a
general manager or minipublisher to facilitate business and
editorial cooperation is in shambles. Meanwhile, two-thirds of The
Times' senior executives have raced, or been pushed, out the door
and most of their replacements are new to Los Angeles or new to the
newspaper business.
</P>
<P>
   Willes' frustration is evident, though his faith in his vision,
including the audacious goal of selling 500,000 more copies, for a
total of more than 1.5 million, has not waned.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we said 18 months ago was we've got to reinvent this very
large, very complicated newspaper,'' Willes said in an interview.
``There is going to be a large amount of change and breakage in the
process.'' But, he said, he is confident that the management team
now in place will be able to move the business in the right
direction. He has taken to reprising his old theme song: Businesses
that don't grow will die.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the agony we're going through,'' he said, ``is because
we're determined to grow.''
</P>
<P>
   The year's events shook his faith in some subordinates, and
theirs in him. Kevin Gruneich, an analyst at Bear, Stearns, said:
``There is no reason why things can't work, and with Mark taking
over the publisher's role at The Los Angeles Times, they should
work. The strategy has been fine. The execution has not.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that it is unusual for a radical change in business vision
to cause equally radical personnel shifts, which can disrupt the
business. The Times also was not a problem-free institution when
Willes arrived at Times Mirror in 1995; for several years its
executives had groped to reconcile a variety of business strategies
while struggling through harsh economic times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both the city of Los Angeles and the newspaper had been
undergoing a slow-motion nervous breakdown,'' said Steve Wasserman,
the book editor of The Times. ``The shattering of the defense
economy, the collapse of the retail economy, the 1992 riots, these
were body blows to Los Angeles' sense of itself. And the newspaper
has seen that many of the things it took for granted are up for
grabs. The demographics of its audience have changed enormously.''
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper's financial performance did improve in 1996 after
several years in the doldrums; in 1997, the year Willes added the
publisher's title to his business card, the newspaper's profits
soared.
</P>
<P>
   As publisher, Willes has made a number of visible moves. He
added 11 new business journalists and gave their section 200 more
pages of space a year. Competitors say the improvement is
noticeable; a month ago, two Times reporters won a Pulitzer Prize
for coverage of the entertainment industry.
</P>
<P>
   Local news coverage has been reshaped to win readers. The Times
cut its regional reporting staff and put its emphasis on a dozen
new ``Our Times'' newspapers, which give local communities, from
Yorba Linda in the south to Ojai in the north, everything from high
school sports scores to neighborhood crime reports.
</P>
<P>
   The Times also created a new health section and a separate
Hispanic news desk, with 13 journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Willes ticks off these initiatives with studied satisfaction.
But, he adds, ``If we were to find out how many additional readers
we've had because of this very expensive effort with the Latino
desk, I could probably count it on these fingers,'' as he held up
both hands.
</P>
<P>
   Some Times executives, dissatisfied with Willes' predecessors,
welcomed his fresh approach and optimism. But some of these same
managers are now gone. The pace of the exodus has quickened
recently; heads around the industry turned in late February when
Jaynie Studenmund, a banking executive who started work as a senior
vice president on Jan. 11, left after six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   All Ms. Studenmund would say was: ``This was a gut-wrenching
decision in large part because I do like and respect so many people
at The Los Angeles Times. And I do happen to like and respect Mark
Willes tremendously. But I concluded for me personally it was not a
match.''
</P>
<P>
   Seven others of more than 15 managers who have left recently
were willing to discuss their experience at The Times on condition
that they not be identified. Their most common criticism was that
management operated in a helter-skelter, ad hoc manner, with serial
strategies that produced one exhausting experiment after another.
</P>
<P>
   The most ballyhooed management change, one that sent a shiver
around many newsrooms, was the creation of general managers for
news and feature sections. The fear was that the general managers,
dealing with both editors and advertising executives, would have a
pernicious influence on journalism. Less noticed were worries in
the advertising department that sections would cannibalize one
another's ads.
</P>
<P>
   Neither happened _ possibly because the general managers found
themselves without influence, and now the ranks of the general
managers are turning over as fast as those of the senior vice
presidents.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a lot of turnover,'' acknowledged Leo Wolinsky,
one of The Times' four managing editors. ``I suppose one could
argue that every organization making a radical change goes through
this before settling down with the right team. But it's going on
all the time. And new people are coming in who have to learn what
the old people knew already. It's hard to get a head of steam up.''
</P>
<P>
   At its core, the issue was: What does a general manager do? As
one former general manager explained, ``In terms of controlling
revenues, the ad department reported somewhere else, not to us. How
can you be responsible for a profit-and-loss statement when you
don't control any levers?''
</P>
<P>
   Willes' new second-in-command, Kathryn Downing, 45, who had
earlier run the Times Mirror legal publishing division, agrees with
the criticism. ``We should have spent more time up front deciding
what their role was,'' she said of the general managers.
</P>
<P>
   Also, she said, the lines of authority were unclear. Now James
Helin, a new senior vice president and chief marketing officer,
will supervise them. Advertising department strategies are being
developed by John McKeon, another new senior vice president, who
worked for two decades at Newsday.
</P>
<P>
   The circulation department had different problems. By one former
executive's account, 1998 began with directives to grow at any
cost, which were supplanted by directives to grow but cut costs
ever more aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Willes and Ms. Downing said, the expensive direct-marketing
strategy _ telephone calling and door-knocking that pulled
potential customers from their dinner tables _ is being curtailed.
Subscribers who buy under those circumstances are less likely to
renew. More than 90 percent of new subscribers fail to renew,
forcing the sales staff to replace them just to keep circulation
figures stable.
</P>
<P>
   One new circulation strategy is joint distribution with
immigrants' newspapers like La Opinion, which The Times partly
owns, and Korea Times, the United States' largest Korean-language
newspaper, which started distributing The Times to some of its
20,000 Sunday readers a few weeks ago. But the net effect on
overall circulation is still unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Proving that the experimentation and executive churn contributed
to the newspaper's 1998 disappointing financial results would be
difficult, but it did not help. Still, the newspaper's operating
profit margin was 15 percent _ down from 18 percent in 1997, but
hardly embarrassing.
</P>
<P>
   The average price of Times Mirror stock was well below the
industry average in 1998, according to an index of newspaper stocks
developed by Bear, Stearns, but this year it is doing slightly
better than the industry average. The stock price closed down 18.75
cents on Friday, at $58.875.
</P>
<P>
   As high-margin help-wanted advertising leached away in 1998, ad
revenues fell well behind projections, ending the year at $881
million, $20 million less than projected, according to the two
people with access to budget summaries.
</P>
<P>
   This eventually led to cuts in news space in the newspaper. The
editorial department has lost about 3 percent of the space it had
in 1998, according to Michael Parks, the editor of The Times. The
front section and the metropolitan news section have been among the
most affected, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some respects it's made us make better choices, but in
other respects it does pinch,'' Parks said. ``When we need the
space we go and get it for major stories. Where it pinches is on
daily coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   It did not help that the newspaper was unable to account for
about 3,000 tons of newsprint, forcing the company to take a loss
of about $1.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   The financial disappointments came as regional competition from
newspapers sprinkled around The Times' large circulation area
intensified. And for the third time in a decade, The Times is
trying out a new local news strategy, relying on 12 new small local
``Our Times'' newspapers, published by a Times subsidiary and
distributed with The Times in specific communities, to win reader
loyalty for their big sister.
</P>
<P>
   The bet is that this hyperlocal approach will attract more
readers than the broader regional coverage. At the same time, the
staffs at regional editions in Ventura County and the San Fernando
Valley have been trimmed. These regional editions are edited as
separate daily versions of The Times with particular emphasis given
to news of regional interest, such as scores of area sports teams
and the woes of county governments.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, the Valley Edition's newsroom staff dropped from 111
full-time staffers and seven part-timers to 84 full-time
journalists. The Ventura Edition went from 32 to 29 full-time
journalists.
</P>
<P>
   As for the grandfather of the regional editions, the 34-year-old
Orange County edition, which competes with the dominant Orange
County Register for the area's wealthier readers, Willes said, ``I
don't honestly know what we're going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``What we're doing now is not working as well as it
needs to.''
</P>
<P>
   In reshaping the local coverage, the newspaper has also created
a two-tier salary system, with less experienced ``Our Times''
starting reporters paid $450 a week, less than half the starting
salary of a Times reporter. In some areas of Orange County, like
Brea and Laguna Hills, the Our Times editorial material is merged
with The Times metropolitan news section.
</P>
<P>
   While The Times' overall daily circulation increased by just 0.3
percent in the six months ended March 31, circulation in Ventura
County, which has three ``Our Times'' sections, grew by 3 percent,
according to Robert Magnuson, a senior vice president for the
regions at The Times.
</P>
<P>
   Willes is optimistic when he talks about such a harbinger of
circulation success. But his tone sometimes grows grim, when he
alludes to dire alternatives. In the Times Mirror 1998 annual
report, Willes was paraphrased as saying that if expectations of
growth proved unfounded, ``the result would mean dismantling the
company.'' In a recent interview, he said that the reference was
just a variant of the grow-or-die theme, nothing new.
</P>
<P>
   ``My frustration,' he said in a separate interview, ``has come
from not doing everything we could do to try things that have been
successful in other businesses. If we've tried all these things and
in four years they haven't worked, then they can say Mark Willes
did some damage before he left. But we haven't tried them yet.''

   GLASTONBURY, Conn. _ When Bob Backlund hits the campaign trail
as a Republican congressional candidate in greater Hartford, he
isn't asked about school vouchers or abortion or Kosovo, but about
the ``cross-face chicken wing.''
</P>
<P>
   Other politicians can only dream of leaping from behind the
lectern, throwing a noisy audience member into a hammerlock and
then twisting his arm behind his back. Backlund actually does it _
and the crowds bark and clap.
</P>
<P>
   Backlund, two-time champion of the World Wrestling Federation,
is leading a parade of professional wrestlers who hope to duplicate
last fall's upset victory by Jesse Ventura, formerly ``the Body''
of the WWF and now the governor of Minnesota. With huge built-in
followings and a sweaty instinct for pleasing the masses, these
candidates hope to tap voters' disgust with the same old political
faces.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of people that watch wrestling that don't give a
hoot about voting,'' Backlund said. ``But because of who's running,
they're going to vote. And when the people vote for me, they're
votin' for America.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom Davis, R-Va., chairman of the National Republican
Congressional Committee, said Backlund was part of a national
effort by the party to appeal to nontraditional voters. He said the
party also expected Jeff ``Skunk'' Baxter, former guitarist for
Steely Dan and the Doobie Brothers, to challenge Rep. Brad Sherman,
D-Calif., in the San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see 2000 as a great year for outsiders,'' Davis said.
``People may be tired of what's happening in Washington and want to
get some new blood in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Other wrestlers-turned-politicians include Jerry Lawler, a
current WWF star, who is pondering an independent bid for mayor of
Memphis, Tenn., in October; John DeFazio, once the WWF's ``Jumpin'
Johnny,'' who has the endorsement of the Allegheny County, Pa.,
Democratic Party in Tuesday's primary for a seat on the County
Council, and Harry Venis, a Democrat who wrestles as ``Dirty
Harry'' and was elected mayor of Davie, Fla., in 1996 and now says
he aspires to a statewide office.
</P>
<P>
   Backlund, a strawberry blond who played the good guy for most of
his career in the ring, said he could relate to disaffected voters
since he did not cast his first ballot until three years ago, when
he did volunteer work for the Bob Dole campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can show `em, `Hey, I didn't vote either, but I made a big
mistake. You can't complain if your taxes go up, because you're not
part of the system.' '' Plus, he said, he has the simple tastes of
the common man.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a candidate who simply shakes hands. At a recent
stop at Hooker Elementary School in Hartford, he was introduced to
Donna Liebman, a librarian who said she was a longtime fan. He
grabbed her in an airborne bear hug, then twirled her around as she
cooed with delight. In a list of accomplishments, his campaign
biography notes that he ``once lifted Hulk Hogan (302 pounds) over
his head with one arm.''
</P>
<P>
   Backlund is 49 but stays in chest-baring shape by starting each
day at 6 a.m. with a punishing regimen at his home in this woodsy
suburb of Hartford. His basement has a rowing machine, monkey bars,
a rack of barbells and tumbling mats.
</P>
<P>
   As he exercises, he listens to memory- and vocabulary-building
tapes.
</P>
<P>
   After an hour of Marine pushups, bench presses and hanging
upside down in ``gravity boots,'' Backlund bounded over to an
electric juicer and started pulverizing a dozen carrots, with a few
apple slices thrown in for variety.
</P>
<P>
   ``Breakfast,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite spending most of his adult life in tights, Backlund has
flirted with politics before. As the WWF candidate for president in
1996, ``Hail to the Chief'' blared when he entered the ring.
</P>
<P>
   But the Connecticut candidacy is no joke. Backlund, 49, has the
support of top party leaders and is expected to win the Republican
nomination next year. He has retired from wrestling in this country
(he still performs in Japan, where he has a big following), and has
set out to raise $1 million for the 1st District race against Rep.
John Larson, a first-term Democrat. Backlund said he may stage a
celebrity wrestling match as a fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   He is printing up T-shirts touting ``The Wrestling Republican,''
and may bring back his action figure.
</P>
<P>
   Backlund, who grew up in rural Minnesota, said his candidacy is
possible only because of Ventura. (In tribute, Backlund has deleted
a line from his resume that bragged about beating ``The Body'' 10
times.) Backlund said the Ventura victory allowed him to skip at
least two years of groundwork that otherwise would have been
required to have his candidacy taken seriously by party officials
and contributors.
</P>
<P>
   Several political analysts said that Ventura's election
demonstrates an opportunity for quirky candidates, but that it was
largely a product of local factors and would be difficult to
duplicate.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are willing to take a chance if they hear straight talk
instead of flim-flam,'' said Peter Fenn, a Democratic media
consultant. ``We have to realize as politicians and consultants
that if we show ads of guys walking on the beach in suits, voters
are going to shake their heads.''
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Rothenberg, a nonpartisan analyst who closely tracks
races around the country, said that candidates who were famous in
other fields could help Republicans loosen up their image as a
``blue-suit, button-down party.'' He said that although polls did
not indicate an anti-establishment mood, ``Under this rather slim
veneer of satisfaction, you find a longstanding American skepticism
about special interests and professional politicians.''
</P>
<P>
   Vincent McMahon, owner of the WWF, said his wrestlers were in
the same business as career politicians, but were just more honest
about it. ``Given the choice, Americans know they can trust an
entertainer as politician more than a politician as entertainer,''
McMahon said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Lawler, the wrestler who is toying with running for mayor of
Memphis, said that wrestlers had an obvious advantage when entering
politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Political races in general have become either beauty contests
or popularity contests,'' he said. ``When you're talking about
wresting, you're talking about people who have made a living in
front of crowds and on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   DeFazio, the candidate for the Allegheny County Council,
remarked, ``When people see you in tights every Saturday, they
really know you.''
</P>
<P>
   The ex-grapplers open a whole new frontier for the political
consultants who specialize in opposition research. Backlund, for
instance, acknowledges he has slapped wrestling rivals, and chased
others into the dressing room. He even admits involvement in table-
and chair-throwing episodes. But he showed a budding pol's caution
when asked if he had ever pulled a rival's hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not that I recall,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Backlund, who held the WWF champion belt from 1978 to 1983, once
replied when asked if professional wrestling matches were staged,
``They're on the level.'' He stands by that today, but again showed
his nascent political instincts as a visitor took notes from a huge
stack of scrapbooks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those quotes in wrestling magazines _ they aren't quotes,'' he
warned.
</P>
<P>
   Even before he was a candidate, Backlund made regular stops at
YMCAs, hospitals and senior citizens' homes in the cities where he
performed, promoting physical, nutritional and mental fitness as
the keys to happiness.
</P>
<P>
   Backlund, the celebrity spokesman for Gov. John Rowland's
Committee on Physical Fitness, now dons a red bow tie and red
suspenders for visits to public schools, where he leads students in
calisthenics, then lectures them about the evils of sloth and
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   He hands out cards showing himself topless and glistening, but
will give his autograph only to pupils who can name all the
presidents. ``For the last one, it's OK to say Hillary,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Backlund's wife, Corki, is a high-school physical education
teacher. They have been married 25 years and met while they were
attending South Dakota State University. They have a 21-year-old
daughter, Carrie, who is a junior at the University of Rhode
Island, studying marine biology.
</P>
<P>
   His platform is conservative but otherwise vague. ``I want
America strong, and to do things with people,'' Backlund said.
</P>
<P>
   Larson, Backlund's prospective opponent, said that Backlund was
a nice guy and seemed well-intentioned, but that he was ready to
take him on. ``God bless him,'' he said, ``but I'm wrestling with
Social Security, Medicare and saving the public education system.''

BLUES WANT TRAFFIC IN FRONT OF BELFOUR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
Most of us spend our lives trying to avoid traffic.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The St. Louis Blues will spend tonight's game desperately trying
to create it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to get more traffic in front of \RStars goalie\S Eddie
Belfour,'' Blues defenseman Al MacInnis said. ``We have to cause
more traffic and hope for some deflections and rebounds and bang
away. He's seeing the puck really well, and we have to do something
different.''
</P>
<P>
   Stars coach Ken Hitchcock called Belfour ``excellent'' after a
Game 5 performance in which he stopped 30 of the 31 shots he faced.
The Blues felt like they were getting a good number of good first
chances.
</P>
<P>
   The difference, they said, was they weren't getting very many
second chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``There just weren't any loose pucks, and we weren't there for
the rebounds,'' Blues defenseman Chris Pronger said. First and
foremost In this second-round series against the Stars, the Blues
have at times been better, been quicker, been faster.
</P>
<P>
   They have yet to be first.
</P>
<P>
   In the first five games of the series, St. Louis hasn't scored
the first goal. The Stars scored first in Game 5, a shorthanded
goal by winger Jere Lehtinen at 3:47.
</P>
<P>
   ``We dig ourselves a hole,'' Blues coach Joel Quenneville said.
``I mean every game we've given up the first goal, and shorthanded
goals are not the fun ones to give up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blues scored first in four of their seven first-round games
against Phoenix. They were 2-2 in those games. Second helpings The
Blues might not start off well, but they sure can rebound. For the
fifth consecutive game, they dominated the second period.
</P>
<P>
   In Games 3 and 4, it was enough to get the Blues the victory.
</P>
<P>
   In Game 5, it wasn't even close.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis outshot Dallas 12-5 in the second period of Game 5.
</P>
<P>
   The Blues have outscored the Stars, 7-4, in the second period.
But the Stars have outscored the Blues, 6-1, in the first period
and 3-2 in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I knew what the difference was,'' Pierre Turgeon said.
``Every game it seems like we are behind early.''

 &HT;    Little resolved as claims of racism mar Jefferson group meeting
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. _ Four women who claim kinship to Thomas
Jefferson and his slave, Sally Hemings, sought Sunday amid a
rancorous debate to join an all-white association that owns
Jefferson's graveyard.
</P>
<P>
   Dorothy Westerinen, a descendant of one of Hemings' sons, Eston,
said she is doubtful that the Monticello Association will extend an
invitation to her. That's despite recent DNA evidence suggesting
that Jefferson was Eston Hemings' father.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want them to say to my face that they do not want me,'' said
Westerinen, seeking admission along with her mother, Dorothy
Westerinen, Michelle Cooley-Quille and Shay Banks-Young.
</P>
<P>
   The association's 86th annual meeting adjourned without any
resolution in the centuries-old dispute over whether America's
third president fathered any of Hemings' seven children. But the
three-hour closed-door meeting did produce bickering that spilled
into the lobby of the Jefferson ballroom of the Omni hotel in
downtown Charlottesville, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Only association members can be buried in the Monticello
Graveyard. Over the next year, the 700 members face the decision
whether to recognize Hemings' descendents, though most lack
genealogical evidence to prove a link to Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
   Association member Theresa Shackleford said she supports the
group's decision to assess further genealogical and historical
evidence of Jefferson's four-decade relationship with Hemings after
Jefferson's wife, Martha, died in 1782.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not racist; we are snobs,'' Shackleford said. ''I am
for any lineal descendent of Thomas Jefferson be they black, white
or purple being buried in the graveyard.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They never hired a genealogist on me,'' countered Lucian
Truscott IV, 52, a Los Angeles screenwriter who has belonged to the
association since he was a child. Last fall on national TV, he
invited three dozen black ''cousins'' to attend this weekend's
Jefferson family gathering as his guests.
</P>
<P>
   In Sunday's meeting, some members sought to reiterate that last
fall's DNA evidence was inconclusive, despite lead scientist Eugene
Foster's conclusion that ''Thomas Jefferson was the most likely
person to have fathered Eston Hemings.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There are some people who find it very hard to believe that
Thomas Jefferson fathered any of Sally Hemings' children,'' Foster
said afterwards.
</P>
<P>
   By Sunday afternoon, association members were openly disputing
Truscott's allegations of racism.
</P>
<P>
   Truscott urged the association to invite Hemings' ancestors to
join as nonvoting honorary members until admission guidelines were
set. Association President Robert Gillespie rejected the suggestion
and, later, he denied he was snubbing Hemings' kin.
</P>
<P>
   Gillespie said the association's executive committee _ not
members at large _ is responsible for nominating honorary members.
''The committee met yesterday,'' Gillespie said.

 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUDONY, Russia _ Another spring, this one cold and raw, finds
Aleksandra Varfolomeyeva in her one-story wood house on the road
halfway between Pskov and St. Petersburg. She lives here with her
husband, her 40-year-old son, six sheep, two cows, two calves, a
horse, a piglet and a dog named Fog.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Varfolomeyeva, a vivacious 75-year-old with a gap-toothed
smile beneath a bright purple kerchief, spent her working life on
the local collective farm, for which she receives a government
pension of 400 rubles a month. Last year, 400 rubles were worth
$66. Today, that same sum is worth $16 _ that is, when it is
actually delivered to her door, in cash, by the postman.
</P>
<P>
   There were months last year, after the ruble crashed, when the
money simply did not arrive, turning Mrs. Varfolomeyeva into one of
the Russian government's many creditors. It was not the first time
the government has borrowed money from its people; by last October,
the pension debt had ballooned to 30.5 billion rubles ($3 billion
at that time), owed to 38 million retirees.
</P>
<P>
   Russian debts are a funny business, as big Western banks have
learned to their horror and chagrin. But Mrs. Varfolomeyeva long
ago stopped trying to figure out when she will get her money. As
she sees it, retrieving a pension from the backlog that has piled
up at the regional administrative center of Pskov is sort of like a
lottery. Either your number comes up, or it doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people have gotten their December checks,'' she said,
shrugging off the whole business with a sigh, and reaching for the
vial of nitroglycerin pills she keeps in her sweater pocket for her
heart condition. ``They are the lucky ones. I got my November one
just now, but not December. Some got it, others have not _ that is
the way it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, since January, the Pskov district _ one of Russia's
poorest regions, set in an idyllic rolling countryside _ has been
paying each month and slowly digging its way through its backed-up
pensions. At this point, it has paid up most of November, some of
December and on orders from Moscow, is adding 12 percent to the May
checks. Nationally, the pension debt, now officially down to 17.5
billion rubles (about $750 million), continues to shrink.
</P>
<P>
   But then again, so too does the value of the ruble.
</P>
<P>
   Like most rural pensioners, Mrs. Varfolomeyeva has dealt with
the vanishing ruble by trying to do without it. She pays 50 rubles
a month for a canister of gas for cooking and 10 rubles a month for
electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, her cash expenses are down to a bare minimum _ animal
feed (which has tripled in price in the past year), bread, salt,
sugar, flour, matches, soap, medicine and the odd tin of herring,
best eaten with boiled potatoes and onions for a special treat.
These are the things she buys when the ``store'' rolls into town on
the back of a truck.
</P>
<P>
   She cannot remember the last time she took a bus anywhere, let
alone to the ancient Russian city of Pskov, which lies about 60
miles to the south. ``Bus?'' she said, with a question mark in her
voice. ``Who can take the bus? Where can you go with this money of
ours?''
</P>
<P>
   Her life is here, on the one-hectare plot _ a bit less than two
and a half acres _ surrounding her cozy ``izba,'' a traditional
Russian cottage that through a back door, past the family outhouse,
spills into a dark, low-ceilinged barn. The barn itself is no
bigger than a small American living room but it is big enough for
the horse, the two cows and their month-old calves.
</P>
<P>
   The latest addition was the piglet, still unnamed, that was
bought the day after May Day, for 580 rubles. When the
Varfolomeyevs bought a piglet last spring, it cost 200 rubles. That
pig eventually ended up in the larder, helping the family get
through a winter that many here and abroad had feared would bring
Russia to the brink of famine.
</P>
<P>
   There was no famine here in Ludony last winter, and it is
doubtful that anyone in the Varfolomeyev family will go hungry next
winter either. Besides the pig, there is a newborn lamb and the two
calves, which will either be sold or eaten after a summer feasting
on the wide open pastures that stretch out behind a back yard
cluttered with chopped wood, a horse cart and a combine belonging
to the collective farm.
</P>
<P>
   An Arctic chill over the May Day holidays postponed the planting
season here in northern Russia, but Mrs. Varfolomeyeva has given
her tomato plants a head start, by spreading them across the
windowsills, table tops and other available surfaces in her
living/bed room. Come summer, she will take up her post on the
roadside, selling vegetables from her garden to passing motorists.
</P>
<P>
   The vegetables bring in extra cash, as does the milk from the
two cows. One of these came to the family in lieu of salary for her
son, whose wages at the local collective farm, when they are paid,
amount to 70 rubles a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sorry to say that our collective farm is in very bad
shape, and their salaries are miserly,'' Mrs. Varfolomeyeva said.
``I tell him he has to keep us alive because when we die, he won't
be able to live.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Varfolomeyeva has three other children, including a
daughter who lives with her family down the road a piece, and other
relatives, including a sister-in-law who came rushing into her
house, seeking help to find a runaway horse.
</P>
<P>
   These local events tend to block out the outside world, although
the war in Yugoslavia has beamed its way into Ludony via
television. That is the one feature of modern life shared by a
majority of households _ including those, like the Varfolomeyev's,
that lack both running water and a telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Varfolomeyeva is not one to pay much attention to politics,
despite the changes that have convulsed her country over the last
10 years. She was born in this village, married here, worked here
her whole life, and in the last years, has come to realize that
when all is said and done, not much has changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, my dear, we have never lived a good life,'' she
said, as she gave a visitor a reassuring pat on the arm.

IN THIS KITCHEN, GLUNKING, SHOVING AND SPLATTING GET JOB DONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN OWEN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Norah Hillis swears she has never written to a newspaper
columnist before. But she could no longer control her indignation.
</P>
<P>
   ``After reading your column so many times, I must find out why
you feel it necessary to use such crude language in describing your
process of cooking,'' she explained. ``The English language is
beautiful until it is defiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't possibly see how using the words, `plunk, shove and
dump' come under the heading of good writing. I would like to
suggest that you buy a good thesaurus and use it frequently,'' she
adds.
</P>
<P>
   I don't deny that I am inclined to dump a half cup of sugar into
a mixing bowl. And I admit that my laptop computer is equipped with
a thesaurus.
</P>
<P>
   Can I ``jilt, renounce or disenfranchise'' a cup of sugar, as my
thesaurus suggests in place of ``dump''?
</P>
<P>
   I often ``shove'' a casserole into a 350-degree oven. Should I
instead ``bulldoze, elbow or jostle,'' the inoffensive pottery?
</P>
<P>
   My computer's thesaurus won't even cope with words like ``moosh,
gloop or plunk.''
</P>
<P>
   I do have a Webster's New International Dictionary heavy enough
to give NFL lineman Cortez Kennedy a hernia. Printed in 1913, it is
hardly ``new.'' Yet Webster understands ``plunk,'' and his
description suggests, ``With a plunking sound.''
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly the noise raw oysters make when you plunk them
intoa skillet for a dish like thisone.
</P>
<P>
   Plunked Oysters
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   1 pint oysters
</P>
<P>
   Pinch of garlic powder
</P>
<P>
   half teaspoon chopped mint
</P>
<P>
   one-quarter teaspoon cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   Tabasco sauce
</P>
<P>
   Salt, pepper
</P>
<P>
   Short slug of Madeira or sherry
</P>
<P>
   Melt the butter in a skillet. Plunk in the drained oysters.
Sprinkle with the garlic, mint, cinnamon mixture. Add two splats of
Tabasco and salt and pepper to taste.
</P>
<P>
   Add the wine (a short slug is about one and one-half tablespoons
but who's measuring?) Simmer until the oysters have firmed up and
the edges have curled on the little buggers. Spoon into two
ramekins and serve with crisp toast points.
</P>
<P>
   Don't you think ``ramekins'' and ``crisp toast points'' add a
bit of class to this recipe? OK, so I portion out the Tabasco in
splats. That's the only way you can coax it out of the bottle in
portions large enough to properly clear the sinuses.
</P>
<P>
   I'm pretty sure most of my readers can distinguish between a
``splat'' and a ``short slug.''
</P>
<P>
   Plucked Poultry Salad
</P>
<P>
   1 barbecued chicken, skinned and boned
</P>
<P>
   14-ounce can diced green chilies
</P>
<P>
   1 to 3 teaspoons minced jalapeno pepper
</P>
<P>
   2 green onions, chopped
</P>
<P>
   4 Roma tomatoes, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 cup peeled and chopped jicama
</P>
<P>
   one-half cup cilantro leaves, minced
</P>
<P>
   one-third cup olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoon white wine vinegar
</P>
<P>
   2 cloves garlic, minced
</P>
<P>
   three-quarters teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   one-haf teaspoon freshly ground pepper
</P>
<P>
   If fryers or roasters are on special, buy two chickens and
barbecue or roast them both. Save one of them for the salad. Or you
can buy a barbecued clucker for about five bucks at the deli
section of supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   Jicama and fresh cilantro were once available only in Mexican
markets but are now stocked in the produce departments of most
major supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   After you have plucked the meat off the chicken, whack it into
bite-size pieces then dump in a large salad bowl. Add the canned
green chilies, green onions, tomatoes, jicama and cilantro. Throw
in as much minced jalapeno as your personal thermometer can easily
tolerate.
</P>
<P>
   Into a dressing jar with a lid combine the oil, vinegar, garlic,
salt and pepper. Cover and shake until ingredients are thoroughly
combined or until your tennis elbow begins to throb. Use as much
dressing as you need to moisten the salad ingredients, then toss
and serve.
</P>
<P>
   This should provide a light meal for you and three grammarians.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure Norah Hillis is a wonderful cook and likely could give
Martha Stewart a lesson on kitchen etiquette.
</P>
<P>
   But some of us are destined to lurch through life glunking,
smearing and mooshing muck. It's a wonder anything gets from the
pots to our mouths without major environmental pollution.
</P>
<P>
   The products of our efforts could be classified as
``gut-busters.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody promised you ``pretty.''

<P>
   So what's it gonna take?
</P>
<P>
   They dragged John Elway away from his kids in Denver and shoved
him into a few downtown L.A. office buildings for power lunches
under the cone of silence in hopes he'll get smart fast. Then they
all emerged with toothy grins bigger than Elway's about the
prospects of his involvement in an NFL expansion team for Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   So NOW y'all ready for some FOOTBAAAWL?
</P>
<P>
   Didn't think so.
</P>
<P>
   Amazin', isn't it? No matter what kind of see-through bikini the
NFL tries to put on this thing, we're not fawning for it. Elway
becomes just another Angelyne billboard. Let us know when the lines
for the ``Star Wars'' prequel menace over to the Coliseum ticket
office.
</P>
<P>
   Don'tcha think it means something when Elway doesn't even show
for the press conference, leaving the mayor to beam brightly about
how FABULOUS things are going as he's standing there with a giant
key to the city waiting to hand it to someone.
</P>
<P>
   Elway's agent, Starvin' Marvin Demoff, says living in Denver
isn't an issue for Duke. ``If it wasn't Los Angeles and
professional football, and the opportunity at management at a very
high level and possibly being president, it wouldn't be a
consideration,'' Demoff said.
</P>
<P>
   That's pretty ``iffy'' to our sun-burned ears.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, while poor abandoned Cowtown begs for expansion _ so
why'd you let the Oilers go in the first place? _ L.A. figureheads
continue to talk amongst themselves, accomplishing nothing, trying
not to hurt anyone else's feelings while elbowing for ownership
power.

JOHN MINOR WISDOM, JUDGE WHO HELPED TO END SEGREGATION, DIES AT
93 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Subs lede to correct date of death to Saturday)  
 (ATTN: La., Fla., Ala., Miss., Texas, Ga. and Va. )  (Eds: An abridged version will move shortly. )

 By JACK BASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Judge John Minor Wisdom, the New Orleans legal scholar who wrote
opinion after opinion that desegregated courthouses throughout the
South and put blacks on juries, in the voting booth, in state
legislatures and in integrated classrooms, died Saturday morning in
New Orleans. He would have turned 94 Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Wisdom wrote the opinion that allowed James Meredith to attend
the University of Mississippi. In 1967 he wrote the majority
opinion in another case, U.S. vs. Jefferson County, that, as he
recalled, ``really started affirmative action.''
</P>
<P>
   His wide-ranging judicial opinions over more than four decades
kept public schools open in Louisiana when officials tried to close
them rather than integrate, ordered Florida to desegregate even its
reform schools and told sports authorities to desegregate the
boxing ring.
</P>
<P>
   He accomplished this after President Dwight D. Eisenhower named
him in 1957 to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, a
jurisdiction that then included six states of the old Confederacy _
Louisiana, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Texas and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   It was four judges of the 5th Circuit whose opinions helped
shape the civil rights laws of the 1950s and 60s, changing the
South. Wisdom was the last survivor of the men who came to be
called simply the Four, a term used in a dissenting opinion by a
fellow judge from Mississippi who saw them as destroyers of the Old
South that he cherished. The others were Eldred P. Tuttle of
Georgia, John R. Brown of Texas and Richard T. Rives of Alabama.
All but Rives were Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The judges of the 5th Circuit amplified the mandate of Brown vs.
Board of Education, the epochal Supreme Court decision of May 17,
1954, that nullified state laws and state constitutional provisions
allowing or requiring the segregation of black and white students
in public schools because of their race. Among the Four's
trail-blazing decisions of the 1960s, most of them written by
Wisdom, were the following:
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1961, they struck down Louisiana's school-closing law,
after the St. Helen Parish voted overwhelmingly to close its public
schools rather than submit to desegregation.
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1962, they agreed that James H. Meredith had been turned
down for admission to the University of Mississippi because of his
race and they ordered Ole Miss to admit him. In the opinion of the
court, Wisdom wrote that university officials had ``engaged in a
carefully calculated campaign of delay, harassment and masterly
inactivity.'' Meredith became the first black ever admitted to the
university and the first black to go to public school with white
students in accordance with the Brown decision.
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1963, they ordered the desegregation of all public parks,
playgrounds, community centers and cultural facilities in New
Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1964, they struck down the jury-selection system in Orleans
Parish in Louisiana because, as Wisdom wrote, it ``operated to
exclude all but a token number of Negroes'' from jury lists. He
noted that ``no black ever sat on a grand jury or a trial jury
panel in Orleans Parish.''
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1965, they ruled that Louisiana's voter-registration law,
because of its written test on the Constitution, discriminated
against poorly educated black voters. Wisdom wrote: ``A wall stands
in Louisiana between registered voters and unregistered eligible
Negro voters. The wall is the state constitutional requirement that
an applicant for registration `understand and give a reasonable
interpretation of any section' of the Constitution of Louisiana or
of the United States. It is ... the highest, best-guarded, most
effective barrier to Negro voting in Louisiana.''
</P>
<P>
   He concluded that ``this wall, built to bar Negroes from access
to the franchise, must come down.''
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1966, they ordered Florida to desegregate its reform
schools and declared that no state could legally maintain
segregation in any school, whatever its mission.
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1967, they affirmed that six states within their
jurisdiction had to integrate their public schools from
kindergarten on.
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1968, Wisdom made what he regarded as the most important
opinion of his career in U.S. vs. Jefferson, in which the court
overturned the so-called ``Briggs dictum.'' This was the belief,
widely held by conservative judges in the South, that the
Constitution did not require integration but merely forbade
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Wisdom expressed his ``nagging feeling that it is not how far
blacks have come that is important but how far they will have to
go.'' He advocated ``the planned organized undoing of the effects
of past segregation'' and set in motion the philosophical framework
for what would come to be known as affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote: ``To avoid conflict with the equal protection clause,
a classification that denies a benefit, causes harm or imposes a
burden must not be based on race. In that sense, the Constitution
is color blind. But the Constitution is color conscious to prevent
discrimination being perpetuated and to undo the effects of past
discrimination. The criterion is the relevancy of color to a
legitimate government purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   The 5th Circuit made these rulings at a time when die-hard
segregationists were using everything from violence to subtle
evasion to resist change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our court rapidly desegregated every place that could be
desegregated: Buses, hotels, restaurants, parks, barrooms and
athletic contests,'' Wisdom recalled in 1982. ``Our court had
strong opposition from six state legislatures and state governors,
year in and year out. One year the state of Louisiana had five
extra sessions of the Legislature, each one designed to overcome
decisions of the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senators, congressmen, governors and local politicians
eventually changed their attitude toward minorities,'' he
continued. ``This is not attributable to a change of heart but to
the Voting Rights Act of 1965,'' which, he noted, enfranchised
blacks ``previously disenfranchised by many ingenious devices.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, in awarding Wisdom the Presidential Medal of
Freedom in 1993, said that his opinions ``advanced civil rights and
economic justice, and his inspired words echo throughout many of
this century's most significant Supreme Court opinions.''
</P>
<P>
   John Minor Wisdom was born in New Orleans on May 17, 1905, the
son of Mortimer M. Wisdom and Adelaide Labatt Wisdom. His father
was a member of the city's elite and proudly remembered marching in
the funeral procession of Robert E. Lee in 1870. In 1925 the son
received his bachelor's degree from Washington and Lee University,
where he had an interest in literature. He studied literature for a
year as a graduate student at Harvard University, but then entered
the law school at Tulane University, where he graduated first in
his class.
</P>
<P>
   He formed the law firm of Wisdom and Stone with one of his
classmates, Saul Stone.

UNDATED: Saul Stone.   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wisdom practiced law in New Orleans throughout the 1930s, and
then joined the Army Air Corps in World War II, serving in the
Office of Legal Procurement. He was discharged with the rank of
lieutenant colonel.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his early legal work dealt with business law. He
strongly opposed so-called fair-trade laws, legislation that
permitted manufacturers to set the retail prices of their products,
ostensibly to protect small retailers from competition from big
discounters. He told those attending the American Fair Trade
Council meeting in New York in 1953 that they could ``never sell
the American citizen on the justice or logic'' of fair trade.
</P>
<P>
   Wisdom, a long-time Republican loyalist who served in the 1950s
as a national committeeman from Louisiana, worked hard to open
doors to the Republican Party in the South. In 1952 he broke with
the more traditional Southern Republicans, who strongly supported
the candidacy of the conservative Sen. Robert Taft of Ohio for
president.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier that year, he and Eldred P. Tuttle, a lawyer in Atlanta,
had met at the request of Herbert Brownell, Eisenhower's campaign
manager, to organize a campaign in the South to support Eisenhower
for the Republican nomination against Taft. Wisdom and Tuttle
became co-chairmen of the Southern Conference for Eisenhower, and
each led pro-Eisenhower delegations that won contested fights for
credentials at the Republican National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   As attorney general in the Eisenhower administration, Brownell
became an important figure in selecting federal judges, and both
Tuttle and Wisdom were eventually put on the federal bench.
</P>
<P>
   One of the earliest civil rights cases Wisdom received after his
appointment came in 1959, when the 5th Circuit voided a Louisiana
ban on boxing matches between blacks and whites. The court's
decision was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   In 1964 he dissented from the 5th Circuit's majority opinion,
which upheld the tradition of revealing the race of all candidates
for public office on the ballot. The Supreme Court ultimately
repudiated the majority decision and upheld his position.
</P>
<P>
   Though most of the 5th Circuit's ground-breaking decisions
concerning discrimination were made in the 1960s, there were many
significant cases in the 1970s. Among them was a 1972 decision
striking down a Louisiana law barring biracial adoptions. ``It is
obvious,'' Wisdom wrote in the decision, ``that the Louisiana
statute making race a decisive factor in adoption subordinates a
child's best interest in some circumstances to racial
discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   Wisdom wrote several landmark opinions in employment
discrimination cases. In 1979, the Supreme Court adopted the basic
reasoning of his dissent in Weber vs. Kaiser Aluminum and Chemical
Corp. to uphold a hiring plan intended to overcome the effects of
past discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Not all his major decisions concerned race. In 1974, he wrote an
opinion that found that psychiatric patients as a class had a
federal constitutional right to adequate treatment when such
patients were committed against their will to state institutions.
</P>
<P>
   But to the end he felt that no opinion drew more fully on his
intellect and imagination than U.S. vs. Jefferson, which took
almost a year to formulate.
</P>
<P>
   By requiring ``the organized undoing of the effects of past
desegregation,'' he placed an affirmative duty on school boards to
develop desegregation plans. Including a model school desegregation
order, he served notice that ``the only school desegregation plan
that meets constitutional standards is one that works.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals wrote in a 1979 book, ``The Supreme Court from Brown to
Bakke,'' that Wisdom in ``Jefferson'' and related cases
``transformed the face of school desegregation law.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the storms that attended his civil rights decisions, he
attained such stature that in 1969, he was mentioned as a leading
candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court. Moderate Republicans advanced
his name after the Senate rejected President Richard M. Nixon's
nomination of Judge Clement F. Haynsworth, a candidate Wisdom
opposed.
</P>
<P>
   But Nixon's attorney general, John Mitchell, scuttled the idea,
reportedly complaining that Wisdom was nothing more than a ``damn
left-winger.''
</P>
<P>
   Wisdom once told a reporter in the 1960s, when the 5th Circuit
was issuing its most contentious rulings, his dogs were poisoned
and a rattlesnake was thrown in his back yard.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the liberal views about race and civil rights, he
maintained memberships in private clubs and Mardi Gras krewes that
discriminated against blacks and Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people I see in these clubs are the guys I went to school
with and have known all my life,'' he said. ``I would not resign
from any such club.'' He said, ``They know how I stand on these
matters'' and ``I certainly wouldn't change their views by getting
out of the club.''
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Bonnie Mathews Wisdom, and two
daughters, Kathleen Mathews Wisdom and Penelope Stewart Wisdom
Tose. A son, John Minor Wisdom Jr., died.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, when he was 89, the 5th Circuit building in New Orleans
was named for him.

SEATTLE MARITIME SCHOOL HAS QUIETLY COME OUT OF CHOPPY WATERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MIKE BARBER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ ``Man overboard! Man overboard!''
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Steve Powell has guided the Charles A. Kane beyond the
breakwater of Seattle's Shilshole Bay and is heading up sound when
he hears the crew's cries over the rumbling purr of the workboat's
engines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man overboard,'' Powell echoes into the loudspeaker, mustering
the crew to stations. He brings the 101-foot vessel about, cutting
speed and ordering the crew, ``Recover on the starboard side.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Ruszala, a veteran skipper of 25 years in the merchant
marine, has toppled from the stern into the gray, 50-degree waters
off Seattle's Ballard neighborhood. Already he is 100 yards from
the boat and receding.
</P>
<P>
   But the water is calm, sun is breaking through and the 11 crew
members spot him easily.
</P>
<P>
   One grabs a life preserver and waterproof light, another a
first-aid kit. Two don life vests and stand on the gunwales to haul
Ruszala from the water. Others train fingers on Ruszala as Powell
guides the Kane toward him.
</P>
<P>
   A life preserver snakes through the air toward Ruszala _ direct
hit!
</P>
<P>
   ``Good job, get the line, save my butt!'' Ruszala yells. With a
line around his chest, the crew strains to haul him aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly there's trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Ruszala goes limp. He bangs and catches against the side of the
boat, then slips back into the sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Try turning me around,'' Ruszala yells. Arms strain to hoist
him. ``Get the yellow rescue sling from the captain's quarters.
Who's chief mate? Give directions. Assume command.''
</P>
<P>
   This time they haul Ruszala safely aboard. He stands, strips off
the red survival suit that protected him from hypothermia, then
gathers the crew that saved him.
</P>
<P>
   He's ready to critique the rescue.
</P>
<P>
   It's another lesson in a 12-hour day full of them aboard the
Kane, a former offshore supply vessel transformed into a working
classroom of the Seattle Maritime Academy.
</P>
<P>
   Billed as the nation's first workboat academy, the Seattle
Central Community College seafaring school is 30 years old this
year, and newly retooled after nearly going the way of the salmon.
</P>
<P>
   Some thought the school wouldn't reach a fourth decade after it
followed the nation's maritime industry into a slump in the 1980s.
Yet in the past six years the academy has quietly been resurrected,
renamed, and now runs on a $400,000-a-year budget.
</P>
<P>
   The school doesn't train the men and women who skipper the ocean
tankers and freighters of the deep blue. That's the job of
four-year merchant marine academies that award baccalaureate
degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Seattle school's compass points to where there are
jobs: on workboats like tugs, oil tenders, factory fishing ships,
tour boats and ferries.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the future merchant marine,'' says Bjorn ``B.J.''
Aune, academy director. ``This is a working-class school for people
who want to go to sea and who want to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell, a graduate of the four-year Texas Merchant Marine
Academy, recalls how he became a Naval Reserve officer after
graduation, when he found few blue-ocean merchant marine jobs
available.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American merchant marine is hanging by its fingernails,''
he says. ``Its workboat industry is the only one where there are
chances of work. This is not glamorous work; there are no white
linen tablecloths. It's grimy work, for people in coveralls, but
who are needed to keep the boats running.''
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, working seafarers learned at the knees of their
fathers or in apprenticeships. Now they can take classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1990, when the fishing industry hit a slump, I worked five
weekends for free to learn tugboats,'' says Kris Mullan, a
fourth-generation fisherman and port engineer for Fisherman's
Finest, a commercial fishing company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think these students realize how hard it was in the
past, or how good they have it,'' adds Mullan, who also serves on
the school's technical advisory bboard. He says the standardized
training allows students to work on a variety of boats.
</P>
<P>
   The school's mainstay programs _ for engineers and deckhands _
attract about 40 students a year. They pack academic and technical
courses into a demanding nine-month curriculum, building credits
toward academic degrees, and time and experience toward maritime
skills and licenses.
</P>
<P>
   Overall enrollment is about 750 a year, including
continuing-education courses tailored to industry, union or
government needs. For example, a joint venture with Fremont
Maritime Services created the five-day ``India Tango'' firefighting
school, named for the nautical flags ``I'' and ``T'' that signal
``I'm on fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Tom Curley, who oversees merchant marine
licenses in the region, said the academy ``is building up and
expanding, and I think they are on the right track. I've been real
happy with them.''
</P>
<P>
   The school was launched in 1969 as Trident Marine Technological
Facility. Eric Erikson, then Seattle Community College chancellor
and president, literally hocked his family's farm to buy 2.2 acres
on the ship canal northeast of the Ballard Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Now board chairman of Pemco insurance, Erikson says he put up
the farm because ``the bank wanted something to hang onto'' until
other funding arrived.
</P>
<P>
   When the industry slumped in the '80s, enrollment plunged from
several hundred students to just a few dozen. The school lost its
main drawing card, a surplus Coast Guard buoy tender, and by 1989
the two-year associate degree programs were suspended.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, moves were afoot to close the school and sell the land,
but advisers and college officials argued for hanging on and
finding a niche.
</P>
<P>
   The technical advisory board, composed of industry and
government representatives, was an important development, Erikson
says. ``It forces the college to focus their instruction on the
real life out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Aune, who holds a limited master-mariner license and a doctorate
in ocean law from the London School of Economics, oversaw the
academy's overhaul. He walks a steep gangplank, however, abiding by
academic certification requirements as well as Coast Guard
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Simone is a 1972 graduate and senior port engineer for
Crowley Marine Services as well as the technical advisory board
chairman. He likes what he sees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The academy has the capacity to be a phenomenal program to
help the workboat industry,'' he says. ``I like the school's
real-world emphasis.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike students at the nation's seven four-year Merchant Marine
academies, those at Seattle Maritime Academy don't wear uniforms or
march to class. But they adhere to a rigorous tone set by Aune and
his staff.
</P>
<P>
   They emphasize safety, discipline and personal responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't apologize for being doctrinaire about goals like
teaching safety,'' Aune says. ``I will ram safety down their
throats. I work on the premise that they should be able to go to
sea and then go home to loved ones.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no grading on the curve; students can wash out. Sea
classes cast off at 8:55 a.m.; boats wait for no one.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are not prompt, we sail and won't come back for you.
It's an attitude and an ethic,'' Aune says. ``We want people
prepared for the industry, because we want the industry's respect.
A ship delay can cost a company a fortune.''
</P>
<P>
   The school now has a fleet of six working vessels acquired
through the federal Maritime Administration's surplus program. They
range from a 26-foot motor whaleboat to the Encounter Bay, a
189-foot former salvage tug.
</P>
<P>
   The Encounter Bay and the Kane were seized by federal agents as
drug-runner vessels. The 72 tons of Thai hashish seized aboard the
Encounter Bay on June 30, 1988 _ it was headed for Vancouver, B.C.
_ remains a record U.S. drug bust.
</P>
<P>
   The Kane, originally built to tend oil rigs in the Gulf of
Mexico, was seized running a ton of cocaine from Colombia to
Louisiana in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Aune boasts that the academy has the largest operating fleet
among community colleges in the United States. ``Many schools don't
have boats because of the liability,'' he explains. ``We decided to
assume the risk.''
</P>
<P>
   The boats provide coveted ``under-way experience.'' That's the
crucial sea time that must be acquired _ in addition to class work
_ to quality for licenses and ratings for jobs.
</P>
<P>
   When students aren't in classrooms and laboratories wrestling
with math, diesel engines, electrical engines or meteorology,
they're on boats all day Thursdays and Fridays using what they've
learned.
</P>
<P>
   At sea, students take turns filling billets or jobs.
</P>
<P>
   One might stand watch one day; work the next in the loud engine
room logging hourly fuel, oil pressure and water temperature
readings; and take charge another day as chief mate.
</P>
<P>
   Among the students aboard the Kane this year is Corey Allan, 24,
who drove from Maine last summer to enter the engineer program.
</P>
<P>
   Allan, from a fishing family, has toiled since childhood in the
stormy and treacherous Georges Bank off Newfoundland for red crabs,
and lowlined in Florida for sharks.
</P>
<P>
   When that industry declined, Allan got a government retraining
grant to attend the Seattle academy.
</P>
<P>
   Full-time tuition for state residents is $500 per quarter; for
non-residents it's close to $2,000. Laboratory fees, textbooks,
tools and supplies add another $1,200 a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the only school of its kind in the nation that I could
find,'' said Allan, who scoured the Internet in his search.
</P>
<P>
   In two years _ and with enough sea time _ Allan said he can
acquire a third assistant engineer rating. His brother, attending
Maine's merchant marine academy, won't get that rating until he
graduates after four years of school and sea work.
</P>
<P>
   David Thomas, 38, said he is giving up 18 years as a journeyman
painter to go to sea as an engineer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a hands-on working guy,'' he said. ``Painting is seasonal;
engineering offers a good opportunity for travel. I'd like to work
aboard a research vessel.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also a career move for Deborah Bellafonte, 44, who gave up
her landscaping business to join this year's engineering class.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd only spent three days on a fishing boat before this,'' she
said recently, standing watch in the Kane's wheelhouse.
</P>
<P>
   The school has seen increasing numbers of women, though
Bellafonte is the only one in her class of 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of a new area for women in a lot of respects,'' she
said. ``I've had a good response in school, but I know this is out
of the ordinary, so it's time to get thick-skinned.''
</P>
<P>
   Like others, Bellafonte has her eye on ferry work, which has
four-year waiting lists.
</P>
<P>
   She also has a dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``After my 15-year-old daughter is grown, I'd like to head to
Costa Rica and run my own charter boat.''

CHARISMATIC HEADING TO THE BELMONT STAKES AS A FAVORITE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Charismatic was standing serenely in his stall at
Pimlico Race Course Sunday morning, one victory from completing one
of the most remarkable sagas in racing history. Three months after
being offered as a claimer to anybody willing to risk $62,500, he
has a chance to sweep the Triple Crown. His trainer, D. Wayne
Lukas, who won the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness with his
claimer in the last two weeks, said he would go on to the Belmont
Stakes determined to become the 12th horse in history to win all
three.
</P>
<P>
   ``He showed greatness winning the Derby,'' Lukas said, ``and he
showed in the Preakness that he's progressed. He came out of the
Derby more aggressive, more cocky, a strut to his step, like he
knew he'd done something pretty special. He's getting to the point
where he's figuring this game out.''
</P>
<P>
   Charismatic won the Derby at 31-1 and won the Preakness at 8-1,
and now he must outrun his chief rivals at a mile and a half on
June 5 at Belmont Park in New York. It would be his fifth major
race at five different tracks in two months: the Santa Anita Derby,
the Lexington, the Kentucky Derby, the Preakness and the Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   On the day after his latest tour de force, before a record crowd
of 100,311, it appeared that five or six of the horses from the
Preakness would meet again in the Belmont with perhaps another five
or six making late challenges from outside the Triple Crown series.
It appeared that Charismatic would finally get respect as the
betting favorite.
</P>
<P>
   But no horse has swept the Triple Crown since Affirmed did it 21
years ago. In the last two years, horses trained by Bob Baffert won
the first two races, but his Silver Charm was run down by Touch
Gold in 1997 and last year his Real Quiet lost in the final strides
to Victory Gallop.
</P>
<P>
   Fate was playing a strange hand in casting this year's drama.
Elliott Walden, the trainer of Victory Gallop, also is the trainer
of Menifee, who ran second to Charismatic by a neck in the Derby
and by a length and a half as the beaten favorite in the Preakness.
Could Walden thwart a Triple Crown sweep at the wire for the second
year in a row?
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the ending is the same,'' Walden said at his barn this
morning. ``Same story, same conclusion. Right after we got beat
pretty good in the Preakness last year, I wasn't all that anxious
to go to the Belmont. But this year, I feel good about going on and
trying him again in the Belmont, maybe because of the experience
last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Charismatic and Menifee were resting at Pimlico, but they
will be traveling companions on a chartered flight Monday headed
for Louisville, Ky., where their trainers maintain stables at
Churchill Downs. Both are expected to stay in the relative calm
there until perhaps the Wednesday of Belmont week. Then they will
stage Act Three in their drama in a race that will take them
five-sixteenths of a mile farther than they ran in the Preakness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The extra 550 yards could make a big difference,'' Walden
said. ``I think he might like the distance. They all go a mile and
a half, but the big question is how fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Hancock, who owns Menifee with Jimmy Stone, the Louisiana
oil man, has been there before: In 1989, his Sunday Silence outran
Easy Goer in the Derby and Preakness but lost to him in the
Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charismatic is a good horse,'' he said, ``and Wayne's got him
in a zone right now. He's a top horseman and knows how to keep one
that way. I'd hate to spoil someone's Triple Crown, but I know how
it feels to be on the other side after Sunday Silence.''
</P>
<P>
   From the Preakness field of 13, it seemed likely that the first
four finishers would go on to the Belmont _ Charismatic, Menifee,
Badge and Stephen Got Even _ along with Adonis (sixth) and
Kimberlite Pipe (eighth). But the Preakness marked the end of the
Triple Crown trail for some others.
</P>
<P>
   The chief casualty was Cat Thief, who ran in the money in 11 of
his 12 starts but faded to seventh in the Preakness. Lukas said he
would be pointed toward the Jim Dandy at Saratoga or the Swaps at
Hollywood Park.
</P>
<P>
   Worldly Manner, after not racing all winter in Dubai, ran
seventh in the Kentucky Derby and 12th in the Preakness, and his
managers said they did not know yet where he would go next.
</P>
<P>
   Excellent Meeting, the only filly in the Preakness, was pulled
up in the homestretch by her rider, Kent Desormeaux, and underwent
treatment for a displaced palate. Her departure seemed to mark the
end of the Triple Crown campaign for Baffert, who won the Derby and
Preakness in each of the last two years and opened this year with a
barn stocked with talented candidates.
</P>
<P>
   But Baffert flew back to Churchill Downs Sunday with Excellent
Meeting and her stablemate, Silverbulletday, who won the Black-Eyed
Susan Stakes on Friday for her eighth straight victory and now
reigned as Baffert's survivor of the wars of the 3-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   FINISH LINE
</P>
<P>
   Lee Ferrell of Bel Air, Md., the 22-year-old man who stood on
the track at Pimlico as horses raced past him in the seventh race
on Preakness Day, was being held Sunday on a first-degree assault
charge. Police spokeswoman Angelique Cook-Hayes said Ferrell was
first taken to Sinai Hospital for a psychiatric review, but was
released from the hospital Saturday night.

NOT ALL STUDENTS FOUND MARTIME SCHOOL TO THEIR LIKING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MIKE BARBER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ After 11 years in the Army, Shannon Robinson went
through the Seattle Maritime Academy's engineering technology
course in 1995, and later its two-week captain's class.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, 43, now skippers Argosy tour boats on the Seattle
waterfront.
</P>
<P>
   Debbie Ramsey-Bell, 45, took the academy's first engineering
course so she could continue going to sea after her post-doctorate
job in physics and atmospheric sciences ended in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   She's now third-assistant engineer on the University of
Washington's research vessel, Thomas Thompson, where she previously
worked as a scientist.
</P>
<P>
   They are success stories from the academy. Other students aren't
as satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jaross, 28, gave up his glass-blowing business in
Everett, Wash., to attend the academy's first-deck technology
course in January 1998. Although Jaross now works aboard a National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration research vessel, it's not
the kind of work he expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us got anything. We ended up with ordinary seaman's
papers for bottom-of-the-bucket jobs like cooking, mopping decks
and cleaning toilets,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Jaross is among a group of seven graduates of the school's
deckhand program who were not satisfied with their experiences
after graduation. While Robinson and Ramsey-Bell love the work they
got after graduating from the engineering program, Jaross claims
the school misled him and oversold the deckhand program.
</P>
<P>
   Post-graduate success _ and how Seattle Maritime Academy
graduates view the program _ depends largely on what they studied
and how much experience at sea they acquire.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers are in greater demand. Almost all of last year's
engineering graduates got jobs on workboats locally or in the Gulf
of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Licenses are everything in the maritime industry, with Coast
Guard approval for them hinging largely on experience at sea, or
``under-way time.''
</P>
<P>
   Those, like Jaross, who enter the academy program without much
sea time, have less chance of acquiring more advanced licenses than
do those with prior experience, says Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Tom
Curley, who oversees regional merchant marine licensing.
</P>
<P>
   Since the school was retooled in 1993, it has attracted students
ages 17 to 70 _ the oldest a retired trucker who now serves as an
engineer on fishing vessels.
</P>
<P>
   The majority are in their mid-30s. About a third come from the
marine industry. Some work shoreside but need to formalize skills.
Others retrain after losing jobs _ such as timber workers, Boeing
machinists and a member of the Lummi tribe, whose casino closed.
</P>
<P>
   Some simply want career changes, including nurses, academics,
even a bank executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most are more mature, demanding students who aren't
starry-eyed and innocent'' about the kind of the work they are
getting into, says academy director Bjorn ``B.J.'' Aune.
</P>
<P>
   After Robinson graduated from the engineering program in 1995,
she spent a year tending bar and building up time at sea. She then
returned to the school to take the two-week captain's course.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have so much sea time in order to even sit for an
exam for your license,'' she says. ``For an inland 100-ton license
to operate our boats in Puget Sound and the lake areas, you need
360 sea days, and those each encompass an eight-hour time frame.
Basically, you need a year at sea before you can sit down to take
the captain's license test.''
</P>
<P>
   She passed the test and realized her ambition to skipper Argosy
tour boats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love my job,'' says Robinson. ``I was impressed with the
whole school and everything they've done. We are responsible for
the lives of people on the boat, and I feel very prepared. I've
gone back (to the academy) to hire employees and sent some to the
school for training.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramsey-Bell had been at sea plenty of times before she signed up
for the academy, but it was as a scientist researching
pollution-free clouds over remote oceans, not as a crew member.
</P>
<P>
   When academic jobs dried up in 1993, Ramsey-Bell took the
academy's first engineering class. It was a way to remain on
research vessels.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were the guinea pigs,'' she says of the nine-month class.
``Nothing was definite as far as Coast Guard approval. It was kind
of hairy, but it came through at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   She can look back now and laugh, but Ramsey-Bell says some
students were upset.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very taxing and sometimes pretty heavy-duty stuff,''
she says. ``A lot of students weren't well-prepared _ I wasn't for
diesel classes. And some people didn't have the right temperament
to be on a boat and take orders from people.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramsey-Bell says the UW research vessel on which she works ``is
a complicated ship with highly technical equipment, a lot of
electrical stuff. I think I've done well there partly because of
(the academy's) schooling.''
</P>
<P>
   Jaross says he and his classmates were sea novices who didn't
realize the difficulty of acquiring licenses. Though he works on a
research ship, he says he wishes he'd never taken the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although the academy had a caveat in a brochure that the
(deckhand) course was pending Coast Guard approval, we were
verbally assured throughout the program that it was merely a
formality. We feel defrauded,'' Jaross says.
</P>
<P>
   Jaross said he and others were misled by director Aune on the
certification issue.
</P>
<P>
   Aune acknowledges that the Coast Guard approval he wanted didn't
come through for Jaross' deckhand class, but he flatly denies the
students were misled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never misrepresented anything,'' Aune says. ``We got some
of what we asked for (from the Coast Guard) and these students knew
the situation and had a choice, but (they) found it more convenient
to raise a ruckus.''
</P>
<P>
   If the academy wins an appeal to qualify deckhand students for
the Coast Guard's higher able-bodied seaman rating, it would be
awarded retroactively to the disgruntled students, Aune says.
</P>
<P>
   School officials and Coast Guard and industry representatives
say Jaross got appropriate ratings. He and others, however, have
little previous sea experience and need to work 90 days at sea to
acquire the able-bodied seaman rating.
</P>
<P>
   Curley says that while most new seafarers have a year to log sea
time before their certificates expire, the local Coast Guard office
allows students such as Jaross and his classmates three years to
acquire the 90 days of sea time.
</P>
<P>
   And the deckhand program will be offered again this September,
Aune says.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Judge John Minor Wisdom, the New Orleans legal scholar who wrote
opinion after opinion that desegregated courthouses throughout the
South and put blacks on juries, in the voting booth, in state
legislatures and in integrated classrooms, died Saturday morning in
New Orleans. He would have turned 94 Monday.
</P>
<P>
   He had remained active throughout the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Wisdom wrote the opinion that allowed James Meredith to attend
the University of Mississippi. In 1967 he wrote the majority
opinion in another case, U.S. vs. Jefferson County, which, as he
recalled, ``really started affirmative action.''
</P>
<P>
   His wide-ranging judicial opinions over more than four decades
kept public schools open in Louisiana when officials tried to close
them rather than integrate, ordered Florida to desegregate even its
reform schools and told sports authorities to desegregate the
boxing ring.
</P>
<P>
   He accomplished this after President Dwight D. Eisenhower named
him in 1957 to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, a
jurisdiction that then included six states of the old Confederacy _
Louisiana, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Texas and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   It was four judges of the 5th Circuit whose opinions helped
shape the civil rights laws of the 1950s and 60s, changing the
South. Wisdom was the last survivor of the men who came to be
called simply the Four, a term used in a dissenting opinion by a
fellow judge from Mississippi who saw them as destroyers of the Old
South that he cherished. The others were Eldred P. Tuttle of
Georgia, John R. Brown of Texas and Richard T. Rives of Alabama.
All but Judge Rives were Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The judges of the 5th Circuit amplified the mandate of Brown vs.
Board of Education, the epochal Supreme Court decision of May 17,
1954, that nullified state laws and state constitutional provisions
allowing or requiring the segregation of black and white students
in public schools because of their race.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, Wisdom made what he regarded as the most important
opinion of his career in U.S. v. Jefferson, in which the court
overturned the so-called ``Briggs dictum.'' This was the belief,
widely held by conservative judges in the South, that the
Constitution did not require integration but merely forbade
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Wisdom advocated ``the planned organized undoing of the effects
of past segregation'' and set in motion the philosophical framework
for what would come to be known as affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, in awarding Wisdom the Presidential Medal of
Freedom in 1993, said that his opinions ``advanced civil rights and
economic justice, and his inspired words echo throughout many of
this century's most significant Supreme Court opinions.''
</P>
<P>
   John Minor Wisdom was born in New Orleans on May 17, 1905, the
son of Mortimer M. Wisdom and Adelaide Labatt Wisdom. His father
was a member of the city's elite and proudly remembered marching in
the funeral procession of Robert E. Lee in 1870. In 1925 the son
received his bachelor's degree from Washington and Lee University,
where he had an interest in literature. He studied literature for a
year as a graduate student at Harvard University, but then entered
the law school at Tulane University, where he graduated first in
his class.
</P>
<P>
   He practiced law in New Orleans throughout the 1930s, then
joined the Army Air Corps in World War II, serving in the Office of
Legal Procurement. He was discharged with the rank of lieutenant
colonel.
</P>
<P>
   Wisdom, a long-time Republican loyalist who served in the 1950s
as a national committeeman from Louisiana, broke with the more
traditional Southern Republicans, who strongly supported the
candidacy of the conservative Sen. Robert Taft of Ohio for
president in 1952.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier that year, he and Eldred P. Tuttle, a lawyer in Atlanta,
had met at the request of Herbert Brownell, Eisenhower's campaign
manager, to organize a campaign in the South to support Eisenhower
for the Republican nomination against Taft. Wisdom and Tuttle
became co-chairmen of the Southern Conference for Eisenhower, and
each led pro-Eisenhower delegations that won contested fights for
credentials at the Republican National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   As attorney general in the Eisenhower administration, Brownell
became an important figure in selecting federal judges, and both
Tuttle and Wisdom were eventually put on the federal bench.
</P>
<P>
   Wisdom wrote several landmark opinions in employment
discrimination cases. In 1979, the Supreme Court adopted the basic
reasoning of his dissent in Weber vs. Kaiser Aluminum and Chemical
Corp. to uphold a hiring plan intended to overcome the effects of
past discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Not all his major decisions concerned race. In 1974, he wrote an
opinion that found that psychiatric patients as a class had a
federal constitutional right to adequate treatment when such
patients were committed against their will to state institutions.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, he was mentioned as a leading candidate for the U.S.
Supreme Court. Moderate Republicans advanced his name after the
Senate rejected President Richard M. Nixon's nomination of Judge
Clement F. Haynsworth, a candidate Wisdom opposed.
</P>
<P>
   But Nixon's attorney general, John Mitchell, scuttled the idea,
reportedly complaining that Wisdom was nothing more than a ``damn
left-winger.''
</P>
<P>
   Wisdom once told a reporter that in the 1960s, when the 5th
Circuit was issuing its most contentious rulings, his dogs were
poisoned and a rattlesnake was thrown in his back yard.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the liberal views about race and civil rights he
espoused throughout his judicial career, he maintained memberships
in private clubs and Mardi Gras krewes that discriminated against
blacks and Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people I see in these clubs are the guys I went to school
with and have known all my life,'' he said. ``I would not resign
from any such club.'' He said, ``They know how I stand on these
matters'' and ``I certainly wouldn't change their views by getting
out of the club.'' He is survived by his wife, Bonnie Mathews
Wisdom, and two daughters, Kathleen Mathews Wisdom and Penelope
Stewart Wisdom Tose. A son, John Minor Wisdom Jr., died.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, when he was 89, the 5th Circuit building in New Orleans
was named for him.

A CLASSIC LOVE STORY ASSUMES A MODERN GUISE WITH VIVID PASSION IN
TACT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``La Bayadere'' has romantic intrigue galore, a death
by snakebite and a crumbling temple to recommend it. The Minkus
score is a similarly operatic bundle of grand _ and melodic _
passions.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the ballet is a scene that captures the essence
of ballet classicism, in the late 19th century and, remarkably
enough, in our own ``neoclassical'' times.
</P>
<P>
   Performers can take flight in dance passages of great beauty and
purity. The dancers of American Ballet Theater rose to the occasion
in performances on Friday night and Saturday afternoon at the
Metropolitan Opera House, where the sumptuous production, staged by
Natalia Makarova after the Marius Petipa original, may be seen in a
``Bayadere'' mini-season that ends on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Created in 1877 for the Maryinsky Ballet of St. Petersburg,
Russia, ``La Bayadere'' was seen in the West only in the excerpted
Kingdom of the Shades scene until this 1980 production by Ms.
Makarova, who took a well-deserved curtain call on Friday night.
The balletgoer who doesn't enjoy the scene, the dance critic Clive
Barnes once suggested, doesn't really enjoy ballet. The same might
be said for the entire work, despite its lumbering scenario. By
taking ``La Bayadere'' seriously enough to perform it without a
trace of camp, the two Ballet Theater casts made the work live not
just as history but as vivid contemporary theater.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday night Susan Jaffe made of Nikiya, the Indian temple
dancer who loves and is betrayed by the noble warrior, Solor, an
ethereal creature whose fragility foretold from the start her cruel
destruction. Ms. Jaffe's long, supple arms seemed to evaporate like
mist as she danced, in much the same way her ghost or ``shade''
will later appear and disappear.
</P>
<P>
   There was something of that dreaming quality to Jose Manuel
Carreno's Solor, communicated through the sheer beauty and clarity
of his dancing, from precise, fluent preparations for steps and
phrases to turns that shimmered in their speed and control. Very
small gestures of the head and arms suggested undercurrents of
emotion. Paloma Herrera played the vicious Gamzatti as a spoiled
young woman determined to win Solor at any cost. The
characterization worked, but Ms. Herrera's dancing did not live up
to her clear, sharply etched best.
</P>
<P>
   Performing on Saturday afternoon, Julie Kent was a delicate
Nikiya whose love for Solor expanded her like a flower opening to
the sun. Her Solor, Vladimir Malakhov, was a creature of the air,
soaring effortlessly in perfectly shaped high traveling jumps and
touching earth eventually as softly as a cat. Irina Dvorovenko,
seen in a role debut as Gamzatti, communicated the character's
ruthlessness through the steely boldness of her dancing.
</P>
<P>
   Victor Barbee was less acute than usual as the High Brahmin on
Friday. Joaquin De Luz's Bronze Idol solo was fascinating in its
measured dynamic shifts. On Saturday Robert Hill's Brahmin was a
figure of frighteningly eerie stillness. Michael Cusumano spooled
out the pyrotechnics of the Bronze Idol solo in a single thread of
dancing.
</P>
<P>
   The luminous, seamless dancing of the female corps made it clear
at both performances why the Kingdom of the Shades scene is so
beloved by balletgoers. The three Shades solos were danced capably
by Yan Chen, Ekaterina Shelkanova and Michele Wiles (Friday) and
the charming Anna Liceica, Ms. Shelkanova and Veronica Lynn
(Saturday). John Selya's Head Fakir was a bullet charging awesomely
through the wild choreography for this ragged messenger on Friday,
while Vladislav Kalinin was exciting in pure dance terms on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The lead casts were completed by Ethan Brown, Christopher
Martin, Rosalie O'Connor, Erica Cornejo and Sara Mau. The score,
arranged by John Lanchbery, was conducted by Charles Barker.

MONTENEGRIN GOVERNMENT BALANCES UNEASY PEACE AGAINST FEARS OF CIVIL
WAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ANTHONY DePALMA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PODGORICA, Montenegro _ This capital city nestled in mighty
mountains has been telling two tales since NATO's air assault on
Yugoslavia began.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface it remains the same slightly shopworn metropolis
of smart restaurants and sidewalk cafes where people sip sweet
coffee as a disco roar conceals conversations.
</P>
<P>
   But every evening, when Freedom Street fills with elegant
promenaders flaunting Versace jeans and Benetton blouses, heavily
armed guards in flak jackets and camouflage fatigues stand vigil
before government offices just around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   The weary officials inside, often with bags under their eyes and
exaggerated creases in their foreheads, are busy playing a
cat-and-mouse game with Yugoslavia's Second Army, which they
suspect of plotting some kind of coup d'etat in alliance with a
powerful segment of Montenegro's parliamentary opposition that
supports Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, the situation has reached an extremely delicate
balance between civil war and uneasy peace that could be tipped by
the opposition or the army. For now the Montenegrin government, the
reluctant junior partner of Serbia in the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia, retains tentative control.
</P>
<P>
   But officials worry, however, that their opponents _ acting
under orders from Milosevic _ are trying to destabilize Montenegro
and choke the economy, in effect conducting what they call ``a
creeping coup'' that will undercut the elected government and cause
it to fall.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, officials say, the Yugoslav army is acting as an army
of occupation, ignoring Montenegro's constitution, and imposing its
own order. Sometimes the civilian authorities persuade the army to
back down, as when they managed to get it to reopen the border with
Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   But they had less success in other areas. Despite protests,
young men are still forced into the army. Foreign journalists can
still be stopped, searched and sent home, even though the
Montenegrin government welcomed them. And the government has been
unable to completely protect the thousands of Kosovo Albanians who
have sought refuge here.
</P>
<P>
   In one incident along the border a few weeks ago, seven
displaced Kosovars were killed in a skirmish with the Yugoslav
military. Now the government has stationed its own police around
the camps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since March 24 we've had two sets of laws in Montenegro _ the
army's and the government's,'' said Milka Tadic, managing editor of
the weekly independent newspaper Monitor. ``But as we all know,
when you have two laws, you really have no law at all.''
</P>
<P>
   After more than a month and a half of this struggle, the
Montenegrin government remains intent on resisting the army,
without provoking a violent reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``As reasonable people we seek to avoid conflict,'' said
Montenegro's foreign minister, Branko Perovic. ``But if they insist
on conflict, they will have it.''
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro is a small theater in the current conflict, a
republic the size of Connecticut with 635,000 people and an ancient
history of stubborn resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the consequences of what is happening here are of great
concern to NATO and Washington because Montenegro looms as yet
another flash point in what remains of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The allies have warned Milosevic that they will not stand idly
by if there is an outright attempt to overthrow Montenegro's
constitutional government. But the limited bombing of Montenegro's
airport and other sites by NATO jets has given the large number of
Montenegrins who support Milosevic a chance to further stir up the
resentment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is unacceptable that the government of Montenegro has still
not condemned the aggression on its country but instead blames the
federal government,'' said Predrag Bulatovic, deputy leader of the
Socialist People's Party at a recent news conference.
</P>
<P>
   While the Socialist party is a minority in parliament, it enjoys
substantial support among hard-liners and former Communists, and
many of its leaders are closely aligned with Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Party leaders accuse the current government of treason for not
supporting Serbia's war effort. They are suspicious of foreign
journalists and rejected requests for an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The roots of Montenegro's current crisis go back to 1997, when a
majority of voters turned away from Milosevic and his policies by
electing a pro-Western, democratic president. The day before Milo
Djukanovic was inaugurated, more than 30 police officers were hurt
in Podgorica when they confronted a pro-Milosevic mob intent on
keeping the new government from taking power.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've never given up the idea of a coup,'' said Dragisa
Burzan, Montenegro's deputy prime minister, referring to the
Socialist People's Party, and indirectly to Milosevic. ``Now they
want to misuse the situation with NATO to conduct their coup
because they know that in normal times they could not succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   On top of the political uncertainty, Montenegro's economy is a
shambles. Tourism, the republic's top source of income, has been
devastated as vacationers have stayed away from Montenegro's famous
Adriatic Sea beach resorts.
</P>
<P>
   About 70 percent of the economy is not functioning, officials
said, and top industries have been severely cut back or completely
shut down because they cannot get raw materials and because Serbia,
the biggest buyer of Montenegrin exports, has been effectively shut
down by the current conflict with NATO. Unemployment is soaring and
the government is almost out of money.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The strongest weapon civilian authorities have used to hold the
Yugoslav army in check is the 3,000-member police force, backed by
a large number of reservists. The Montenegrin government has
refused to recognize Belgrade's determination that a state of war
exists, and it refuses to give the Yugoslav army the power it wants
to commandeer schools, hospitals and public buildings and to
confiscate private stores of goods for military uses.
</P>
<P>
   But outright confrontation is not the goal. ``Our strategy,''
said Burzan, ``is to buy time.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts indicate that as the crisis has evolved,
Djukanovic's government has gained confidence in its ability to
handle the opposition's challenges without overreacting.
</P>
<P>
   ``But does that mean there are not going to be ongoing crises?''
said one western diplomat based outside Montenegro. ``The answer is
no. But on the other hand, the opposition is also showing a lack of
aggressiveness or boldness and they seem to have learned that it is
best not to cross certain lines.''
</P>
<P>
   The government is trying hard to preserve a sense of normalcy,
knowing that war fever could embolden the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Perovic, the foreign minister, said in an interview that he
believed Montenegro would be able to hold off its opponents until
the NATO bombing ended. He said he hoped that then the tensions
would ease substantially and the government would return to its
program of economic and political reform.
</P>
<P>
   But he warned Western leaders not to underestimate the
seriousness of Montenegro's crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that Mr. Milosevic is pushing so hard to destabilize
Montenegro should be a clear warning to the international community
that he is trying to find some way to escape from the trap they
have set for him,'' Perovic said. ``What he is doing here is trying
to eliminate a political force that will give him trouble after he
survives the current conflict.''

 &HT;    Gifts to HBCUs on the rise
 &HT;    By Kimberly H. Byrd
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ While individual contributions to historically black
colleges and universities have been up over the last decade, they
are still smaller than the millions given to traditionally white
institutions every year.
</P>
<P>
   William H. Gray, president and chief executive officer of the
United Negro College Fund, says there's a reason for the disparity.
</P>
<P>
   ``African-Americans have not had access to capital formation and
wealth accumulation like the white community,'' said Gray, whose
organization has raised $1.4 billion for black colleges and black
students. ``There are many more multimillionaire graduates from
Georgia Tech than there are from Morehouse. Therefore, over the
decades, they've been able to give more.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, actor Bill Cosby and his wife, Camille, were recognized
as black philanthropists when they donated more than $20 million to
build a new academic center at Spelman College. The couple has also
supported at least six other black colleges, including Morehouse.
</P>
<P>
   Willie Gary, a prominent Florida attorney, pledged $10 million
to his alma mater, Shaw University in Raleigh, N.C., in the early
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago-based talk show host Oprah Winfrey, who delivered the
commencement address at Morehouse on Sunday, established a
scholarship fund at Morehouse a decade ago with $1 million. In
1997, she gave $1 million to launch another scholarship at the
school.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the big donors are graduates of HBCUs, university
administrators said. Others have children who attended one of the
colleges. Some choose to support the schools because they provide
educational access to African-American students.
</P>
<P>
   Gray attributes the increase in giving at HBCUs to the fact that
the first group of ``extremely wealthy'' African-Americans surfaced
over the last decade with careers in sports, entertainment and
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still, when you look at the wealthiest African-Americans and
compare their wealth to the wealthiest whites in America, there is
a huge gap,'' Gray said. ``So HBCUs continue to struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   They struggle, Gray said, not only because black alumni from the
schools have limited wealth, but also because the HBCUs are
committed to educating students from low-income families. Out of
fear the students could otherwise be denied entry to other
institutions of higher learning, HBCUs are hesitant to raise
tuition and fees.
</P>
<P>
   The key to getting alumni to contribute _ even if it's not in
the millions _ is to give them a cause or a building campaign to
support, said Trisa Long Paschal, vice president for institutional
advancement at Spelman College.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1993-96, Spelman ran a fund-raising campaign that
produced $113.8 million, of which $3 million came from alumni. The
campaign was centered around building a science center, and now the
college is planning to renovate the historic Sisters Chapel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found that we'd never asked our alumni for help, and once
we asked they said yes,'' Paschal said. ``It was a matter of
helping them understand how they could support us.'' Carla Maxwell
Ray, associate vice president of institutional advancement at
Morehouse, said the school uses galas and affairs in various
locales across the United States to increase awareness about the
institution's goals.
</P>
<P>
   Getchel Caldwell, associate vice president for university
relations for Clark Atlanta University, said officials there are
negotiating sizeable gifts from three alumni and an anonymous donor
sometime during the 1999-2000 school year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clark Atlanta has good experience with getting foundation
support,'' Caldwell said. ``But we're just getting into the
ballgame of individual, six-digit gifts.''
</P>
<P>
   Caldwell said Clark Atlanta averages about $1 million a year in
individual gifts, mainly from alumni. That's not surprising since
it mirrors nationwide statistics that show alumni giving ranges
between 11 percent and 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``African-Americans are just getting into positions where they
have disposable wealth to give back to institutions of higher
learning,'' Caldwell said, acknowledging that their main competitor
is the black church.
</P>
<P>
   ``As increasing opportunities are made to African-Americans,
you'll see increased giving just as you saw with early immigrant
colleges like Notre Dame, Brigham Young and Yeshiva,'' Gray said.
``Black colleges will continue to survive and flourish.

   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Gordon H. Smith, R-Ore., was endorsed by the
National Rifle Association. He owns guns and has taught his two
sons and his daughter how to use them. And while he has ``always
melted in the face of Bambi,'' he occasionally goes hunting for
pheasant and duck.
</P>
<P>
   But despite his resolute defense of the Second Amendment, Smith
said he was dismayed by the position that he and his party found
themselves in last week, essentially standing in opposition to
requiring background checks on everyone who buys guns at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   The morning news programs, portraying the Republican Party as a
captive of the NRA, only added to his unease. ``I voted, and I woke
up feeling ashamed and determined to change this,' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By week's end, with Smith's help, the Republicans had reversed
course on the issue, even though the Democrats had said there were
still big loopholes in their approach. And Smith, a 46-year-old
businessman in his third year in the Senate, had become emblematic
of the new Zeitgeist on gun control, post-Littleton.
</P>
<P>
   The turning point for Smith, though, was not the killing of 15
people at a high school in Littleton, Colo., he said, but the
previous school shooting in Springfield, Ore., where two students
died and many more were injured.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he went to Thurston High School after the shooting,
saw ``these survivors with the bullet holes scarred over on their
bodies,'' and heard ``their parents pleading for us to do
something.'' And, he said, ``It made me determined not to just talk
this away.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics would argue that the Republican Party's shifting stance
on gun control was less a profile in courage than an effort to get
in front of the public opinion polls, which many strategists
believe show an electorate increasingly open to regulating guns.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, back home in Oregon, the Republican-led House was also
moving on a bill last week that would require background checks for
people who who buy firearms at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   But gun control, like abortion, is an issue with little
political territory that is truly safe. And when all the voting was
done last week, Smith did not sit in his office with the happy
certitude of the poll-driven politician, confident in his numbers.
Even as he spoke, his assistants were lining up interviews with
editors of rural newspapers, trying to get his position across back
home.
</P>
<P>
   Will he be punished?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' said Smith, who is not up for re-election
until 2002. ``I don't know. I know I feel at peace with myself, and
I'm determined to sell my view at home, which is that if you want
to protect your Second Amendment rights there come some
responsibilities _ and part of it is putting into place background
checks which separate good citizens from kooks and crooks.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., a leader in gun control
efforts, said he had spoken to Smith at some length and concluded,
``I don't think that this, for him, was a political calculation as
much as it was, `Enough, already!''' The gun lobby, Schumer said,
had simply pushed Senate Republicans too far.
</P>
<P>
   Before their reversal on Friday, Republicans like Smith were on
record with a vote against a Democratic proposal that would have
required background checks for all sales at gun shows and for a
Republican proposal that would have made those checks voluntary in
some cases. Smith, who said he had supported the idea of mandatory
background checks all along, but thought the Democratic bill
``overreached,'' was one of those who demanded a stronger
Republican alternative. It passed on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who notes he is the first Senator elected from mostly
rural eastern Oregon in nearly 75 years, clearly likes the idea of
finding middle ground, ``reasonable proposals'' that can link rural
and urban constituents, hunters and suburban parents. Although
considered a conservative, he prides himself on forging a good
working relationship with Sen. Ron Wyden, a liberal Democrat and
past opponent. ``I'm probably not pure enough for any single
interest group,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Could it have something to do with his childhood?
</P>
<P>
   He was the eighth of 10 children. His father worked in the
family's food processing business, then went to work in the
Eisenhower administration as executive assistant to the secretary
of agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   His mother was a Udall, making Smith a cousin of the notable
Western Democrats Morris and Stewart Udall. ``I watched them make
enormous contributions to our country in Congress and in Democratic
administrations,' he said. ``So for me, the issues that divide
Democrats and Republicans have never been about good people and bad
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, a Mormon, graduated from Brigham Young University in 1976
after a two-year missionary assignment in New Zealand. He obtained
a law degree, practiced law for a while, then bought the family
frozen vegetable company in eastern Oregon. In 1992, he won
election to the Oregon state Senate, and three years later was
elected Senate president.
</P>
<P>
   He went to the U.S. Senate after a brutal year in which he
sought two Senate seats: He lost a special election in January 1996
to Wyden for the seat left vacant by the resignation of Sen. Bob
Packwood. Then, with a campaign pitched more to the center, Smith
came back to win the election in November 1996 for the seat left
vacant by the retirement of Sen. Mark O. Hatfield.
</P>
<P>
   So what, exactly, changed for him in Springfield and Littleton?
The week was winding down, the other senators scattering, and Smith
was groping, just a little. Then finally he said, ``It heightened
the sensitivity I felt Wednesday night when I saw my party being
unresponsive to the emotions I felt from places like Springfield
and Jonesboro and Littleton.''
</P>
<P>
   In that moment, change seemed in the air.

TANQUERAY RETIRES JENKINS AND INTRODUCES COOL BRITANNIA  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., Ill., Texas, Mich. , Calif. , Fla., Britain)   By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The marketers of a well-known gin are shaking, not
stirring, its advertising, replacing a pitch based on fantasy with
one based on reality _ well, as realistic as you can get on Madison
Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Tanqueray, the best-selling brand of imported gin, is ending a
five-year campaign featuring a make-believe character named
Jenkins, a dapper roue whose sybaritic adventures centered on
parties and gin martinis. Ads last month trumpeted the
``disappearance'' of Jenkins and the subsequent decision of the
``beloved Tanqueray figurehead,'' as he was described in one mock
headline, to retire to _ appropriately enough _ a make-believe
tropical island.
</P>
<P>
   New print, outdoor and postcard ads and promotions, now under
way, sell Tanqueray on attributes like authenticity and heritage.
They present traditional and contemporary images of London to
reinforce the Tanqueray identity as a brand distilled in Britain
since 1830.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of the new campaign, with an increased budget of $25
million to $30 million, is underlined by a formal redesignation of
the brand on labels and packaging as Tanqueray London Dry Gin.
</P>
<P>
   The switch in campaigns is indicative of the need for
advertisers and agencies to rethink how they approach consumers,
even when ads are deemed successful.
</P>
<P>
   Tanqueray case shipments in the United States rose 2.8 percent
last year to 1.3 million, according to the Impact annual distilled
spirits survey published by M. Shanken Communications in New York,
even as shipments of domestic gins declined about 4 percent and
shipments of all gins fell about 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In total sales for all brands, Tanqueray trails only Seagram's
Gin, sold by the Seagram Co.
</P>
<P>
   The Jenkins campaign ``made the brand a lot more relevant and
fun and hip and brought a lot more younger adult consumers into the
Tanqueray franchise,'' said Leah Russell, vice president and
product group director for the Tanqueray brand family at the
Schieffelin &AMP; Somerset Co. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's time for a change, time for something new and
different,'' she added. ``So it's time to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   The new campaign, carrying the theme ``Tanqueray London,'' also
serves as a fond ``cheerio'' to Deutsch Inc. in New York, which has
been the brand's agency for American campaigns since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Diageo PLC, which owns Schieffelin &AMP; Somerset, is consolidating
the Tanqueray worldwide creative account at offices of the J.
Walter Thompson Company unit of WPP Group PLC.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had an excellent relationship with Deutsch,'' Ms.
Russell said. ``But this is the corporate direction, and we
understand it's meant to benefit the company as a whole.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, she added, ``we are so excited and confident about the
`London' campaign that we will support it fully despite the
change.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Deutsch waxed bittersweet about the loss of the
Tanqueray assignment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great relationships and great advertising don't often come
into play'' in consolidations, said Andrew Beaver, executive vice
president and group account director at Deutsch.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``we're told the `Tanqueray London' campaign will
run for a year at least.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign uses photographs of British icons interspersed with
men and women in their 20s clad in trendy outfits. The familiar
symbols include flags, an English bulldog and a swatch of Prince of
Wales plaid fabric; the modern symbols include the logo of the
Ministry of Sound, a group of London disk jockeys.
</P>
<P>
   The attitude is very much ``Cool Britannia,'' the sobriquet for
the chic, confident spirit of Britain under Prime Minister Tony
Blair, crossed with the tongue-in-cheek attitude of Austin Powers,
the comic secret agent played in two films by the actor Mike Myers.
(In fact, small type in some Tanqueray ads, to promote
``responsible drinking,'' uses the Powers catch phrase ``Oh
behave.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``There seem to be articles almost daily about new things in
fashion, art, design, style and music coming from London,'' Ms.
Russell said. ``These are fun, compelling images, unusual for
spirits advertising and refreshing in that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the campaign is not just about what's going on now,
because that would be just fads,'' she added. ``The background for
the cool London of today is 20, 30, 40 years of cool trends, from
the Beatles and Twiggy and punk to Oasis and Seal and Wallpaper
magazine.''
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Delaney, partner and executive creative director at
Deutsch, and Craig Markus, senior vice president and group creative
director, expressed enthusiasm about the elasticity of the format.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sign of a big idea when you can just keep going and
going and going,'' Ms. Delaney said. ``We almost had to restrain
ourselves from putting together more ads'' beyond the initial 10.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequent ads are already being planned. For instance, Ms.
Russell said, a distinctive London taxicab will be in an ad to
discourage drinking and driving.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign, which also promotes Tanqueray Malacca Gin, a
lighter-tasting variety, will appear in magazines including Black
Enterprise, Cosmopolitan, Ebony, Elle, Fast Company, GQ, The New
Yorker, Playboy, Rolling Stone, Saveur, Talk, Vanity Fair and
Wallpaper. The outdoor signs will appear in 12 markets including
Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Detroit, Los Angeles, Miami, New York and
San Francisco.

 &HT;    GORE OFFERS TEACHERS CARROT AND STICK
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON - Teachers should get more money and be held to
higher standards, Vice President Al Gore said Sunday in what was
billed as the first major policy address of his presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should treat teachers like professionals, we should pay
them like professionals, and we should hold them to high
professional standards,'' Gore said in a commencement speech at
Graceland College, a Mormon-founded school in Lamoni, Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   The financial incentives would include $10,000 hiring bonuses
and higher pay. The higher standards would be imposed through
tougher licensing tests and weaker tenure protection.
</P>
<P>
   The new teacher policies were at the heart of his long education
agenda. Its two dozen points included suggestions that states offer
voluntary pre-school programs for every child, and that parents,
teachers and students be required to sign a disciplinary pledge on
the opening day of school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every one of these proposals will be fully paid for within a
balanced budget,'' Gore said, though he did not estimate what they
would cost.
</P>
<P>
   His blueprint was far more detailed than that of his only
visible challenger for the Democratic nomination, former Sen. Bill
Bradley of New Jersey. Bradley has said he will offer specifics of
his own education program in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said the hiring bonuses would go to older people who switch
to the teaching profession and to young people who join a new
``21st Century Teacher Corps,'' and teach for four years in ``a
school that needs your help.'' Today, that school would probably be
in either an inner city or rural area, where recruiting qualified
new teachers is most difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Teacher unions that have backed Gore in the past already favor
better pay and bonuses as well as tougher licensing tests. But they
have offered only tepid support for programs that weed out weak
teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Many other items on Gore's long list of proposals repeated or
extended suggestions that President Clinton has sent to Congress
for approval this year. For example, Clinton wants the average
class size in early grades limited to 18. Gore said he would reduce
class size in higher grades to 20.
</P>
<P>
   One completely new proposal was Gore's suggestion for creating a
new volunteer army of tutors and mentors who would help children
on-line, rather than in person.
</P>
<P>
   However, the vast bulk of Gore's proposals have been tested by
reform-minded officials ranging from Richard Daley, the Democratic
mayor of Chicago, to two Republican presidential hopefuls, former
Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Gore endorsed efforts to make schools ``gun free,
drug free, safe and secure,'' encourage adults to volunteer as
mentors, run after-school and summer-school programs, stress
``civic'' and ``character'' education, and use tests to prod
schools toward efforts to narrow the gap between whites and other
students in drop-out rates and scholastic achievement.
</P>
<P>
   However, unlike Alexander, publishing heir Steve Forbes of New
Jersey and several other GOP candidates, Gore opposes the use of
tax-paid vouchers for students in private elementary and secondary
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander scoffed at Gore's proposals as so detailed that they
amounted to proposing creation of a ``national school board.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants teachers whose qualifications would be set in
Washington,'' Alexander told Reuters news service in an interview.
``It's a question of who knows what's best - Washington or the
local school boards, teachers and parents.''
</P>
<P>
   Ari Fleischer, spokesman for GOP presidential candidate
Elizabeth Dole, said, ``She will look at the vice president's
positions, but she won't comment on them in a partisan or negative
way. She doesn't think education should be a partisan issue.''

BIG COMPANIES FALLING BEHIND IN YEAR 2000 REPAIRS, SURVEY SAYS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Texas)  By BARNABY J. FEDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The largest companies in the nation continue to fall behind
their schedules for Year 2000 repairs, and most suspect that their
budget estimates for the remaining work are too low, according to a
survey in April that was the latest in a closely watched series
that began in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   About 22 percent say they do not expect to have all of their
critical systems tested and ready to adjust when the clock ticks
over to Jan. 1, 2000. That is up from 16 percent in November and 12
percent last August.
</P>
<P>
   The number of companies that have actually encountered a
computer failure stemming from Year 2000 date miscalculations
jumped to 72 percent in April from 55 percent in the previous
survey, which was completed in November. Eight percent of the 152
Fortune 500 companies and 14 government agencies responding said
they had severed relations with a supplier, customer or partner
because of Year 2000 problems. This is the first time that such
moves have been reported.
</P>
<P>
   The surveys, which are sponsored by CAP Gemini America, a New
York consulting firm, are carried out by Howard A. Rubin, an
information technology researcher based in Pound Ridge, N.Y. The
respondents are typically chief information officers or project
managers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone agrees there will be some sort of disruptions,''
Rubin said. ``The real issue is going to be how you maintain
business continuity.''
</P>
<P>
   The fear is that computers will break down because they read the
year 2000 as 1900.
</P>
<P>
   About 85 percent of those polled said that spending would have
to rise beyond current estimates, mostly to support more testing
and the creation of emergency command centers and other contingency
plans aimed at keeping business running despite any Year 2000
glitches. Projects are slipping past their expected deadlines at 92
percent of the companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's typical information technology,'' said Prof. Leon A.
Kappelman, a software management expert at the University of North
Texas. ``You don't get any recognition until the last 30 days that
your project is going to be late.''
</P>
<P>
   More than a third now report that their companies are cutting
back on new information technology projects to pay for Year 2000
work. In part because of the attention to contingency planning,
which involves business managers in addition to technology
specialists, the percentage of work done internally has jumped to
82 percent from 60 percent in November.
</P>
<P>
   For all the problems, the respondents seem confident in their
ability to manage their way through Year 2000 disruptions. Three
out of four said that their Year 2000 programs will give them a
competitive advantage, the survey found.

YESTERDAY: THREE MORE CHEERS FOR MAGIC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As the year 2000 approaches, here's a look at some
of the interesting anniversaries that will occur this week in Los
Angeles sports history (followed by the ranking of the event from
the book ``Unforgettable: The 100 Greatest Moments in Los Angeles
Sports History'' in parenthesis, where applicable):
</P>
<P>
   __ May 18, 1956: Before 18,000 on a Friday night at L.A.'s
Wrigley Field _ an unusual place for a boxing match of this
magnitude _ 35-year-old Sugar Ray Robinson regains his middleweight
title against Carl ``Bobo'' Olson with a fourth-round knockout.
(90).
</P>
<P>
   __ May 18, 1987: Magic Johnson is named league MVP after
averaging a career-high 23.9 points for the Lakers and leading the
league with 12.2 assists.
</P>
<P>
   __ May 21, 1988: The Clippers win the NBA draft lottery and five
weeks later use it to pick Danny Manning out of Kansas. He would go
down with a knee injury 26 games into the season.
</P>
<P>
   __ May 22, 1968: The Dodgers' Don Drysdale outduels the
Cardinals' Bob Gibson 2-0 at Busch Stadium for his third straight
shutout en route to his record 582/3 scoreless innings.
</P>
<P>

   CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. _ If descendants of Thomas Jefferson ever
accept as their relatives people who claim as forebears Jefferson
and Sally Hemings, one of his slaves, the first steps were taken
over the weekend. However small they were.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the Jefferson family's 86th reunion, his descendants,
a group known as the Monticello Association, for the first time
invited Hemings descendants to attend a reception on Saturday at
Monticello, Jefferson's plantation home, and a family business
meeting Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   About 35 Hemingses came, and also for the first time, the
association agreed to accept a membership application from a
descendant of each of the three male children Hemings relatives
claim she had by Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a motion to have the Hemings descendants leave the
room after lunch Sunday, when the business meeting officially
began, was voted down, 33-20, another small sign that relations
might be warming.
</P>
<P>
   But it could be a long thaw.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the desire of all Hemings' progeny to be recognized as
true descendants of the nation's third president and the author of
the Declaration of Independence, the applications were viewed as
strictly symbolic.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; And final approval was hardly guaranteed, reflecting the
fierce pride of Jefferson descendants and their grudging reluctance
to accept an alternative view of history that shows their patriarch
in a less than glowing light.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the ongoing campaign by Hemings descendants to
prove what they believe is their rightful place in history, the
association voted to have a special committee gather more evidence
_ through genetic tests, oral histories and anything else _ before
making a final determination of whether Hemingses are truly
Jeffersons.
</P>
<P>
   The committee is expected to present its findings by next year's
reunion.
</P>
<P>
   The vote effectively seeks to build upon years of scientific,
genealogical and historical work that both supports and disputes
the contention that Jefferson and Hemings had children together.
Recent genetic tests, for example, offered evidence that Jefferson
probably fathered one of Hemings three sons, Eston Jefferson, but
not necessarily the other two, Thomas C. Woodson and James Madison
Hemings.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, descendants of Eston Jefferson argued this weekend
that the genetic evidence is compelling, while Woodson and Madison
progeny sought to place greater emphasis on oral histories passed
down by generations of their families.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, the request for more information continued a
Jefferson family dispute pitting forces sympathetic to the Hemings'
campaign to be accepted against family members who want to see more
proof.
</P>
<P>
   The rancor spilled out &UR;  &LR; of the meeting room Sunday when the
Hemings' leading champion among the Jefferson descendants, Lucien
K. Truscott IV, an author from Los Angeles, accused the out-going
president, Robert M. Gillespie, of sabotaging efforts to have
Hemings' descendants ultimately be recognized as true Jefferson
descendants.
</P>
<P>
   Truscott said that when he made a motion for the association's
executive committee to admit the Hemingses as honorary members, he
was dismissed by Gillespie as acting out of order.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a good reflection of how fair they intend to be with
the criteria committee they appointed,'' Truscott said. ``They had
the opportunity to vote, to let these people in as nonvoting
members, to come to meetings, and they wouldn't even let the floor
vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Gillespie insisted Truscott was out of order, that association
bylaws say that honorary members must be affiliated either with the
Monticello Foundation, which maintains the residence, or the
University of Virginia, which Jefferson founded.
</P>
<P>
   Other Jefferson descendants took issue with Truscott, not least
for his characterizations of association members as racists for
their reluctance to recognize Hemingses as Jeffersons.
</P>
<P>
   As Truscott stood before a bank of television cameras, answering
reporters' questions, one Jefferson descendant, Theresa
Shackelford, walked up beside him to refute some of his
contentions.
</P>
<P>
   To his charge that some members have said they would resign and
insist upon not being buried in the family cemetery if Hemings were
allowed in, Ms. Shackelford said, ``I've never heard anybody say
they would resign or refuse to be buried in the graveyard.
</P>
<P>
   ``And you can't allow them in as honorary members until there is
time to do more thorough research,'' she added. ``You can't do
these things halfway. Look, I am for any lineal descendant, be they
black, white or purple. We're not racists in this organization.
We're snobs, but not racists.''

FACING ELIMINATION NOTHING NEW FOR BLUES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
DALLAS _ Sometimes, it's all in the way you look at a situation.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The St. Louis Blues trail the Stars 3-2 in their best-of-seven
Western Conference semifinal series. If they lose Game 6, scheduled
for 6:30 tonight in St. Louis, their season is over.
</P>
<P>
   The Blues think they are lucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we look at it,'' defenseman Al MacInnis said, ``We're
in a better position now than we were in the first series.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first series, they trailed the Phoenix Coyotes 3-1 and
had to win three consecutive games to advance. They did, becoming
the 15th team in the Stanley Cup playoffs to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``We faced elimination before,'' MacInnis said. ``We faced it
three times in the first round. It's not going to be anything new
to us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blues realize what they have to do, too, if they are going
to again survive testing the odds. In NHL playoff series that were
tied 2-2, the Game 5 winners have won 81 percent of the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to do two things,'' Blues center Pierre Turgeon said.
``We have to play well on the power play, and we have to come out
strong early. If we do those things, we'll be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a pretty big ``if.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blues are 2-for-25 on the power play and have been outscored
6-1 in the first period.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we knew \Rwhat was wrong with the power play\S we'd have it
fixed, wouldn't we?'' Chris Pronger said.
</P>
<P>
   Blues coach Joel Quenneville said the Blues would work on the
power play to try to get it back to where it was in the first
round, when they were 9-for-33 with a man advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a couple of quality chances that didn't materialize,''
Quenneville said.
</P>
<P>
   The Blues were getting plenty of first shots. MacInnis said the
Blues have to find a way to get more second chances. They would
also help themselves if they weren't always playing from behind.
</P>
<P>
   In the first five games of the series, the Stars scored the
first goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gets back to we want to get out quick,'' Blues winger
Blair Atcheynum said. ``We have to start strong and get the Kiel
\RCenter\S rocking.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kiel Center hasn't been very friendly to the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   The Blues are 2-0 at home against the Stars in the playoffs.
They were 3-0-1 at home against them in the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest, and maybe most important numbers, are 3-0 _ the
Blues' record in elimination games in this year's playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you think?'' Pronger said when asked if Game 6 was
like the last three games against Phoenix. ``It's definitely a
do-or-die situation. We have to win to stay alive in the series.''
</P>
<P>
   His solution on how to stay alive for Game 7?
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to look at ourselves in the mirror and come up with a
better effort,'' Pronger said. ``Our attitude has to be desperation
and determination. This is the same thing as Phoenix; a loss and
you go home.''

 ZIFF-DAVIS SEEKING AIR TIME FOR ITS PC-TV CHANNEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By Dan Fost  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
In its uphill quest to build a 24-hour cable television channel
with nothing but shows about computers, San Francisco's ZDTV last
week marked its first anniversary with impressive national growth
but without the prize it covets most: complete coverage in the Bay
Area.
</P>
<P>
   Locals can see the station on a select number of cable systems,
or via satellite services such as DirecTV and EchoStar.
</P>
<P>
   Not only do people in San Francisco and Silicon Valley represent
the country's most likely audience for all-computer all-the-time
television _ Wired magazine called it ``you-gotta-be-kidding TV'' _
but the 200 people who work for ZDTV would love to tell their
neighbors and friends where to tune in.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was any one thing I could still do in this first
year, if I had a magic wand to wave, it would be to make ZDTV
available to everyone in the Bay Area,'' said Larry Wangberg, the
chief executive. ``Here we are in the middle of everything we're
talking about, and we're the only national network based in the Bay
Area, and to not be carried is disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   Alice Chegia, a news producer and anchor in ZDTV's news
department, notes that Kate Botello and Leo Laporte, the stars of
the ZDTV show ``The Screen Savers,'' are mobbed by fans when they
do store appearances from Las Vegas to New Jersey, but ``nobody
would even open the door for them at Staples on Potrero.''
</P>
<P>
   For ZDTV to pull it off locally, the network will have to get
picked up by Tele-Communications Inc., which provides cable
services to 1.3 million people in the Bay Area _ 90 percent of the
region's cable audience.
</P>
<P>
   That's why signs are popping up around San Francisco saying
things like, ``TV doesn't get any more PC than this,'' and ``Dot
coms, not sitcoms.''
</P>
<P>
   While it's part of a more-than-$5 million national ad campaign,
the blitz comes at a crucial time locally. TCI has sent surveys out
to its Bay Area customers, asking what new channels they'd like to
see and which ones they want bumped. The surveys are due to TCI by
July 10 and could have a quick impact on channel lineups.
</P>
<P>
   ``For ZDTV and any cable network, it's about customer demand,''
said Andrew Johnson, executive director of communications for TCI's
Western region. ``If they are successful in spreading the word
about what the channel offers, promoting themselves and creating
buzz in the community, certainly we'll have to give it a serious
look.''
</P>
<P>
   New York City, ZDTV officials note, is also high on the list,
but ZDTV hasn't persuaded the Big Apple's cable provider,
Time-Warner, to carry the network anywhere, much less in the
advertising capital.
</P>
<P>
   ZDTV is available on cable in some large cities, like Denver and
Phoenix, as well as places like Smyrna, Ga.; Muscatine, Iowa; and
Kennebunk, Maine. It boasts a total reach into 11 million homes,
but only about 4 million of those are via cable. And that reach is
out of about 76 million homes that get either cable or satellite
television services.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a typical story for a new network,'' said Alan
Breznick, national affairs editor for Cable World magazine. ``It's
very hard to get distribution at first.''
</P>
<P>
   Venerable computer magazine publisher Ziff-Davis launched the
station one year ago with two ambitious goals: to make interesting
programs about computers, and to sell those to a marketplace that's
saturated with television networks.
</P>
<P>
   It produces six hours of programming a day, which it then
repeats three times. Many of the shows are live. The station is
constantly considering new shows and trying out concepts in its
existing shows to see what might work as a spin-off.
</P>
<P>
   The current lineup includes ``Call for Help,'' which advises
viewers on how to use their home computers, and ``The Screen
Savers,'' a similar show with a geekier audience; ``Silicon Spin,''
sort of a high-tech ``McLaughlin Group'' hosted by the curmudgeonly
John C. Dvorak; a news show, ``Internet Tonight''; ``Fresh Gear,''
veteran tech writer Jim Louderback's look at the latest gadgets;
and ``The Money Machine,'' a primer on using computers and the
Internet to make money.
</P>
<P>
   Among ZDTV's striking differences are what it calls a ``Netcam
Network'' _ tiny cameras that the station has sent to 2,500 viewers
(with plans to reach 10,000 eventually) so that viewers can chat
live on the air as if they're guests on ``Nightline'' _ and
``live'' animated characters Tilde and Dash, who speak to viewers
in real time thanks to humans wired behind the scenes.
</P>
<P>
   At launch, Ziff-Davis said it was prepared to spend $100 million
on the endeavor, and analysts expect ZDTV to lose $30 million to
$35 million this year. Last year, ZDTV scored a $54 million
investment from Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, which gives him a
33 percent stake in the venture. Allen is one of the country's
largest cable operators, and ZDTV chief executive Larry Wangberg
said that should help get the network into more homes.
</P>
<P>
   Wangberg, 56, a cable industry veteran, booms with enthusiasm at
his new high-tech career. He points to eager viewer response and
advertising from big tech firms like Microsoft, Oracle, Dell
Computer and Sun Microsystems as evidence of growing success. The
next step is to sign up big mainstream advertisers, like carmakers;
Wangberg said it's about to happen, but he can't give specifics.
</P>
<P>
   ZDTV faces stiff competition from other cable networks, whether
they're already out there like the Cartoon Network or Robert
Redford's Sundance Channel, or whether they're even newer startups
like a planned National Geographic channel.
</P>
<P>
   Until it hits 20 million homes, Nielsen, the television ratings
firm, won't even assess ZDTV's share of viewership.
</P>
<P>
   TCI's Johnson notes the numbers that stack up against any new
network. ZDTV is one of 176 networks competing for slots. The
average cable lineup has about 60 slots. Stations that the Federal
Communications Commission requires to be carried take up about half
those offerings. Cable systems with digital offerings can fit an
extra 36 channels.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means there's 70 spaces &UR;  &LR; and 170 competing,'' TCI's
Johnson said. ``We're no different than your local Safeway. If
there's demand for your product, we'll put it on our shelf. If it
doesn't sell, we'll take it off and replace it with something
else.''
</P>
<P>
   TCI is likely to hear from some of ZDTV's rabid fans. Jim
Gabbert of Sausalito, the former owner of KOFY-TV (Channel 20),
watches ZDTV over his DirecTV satellite dish. ``I think they do a
lot of neat things,'' he said. ``TCI should be crucified for not
carrying them.''
</P>
<P>
   Although ZDTV is the only TV network dedicated to computers, it
isn't the only TV programming about computers. Silicon Valley's own
Stewart Cheifet pioneered computing television 15 years ago when he
created ``The Computer Chronicles'' for PBS, and Cheifet also
co-hosts the PBS show the ``Net Cafe.''
</P>
<P>
   Other network affiliates and cable stations offer computer
shows. In the Bay Area, KRON-TV produces ``New Media News,'' which
appears on KRON and BayTV (both of which are owned by Chronicle
Publishing Co.).
</P>
<P>
   Cnet, a San Francisco firm that competes fiercely with
Ziff-Davis' online publications, produces five television shows
with a sixth on the way. Most of those shows air on USA Networks
and the Sci-Fi channel, with some showing on local stations such as
KRON and KPIX.
</P>
<P>
   Although ZDTV says it doesn't view Cnet as competition, Greg
Drebin, ZDTV's senior vice president of programming and production,
offers a pungent assessment of Cnet's offerings: ``I defy anybody
to tell me when they're on the air.''
</P>
<P>
   While some of Cnet's shows bounce around the programming
schedule, others have regular time slots on stations that have a
broad reach. USA and Sci-Fi are in 77 million and 55 million homes
respectively, said Dan Sexton, vice president of Cnet television.
</P>
<P>
   Cnet had initially contemplated a cable network well before ZDTV
launched, but Sexton said, ``Financially, it just did not make
sense to us. It made more sense to attach our programming to
existing cable networks that had more carriage.''
</P>
<P>
   While ZDTV works to get picked up by more cable systems, some
observers hope to see the channel look to Wall Street for more
financial backing. For one thing, said Larry Gerbrandt, senior
analyst with the Carmel media research firm Paul Kagan Associates,
no cable networks are traded on the public stock market; those that
were, like Black Entertainment Television, the Nashville Network
and the Family Channel, have either been taken private or been
acquired by larger companies.
</P>
<P>
   ZDTV doesn't reveal specifics about its finances, but Wangberg
says it operates at a loss and will continue to do so for the
foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
   These days, that often spells success in the stock market, but
CEO Wangberg is coy about any potential public offering.
</P>
<P>
   ``In today's environment, some people can't help but think about
that, but there's nothing specific in the works that would be
happening any time soon,'' Wangberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Just because ZDTV is the first computer network out there is no
guarantee of success, but its timing and its deep pockets do give
it a leg up, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Niche businesses like ZDTV are the future of video
programming,'' said Gary Arlen, president of Arlen Communications,
a Maryland media research firm. ``If Ziff is willing to sustain it
for three or four years, I think it has a good chance of long-term
success.''

 A Day in the Life of ZDTV's `The Screen Savers' Show

``Geek'' is a word you hear a lot on the set of ``The Screen

</P>
<P>
   The hosts of the &UR;  &LR; daily hourlong ZDTV show refer to themselves
as geeks. The producer says he's a geek. The viewers? Geeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Geekiness is good,'' says Kate Botello, the 27-year-old

</P>
<P>
   Broadcast veteran Leo Laporte plucked Botello as his co-host
from the geekiest of careers. She's gone from working in
Ziff-Davis' information services department to being a star on the
company's new television station.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got caught doing my Judy Garland impression at the laser
printer, and that's how I bonded with Leo,'' Botello says.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  The computer-advice show includes a mix of interviews and
product reviews, but mostly it's Botello and Laporte chatting with
viewers about how to get the most out of their computers. Botello
is the young, female, red-headed, hyperactive foil to Laporte's
mature, silver-haired authority.
</P>
<P>
   Laporte, 43, has broadcast television and radio shows about
computers for most of the past decade. He and Botello are living
proof that television about computers does not have to be, in the
words of ZDTV chief executive Larry Wangberg, ``Two guys in lab
coats talking about the latest chip technology.'' It can be perky,
silly and interactive _ and actually help people solve their
computing problems.
</P>
<P>
   A typical day on the show starts at midmorning as the staff
files in to ZDTV's offices in the former San Francisco Fashion
Center at 650 Townsend St. With its white walls, white pipe
railings and bizarre curves and corridors, Botello calls the
building ``the S.S. Townsend.''
</P>
<P>
   Botello and Laporte maintain cubicles among the producers and
directors who work on the show; no dressing rooms with stars on
them here.
</P>
<P>
   Staffers spend at least part of the morning sifting through the
more than 600 e-mails Laporte gets each day, looking for trends and
for interesting questions that could be answered on the air. On his
drive home each evening, Laporte calls in from his car phone and
dictates answers to the questions.
</P>
<P>
   At noon, producer Ken Marcus, Laporte, Botello and a team of six
others gather in a conference room for the daily meeting. The
staffers have a variety of roles: working on the show's ``Netcam
Network,'' writing for the Web site tied to the show, lining up
guests for each day's episode and making sure the computers on the
set actually work.
</P>
<P>
   As they file in, Botello takes out a personal digital assistant
and shows off a drawing that a viewer e-mailed to her _ a cross
between Botello and Lara Croft, the animated star of the computer
game Tomb Raider. ``It's Screen Raider,'' Botello says. ``Isn't
that cool?''
</P>
<P>
   The fan response to the show is at times overwhelming to the
stars. On their first public appearance, in Las Vegas, more than
200 people lined up for four hours to meet Kate and Leo. More than
700 people turned out at Staples and Gateway stores in Pennsylvania
and New Jersey, including people wanting them to autograph their
motherboards, and a family of five wearing geeky glasses just like
Botello's and announcing, ``Amaze Yourself!'' _ the ZDTV slogan.
</P>
<P>
   Botello, who speaks in the rapid delivery of a stand-up
comedian, says her ``rubber face'' serves her well on camera. She
once pursued a career in theater, working as an understudy in the
San Francisco revue ``Beach Blanket Babylon,'' performing in skits
as Hillary Clinton, Ivana Trump and a dancing trash can. Of her
goofy television persona, she says, ``I actually am more weird than
I am on the air, and I have to tone myself down.''
</P>
<P>
   During the noon meeting, Botello throws in an occasional
wisecrack, but Marcus generally moves it along. They discuss that
evening's show and outline the show that will air one week later.
It's over in 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Staff members break for lunch and spends the afternoon
performing their tasks: updating the Web site, making sure the chat
software is working after a glitch sidetracked it the night before,
arranging the viewers who will appear on the show via their
netcams.
</P>
<P>
   The netcam network is huge. 3Com Corp., the computer networking
company, is giving &UR;  &LR; away 10,000 ``netcams'' for ZDTV viewers. These
little cameras sit atop viewers' monitors and are used to send in
video e-mails or to chat live on the air with the hosts.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the netcam star has a superfast Internet connection, the
quality often is herky-jerky motions that don't synch with the
sounds. ZDTV has handed out the netcams to everyone from young
children to retirees, from Houston to Neptune City, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Watching a promotional video of a guy named Al in Shreveport,
La., touting ZDTV on his netcam, ZDTV Vice President Greg Drebin
says, ``What other channel would this guy get a chance to be on?
The Internet is a level playing field. You don't have to look like
Mary Hart or John Tesh.''
</P>
<P>
   Early in the afternoon, Botello hops in a ZDTV van that shuttles
her to the station's studio, in a converted industrial building on
Potrero Hill.
</P>
<P>
   The station runs two 8,000-square-foot studios, each with fully
digital control rooms. Each studio has several sets, which look
small in person but much larger and more sophisticated on
television.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Screen Savers'' set has the look of ``Wayne's World,'' a
dorky basement cluttered with computers. Botello starts working on
the technical side of the show, installing software she might need
to use on the air. If she does it herself, she can talk about it
more cogently on the air.
</P>
<P>
   She crawls beneath a computer, unplugging and plugging in wires.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Laporte has arrived and gone straight to another set,
where he does another live show, ``Call for Help.'' That's the
less-techie sibling of ``The Screen Savers,'' in which Laporte
answers questions from children and new PC users. Botello calls it
``Mr. Leo's Neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Laporte used to talk for eight hours straight on the
radio, he says he can do two live shows in one day, when such an
endeavor would exhaust other ZDTV hosts. &UR;  &LR; Plus, he has what Botello
calls an ``encyclopedia brain'' crammed with computing knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   After his live episode of ``Call for Help'' ends, a tired
Laporte heads upstairs to a clothes rack and changes his shirt for
``The Screen Savers.''
</P>
<P>
   Laporte already has had his makeup applied by the time Botello
goes in to artist Kadidja Sallak's cramped office. Her red hair _
``it's my hair color; I paid for it'' _ is curled and combed, and
she comes out ready for show time.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, other staffers are arriving. Camera operators wheel
giant contraptions onto the set, snapping cameras in place. Marcus,
the producer, makes sure everything is set in the control room.
</P>
<P>
   At 5:20 p.m. _ 40 minutes to airtime _ Marcus convenes a quick
staff meeting on the set. Seventeen people form a circle. Everyone
runs through a script of each of the seven segments and the breaks
in between.
</P>
<P>
   While the final technical details fall into place, Laporte and
Botello warm up the crowd in the ZDTV way: They log into a chat
room. ``This is the live audience,'' Laporte says. ``If they get
bored, they'll write, `Snooooore.'''
</P>
<P>
   Marcus takes his seat in a control room. A computer monitor
shows him the script. A wall of TV monitors shows what's happening
on the set. He's wearing a headset and has a row of buttons he can
push to communicate with different people, from the camera
operators to the directors to Laporte and Botello.
</P>
<P>
   The show's opening plays, and then it's Laporte and Botello,
yakking away on live television. They discuss the latest upgrade to
Windows98, ask viewers to respond to an online poll and take a call
from a young man in French Creek, Nev.
</P>
<P>
   When the caller rambles on with irrelevant questions, Marcus _
watching time tick away _ yells into his headset, ``Lose him!''
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the show runs smoothly. Laporte and Botello tease
each other and banter with callers.
</P>
<P>
   The hosts continually tease an upcoming segment with Industrial
Light and Magic effects wizards Dave Latour and Rudy Bloss, who
will show the technology behind the movie ``The Mummy.'' The crew,
getting caught up in the hype, wraps production assistant Roger
Chang in toilet paper and has him stagger across the set on camera
as one segment segues to a break.
</P>
<P>
   As the show winds down, Wendy from Bethel, Conn., comes in on a
netcam. ``Right before we went on the air with her, she froze,''
Marcus says, looking at the still photo of Wendy on the screen. He
shrugs. ``It's the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcus actually likes when things like that happen: It shows the
viewers that the show is truly live and that computers do screw up.
``It's good TV,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Laporte wraps it up: ``Remember, my friends, believe in
technology, but keep your hands out of the hard drive at all
times.''
</P>
<P>
   The set is broken down almost instantly while advertisements
play on the air. Marcus gathers up his files in the control room.
``I gotta get out of here. News is coming in in half an hour,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   Laporte and Botello close out the chat rooms, and the staff
files out of the studio.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was show No.273,'' Marcus says. ``I have 273 hours of
live television under my belt. I think there were only 70 episodes
of `I Love Lucy.'''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the dark studio, the sun is still shining on Multimedia
Gulch. Some staffers get into the van to head back to Townsend
Street; Botello and Laporte have their cars handy.
</P>
<P>
   On his ride back home to the North Bay, Laporte begins dictating
answers to viewers' questions for tomorrow's show, episode 274.

 FILES _ SF CHRON  
 THE NET FILES/JON SWARTZ  Ruling May Mold Online Advice Giving 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
It lacks the sizzle of cybersex and economic clout of encryption,
but a First Amendment lawsuit now in progress could set the bounds
for government regulation of speech and commerce on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Court Judge Ricardo Urbina of Washington, D.C., is
expected this week to rule in the case. At issue: whether the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission is trampling the rights of Web
sites, newsletter publishers and software developers that give
investing advice by subjecting them to stringent licensing
procedures that include taking fingerprints and conducting
background checks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're being treated like criminals,'' said Scott Bullock,
senior attorney at the Institute for Justice, a civil-libertarian
law firm that is suing the CFTC on behalf of the plaintiffs. ``It's
amazing that the federal government is fingerprinting people before
they can establish a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as if these advisers are taking people's money and
investing it in the market,'' Bullock said. ``This has cast a chill
over the investment community.''
</P>
<P>
   The CFTC, which regulates the commodity and futures markets in
the United States, contends that it must license individuals
working in those markets _ including anyone paid for opinions and
general information about commodities. In 1995, the four-member
commission, wary of the growing influence of the Web, began
actively enforcing its policy.
</P>
<P>
   Publications like the Wall Street Journal and Barron's are
exempt from the rule because they give ``incidental'' commodity
trading advice as part of a general-purpose news service. The
Institute for Justice's clients in the current case exclusively
provide commodity trading advice, according to Bullock.
</P>
<P>
   Registration can be demeaning. Commodities advisers are not only
fingerprinted and investigated, but must divulge subscriber lists
and endure on-the-spot audits, according to Bullock. An adviser who
fails to register faces up to $500,000 in fines and five years in
prison, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unbelievable. There is no such registration process required
by any other government agency,'' said plaintiff Stephen Briese,
publisher of Bullish Review of Commodity Insiders, a Web site and
newsletter based in Gulf Breeze, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   CFTC officials declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   The case has far-reaching implications, according to free-speech
advocates. A victory for the plaintiffs would ``send an arrow''
through future attempts by government agencies to regulate
commentary in newsletters and Web sites deemed ``expert advice'' by
the government, Bullock said. That could reverberate into other
areas as diverse as medical and legal advice.
</P>
<P>
   A favorable decision also may halt an alarming trend: government
suits against publishers of self-help information. In January, a
Texas federal district court ruled that Parsons Technology's
Quicken Family Lawyer software amounted to an ``unlicensed practice
of law.'' The court subsequently banned the product's sale in
Texas, presumably to protect the ``uninformed and unwary from
overly simplistic legal advice.''
</P>
<P>
   Parsons of Hiawatha, Iowa, is appealing the decision to the U.S.
Court of Appeals In New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A STUDY IN CONTRASTS: File this under cruel fate: Less than a week
after Marimba went public in a stock offering valued at more than
$1 billion, PointCast was sold for relative chump change _ $7
million _ to an obscure Southern California software company.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Both companies were pioneers of ``push'' technology, which
automatically delivered customized news and information to
consumers' desktop computers. Why such different outcomes?
</P>
<P>
   After push lost its, well, oomph, Marimba of Mountain View
refined its business plan in late 1997 and, with the guidance of
influential venture capitalist John Doerr, was able to mollify
investors. Virtually overnight, it recast itself from a news
provider to a distributor of software programs for corporate
networks.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``They were smart enough to realize they needed to change
quickly or fall by the wayside like all the other push companies,''
said Allen Weiner, vice president of services at NetRatings Inc. in
Milpitas. &UR;  &LR; ``Marimba identified a problem that enterprise companies
had and turned its focus on a dime.''
</P>
<P>
   Marimba also remained patient with its management team. Chief
executive Kim Polese doggedly sold the new and improved company
while pursuing an IPO. ``Kim did a fabulous job of holding things
together _ both as a leader and a strategist,'' said Jim Breyer,
managing partner at Accel Partners, a Palo Alto venture capital
firm.
</P>
<P>
   Added another venture capitalist, who requested anonymity, ``I
still don't have a clue what they do, but they're worth $1 billion.
PointCast would kill for that.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; PointCast's sorry end was sad but hardly surprising.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, LaunchPad Technologies of San Diego essentially
agreed to buy PointCast for $7 million in stock and cash. LaunchPad
makes eWallet, which lets online users store credit card
information on their personal computers to simplify e-commerce
shopping.
</P>
<P>
   The price is a pittance for PointCast, which exploded on the
Internet landscape as the progenitor of ``push'' technology.
</P>
<P>
   At one time, the Sunnyvale company was so hot that it spurned a
$450 million takeover bid from media magnate Rupert Murdoch in
early 1997 in hopes of striking it even richer with a stock
offering. In that instance, greed was not good.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street soured on push _ which was criticized for clogging
corporate networks with too much data _ and eventually balked at
PointCast's IPO. Chris Hassett, co-founder and CEO, was jettisoned
in mid-1997 and former Pacific Bell CEO David Dorman immediately
stepped in. By then, PointCast's number of subscribers was stagnant
at 1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Dorman _ who vowed to take PointCast public within a year,
scotched those plans in 1998 and vainly pursued a buyer _ resigned
in March to run a new $10 billion venture between AT&AMP;T and British
Telecommunications PLC.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, a technology pact in which PointCast would supply
high-speed Internet access to a consortium of Baby Bells fizzled,
and PointCast fired a third of its then 220-person staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``PointCast was slower than Marimba to make a transition from
consumer-technology provider to enterprise provider,'' said Ken
Andersen, assistant managing editor of Venture Finance newsletter
in San Francisco. ``It cost them.''

 _ SF CHRON   Dissecting Biotech Industry's Bleak Prospects 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
Some 5,000 biotech leaders head to their annual trade show this
week in Seattle amid one of the toughest times in the industry's
history.
</P>
<P>
   Despite record highs on Wall Street, most small and midsized
biotech stocks have tanked as money managers shun long-term risks
in biotech for instant riches on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes seven to 10 years on average to approve a new drug,
and most institutional investors don't want their capital tied up
that long,'' said Curtis Hogue, analyst with Volpe Brown Whelan in
San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   And though the industry wants the Food and Drug Administration
to speed up its approval process, the public is pressuring the
agency not to let up its scrutiny because some newly approved
remedies have turned out to have deadly side effects for a few
patients.
</P>
<P>
   Even agricultural biotech, where companies have been able to
bring products to market quickly because they escape most FDA
scrutiny, could be stalled by European regulators. The Europeans
are demanding that American food producers label crops grown from
genetically modified seeds. Remember the Boston Tea Party? This
time, it could be the British or Germans in war paint, dumping
cargoes of genetically produced corn or soybeans exported from the
United States to their side of the pond.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid we could be headed for a trade war with Europe over
food,'' said David Flores, publisher of the BioCentury newsletter
in San Carlos.
</P>
<P>
   Surveying the industry's current woes, even optimistic Mark
Edwards, managing director of Recombinant Capital in San Francisco,
voiced this lament: ``Things do seem to have fallen to wrack and
ruin at the moment.'' But as tough as times are right now, Edwards
and other observers insist that better times lie ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``The irony is that the industry has many more drugs in
late-stage clinical trials than ever before,'' said Carl Feldbaum,
president of the Biotechnology Industry Organization.
</P>
<P>
   As the sponsor of this week's trade show in Seattle, Feldbaum
expects a record 5,000-plus attendees to peruse the show's 370
exhibits of everything from test tubes to video-conferencing
systems for travel-weary execs.
</P>
<P>
   Feldbaum is not alone in believing that the industry's strong
product pipeline means Wall Street is missing a bet. Scott
Morrison, a biotech consultant with Ernst &AMP; Young in Palo Alto, has
counted 305 drugs from U.S. biotech firms in late-stage trials.
Even if only 20 percent pass FDA review, as has historically been
the case, that would mean 60 new drugs on the market within two
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a tremendous number of undervalued companies out
there,'' Morrison insists.
</P>
<P>
   The industry has roared back from down cycles before. After the
lean years of 1993 and 1994, biotech stocks and IPOs took off in
mid-1995. The current crop of small firms was fertilized by capital
from venture firms and Wall Street during the latest boom cycle.
</P>
<P>
   But the good times in biotech ended last summer when the broader
market went into a decline. Other sectors quickly rebounded. So did
large biotech issues like Genentech and Amgen. But the vast number
of small to midsized biotech firms have never recovered, causing
cash-flow emergencies at dozens of firms, according to Jon Duane,
biotech consultant with McKinsey &AMP; Co. in Palo Alto.
</P>
<P>
   ``It now takes $300 million to $400 million to develop a drug,
and if a young company can't raise money on Wall Street, it doesn't
have a prayer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Duane says the latest biotech IPO occurred last August. In a bid
to break the dry spell, two Bay Area firms filed public offerings
earlier this month. VaxGen is a Brisbane firm working on an AIDS
vaccine. BioMarin Pharmaceutical in Novato is testing a drug to
treat a rare disease deadly to children.
</P>
<P>
   Both firms are in quiet periods, but what happens to their IPOs
over the next few months will speak volumes about Wall Street's
willingness to bankroll early stage biotech.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, cash-starved firms are striking Faustian bargains
with large pharmaceutical companies. Big drug firms have pockets
deep enough to fund biotech experiments. But if the biotech firm
strikes gold with a hit drug, its Big Pharma backer will lay claim
to most of the profits.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, local biotech firms are fortunate that Big Pharma has
filled the funding gap caused by Wall Street squeamishness.
Edwards, at Recombinant Capital, says Pfizer is indicative of this
trend. Flush with profits from Viagra, the New York drugmaker
recently opened a Bay Area office to plow at least $150 million a
year back into deals with Bay Area biotech firms, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The brewing trade war with Europe over genetically modified
foods has far less effect on the local industry than the funding
crisis because ag biotech is largely a Midwest phenomena.
</P>
<P>
   But food labeling is an issue that could rear up in the United
States as it has in Europe. Industry says genetic modifications to
crops _ generally meant to increase their resistance to insects _
are an environmental plus because they lessen the need for
insecticide sprays.
</P>
<P>
   Americans have been swallowing enhanced corn and soybeans for
years with no ill effects, says BIO President Feldbaum, who calls
European insistence on labeling ``irrational.''
</P>
<P>
   But Doreen Stabinsky, environmental studies professor at
California State University in Sacramento, calls labeling a
consumer protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Irradiated food is labelled,'' she said. ``If people want to
know how their food is produced, they should have that right.''
</P>
<P>
   Stay tuned for more on the food fight.

 `Smart' Vending Machines Deliver Merchandise, Ads
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By Carol Emert &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Care for an ad with that inkjet cartridge?
</P>
<P>
   Zoom Systems, a San Francisco company, has developed a ``smart''
vending machine that delivers targeted advertisements along with
merchandise such as printer supplies and T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Zoom's ``E-Station'' looks like a Space Age vending machine
crossed with a touch-screen ATM. The screen interface allows a user
to ask for product information, such as which kind of cartridge to
use with his or her printer. And the manufacturer can send
promotional messages tailored to users' buying patterns.
</P>
<P>
   For example, an office manager might go to an E-Station in her
building, insert her company credit card and order a
Hewlett-Packard inkjet cartridge. HP might then flash her an offer
for 50 percent off a second cartridge or explain why its
next-generation printer is better than the one she has.
</P>
<P>
   Because the office manager's credit card identifies her on every
visit, the machine can keep track of her purchases and remind her
when it's time to buy toner for the office photocopy machine.
</P>
<P>
   The machines, which are connected to the Internet, also can
monitor inventory, so manufacturers know which products are selling
and when to restock them. Information from each machine is
collected in databases that the product-makers can access from
 &LR; www.zoomsystems.com &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Although other vending machine-makers use Web technology to
track inventory, only E-Station has an interface that allows
information to flow between manufacturer and customer. Zoom has
filed 200 patent claims, the first in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowing a customer is predisposed to buy a certain item
presents a very good opportunity for a manufacturer to make a
higher margin sale,'' said Shawn Milne, research analyst with
Hambrecht &AMP; Quist's E-Services Group. ``The whole service world is
trying to drive repeat business from existing customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, privacy advocates aren't likely to take a shine to
E-Station's information gathering any more than they like similar
setups on Web sites and supermarket scanners.
</P>
<P>
   Gower Smith, Zoom's chief executive, said E-Stations do not know
users' names, demographic profile or other personal information.
Repeat buyers are known only through identifiers on their corporate
cards or employee numbers, similar to the way a Web site can track
an individual's behavior whenever she visits the site, but doesn't
know who the person is.
</P>
<P>
   Zoom plans to use more personalized information down the line,
but only if users voluntarily register, said Smith. The information
will never be sold to third parties, he added.
</P>
<P>
   HP is the first manufacturer to test the machines, installing 10
in Tempe, Ariz., in fall 1997. &UR;  &LR; Zoom's Smith said he is also
talking to Home Depot, Gap and Joe Boxer about using E-Stations.
</P>
<P>
   HP has ordered 200 more machines and plans to install the first
local E-Stations by the end of the summer in Silicon Valley
offices. A European rollout is in the planning stages.
</P>
<P>
   Vending machines allow shoppers to avoid the hassle of finding
merchandise in a store and standing in a checkout line. And of
course, the machines are open around the clock: nights, weekends
and holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Smith foresees potential sales of T-shirts, aspirin and other
consumer items at hotels and airports; office supplies in office
complexes; frequently purchased items such as nails outside stores
like Home Depot; and Barbie dolls in machines outside toy stores.
</P>
<P>
   For manufacturers, vending machines are an opportunity to
eliminate the high costs of selling through stores.
</P>
<P>
   Vending machines can generate very high sales. For example, San
Francisco's Joe Boxer Inc. sells underwear out of about 20 vending
machines located mostly in department stores. Sales per square foot
from the machines run about $2,600 per year, said Joe Boxer chief
executive Nicholas Graham. That's about 10 times higher than sales
per square foot at an average mall store.
</P>
<P>
   Graham said he considers his company's Web-wired vending
machines, which are able to track stock levels, a success. But he
said he is interested in E-Stations for their interactive
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   For now Zoom does not intend to go after the traditional vending
market of snacks and soda. Higher-ticket items are more profitable,
and the company's model makes more sense ``where information helps
make a sale,'' said Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Zoom, which moved to the Bay Area in January from Sydney,
Australia, expects to roll out several hundred E-Stations this year
and thousands in 2000. In the next three to five years, Zoom
expects sales of merchandise through E-Stations to reach $500
million annually in the United States alone, said Dan Enright,
Zoom's sales director.
</P>
<P>
   Zoom will either lease its machines for a monthly service fee of
about $250, or sell them. The cost of purchase includes $2,000 to
$2,500 for the vending machine and additional costs for the PC, the
touch screen and other components.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is home to 6.6 million conventional vending
machines that generate sales of $19 billion to $28 billion,
according to the National Automated Merchandising Association.

 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For all his devotion to Elizabeth Dole, and for all
the blessings he offers her campaign for president, Bob Dole is
nobody's compliant, stick-with-the-script,
gaze-lovingly-at-your-mate political spouse.
</P>
<P>
   Three times she stood by his side as he ran for the presidency
and lost, and recalling her tireless campaigning, he says, ``I'm
her biggest fan and supporter, and should do for her what she did
for me.''
</P>
<P>
   But in his first extensive interview about the progress of his
wife's campaign, Dole said he wanted to give money to a rival
candidate who was fighting for much of her support. He conceded
that Mrs. Dole's operation has had growing pains, was slow to raise
money early and was only beginning to hit its stride. And while
Dole was hopeful, he allowed that he was by no means certain she
would even stay in the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's getting there,'' he said of her progress so far.
</P>
<P>
   Hedging his bets, perhaps, Dole acknowledged that he wanted to
contribute to the campaign of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a close
friend who stuck by Dole's side in the final, depressing weeks of
his run against President Clinton in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've thought about it,'' Dole said in the interview on Friday.
``McCain's my friend. And he's not raising the money that George
Bush is. I think we need to keep good people in the race. So I've
thought about ways to help McCain in particular.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he had not yet written the check, he said, ``I think
I'd check with Elizabeth first.''
</P>
<P>
   Never one to hew to talking points, Dole had no interest in
espousing the confident spin of the Dole campaign that Mrs. Dole
will be the next president. Although she has formed an exploratory
committee, and has been aggressively competing for the nomination,
Dole did not sound convinced that Mrs. Dole would take the final
step and formally declare her candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sort of leaning that she'll do it,'' said Dole, who works
at the law firm Verner, Liipfert, Bernhard, McPherson &AMP; Hand here
and has stayed in the public eye mostly because of his television
commercial about erectile dysfunction. ``But she hasn't told me
point-blank. If there's no response out there, or if it looks
impossible, this is not her whole life. If she can't raise the
money, obviously it's pretty hard to be a candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   While his wife is running second to Gov. George W. Bush of Texas
in most polls out of a field of nearly a dozen, Dole said that Bush
_ whom he called ``the absentee candidate'' because he has been
holed up in Austin _ would probably be ``very impressive'' on the
stump.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's in a strong position, no question about it,'' Dole said.
Reeling off Bush's roster of endorsements, he recalled the 1988
campaign, when he could not compete with Vice President George Bush
in capturing endorsements and lost the nomination. ``He's got good
people,'' Dole said of Gov. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   And Dole passed up the opportunity to say that his wife would be
formidable against Vice President Al Gore in a general election.
``It's too early to tell,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dole is breaking new political ground: Never before has a
politician won the Republican nomination only to see his spouse
seek the same office the next time around. The Dole-Dole dynamic is
fraught with personal and political land mines, a sense of missed
opportunities _ and perhaps even competition. On the one hand, Dole
wants Mrs. Dole to be president. On the other hand, Dole spent much
of his career trying to be president himself. On the one hand, Dole
said he did not want to interfere with his wife's campaign. On the
other hand, he loves campaigning and wants to be involved.
</P>
<P>
   That has left Dole, who is 75, playing a blend of roles, part
admiring spouse, part coach, part critic. Dole sounded a bit like
Clinton did in an interview last week about Gore's campaign: He
conceded that there had been growing pains and that his protege had
to relax on the trail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to coach like Clinton,'' Dole said. ``It's a
full-time job with Gore. But I'm available for part-time work.''
</P>
<P>
   Jokes aside, Dole said he had been ``a little bit concerned''
that Mrs. Dole's campaign had a slow start, but that people should
be patient given that Mrs. Dole, a two-time Cabinet secretary who
is 62, had been until recently the president of the American Red
Cross.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to get more answers than you ever thought from
Elizabeth once she hits her stride,'' he said. ``And she's getting
there. She's got to catch up after eight years in the Red Cross.
She needs a little breathing time. You can't expect her to walk out
the door and say, `Now, I'm going to answer every question in the
world about whatever.'
</P>
<P>
   ``She's feeling better about what's happening,'' he continued.
``Anybody's under a little pressure at the beginning. When you
leave the Red Cross you get all the nice comments and the
expectations go up. My view is, it's getting better, it's looking
better. The money's looking better.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked why when he was a candidate he never memorized his
speeches as Mrs. Dole does, Dole said that given his decades in the
Senate and service as majority leader, he had always felt
comfortable discussing issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew a lot about issues,'' Dole said. Mrs. Dole, he said,
seemed to be growing more comfortable bantering with reporters
about policy. ``She's more and more relaxed almost every day. You
can almost sense it.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Dole said his wife could become the most compelling candidate.
``It could be exciting to have a qualified woman running for
president of the United States,'' he said. ``That has a lot of
attraction in itself.''
</P>
<P>
   He praised her tenacity, saying, ``She's flying around all by
herself, like yesterday, New York to Chicago, coach on American
Airlines to save money.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole said that he was trying to keep a low public profile and
had attended only two of Mrs. Dole's events. ``I haven't even been
in the headquarters,'' he said. ``So they can't say, `Bob Dole, who
couldn't get in the front door, is trying to get in the back door.'
''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dole, in a separate recent interview, agreed that it was
important that she strike out on her own. ``It's important for me
to establish that this is my campaign,'' she said. ``It's important
that I go solo here for a while. Bob will certainly be willing to
do his share of campaigning, but I'll be making the decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how much pillow talk there was between her and Dole on
issues, she said, ``With a strong marriage, you're going to talk
things over. Obviously, he's got a lot of political wisdom having
been in politics so long.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole agreed that his wife needed to be front and center, but he
said he would counsel her. ``I can direct her on some issues,'' he
said. ``Wherever I can help: agriculture, Social Security,
Medicare, foreign policy. But only what I'm asked to do. I feel
like I've got to watch it a little. I don't want her to have to
defend what I say.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Doles were hard-pressed to give an example of how they
differed on issues. ``I'd have to think for a moment,'' Mrs. Dole
said. But days after the interview with her, Mrs. Dole called for a
ban on assault weapons _ something her husband had opposed in the
Senate. In his interview, Dole endorsed his wife's position. ``It's
always a vote that I questioned,'' he said. ``She did the right
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole said that he tried to talk to his wife every day but
scoffed at the idea that he was deeply involved in the campaign
operation. He said he missed most of her recent speech in New
Hampshire when she outlined her position on guns. ``They didn't
have it on C-Span,'' Dole said. ``I tried C-Span at 7 o'clock, at 8
o'clock, at 9 o'clock, at 10 o'clock.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole applauds his wife's trademark strolling into audiences to
deliver speeches. But he said she should not get carried away with
it. ``Obviously, she's not going to do the Notre Dame commencement
in the middle of the sophomore class,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was sorry he did not try the technique in 1996, he
recalled his embarrassing mishap at an event in California. ``I did
fall off the stage in Chico,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dole questioned whether Mrs. Dole should heed his suggestions
anyway. ``I lost,'' he said. ``Remember?''
</P>
<P>
   At the close of the interview, Dole said he hoped he had not
said anything that could get him in hot water with the candidate.
``Write a good story or I'll be dead,'' he pleaded with a laugh.
``I'll be under house arrest!''

CRIME DROPS IN U.S. FOR SEVENTH YEAR IN A ROW  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.)   By FOX BUTTERFIELD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Crime in the United States dropped dramatically last year, the
seventh consecutive year it has fallen, according to preliminary
figures released by the FBI Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The number of violent crimes and property crimes each fell 7
percent in 1998, creating the largest annual decline since crime
began to decrease in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest decrease occurred in robbery, which fell 11 percent,
followed by a 10 percent decline in motor vehicle theft and an 8
percent decline in murder, the FBI said in its annual Uniform Crime
Report.
</P>
<P>
   The decline in robbery, by far its largest single year decrease
in the 1990s, is particularly significant, said Alfred Blumstein, a
criminologist at Carnegie Mellon University, because it reflects a
diminished demand for crack cocaine, which had driven violent crime
rates upward in the 1980s. ``For people who are heavy drug users,
robbery is a favorite way to get drugs,'' Blumstein said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said, the drop in robbery may be attributed to
the vitality of the economy, which has become so strong that it is
now reaching into the inner cities and providing jobs, even if low
paying ones, to unskilled young people who had previously turned to
selling drugs because they were shut out of the job market.
</P>
<P>
   Criminologists pointed to several other factors that appear to
be behind the drop in crime, though they acknowledge that it is
impossible to measure them precisely. These include a huge increase
in the number of people behind bars, more imaginative police
strategies, tighter gun control laws and widespread community
programs to work with troubled young people.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond these factors, said James Alan Fox, dean of the college
of criminal justice at Northeastern University, there appears to be
a kind of contagion effect. ``The more crime drops, the more
lawfulness becomes the norm, as opposed to lawlessness,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fox said the seven-year drop in crime, the longest uninterrupted
decline since the 1950s, underscored an important point _ that
school shootings like the recent massacre in Littleton, Colo.,
``are a statistical aberration.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For most of our kids, school is the safest place to be,'' Fox
said. Violence in school is far lower than violence in the home, in
many children's neighborhoods or in areas around schools, he said.
</P>
<P>
   For criminologists, Fox said, the biggest question now is how
long the decline in crime can last.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI report measures the so-called serious or index crimes,
which include the violent crimes of murder, rape, robbery and
aggravated assault and the property crimes of burglary, larceny,
motor vehicle theft and arson. The report is based on arrest data
supplied by local police forces.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that rape and aggravated assault had both
dropped 5 percent, while burglary and arson each went down 7
percent. Only larceny, which includes petty theft like shoplifting
and pickpocketing, showed no decrease.
</P>
<P>
   The declines in crime were generally highest in the nation's
largest cities, apparently a reflection of more intense police
efforts in those cities. Murder, for example, fell 11 percent in
cities with a population over one million, but only 6 percent in
cities of 50,000 to 100,000 and not at all in small cities of
10,000 to 25,000. Only the suburbs had an increase in murder, of 2
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Murders in New York fell to 633 in 1998, from 770 in 1997, the
report said, with New York dropping to second place in reported
murders for the first time in memory. Chicago surpassed New York
with 694 murders.

 &HT;    Thrashers content with second pick
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A weighted lottery didn't help the Thrashers' seeding
in the upcoming entry draft Sunday. More importantly, it didn't
hurt them.
</P>
<P>
   They will pick second in the June 26 draft, giving Atlanta
general manager Don Waddell a shot at either of two high-scoring
natives of the Czech Republic: Patrik Stefan, who played this
season with Long Beach of the International Hockey League, or Pavel
Brendl of Calgary of the Western Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago had only a 3.7 percent chance of holding the winning
number but had 3-4-6-7 among its allotment when those ping-pong
balls popped out of a machine at the NHL office in New York,
allowing the Blackhawks to move from eighth to fourth. But the
lottery did not affect the top three selections: Tampa Bay, the
Thrashers and Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a (16.9) percent chance to move to No. 1, but there was
a much greater chance of us moving down,'' Waddell said. ``We
would've loved to move up, but it was crucial for us to not drop.''
</P>
<P>
   Stefan is ranked by the NHL's Central Scouting as the top player
in North America in the draft, one ahead of Brendl. But the
Thrashers may have a shot at him because Stefan is a center and
Brendl is a right winger, a position of greater need for Tampa Bay.
The Lightning also may shop its pick to other teams. But there are
health concerns with Stefan, who suffered at least two concussions
this season and played only an abbreviated season. Daniel Sedin of
Sweden is considered the next best player in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   Waddell said if Stefan is healthy, ``He's the most talented
player in the draft.'' Waddell, who at Sunday's lottery clutched a
rabbit's foot given to him by his daughter, Chelsea, will get
another close look at Brendl this week in Ottawa when he attends
the Memorial Cup _ the Canadian juniors Final Four, which includes
Calgary.

 By BILL CARTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Even as a revolution rages around them _ one that
they acknowledge is changing their world in ways they cannot yet
begin to calculate fully _ television network executives have sat
in rooms in the last few weeks, huddled in small groups, taking
part in an annual ritual as old as the medium itself.
</P>
<P>
   They were picking sitcoms for the fall season.
</P>
<P>
   But the process is taking place with a greater sense of urgency
this year. Faced with a continuing loss in audience and an
explosion in technological advances, the networks are attempting to
transform themselves into far more versatile institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Long considered headed for extinction, the networks are
beginning to add new, interactive dimensions to their relationships
with viewers and advertisers. They are seeking to develop multiple
uses for their shows and sell products related to programs they
broadcast. And they are preparing for the day when the functions of
a TV set converge with those of a computer.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the networks' repositioning is the ability to
build and market hit entertainment shows. But the popularity of a
television show is beginning to take on even more importance _ ``an
outright necessity'' in the words of NBC president Robert Wright.
</P>
<P>
   For the networks, the hit show is the hub in a growing wheel of
interests: promotion platforms for related businesses; sales of
replays on cable television or even Internet sites; and the
creation of direct links between advertisers and viewers.
</P>
<P>
   In one example of the latter, Wright envisions a viewer watching
a commercial for a Silverado truck, clicking on an on-screen icon
and being directed to information on the vehicle, the places where
it can be bought nearby, and perhaps even a number to call to order
one.
</P>
<P>
   Networks have already moved into marketing and selling compact
discs based on the music offered in a television film _ in fact, a
CD from ``The '60s,'' a movie on NBC, is a hit. In coming years,
they may try to sell other items, like the fashions worn by the
star of a sitcom.
</P>
<P>
   None of this would be happening if television shows were viewed
in the same way films or plays are. Partly because it became the
most pervasive and effective advertising medium ever created, and
partly because it is plugged into the home, television has always
been considered less art form than appliance.
</P>
<P>
   But even as the network industry tries to mutate from a model
that relies exclusively on commercials for its income to one that
also relies on electronic commerce, executives acknowledge that
they must not lose their focus on their core business _ show
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end it's still all about the content,'' said Robert
Iger, the chairman of ABC Group, a unit of Walt Disney Co.
</P>
<P>
   No one is convinced that the networks can transform themselves
from old media to new media. But a degree of rethinking is taking
place concerning what has been a foregone conclusion: that the
networks, whose share of the audience has declined from 69 percent
to 55 percent in the last five years, would die a not-all-that-slow
death.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than contemplate their deaths, the networks, in fact,
expect advertisers to set a record of nearly $7 billion in advance
purchases of commercial time for next year.
</P>
<P>
   The network prime-time sales process, not much different from
the days of ``I Love Lucy,'' begins this week in elegant locations
in Manhattan, from Carnegie Hall to Lincoln Center to the New
Amsterdam Theater. That is where the networks will introduce their
new prime-time program schedules.
</P>
<P>
   The situation seems to defy logic: Networks' advertising
revenues are soaring, even though their projected 8 percent
increase is matched by an almost identical percentage decline in
the size of network audiences this year.
</P>
<P>
   But competition for viewers has been multiplying exponentially
on cable and the Internet. So the power of even a diminished mass
medium to reach tens of millions of people at once makes broadcast
networks more valuable to advertisers, not less.
</P>
<P>
   That is just one incongruity the networks face as they try to
navigate a roiling media sea they once towered over. Among the
others: Networks in some ways are benefiting from the increasing
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Though they cannot begin to afford to buy high-flying stars of
the new media like America Online or Yahoo, the networks have
become the centerpiece of the marketing and promotion strategies
that such companies pursue. Internet companies are buying so much
commercial time that they are helping the networks set those new
ad-revenue records.
</P>
<P>
   And even in instances when networks have given Internet
companies commercial time in exchange for equity stakes in them,
the networks wind up benefiting indirectly. By cutting the overall
amount of time they have available, the networks can raise the
rates on their remaining inventory.
</P>
<P>
   Few network executives are entirely bullish about long-term
prospects, though. They cannot see an end point to the
technological advances, from Internet expansion to digital delivery
of television signals that are producing what Iger called
``monumental seismic shifts'' in the business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knows where the earth is going to stop moving,'' Iger
said. ``Really, it's never going to stop moving. So it's almost
imperative to know when to jump in and when to jump out.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, jumping in has meant, among other things,
investment in Internet companies. ABC and NBC acquired Internet
portals, Go and Snap, respectively, and CBS took interests in a
number of smaller Internet businesses like Marketwatch.com and
Office.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do see the Internet as much more an opportunity than a
threat,'' said Wright of NBC, a unit of General Electric Co.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Rogers, the president of NBC business development, said:
``The traditional network business may be challenged. But there is
upside potential as well, given a network's ability to reinvent
itself and develop value that is hugely bigger over time.''
</P>
<P>
   The same force that is driving up advertising revenue even as
audiences decline is providing the networks with what some predict
will be significant benefits as soon as next year. ``The incredible
promotional platform represented by the networks is going to
provide them with big opportunities,'' said Jessica Reif-Cohen, an
analyst for Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   The networks have taken steps to exert more authority over their
affiliated stations and cut costs through layoffs and tightened
reins on program expenses, Ms. Reif-Cohen noted, and she predicted
that ``investor sentiment will swing wildly in favor of the
broadcast networks this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Such forecasts fly in the face of the expectations of rivals in
cable television and new media industries. Most of them continue to
dismiss the networks as dinosaurs trying to stave off extinction.
</P>
<P>
   For example, one senior Internet executive called the networks'
Internet strategy largely meaningless. They will never be able to
be big enough in that industry to be significant players, the
executive said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least some of what they are doing now is just trying not to
look left out,'' this executive said. ``I sympathize with them. If
I were in their business, I wouldn't know what to do either.''

</P>
<P>
   The networks want to protect their economic base, while they
reinvent themselves. That means squeezing every area of costs they
can. For example, networks have long paid studios a flat fee for
the rights to two broadcasts of a show. But Iger said the system
simply ``does not work anymore,'' because the fees have escalated
prohibitively after four years if the show turns out to be a hit.
</P>
<P>
   For networks now, he said, it becomes untenable if some other
party controls the economic future of a program.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to be able to gain some share of the upside that the
new technology allows,'' Iger said.
</P>
<P>
   One result of that strategy is a move toward even more vertical
integration, with networks trying to own every piece of programming
they can. Deal-making with the studios has become a blood sport.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, senior executives at Hollywood production studios said
the demands by networks for ownership in shows have turned
deal-making into, as one described it, ``the wild West _ there are
no rules at all, a deal isn't a deal anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The networks expect to capitalize by replaying _ or in their
term ``repurposing'' _ shows on digital channels or cable channels
that they own. ABC plans to do that with soap operas it owns on a
proposed Soap Opera Channel.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the possibility, through the technology of video
streaming, of showing programs on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The networks also expect to sell products related to their
shows, though Wright of NBC said that is so far a very small part
of their business plan. ``Today it isn't much of a business, but it
may be quite attractive in two to three years.''
</P>
<P>
   Out of the same desire to control as much of their destiny as
possible, the networks continue to press to own more television
stations. Federal regulations limit them to owning stations that
reach 35 percent of the country, and the networks are lobbying to
raise that percentage.
</P>
<P>
   Wright said one threat facing the networks is consolidation by
cable companies _ typified by last week's deal in which Cox
Communications bought TCA Cable. He said cable systems could soon
reach enough viewers in a single city to become serious competitors
of local broadcast stations for local ad revenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the revenue situation is going to get any worse
at the national level, but we're going to see impact on the local
component,'' Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, which is owned by News Corp., has been less active in
aligning with Internet sites _ though Peter Chernin, chairman of
Fox Entertainment Group, said the company would be announcing some
deals in the next few weeks. But he argued that any convergence of
the TV set with the computer would only enhance the company's
position, because of its 40 percent interest in the TV Guide cable
channel.
</P>
<P>
   He called that channel, which identifies what TV shows are on
what cable channels, ``the mother of all portals.''
</P>
<P>
   But network executives still question how much interaction
viewers will have with their television sets, even after the sets
are wired to be online.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the functions of television and computer will stay
separate,'' Wright said, ``with the notable exception of sports.''
</P>
<P>
   Sports is already awash in informational asides _ like on-base
percentages in baseball and average yards gained after a catch in
football. Thus, sports is expected to be the first area that
technophiles dabble with when they can interact with their
televisions.
</P>
<P>
   With entertainment shows, though, ``I just think that people
still will want to watch just to relax,'' Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   To Iger, much more in doubt is what the next generation of
television viewers _ what he called ``the mouse-click generation''
_ will do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our kids have been raised to be multitaskers,'' he said.
``They're comfortable being active rather than passive, and that
should not be ignored.''
</P>
<P>
   As the networks consider their priorities, a leading executive
in the wired world, Robert Pittman, the president of America
Online, has one helpful suggestion: ``My advice to the networks
would be, stick to your knitting.''

GORE OUTLINES PLAN TO IMPROVE EDUCATION  
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Tenn., Iowa) (rk) 
 By ETHAN BRONNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAMONI, Iowa _ In what political aides described as his first
policy speech of the presidential campaign, Vice President Al Gore
called Sunday for ``revolutionary change'' and substantial federal
investment in education. He advocated universally available
pre-school for 3- and 4-year-olds, the creation of a teachers corps
of new graduates for neglected schools, rigorous tests for new
teachers, the elimination of large high schools and legal
protection for parents who visit their children's teachers during
the work day.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a college graduation ceremony in southern Iowa a day
after opening his campaign headquarters in Des Moines, Gore said
education was the key to meeting the country's economic, social and
moral challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let us realize that education is the greatest anti-poverty
program,'' he said, ``the most powerful anti-discrimination
strategy we could ever have.''
</P>
<P>
   He referred to international comparisons showing American high
school students to be far below those of many other countries, and
he asked, ``How long can we stay first in making new discoveries if
we stay dead last out of all countries surveyed in physics?''
</P>
<P>
   While the vice president's proposals reflect a growing consensus
among educators and contain elements found in legislative plans at
the state and federal level, certain aspects are new in a
presidential campaign, notably the call for the universal
pre-school and the commitment for a teachers corps for schools in
need.
</P>
<P>
   Though southern Iowa is not a Democratic stronghold, the vice
president was warmly received at Graceland College, a conservative
Christian institution affiliated with the Reorganized Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which broke with the Mormons in
the last century.
</P>
<P>
   His comments about high-quality pre-school and elevating the
teaching profession drew enthusiastic applause, as did his
assertion of the need for renewed focus on discipline, values and
safety in schools, all signs that focusing his domestic agenda on
education will meet with public approval.
</P>
<P>
   Federal statistics show that there are more children in school
this year than in any previous year in American history and the
number will rise every year for the next 10 years. Many political
races across the country last November, including those for
governors, representatives and senators, centered on education.
</P>
<P>
   While the education goals of the two major parties often seem to
resemble each other _ higher standards, better teachers, improved
safety _ a principal distinction between Republicans and Democrats
has been the opposition of Republicans to involving the federal
government in education. Republicans favor local control and local
standards and see a federal role as creating unwieldy, costly
structures for distant bureaucrats.
</P>
<P>
   Lamar Alexander, a Republican and former education secretary who
is hoping to gain his party's presidential nomination, reacted to
Gore's speech by saying it was the ``right church, wrong pew.''
</P>
<P>
   From his hometown, Maryville, Tenn., where he also was a giving
a college graduation speech, Alexander dismissed the vice
president's proposals as ``adding up to a national school board.''
Alexander said that instead of creating more federal education
programs, federal dollars should be sent back to local school
boards, parents and teachers to let them decide what is best for
their students.
</P>
<P>
   But in his speech, Gore's said: ``Some say there is no national
role in helping communities improve their schools. I say that
education is our No. 1 national priority for investing in the
future. And we must take dramatic steps to help states and
communities provide a quality education for their children.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Gore nor his aides would put a price on his new
proposals but they said all would fit within a balanced budget.
</P>
<P>
   Gore made seven recommendations : pre-school for all children;
improved teacher quality partly through creation of a federally
subsidized teachers corps; renewed focus on discipline and safety;
a fundamental reduction in the size of high schools; turn around
failing schools; improved technology for schools, and a tax-free
savings plan for parents and grandparents to pay for college
education.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said the recommendations fell into three categories: those
that required substantial federal investment; those that would
involve modest investment; and those that relied essentially on
leadership. The high-cost items are the universal pre-school
program and the teacher corps.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Gore said that the pre-school program is needed for two reasons.
First, he said, family life is changing. He said that in seven out
of 10 households, both parents work all day. While a generation
ago, 7 percent of American households were single-parent families,
today it is 27 percent. Second, he said, research has shown how
critical early education can be, leading to higher IQs and
achievement levels.
</P>
<P>
   Many states provide voluntary pre-school programs. Gore is
proposing that every state develop and expand its existing programs
through federal bloc grants so that every 3- and 4-year-old can
attend a good pre-school.
</P>
<P>
   On improved teacher quality, Gore proposed the creation of what
he called ``a new 21st century teachers corps open to talented
young people across the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, students above a certain level in their
graduating class would be eligible to commit themselves to four
years of teaching in a high-need school. In exchange, the federal
government would give them $10,000 to pay for college. After that,
those willing to make teaching a career would be eligible for
another $10,000 as well as getting their teacher training paid off.
The average debt with which graduates leave college is $9,000.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said the teacher corps graduates would have to pass a
rigorous test and advocated the same test for all new teachers as
well as five-year evaluations of teachers for license renewal.
</P>
<P>
   ``No teaching license should be a lifetime guarantee,'' Gore
said. But he emphasized that teachers, a traditional support group
for Democrats, deserve respect. ``When I see politicians bash our
teachers, I have to wonder: How long would they last in a classroom
with 24 14-year-olds?''
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Feldman, president of the American Federation of
Teachers, hailed the vice president's speech, saying she supported
his calls for new tests and evaluations to improve the quality of
teachers.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For pupils with discipline problems, Gore advocated the creation
of second-chance schools where troubled youngsters and those caught
with guns ``can receive the strict discipline and intensive
services they need.'' In many of the nation's biggest cities,
troubled students are simply expelled and the idea of second-chance
schools is gaining attention.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid producing troubled students, Gore offered a proposal:
that parents, teachers and students meet on the first day of school
every year to agree on and sign a discipline code. This would
increase links between parents and schools. He added that parents
must be given the legal right to take off from work for that and
subsequent teacher meetings. Aides said that would come through
extension of the federal Family and Medical Leave Act.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he favored increasing the ability of parents to choose
a public school for their children outside their neighborhoods but
opposed the use of vouchers supported by public money to send
children to private schools. Vouchers are favored by many
Republican candidates as a way to expand school choice and instill
competition in the system. Gore said that would siphon public
school financing.
</P>
<P>
   Gore ended by calling for a National Tuition Savings program
bringing together disparate state plans for tax-free,
inflation-proof savings for college by parents and grandparents. He
also urged that employers help employees save tax-free for college
and job training.
</P>
<P>
   ``We help people save for retirement tax-free and help them pay
their mortgages tax-free,'' he said. ``Now we must help them save
tax-free for one of the biggest expenses most families will ever
face in life, sending a child to college.''

SEARCH ENGINE FOR AUDIO AND VIDEO WILL SHOW ADVERTISING WHILE YOU
WAIT 
</HEADLINE>
   By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ In a deal that will aim advertising at the
growing millions who listen to music and watch video on the
Internet, Real Networks Inc., a multimedia software maker, and
Snap.com, an Internet hub, plan to announce on Monday that they are
starting a search engine that will find content on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The companies said the search engine would be embedded in copies
of Real Player G2, a free program from Real Networks that enables
people to listen to music and watch video over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Users of the Real Player program will be able to search the
Internet for music, other audio or video files that can be played
using the software.
</P>
<P>
   The catch is that when users begin the process, they will be
taken to a Web site (http://real.snap.com), sponsored by both Real
Networks and Snap.com, that will display advertising while the
search is under way. Snap.com, an Internet portal site owned
jointly by CNET and NBC, will provide the search engine technology
behind the site.
</P>
<P>
   Real Networks says that about 60 million people have downloaded
the Real Player software, but that only 30 million have the latest
version, which is the Real Player G2. To use the search engine,
they must download an enhancement to the G2 player.
</P>
<P>
   Jay J. Wampold, a spokesman for Real Networks, said he expected
huge traffic for the search engine. ``The uptake on this will be
very quick,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement comes a week after NBC Internet and Snap.com
announced that they would team with Xoom.com, a direct-marketing
company, to start a publicly traded company called NBCi. That deal
is unrelated to the one involving Real Networks, which is not
taking part in the NBCi project, the companies said.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the search engine announcement, Real Networks said it
would provide the new site with its Real Guide directory service,
which provides links to sites with real audio and video
programming. Some 400,000 Web pages have such programming, with 85
percent of them featuring content in a format that can be listened
to or viewed using Real Player; other competing formats include ASF
from Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Snap and Real Networks said that they were also planning to
start a multimedia search site for people who have high-speed
access to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The site (http://speed.snap.com) will include richer graphics
and the ability to download audio and video at faster speeds.

NOW OR NEVER IF TRINIDAD WANTS BOUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The clock is winding down on a possible Oscar De La Hoya-Felix
Trinidad fight for September.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Arum, De La Hoya's promoter, said he has offered Trinidad
$10 million and a percentage of pay-per-view revenues beyond 1
million homes to face De La Hoya on Sept. 18.
</P>
<P>
   And if Arum doesn't get an answer by Wednesday, he said, he will
turn his attention to Ike Quartey for that date.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Trinidad's handlers _ principally his father, Felix
Sr. _ have demanded equal pay for the fighters, even though De La
Hoya is by far the bigger name and moneymaker.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya, who defends his WBC welterweight title against Oba
Carr on Saturday, would earn up to $15 million against Trinidad, a
figure only he can command outside the upper echelons of the
heavyweight division.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The offer) is appreciably more than we paid for Whitaker, and
it's more than double what we paid for Quartey,'' Arum said.
</P>
<P>
   ``(HBO brought promoter Don) King and the father to a meeting in
New York (at the end of last week) to tell them: `Hey, the gravy
train stops if you don't take this fight.' ''
</P>
<P>
   For once, King doesn't appear to be an impediment to the fight.
</P>
<P>
   King, Trinidad's promoter, has what Arum called ``a stupid
contract'' with the fighter that requires the promoter to pay a
reported $43 million for 12 fights. In other words, he NEEDS this
fight.
</P>
<P>
   Arum said he's convinced that Felix Trinidad Sr. is pricing
himself out because he really doesn't want the fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The impediment to the fight is not King but the father,'' Arum
said. ``The father doesn't want his son to fight De La Hoya. Don't
believe anything different. That's what the people in Puerto Rico
are saying.
</P>
<P>
   ``They figure he can fight these opponents and make what for
them is considerable money, a million or so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was discussing it with (De La Hoya's) father, Joel, and
asked, `If your son could make a lot of money fighting a guy that
you're pretty sure he can't beat, would you take the fight?' He
said, `No, it wouldn't be worth it.' That's the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The contract is there. If he doesn't sign it, he's scared of
me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   More likely, Trinidad's people simply have an inflated view of
their fighter's marketability. Let's hope they don't hold out for
an unreasonable purse so long that the fight the world wants to see
falls apart.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya, who knows what a victory over Trinidad would mean to
his legacy, is one of those who holds this sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the fight I really want,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   __ A million homes? Arum's offer of a percentage of pay-per-view
revenue beyond a million homes is probably meaningless.
</P>
<P>
   No fight outside the heavyweight division has had a million
buys. This is the biggest lower-weight matchup out there but isn't
likely to crack a million.
</P>
<P>
   __ In the wings: Arum believes he'll have no problem making a
bout with Quartey if he can't come to terms with Trinidad.
</P>
<P>
   Quartey knows he can't command a huge payday after losing a
close decision to De La Hoya in February and is eager to get it
right in a rematch.
</P>
<P>
   For the fans, De La Hoya-Quartey II isn't as compelling as De La
Hoya-Trinidad but will draw a lot of buys because of the first
fight, which was extremely competitive and entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   __ So long Gil: De La Hoya said the Carr fight will be his last
with trainer Gil Clancy.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya said Clancy, one of the most respected names in
boxing, has been a valuable in working with principal trainer
Robert Alcazar.
</P>
<P>
   However, the fighter said he wants to revert back to the
aggressive knockout artist he was before he began bringing in new
trainers, back to what Alcazar has preached all along.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be me and Robert,'' De La Hoya said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gil is an excellent motivator, he's a person who has a lot of
knowledge of boxing. It's nothing against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just the team I want.''
</P>
<P>
   __ What about Carr? With all the talk about Trinidad, Carr seems
to be getting overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   Carr isn't seen as the threat Trinidad or Quartey are, but he's
capable. De La Hoya said he's well aware of that fact.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I'm focused on Carr. You'll see on (Saturday),'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Enter Mosley: ``Sugar'' Shane Mosley, the undefeated IBF
lightweight champion confirmed rumors when he said he wants to move
up to weight classes and fight De La Hoya, possibly at the new
Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   It makes sense from a business standpoint. No one in or around
his weight class is going to get him the payday he would get
against De La Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   However, he would have little chance of winning. Even a fighter
as talented as Mosley can't expect to move up 12 pounds in weight
and beat one of the best fighters of his generation.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, Mosley disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't be no mismatch. If I hit him, I'll knock him
out,'' the normally reserved Mosley told the New York Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya doesn't seem interested, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   He was criticized much of his career for facing boxers who moved
up to HIS weight. He doesn't want to go through that again.
</P>
<P>
   __ No Vargas: One matchup will probably WON'T see anytime soon
is De La Hoya-Fernando Vargas.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas, the IBF junior middleweight champ from Oxnard, has been
publicly critical of De La Hoya's character _ and De La Hoya has
had enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never give Vargas a chance, never,'' he said. ``He's been
very disrespectful, he has no respect whatsoever. He doesn't
deserve an opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya can see himself fighting another Olympian, WBA junior
middleweight champion David Reid. The prospect of one gold medalist
facing another is enticing.
</P>
<P>
   However, what if Reid fights Vargas first and then loses?
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I'm in trouble,'' De La Hoya said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   __ Hamed-Tapia? Naseem Hamed called Arum last week for two
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   One, he wanted to voice his objection to Arum's use of the term
``English fraud'' when referring to the flamboyant but untested
featherweight. And, two, he wanted to suggest a bout with WBA
bantamweight champ Johnny Tapia, who probably would have to go up
two weight classes (from 118 to 126 pounds) for the fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, he complained I called him an English fraud and we
talked about it,'' Arum said. ``And then he said, `Tell Johnny
Tapia I'd like to fight him before the end of the year.' It was an
interesting conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   Tapia, who defends his title against Paulie Ayala on June 26 in
Las Vegas, is interested in a Hamed bout but said he would probably
move up to junior featherweight (122 pounds) first.
</P>
<P>
   He also said his focus is on Ayala.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I'm thinking about is June 26,'' he said. ``Too many
fighters have looked ahead and got knocked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Tapia's trainer, Fred Roach, doesn't think a jump to 126 is
unreasonable.
</P>
<P>
   ``(In a recent bout) Johnny weighed 118,'' he said. ``Going into
the ring, he weighed 130 pounds. Johnny's 5-foot-7, very strong.
Naseem is 5-foot-3. Johnny's a bigger person in there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then again, Hamed punches hard. That's the only problem. But I
can't see Johnny Tapia, with his boxing skills, even getting
touched by this guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very unorthodox fighter. I think a good, basic boxer
from the American style will beat this guy. He's fighting all old
horses. I'd love that fight for Johnny. I don't care what the
weight class is.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITTIER, Calif. _ If ever there was a wonder boy in the
lucrative business of drug testing, it was Dr. Robert Fiddes.
</P>
<P>
   In just a few years, Fiddes transformed his sleepy medical
practice here into a research juggernaut, recruiting his patients
for drug experiments at a breakneck pace. His success made him a
magnet for an industry desperately scouring the nation for test
subjects. Companies large and small showered him not only with
almost 200 studies to conduct, but with millions of dollars in
compensation for his work.
</P>
<P>
   Life was good. With bank accounts bulging, Fiddes and his wife
could afford to drive matching BMWs; a Ferrari parked in his garage
was ready for special occasions. After a short time in research,
the once small-time family practitioner was planning his dream
house on a Cayman Islands beach and envisioning the day he would
make millions more by selling shares in his business to the public.
</P>
<P>
   But amid all the glitter and cash was a fact that no one outside
his office knew: It was all a scam.
</P>
<P>
   For Fiddes was conducting research fraud of audacious
proportions, cutting corners and inventing data to keep the money
flowing from the drug industry. Fictitious patients were enrolled
in studies. Blood pressure readings were fabricated. Bodily fluids
that met certain lab values were kept on hand in the office
refrigerator, ready to be substituted for the urine or blood of
patients who did not qualify for studies.
</P>
<P>
   Monitors for the government and the industry never noticed any
problems with Fiddes' bogus paperwork, which they reviewed during
routine audits. Even when some of Fiddes' employees alerted those
monitors to their suspicions, no investigations were initiated.
Instead, their warnings were filed away, while Fiddes' sterling
reputation as a researcher grew.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in June 1996, the scheme started to unravel when a
manager of a neighboring doctor's office, Dennelle Del Valle, told
a government auditor of rumors of crimes, lies and fraud she had
heard from Fiddes' own employees. Eventually, to prove the claims,
Ms. Del Valle slipped a piece of paper into the auditor's hand. On
it was written a telephone number and a single name: Susan. It was
the tip that would lead the government to Susan Lester, a former
employee of Fiddes who not only knew what had happened, but had
records to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   So began the multiyear investigation of Fiddes' Southern
California Research Institute, a testing operation that was one of
the most corrupt research enterprises ever discovered by law
enforcement. The case is set to wind to a close this week, with the
scheduled sentencing of the last co-conspirator. But in its wake is
wreckage: Fiddes and several accomplices have pleaded guilty to
fraud, drug-study results for virtually every company in the
business have been compromised and the reliability of the private
system for testing drugs for safety and efficacy has been thrown
into question.
</P>
<P>
   Fiddes ``was putting the health of all these patients at risk,''
said Alan Knox, the former chief financial officer of the Southern
California Research Institute, who resigned soon after the
government investigation caused him to learn of the frauds. ``But
he was also skewing samples that could affect the whole American
public,'' Knox added.
</P>
<P>
   The abuses of this one doctor point to weaknesses in the new
system that has developed in recent years for testing experimental
drugs. No longer does the pharmaceutical industry rely on career
researchers at academic medical centers, whose professional
reputations are forged on the quality of their data. Rather, the
industry has turned to thousands of private-practice doctors, for
whom testing drugs has become a sideline for making money.
</P>
<P>
   While the researchers and their incentives have changed, the
methods for monitoring what they do remain basically the same even
though now, since they are paid for each patient they recruit,
researchers have an enormous financial incentive to cheat. The case
of Fiddes underscores the ease with which such a system can be
deceived _ a fact that has not been remedied since the discovery of
his crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The story of the corruption at the Southern California Research
Institute was pieced together from memos and other internal
documents, investigators' notes, drug company and court records,
personal diaries and affidavits of participants, as well as
interviews with government officials, lawyers and the now-defunct
company's former employees and consultants.
</P>
<P>
   The picture that emerges from these documents and interviews is
of a research office ruled by a doctor driven by greed. Few
employees other than the study coordinators _ mostly women of
limited financial means _ were aware of the magnitude of the
swindle. Those bothered by it were repeatedly assured that this was
the way the drug industry worked. Faced with that perception, there
seemed little they could do without risking their livelihood to
stop the influential Fiddes, a man who believed that the system of
monitoring was too poorly designed to ever catch him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he thought he could be touched,'' said Kathryn
Davis, a medical transcriber at the research center. ``We just
didn't understand why it had to go down the way it did. Maybe he
just wanted too much too fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Through his lawyer, Fiddes _ who is now serving a 15-month
sentence for fraud _ refused repeated requests for an interview.
</P>
<P>
   But in interviews with the government after he agreed to plead
guilty, Fiddes portrayed himself as a man trapped by the dishonesty
of others. He maintained that most researchers are forced to cheat
because drug companies issue requirements for test subjects that
sounded good in marketing material, but were impossible to meet in
the real world. He said _ with no evidence to back up his claim _
that anyone successful in the business was skirting the rules.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At his own research center, Fiddes laid much of the blame for
everything that happened on his study coordinators _ again, without
providing evidence to support the assertion. While he was the
beneficiary of the illegal activity, he maintained it was the
salaried employees working for him who devised the frauds, often
without his knowledge. The information provided by Fiddes has not
resulted in any additional investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his refusal to accept the blame, Fiddes was anguished at
being labeled a criminal. In a letter pleading for mercy that he
sent last year to U.S. District Judge Robert M. Takasugi, he
described his torment.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family has had to endure the humiliation of seeing a
husband and father sink from being a widely respected community
member to now being visualized as nothing more than a common
crook,'' Fiddes wrote. ``My mother often said, `The only thing in
life that is important is to be able to hold your head up high.' I
now know what that means.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Fiddes always wanted to be a skater. As a teenager in his
native Vancouver, British Columbia, he rose most mornings before
dawn, walking to a chilly ice arena for his 5 a.m. practice. The
hard work paid off; he often told of winning Canada's junior figure
skating championship, a victory that set him on the path to going
professional.
</P>
<P>
   But when the time came to choose between a career as a figure
skater or enrolling in a university, young Fiddes took the academic
path. And there he showed that same drive, getting accepted for
medical school at the University of British Columbia after just
three years in college, according to his curriculum vitae.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, at 25, Fiddes earned his medical degree and, with his
new wife, Rebecca, came to Long Beach, Calif., for a job as a
hospital intern. He went on to join a medical partnership, but in
1981 opened his own practice in Whittier with a medical assistant,
LaVerne Charpentier, in a converted house with an awning and flower
garden. It was the perfect image for an old-time family doctor, and
the practice blossomed.
</P>
<P>
   Fiddes' wife would later write of those early days in a letter
to the judge who sentenced her husband. ``His patients adored them
and showered the office with everything from home-baked cookies to
hand-crocheted dolls,'' she wrote. ``Both Rob and Laverne worked
long and hard to provide his patients with the best care.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Fiddes formed a group made up of several family
doctors in the area. But by the late 1980s, an obstacle emerged
that Fiddes was unable to sidestep. Managed care was sweeping
California, and Fiddes chafed at the new rules. ``He felt his hands
were tied in performing whatever tests were necessary to assist in
the proper diagnosis of the patient,'' Mrs. Fiddes wrote in her
letter. Patients ``felt equally frustrated with the new system.''
</P>
<P>
   Growing restless, he decided to pursue a law degree, attending
night school. In 1987, he passed the California state bar exam.
</P>
<P>
   But by then, the medical profession had changed so radically
that an entirely new specialty presented itself: Doctors were
testing the safety and effectiveness of new drugs for
pharmaceutical companies, using their patients as subjects.
Recognizing the opportunity to get away from managed care, Fiddes
jumped at the chance.
</P>
<P>
   His new clinical-trials business grew rapidly. Fiddes appointed
Ms. Charpentier as his first full-time study coordinator, and
raided a private research firm in the area, California Clinical
Trials, to build his staff. He began to dream of eclipsing his
biggest rivals and taking his new enterprise public, at times
doodling his ideas for a corporate logo onto pads of paper.
</P>
<P>
   As the business got going, former employees said, a pattern soon
emerged. Fiddes would meet with patients in his first floor office,
then refer them to the study coordinators on the second floor.
Often, the patients who arrived there felt reluctant about
participating in the trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were pushed to go up there,'' said Susan Lester, the
former study coordinator who blew the whistle on Fiddes. ``They
often would say, `I don't want to participate in this, but I don't
want to make him mad.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In the early days, Ms. Lester and other coordinators would tell
wavering patients to take their time, perhaps by sleeping on the
idea, before signing an agreement to participate in a study. But
Fiddes and Ms. Charpentier, who also declined interview requests,
quickly put an end to such solicitousness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was told that it was a big mistake to let them think about
joining,'' Ms. Lester said. ``They said, `You don't tell them they
have any choice about it. You put them in.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Kimberly Carlon's interviews for a job at the Southern
California Research Institute had been going well. She had only one
more hurdle to clear: Speaking to Fiddes himself. If he approved of
her, the certified respiratory therapist would become the research
site's latest study coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in front of Fiddes' desk in early 1996, she listened as
he described a hypothetical scenario. Suppose, he said, that a
patient was available for a study, but was taking medication
prohibited by the study protocol.
</P>
<P>
   The answer seemed obvious, Ms. Carlon replied: She would send
the patient on his way.
</P>
<P>
   Well, Fiddes told her, that was not the way he did things. At
the Southern California Research Institute, he said, the patient
would be entered into the trial _ something Ms. Carlon understood
would require the center to falsify records so that the violation
of study rules could be hidden.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Carlon got the job. But she would later describe her
discussion with Fiddes as the first moment she should have realized
something was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Like every other study coordinator who passed through Fiddes'
research center, Ms. Carlon found herself being pushed to break the
rules. When she ran a 1996 study for a new asthma inhaler sponsored
by Fisons, a British drug maker, she found a patient who had been
enrolled even though she had an incurable lung disease that should
have disqualified her. When a monitor hired by Fisons asked to see
the patient's medical chart, Ms. Carlon approached Delfina
Hernandez, a more senior employee, and asked what to do.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hernandez quickly fetched the patient's medical chart, and
pulled out every page that made reference to the lung disease.
Then, according to investigative documents, she turned the
remaining records over to the monitor. The violation went
undetected.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hernandez, who later pleaded guilty to fraud, declined to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Again and again, study coordinators were instructed by Fiddes
and his top aide, Ms. Charpentier, to ignore the requirements of
the drug studies. The rules called for excluding smokers from an
asthma study? The coordinators were told to put the smokers in
anyway, and leave their habit out of the medical records. A certain
blood pressure was required for patients to participate in a
hypertension study? Then the coordinators were expected to write
that level into the chart, regardless of the truth. Patients'
medical records contained health histories that precluded them from
participating in a test? Then the offending pages were ripped out
and destroyed, and the patients placed on the experimental
medication despite the dangers.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, the frauds orchestrated by Fiddes grew ever more
audacious. Eventually, according to government documents, it was
not just the records that were being falsified. Instead, medical
tests were rigged _ and at times, patients simply invented. Outside
monitors reviewed the documentation, but since there were real lab
records for the rigged tests, they had no clue that they were being
deceived.
</P>
<P>
   The office refrigerator became the source of human bodily fluids
that met the requirements of various studies. A jug of urine was
often found there on Monday mornings, provided by Carol Rose, one
of the center's employees. Ms. Rose's urine contained high levels
of protein _ just the trait patients needed to qualify for certain
studies. Fiddes paid Ms. Rose $25 each time she collected her urine
and brought it to the office, where over time it was divvied up
among specimen cups labeled with other people's names and presented
for testing.
</P>
<P>
   The refrigerator also proved useful when the research center was
conducting studies on hormone replacement therapy for menopausal
women. The studies required women with blood serums that showed low
levels of estrogen and high levels of follicle-stimulating hormone
_ signs that a woman is going through menopause. To make sure that
the patients' tests qualified, Fiddes sent out a memo specifying
the hormone levels required for the study. ``We need some serum
that scores these numbers in the frig at all times,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Another study on an antibiotic required that patients have a
certain type of bacteria growing in their ear. No problem for
Fiddes. He bought the bacteria from a commercial supplier and
shipped them to testing labs, saying they had come from his
patients' ears.
</P>
<P>
   Fiddes' coordinators, paid bonuses for recruiting patients into
studies, soon began improperly enrolling themselves and members of
their families. Often, names were changed to avoid detection by
drug-company monitors. At times, family members participated in
several studies at once _ a violation of the rules because studies
require that participants not be taking other medications, so that
the data obtained relate only to the drug under study.
</P>
<P>
   Employees ``were running around doing EKGs on each other, if the
patient couldn't pass,'' said Sloan A. Bergman, a former study
coordinator who quit working for Fiddes after less than a year
because of ethical concerns. ``I wasn't happy, but I needed a
job.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet all the while, there were constant reminders that the true
cost of the frenzied drug testing was being borne by sick and
vulnerable patients.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1995, the research institute began work on a
study of Cozaar, a hypertension medication sponsored by Merck &AMP; Co.
Among the patients enrolled by Fiddes was Arlene Roberts, a
70-year-old woman with high blood pressure. Instead of dropping,
her blood pressure rose dangerously when she took the drug. Dawn
Simons, the study coordinator, became alarmed and sent Ms. Roberts
to see Fiddes.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than taking her out of the study immediately, Fiddes
prescribed two other hypertension drugs. The triple dosage not only
violated the study rules, it made it impossible to gauge the effect
of Cozaar.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, Roberts returned. Her face was bruised, her
speech was slurred and she had trouble walking. She told Ms. Simons
that she had passed out over the weekend while bathing. Ms. Simons
took her pulse and found that her heart was barely beating _ the
result, the coordinator thought, of bombarding her body with
hypertensive drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Worried that Ms. Roberts was headed toward cardiac arrest, Ms.
Simons asked Ms. Lester, her fellow study coordinator, for
assistance. The two helped Ms. Roberts, who by then could barely
walk, to Fiddes' office.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `It's no big deal. She's probably making more of it
than it really is,' '' Ms. Lester recalled in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Simons, dismayed at what was happening, thought Ms. Roberts
should be dropped from the study. But Fiddes refused, keeping her
on the medications for several more weeks. Ms. Roberts was soon
seeing another doctor in a hospital for the problems that emerged
during the study. Ms. Simons, the study coordinator, resigned from
her job, but not before surreptitiously copying all the medical
records and turning them over to Ms. Roberts in case she wanted to
bring a lawsuit. Ms. Roberts, who recovered at the hospital, never
sued.
</P>
<P>
   Fiddes received payment in full from Merck _ his reward for
keeping Ms. Roberts in the study through its completion.
</P>
<P>
   Ilse Beverly finally decided that Fiddes had to be stopped.
While working for him for five years handling laboratory tests like
blood work, Ms. Beverly had seen signs of his willingness to cheat
on drug studies. And so in January 1995, almost immediately after
leaving her job, Ms. Beverly telephoned investigators with the Food
and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
   She reported her own experiences, such as the time in 1990 that
Fiddes had asked her _ without explaining why _ to find a way to
alter lab values in urine tests. She also provided the names of
study coordinators who knew that testing data were being
manipulated to enroll larger numbers of patients.
</P>
<P>
   With her revelations, the government had its first solid lead on
what was happening in Fiddes' office fully 17 months before Ms. Del
Valle exposed his crimes to an FDA auditor. Investigators wrote
memos about Ms. Beverly's allegations, and forwarded them from Los
Angeles to the clinical investigations branch of the FDA.
</P>
<P>
   There, the memos were filed away. No investigation was begun.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Fiddes had always found it easy to elude detection by the crews
of company monitors and government auditors that visited his
offices, even when his employees spelled out their suspicions about
what was happening. It wasn't that he was particularly adept at
dodging their questions; rather, they seemed reluctant to challenge
such a prominent figure in the drug-testing business.
</P>
<P>
   ``This business can be run on words, and I have learned the
words,'' Fiddes wrote in a 1995 memo. `` `We have no problems' is
our motto, and tell this to every monitor.''
</P>
<P>
   When Fiddes' efforts to enroll patients were thwarted by system
safeguards intended to insure accurate test data, he often found
ways around the problem.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1995 study of an experimental pain reliever for arthritis
called PHZ 136 that was sponsored by Zambon Corp., Fiddes faced a
particularly difficult impediment. The patients were supposed to
have arthritis of the knee, as verified by X-rays.
</P>
<P>
   Fiddes tried to recruit patients. Again and again, he sent their
X-rays to an independent radiologist for review. And almost every
time the answer came back the same: The patient did not have
arthritis, and so did not qualify for the study. Frustrated, Fiddes
told the coordinator of the study, Ms. Lester, to look through his
medical files for patients with arthritis of the knee. Then, he
said, she should offer each of those patients $25 to come in and
get multiple X-rays, which he could substitute for the X-rays of
patients who did not qualify. But Ms. Lester drew the line, and
refused.
</P>
<P>
   The ever resourceful Fiddes found a way around that obstacle,
however. Through his staff, he contacted the project manager at
Pharmaceutical Product Development Inc., which was managing the
study for Zambon, and asked a question: Because he was a doctor,
couldn't he just interpret his patients' X-rays himself, rather
than send them to a certified radiologist?
</P>
<P>
   The company was happy to oblige. Researchers ``may interpret
knee X-ray films obtained on candidates,'' Julia Dixon, the project
manager, wrote in a letter to Fiddes. ``There is no need for a
radiological consult.''
</P>
<P>
   From that moment on, Fiddes had no trouble finding patients who
qualified for the study. ``That kind of opened it up for him right
there and then,'' Ms. Lester said. ``Everyone understood that if he
was going to read the X-ray, he was going to lie.''
</P>
<P>
   Not long afterward, Fiddes received a letter from one of the
testing company's study monitors. ``CONGRATULATIONS on meeting your
enrollment deadline!'' the monitor, Cheryl Grant, wrote in a letter
dated Feb. 19, 1996. ``I performed a 100 percent source document
verification, and found no outstanding issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Through Pharmaceutical Product Development, a testing company,
Fiddes was paid $45,268 for his effort in the Zambon study. The
company never detected his fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Zambon declined to comment, citing confidentiality of the study,
as did Pharmaceutical Product Development. But Nancy Zeleniak, a
spokeswoman for the testing company, said its monitoring was of the
highest quality. ``We have standard operating procedures for
detecting fraudulent or fabricated data,'' she said. ``We are
helping to set standards in the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Another company came closer to putting him on the spot. Several
former coordinators for Fiddes said they had reported his unethical
conduct to Pat Pryor, an independent study monitor working with
Pfizer Inc. Tipped off to the discrepancies, Ms. Pryor sharply
challenged Fiddes and his staff in her reviews of their paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   Fiddes chafed at the challenges, feigning outrage. ``Our
integrity and reputation for performing high-quality clinical trial
work has been injured, and we are justifiably upset,'' Fiddes wrote
in a July 1995 letter to Pfizer, complaining about Ms. Pryor's
demands. He insisted Pfizer ``have a new monitor assigned to our
site immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Not long afterward, Fiddes announced the news at a staff
meeting: Pat Pryor would not be returning to monitor the Southern
California Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer said that the company replaces monitors if there seems to
be a conflict. ``In order to insure the most objective and best
monitoring, we generally recommend that if there is personal
conflict, and no certainty of irregularities, that a new neutral
person is assigned to review all of the data,'' said Betsy Raymond,
a spokeswoman for Pfizer.
</P>
<P>
   But in the Fiddes case, that policy did not improve the
monitoring. ``We have an extensive system of checks and balances,''
Ms. Raymond said. ``Even with all of that, we didn't uncover the
fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   Why was Fiddes able to fool the monitors so easily? Because the
oversight system is mostly designed to catch errors, not fraud. To
protect patient confidentiality, monitors are forbidden from even
knowing the names of test subjects, meaning that no spot checks are
ever performed by the companies to make sure that researchers are
not making up lab values or inventing patients.
</P>
<P>
   But Fiddes' luck in avoiding detection would not hold. By May
1996, more than half a dozen study coordinators _ including Ms.
Simons and Ms. Bergman _ resigned, fearful that the fraud would
cost them their nursing licenses or certifications. Ms. Lester
likewise decided she could take no more, and wrote a letter to
Fiddes declaring she would no longer participate in fraudulent,
unethical work.
</P>
<P>
   A response came quickly. Ms. Lester was ordered to clean out her
desk immediately, and was escorted from the building. On her way
out the door, she bumped into Kathryn Davis, another Fiddes
employee. With tears in her eyes, Ms. Lester made Ms. Davis a
promise.
</P>
<P>
   ``She told me before she left that she was going to bring Dr.
Fiddes to his knees,'' said Ms. Davis, a former employee. ``I had
no idea that she meant it seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Knox, the chief financial officer of the research center,
was working in his office in the summer of 1996 when the chief
operating officer burst in. The officer, Elaine Lai, demanded that
Knox pull a series of invoices documenting payments to an employee,
Carol Rose.
</P>
<P>
   Knox fished the invoices from a filing cabinet. As he read them,
he grew concerned. Written clearly across the $25 invoices were the
words ``urine sample.'' For the first time, he was seeing the
evidence that Ms. Rose was being paid to substitute her own urine
for that of patients.
</P>
<P>
   Wary of what was happening, Knox copied the invoices, and kept
the originals. As he handed the copies to Ms. Lai, he asked her and
Ms. Hernandez, the longtime senior employee of Fiddes, what was
going on. Well, came back the response, apparently Susan Lester had
gone to the FDA, and worse, was contacting other former
coordinators and attempting to persuade them to talk to the
government about the way Fiddes conducted his research.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember inquiring with Delfina and Elaine and saying,
`What's the big deal?' '' Knox said in a recent interview. ``They
looked at me, they looked at each other and said, `We have to tell
him the truth.' ''
</P>
<P>
   As he listened to them recount the trickery that had taken place
at the institute, he said, ``I was just taken aback by the level of
fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   His first thought, he said, was that Fiddes and his top aides
should confess everything to the FDA. But unknown to him, they were
at that very moment planning a cover-up that would involve
destroying incriminating documents and manufacturing new ones that
might place the blame for any problems on Ms. Lester.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Fiddes was most concerned about the urine substitution, out of
fear that Ms. Rose would talk, according to notes of investigator
interviews. So, in August 1996, he called a meeting at the Hilton
Hotel in Whittier with Ms. Lai, Ms. Hernandez and his longtime
assistant, Ms. Charpentier.
</P>
<P>
   To solve the Carol Rose problem, Fiddes told the group, he would
create a bogus medical chart and false patient history for her. If
asked, he would claim that urine had been collected as part of her
medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The following Saturday, Ms. Lai called a meeting for what she
called ``chart review.'' The actual mission was to go through the
medical charts and destroy any evidence of wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Days later, on Aug. 21, Ms. Lai called for another meeting for
strategic planning. In a memo to Fiddes, Ms. Charpentier and Ms.
Hernandez, she made clear the need to move quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``FDA is busting down our door on Monday,'' Ms. Lai wrote. ``You
MUST be able to dump your files to your car when FDA knocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lai added in the letter that they had to agree to scripted
responses to all questions the government might ask.
</P>
<P>
   As Fiddes and his allies were secretly working on their
cover-up, Knox was reaching out to regulatory experts whom he
thought could help the company in its talks with the FDA. He
contacted Gretchen McKelvey, a quality assurance consultant for
clinical trials, who was quickly hired to help out.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McKelvey was stunned by the magnitude of the fraud she
discovered at Fiddes' office. But even more incomprehensible was
the blase attitude Fiddes demonstrated as he calmly informed her of
his cover-up plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I explained to him that what had happened here was considered
criminal, and that he could be prosecuted for conspiracy and
fraud,'' Ms. McKelvey said in an interview. ``Dr. Fiddes replied
that they were going to blame Susan Lester for all of the problems,
and he was going to say he had no knowledge of what was going on.''
</P>
<P>
   About that time, Ms. McKelvey learned that Fiddes had moved all
of the patient records off site. When she asked where they were,
she said, he replied that they were in storage. Days later, when
she pressed for them again, Fiddes told her the records had been
lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was starting to get really scared,'' she said. ``I don't
like to be messed with.''
</P>
<P>
   As the situation deteriorated, Ms. McKelvey decided the
situation was too big to handle alone, and required someone with
more expertise on dealing with the government. She sought advice
from Michael Hamrell, a consultant who specialized in the FDA.
Hamrell arrived at the research site for a briefing from the
company's top executives, including Fiddes and Knox. They made no
bones about all the protocol violations they had committed. Why
would Fiddes be so open? Because, as Hamrell learned quickly, he
still believed that he could outsmart the system.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me that he knew the law better than the FDA, and that
the FDA couldn't touch him,'' Hamrell said. ``He told me he was a
lawyer, and he wasn't responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of those who worked for him, like Knox and Ms. McKelvey,
saw the writing on the wall and resigned soon after being hired.
But others who for years had accepted Fiddes' repeated assurances
that everyone in the industry did the same things were shaken and
agonized about whether to confess.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to spill my guts, but what is going to happen to me and
my future?'' Delfina Hernandez, one of Fiddes' top aides, wrote in
her diary as investigators closed in. ``God forgive me if you think
I did wrong, and punish me if I did anything to hurt these
patients.''
</P>
<P>
   She soon found out what would happen to her future. On Feb. 16,
1997, teams of federal agents swarmed into Southern California
Research Institute's offices. The entire staff was ordered to move
to the front of the building, as the agents seized box after box of
documents. One agent with a video camera filmed every employee's
face for use in future identifications.
</P>
<P>
   With employees facing such intimidating law-enforcement tactics,
cracks began to emerge in the conspiracy to lie to investigators.
Ms. Hernandez was the first to decide to provide evidence to the
government, and the other dominoes quickly fell. By September 1997,
Fiddes, Ms. Hernandez and Ms. Charpentier agreed to plead guilty.
Ms. Lai pleaded guilty soon afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with Fiddes compelled to cooperate as part of his plea
agreement, the government hoped to learn more from him about
methods for battling research fraud. On Oct. 10, at 10:30 a.m.,
Fiddes met for an interview with Hetal Sutaria of the FDA and
William Leitner, an agent with the agency's criminal division.
</P>
<P>
   For five hours, the agents grilled Fiddes. He told them that
fraud was rampant in the research industry. He named names of
doctors he suspected of engaging in practices similar to his own.
And he described some telltale signs that should raise suspicions
of possible fraud.
</P>
<P>
   But, the investigators asked, what evidence of fraud is there in
the records reviewed by monitors and the government? What could the
watchdogs have seen that would have allowed them to detect his
fraud?
</P>
<P>
   Nothing, Fiddes replied. Had it not been for a disgruntled
former employee, he would have still been in business.

REFUGEES REPORT SLAUGHTER OF CIVILIANS IN KLA REGION 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SKOPJE, Macedonia _ Yugoslav forces have killed more than 100
civilians in three villages in the region that is the birthplace of
the guerrilla group fighting for Kosovo's independence, refugees
arriving in Macedonia in recent days have reported.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees, describing attacks in the Drenica region, said
that in one instance, soldiers herded as many as 60 women and
children into a house and then threw hand grenades and fired
assault rifles through its windows and doors, killing those huddled
inside. The civilians were reported to be family members of a rebel
commander, and the reports came from villagers who said they had
spoken with survivors.
</P>
<P>
   None of the reports could be independently confirmed. But human
rights investigators said initial refugee accounts suggest that
Drenica is emerging as a second area in Kosovo where particularly
ruthless attacks are being carried out.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Ward, a researcher for Human Rights Watch, said initial
reports suggest that the scale of killings in Drenica may rival
those reported to have occurred in a region along Kosovo's border
with Albania. That area is also a stronghold of the rebel group,
the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   ``The emerging picture from Drenica suggests a scale of violence
that rivals the killings on the Albanian border,'' Ward said. ``We
are extremely concerned about the fate of people still trapped
inside Drenica.''
</P>
<P>
   The refugees say that the killings occurred in April and that
the Yugoslav forces systematically emptied villages around the town
of Glogovac as part of an effort to eradicate the rebels from the
area, Ward said. After tens of thousands of villagers were herded
into Glogovac, they were forcibly expelled to Macedonia during the
first week in May, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The most brutal attack occurred in the village of Poklek in late
April, the refugees said.
</P>
<P>
   Miradije Haxhiu, 45, said her family and others in the village
tried to flee to nearby Glogovac in the early morning of April 30,
but were turned back by Yugoslav soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   That afternoon, she said, Yugoslav soldiers entered the village
and opened fire on her home and others in the village. She and her
children dove onto the floor and then hid in the basement for the
next six hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their shots hit the wall,'' she said. ``They nearly killed one
of the children.''
</P>
<P>
   When they emerged after dark, the home of Hallil Muqolli, a
local rebel commander, was burning, she said. The group made their
way to a nearby village, Vasileve, where they found a group of
women and children from Poklek.
</P>
<P>
   There, she and other villagers spoke with Lumnija Muqolli, the
daughter-in-law of the rebel commander. She said that Ms. Muqolli
told her and the others that the Yugoslav soldiers had forced 64
people, most of whom were from the rebel commander's family, into
his home. The group consisted of four men and sixty women and
children, including five infants, Ms. Haxhiu said she was told.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslavs threw hand grenades and fired assault rifles into
the house, Ms. Muqolli said. Ms. Muqolli told the other villagers
that she, her daughter and another child survived by playing dead
and then climbing out a back window before the Yugoslavs set the
house on fire. Rebel soldiers later entered the home and found the
bodies, according to Ms. Haxhiu said.
</P>
<P>
   Ward and Fred Abrahams, a second Human Rights Watch
investigator, said they had spoken to three other villagers who in
separate interviews gave similar accounts of the attack and the
killing of 60 women and children. None of the villagers personally
witnessed the attack, but Abrahams said he found the accounts
credible, given the area's history and the fact that the Kosovo
Liberation Army was active in Poklek.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pattern of abuse in Kosovo and Drenica specifically make
these allegations very credible, although still unconfirmed,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Wiping out members of rebel leaders' families is not
unprecedented in the area. In September 1998, Yugoslav forces ended
a summer offensive in the Drenica region by killing 21 members of
the Delijaj family, including eight women and five children, in the
village of Gornje Obrinje, according to Human Rights Watch. The
family had several rebel members.

DISTANCE IS GOLF'S DRIVING OBSESSION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID A. MARKIEWICZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
``Drive for show, Putt for dough'' _ Ancient golf wisdom
``Hit it long, And you can't go wrong'' _ Modern golf thinking FORT
WORTH, Texas _ With some of the best golfers in the world in Fort
Worth this week for the MasterCard Colonial, area golf fans will
have a chance to watch some of the best putters and some of the
longest drivers on the PGA Tour.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Given the choice of watching a master greensman such as Loren
Roberts _ who won the Byron Nelson Classic yesterday _ or a master
blaster such as John Daly, there really is no choice, though. The
big hitters capture the attention every time. From the PGA Tour to
the local municipal course, distance is everything. Clubs hit
longer, balls go farther and tees are set back farther.
</P>
<P>
   Pros and high-handicappers alike are in hot pursuit of length at
any cost, especially accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants to hit it from the back tees these days,''
said David Bridges, who has been playing golf for 50 years and
teaching it for 20, including a stint at Randol Mill Golf Center in
Fort Worth?????. ``If I had a sign up that said I can teach you how
to hit it farther, and a guy down the street had a sign that said
he'd teach you to hit it straighter, they'd all come to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The lust for long ball is manifest in PGA Tour statistics.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, Dan Pohl led the PGA Tour in driving distance with an
average poke of 274.3 yards. Hit the ball that far in 1999 and you
will be about 34 yards behind the drives of PGA Tour distance
leader John Daly, whose average whack pushes toward 309. The game's
top players, David Duval and Tiger Woods, each drive it about 290
yards on average.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, Hale Irwin averaged 250 yards a drive and won
a U.S. Open. Hit it 250 these days and you'll need a cart to catch
up to your playing partners.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts, a short hitter by PGA Tour standards, said after his
third-round 62 at the Nelson that his ball striking had slipped
this year because he is attempting to increase his distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, I'm out trying to hit it a little farther,'' Roberts
said. ``Every golf course we play they're moving the tees back. You
want to have the shortest iron in your hand you can. Golf courses
are getting longer and harder now.''
</P>
<P>
   Golfers say club and ball manufacturers are also responsible for
the distance craze as they try to increase sales by developing and
promoting equipment they say will add yards. Others cite
television's influence, noting that Daly's ``grip it and rip it''
philosophy is seductive even to duffers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can just see all the blood running out of their fingers,''
Bridges said.
</P>
<P>
   The quest for yardage off the tee is the subject of countless
instructional videos and books. In the May issue of ``Golf
Digest,'' several articles, including the cover story, deal with
how to hit it farther.
</P>
<P>
   To wit: One teaching pro offered thoughts on how to hit it ``10
more yards.'' In ``Tiger Tips,'' Woods suggests golfers widen their
stance ``when you really want to crush it.'' Another piece, ``How
to buy more distance,'' offers suggestions on what clubs will help
you hit it farther.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's cover boy Jason Zuback, the three-time reigning
national long drive champion, who is shown in an inside photo
spread, frame by frame, as he grips it and rips it. It's a hack
Mark McGwire would be proud of.
</P>
<P>
   Distance isn't a bad thing, of course. For one, it allows you to
hit beyond troublesome traps and over water. Also, it can make for
shorter, easier approach shots, the kind that allow you to hit the
ball high and soft, and to drop it close to the pin, giving you a
better chance on the greens.
</P>
<P>
   That's assuming you hit it straight, though, and that's assuming
a lot.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Penneman of Arlington, a competitor in long-distance drive
events, typically hits it longer than 300 yards, and when
conditions are right can near 400 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, he said, ``I'd give up 25 yards if I could put it in the
fairway 50 percent more often.''
</P>
<P>
   On the PGA Tour, length has been a sticky issue. Traditionalists
fear that many revered older and shorter courses will be rendered
obsolete as pros find they are able to fly over obstacles en route
to record-smashing scores. Woods' taming of Augusta National two
years ago fueled such paranoia. There has been much debate about
restricting club and ball technology so munchkins don't hit them
300 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is so alarmist, however. Greg Norman, in Fort Worth
recently, downplayed the distance issue.
</P>
<P>
   Length, schmength, he seemed to say. High handicappers still
can't break 100, and even pros aren't firing sub-60s week in and
week out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at average scores,'' Norman said. ``They aren't much
different than 30 or 40 years ago. Sam Snead once shot a 59 with
older-style equipment. It doesn't make as big a difference as some
people think.'' nn

START-UP LEADS PHONE CAUSE IN BATTLE FOR INTERNET ACCESS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Michael W. Malaga, chairman of Northpoint
Communications Group Inc., stood at a whiteboard in his office here
recently and explained how his newly public company planned to
change the Internet business.
</P>
<P>
   Northpoint builds high-speed data networks using normal phone
lines _ an approach that could render the networks of most current
Internet service providers obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   He drew a box on his improvised map of the Bay area. ``So ISP's
have these big modems pools in every city,'' Malaga said, referring
to the conventional Internet service providers, ``and these access
points for dedicated services like T-1 lines,'' he continued,
drawing another box. ``And then they aggregate the traffic
somewhere else to transport to another city,'' he added, drawing a
third box and connecting them all with lines.
</P>
<P>
   After pausing, the 34-year-old executive erased the entire
schematic with three swift strokes. ``In the future,'' he said,
``they won't have to do any of this. We will allow ISPs to become
sales and marketing companies.''
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether by  &UR; `` &LR; allow'' he really means
``force.'' Although it had revenue last year of only about $1
million, Northpoint, which raised $360 million in an initial public
stock offering on Nasdaq on May 5, now has a stock market value of
about $5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The company is perhaps the most advanced of a small cadre of
aggressive new players that are building high-speed Internet
networks based on a technology called digital subscriber line, or
DSL. It is a technology that, if widely embraced by computer users,
could do away with the dial-up modem access offered by the leading
Internet service providers, like the network-access portion of
America Online's business or Internet access provided by companies
like Mindspring Enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   DSL is shaping up as the telephone network's main weapon against
the cable television industry's mounting campaign to offer
high-speed Internet access. That is why the Baby Bell local
telephone companies themselves are taking a hard look at DSL. But
so far, the smaller and nimbler DSL upstarts like Northpoint are
the ones having more success turning the technical concept into
commercial reality.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, if the Internet service providers really are
fated to obsolescence, they may be planting the seeds of their own
destruction: for those companies are Northpoint's main customers.
</P>
<P>
   Northpoint uses advanced DSL technology from Copper Mountain
Networks Inc., which itself went public on Thursday, raising $84
million and achieving a stock market value of $1.5 billion. The
technology, which combines software and hardware, enables
Northpoint to build networks that can deliver up to 1.5 million
bits of information a second _ or about 30 times as much Internet
data over a normal phone line as is possible with a conventional
56,000-bit-a-second modem. Rather than sell the use of those lines
directly to customers, Northpoint strikes deals with Internet
service providers to use its systems to resell the high-speed data
service to small and medium-sized business users and residential
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, computer users seeking high-speed access through the
telephone network have typically used a special kind of circuit
called a T-1 line. T-1 can deliver 1.5 million bits of information
a second, but it might cost the user $800 or more a month. A
comparable system based on Northpoint's DSL network might cost the
user as little as $350. As a result, an Internet service provider
can resell Northpoint's DSL lines more economically than providing
its own T-1 lines or leasing such lines from a telephone company.
</P>
<P>
   But the fundamental rules of communications economics mean that
the success of Northpoint and its initial DSL competitors, Covad
Communications Group Inc. and Rhythms Netconnections Inc., may very
well spell the end of broad profitability for traditional Internet
providers.
</P>
<P>
   But Northpoint cannot afford to be greedily gleeful about this
prospect. For if the Baby Bell local phone titans also expand into
DSL, those same economic rules could endanger the long-term success
of Northpoint and the other DSL upstarts.
</P>
<P>
   An essential economic characteristic of the communications
industry is that communications networks cost a lot to build but,
once built, relatively little to operate. While it may cost
billions to build a fiber optic link from New York to Los Angeles,
for instance, it costs only pennies, if that, to transmit a call
using that network.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the companies that control the assets _ the optical
fiber, the switches, the advanced gear for transmitting data from
one point to another _ control the pricing for communications
services. These companies also reap most of the profits. It is very
difficult to generate long-term success in the communications
business by leasing communications capacity from others.
</P>
<P>
   The quest to control physical communications assets, and thus to
control one's own costs and increase profitability, is the basic
rationale behind many of the billion-dollar deals that have become
so routine in the telecommunicatons business. That is why
Northpoint's business model may look so attractive to investors but
also so potentially dangerous for Internet providers.
</P>
<P>
   For everyday Internet providers, squeezed between America
Online's marketing juggernaut in the consumer market and the power
of international giants in the big-business segment, Northpoint
offers a compelling proposition. Northpoint can build the DSL
network, operate it and maintain it. That frees Internet providers
to concentrate on finding customers, operating e-mail and World
Wide Web server computers, selling the service at a markup and
answering the phone when something goes wrong.
</P>
<P>
   By using Northpoint, even the smallest Internet provider gets
access to a high-speed data system more advanced than just about
anything America Online is using _ and competitive with the cable
modems that are beginning to sprout around the nation.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But in one sense a deal with Northpoint is a Faustian bargain.
The sacrifice is profit margin, because Northpoint controls the
asset. An example illustrates the case: Northpoint generally sells
a 160-kilobit line to an Internet provider for $75 a month.
Flashcom, which is based in Westminster, Calif., and is one of
Northpoint's biggest customers, sells that same line to end users
for $79.95 a month.
</P>
<P>
   With discounts for buying in bulk, Flashcom is probably paying
less than $75 _ but not much less. Because Northpoint controls the
asset, Northpoint controls most of the profits.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T is pursuing much the same strategy, but using cable
television systems, rather than traditional phone lines. When
America Online and other Internet providers complain that AT&AMP;T will
not have to offer the use of its cable systems to other Internet
providers, what they really fear is the prospect that AT&AMP;T will
sell access to those systems at prices that keep the bulk of the
profits for itself.
</P>
<P>
   For Northpoint, the potential pitfall in its business plan is
that the very economic forces that could let it absorb most of the
profits from traditional Internet providers could eventually
undermine its own profitability. Northpoint, after all, has to
lease the actual copper phone lines to its customers from the Baby
Bell phone giants (though at rates that are regulated).
</P>
<P>
   The company connects to those circuits by installing its own
network equipment inside the Bell companies' central switching
offices. Northpoint buys this equipment from Copper Mountain and
hires Lucent Technologies Inc. to actually install it. Moreover,
Northpoint deals with the end-user customers only through its ISP
resellers. Given all this, what _ if anything _ is Northpoint's
long-term asset?
</P>
<P>
   ``The asset is really in the co-location,'' Malaga said,
referring to the deals Northpoint has struck to place equipment
inside the Bells' central offices. Northpoint has hundreds of such
deals, each of which can take months to negotiate. That has given
Northpoint a head start on many of its potential rivals.
</P>
<P>
   But in the long run, the Bells are compelled by regulation to
offer co-location to just about any company that asks for it. What
that means is that Northpoint might well end up being more valuable
as an acquisition target for a bigger company _ a Bell, say _
looking to make a quick DSL splash.

   MURDER-CRUSADING GRANDMOTHER (Seattle)_ Gladis Spencer stood on
the road where Maya Streeter died, and wept. She wept for Streeter,
dead at 23. She wept for Streeter's three children, left
motherless. And she wept for Derek Spencer, her 20-year-old

COMMENTARY: CUT THE APOLOGIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After a week of whipping up hatred of Americans by
accusing us of deliberately murdering Chinese journalists in
Belgrade, Yugoslavia, President Jiang Zemin deigned to accept a
call from The Great Apologizer.
</P>
<P>
   For the fifth time, President Clinton apologized, expressed
regrets, sent condolences, kowtowed and groveled, begging to be
believed that we did not bomb China's embassy on purpose.
</P>
<P>
   But it is America that is owed an apology. After an accident of
war, we have been falsely accused of killing Chinese with malice
aforethought. That is a great insult, compounded by the calculated
trashing of our embassy by a bused-in mob encouraged by police.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that Beijing's leaders, worried about
demonstrations on the 10th anniversary next month of their
Tiananmen massacre, are milking this mistake for all it is worth.
</P>
<P>
   _ By lying about our intent and suppressing coverage of our
prompt admission of error, the nervous rulers are diverting their
people's anger toward us and away from themselves.
</P>
<P>
   _ By demanding we investigate the accident, they seek to water
down the current congressional investigations of their nuclear
spying _ a series of penetrations of our laboratories and political
campaigns that was no accident.
</P>
<P>
   _ By making Clinton beg forgiveness, they are able to cancel
human rights talks while extracting new trade concessions. The
deal: They will accept Clinton's apologies when he caves in on
their application to the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder that no reputable diplomat would accept the
president's pleas to replace our fed-up ambassador in Beijing.
Clinton is now trying to appoint an admiral whose amiable
association with the Chinese military and U.S. arms contractors
will be closely examined by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Though Clinton is softer than ever on China, he's taken a hard
line in resisting Congress' investigations into Beijing's
penetration of our nuclear labs and our political process. His
latest trick: the improper use of documents submitted for
intelligence declassification to prepare advance refutations of
evidence of security lapses.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has delayed for four months the three-volume
report on security laxity by the House select committee headed by
Rep. Chris Cox. Clinton spinners are already distributing a packet
of reprints of derogations by offended scientists, China-defenders
and favorite journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Cox has used the ``clearance'' delay to rewrite the turgid prose
and to enliven the report with photographs and diagrams showing
what missiles and satellites were stolen; that might even awaken
television interest.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Intelligence Committee, headed by Richard Shelby and
Robert Kerrey, is not about to hold still for the abuse of
clearance. After it submitted one of its reports on nuclear lab
laxity for review to protect intelligence sources, it learned of a
refutation of that bipartisan report in work by the National
Security Council response machine.
</P>
<P>
   The White House was told that the submission of documents was
for security clearance only. It was not to be used for (a) advance
policy review so that ``rapid response'' would occur in the same
news cycle as the reports' release, or for (b) leakage of portions
to the press for ``inoculation'' to later reduce its impact as
``old news.''
</P>
<P>
   The intelligence business is not the publicity business.
National security reports are not to be equated with the Starr
report about hanky-panky. The Shelby committee made plain to the
Berger Rapid-Apology Center that if this undermining of
inter-branch comity did not stop forthwith, ``we're going to zero
out the NSC staff budget.'' (By withholding some $15 million,
Congress could force the spinners onto the Department of Defense
payroll or cause agonizing layoffs in the White House basement.)
</P>
<P>
   In both House and Senate, bipartisan committees are discovering
serious intelligence weaknesses: too little analysis of too much
collection. ``If there's a flare-up in Iraq, North Korea or the
Andes,'' worries an investigator, ``we could not handle it and
Kosovo, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The most troubling breakdown is in counterespionage. The FBI and
CIA, which are not blameless, are telling Congress the weakest link
is the Department of Justice. What began as corrupt political
protection became dangerous national security laxity. Who will
apologize for that?

<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt _ Iran's president met Sunday in Saudi Arabia with
the kingdom's crown prince, taking a crucial step in a process of
fence-mending that is every bit as significant and tricky as the
warmer relationship he has begun with the West.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting, part of the first foray into the Arab world by
President Mohammad Khatami, is clearly important to the moderate
Iranian leader, who has been trying to ease his country out of
years of isolation and external tensions. The visit is the first to
Saudi Arabia by an Iranian leader since Iran's 1979 Islamic
Revolution, which unnerved many of its Persian Gulf neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami has been using his mild manner and eloquence to reassure
Arab leaders that Iran is no longer bent on regional dominance. At
the same time, he has had to take care to avoid inflaming political
foes at home, who have remained hostile to Iran's longtime rivals
and are suspicious of any effort to reach out to either the Arabs
or the West.
</P>
<P>
   To many Iranian conservatives, Saudi Arabia and its neighbors
are little more than outposts of Western imperialism. The result,
midway through a three-nation trip, has been something of a
hodgepodge of statements from Khatami, who is proving adept at
delivering mixed messages.
</P>
<P>
   In Syria, a longtime ally, Khatami met last week with
Palestinian and Lebanese militants to emphasize his country's
support for their campaigns against Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
   He also reiterated Iran's call for Islamic countries to settle
differences among themselves, without the presence of foreign
military forces. The latter was shorthand for an Iranian policy
intent on persuading its Persian Gulf neighbors that they need not
rely on U.S. forces for their protection.
</P>
<P>
   As host to thousands of American soldiers and airmen, Saudi
Arabia has long irritated Iran by turning a deaf ear to that
message. But since his arrival in Saudi Arabia on Saturday, Khatami
has set it aside, and not just to be polite.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami met Sunday in the Red Sea city of Jedda with Crown
Prince Abdullah, who took over day-to-day management of the kingdom
some time ago because of the poor health of his elder brother, King
Fahd, who suffered severe strokes three years ago and is confined
to a wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami and the crown prince reportedly discussed ways to
buttress an accord among oil-producing nations to cut output and
lift prices. Like Iran, Saudi Arabia has suffered in the last 18
months from historically low oil prices, and the lesson that both
countries learned from the agreement reached this spring was that
cooperation was necessary to force oil prices higher.
</P>
<P>
   By underscoring Iran's old demands from Syria, Khatami may
sidestep complaints from conservatives, but his demeanor in Saudi
Arabia leaves little doubt of his commitment to pragmatism over
ideology.
</P>
<P>
   Already, in the two years since his landslide election, Khatami
has become the best-traveled Iranian leader since the Islamic
Revolution of 1979, which ushered in an era of xenophobia. He
addressed the U.N. General Assembly in New York last fall, and he
traveled to Italy earlier this year, making him the most senior
Iranian official to visit Europe in nearly two decades.
</P>
<P>
   On both trips, Khatami reiterated his call for a ``dialogue of
civilizations'' _ a metaphor for his quest for warmer political,
cultural and economic ties between Iran and the West. To Westerners
accustomed to hostility rather than graciousness, those journeys
were seen as landmarks.
</P>
<P>
   And equally, Khatami's Arab tour is being seen as enormously
significant in the Arab world, among countries that not long ago
feared that Iran's revolution might spread to topple their own
governments.
</P>
<P>
   Even in Egypt, one of the few Arab states that has yet to
reinstate full ties with Iran, a headline Sunday in the
government-owned newspaper Al Akbar described Khatami's journey to
Saudi Arabia as ``historic.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Indeed, it marks a turning point in relations between Shiite
Muslim Iran and the Riyadh government, which sees itself as
embodying Sunni Muslim orthodoxy.
</P>
<P>
   The transformation is likely to be reflected in a visit by
Khatami to the Islamic holy sites in Mecca, the scene of several
bloody clashes between anti-Western Iranian pilgrims and Saudi
security forces. Beyond that, in parts of the Arab world, Khatami's
journey has begun to inspire imaginings of a more lasting bond.
</P>
<P>
   If the Arabs and Iranians could put their ancient enmities
aside, wrote Talal Salman, editor of the Lebanese newspaper Al
Safir, they might establish a regional bloc strong enough to
counter ``Israel's territorial designs'' and American hegemony. In
practice, though, the strains remain deep.
</P>
<P>
   Iran remains deeply unlikely to reconcile with Iraq, its foe in
an eight-year war during the 1980s and its principal historical
rival. At the same time, its decade-old occupation of Abu Mousa and
two other islands in the Persian Gulf has kept it embroiled in a
dispute with the United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
   Some Arab diplomats say that Qatar, the last stop on Khatami's
tour, may offer mediation in an attempt to resolve the conflict.
But the islands have become invested with so much symbolic
importance to both sides that a compromise is difficult to imagine,
the diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem that may weigh on Khatami is how his messages in
the Arab world may be interpreted in the West, the other target of
Iranian overtures.
</P>
<P>
   The United States in particular has been watching Khatami
closely to see whether Iranian deeds run in parallel with his
public statements. Last month, the Clinton administration took some
small steps, including a slight easing of economic sanctions
against Iran, in a clear hint that it might entertain further steps
if Iran continued to show the world a generous face.
</P>
<P>
   But the administration has said that any further improvement of
economic ties will depend on three criteria: whether Iran reduces
support for terrorism, abandons pursuit of weapons of mass
destruction and halts its opposition to the Middle East peace
process. And on those grounds, Khatami's performance in Syria might
well be seen as a negative. In Damascus, the Syrian capital,
Khatami underscored Iran's longstanding support for Palestinian
fighters battling Israeli occupation, and he also convened a
meeting that included representatives of the militant Islamic
groups Hamas and Islamic Holy War.
</P>
<P>
   He also met personally with Sheik Hassan Nosrallah, leader of
the Shiite Muslim group Hezbollah, or Party of God, which has long
benefited from Syrian and Iranian support. Senior U.S. officials
have expressed concern about the meetings, saying that Iran
appeared to be showing hostility to a broader Middle East peace.

REPUBLICANS GIVING GROUND ON GUN CONTROL AMENDMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Utah, Wis., N.J., N.Y., Colo., Miss.)  (js) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senate Republicans signaled a willingness Sunday to
approve yet another gun control measure _ namely, a requirement
that child safety devices be sold with handguns _ even though a
similar proposal failed by a decisive margin in the
Republican-controlled Senate less than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   It was the latest sign, after a week rife with such indications,
that Republicans were intent on showing a heightened sensitivity to
the toll of gun violence. But there were also reminders Sunday that
the juvenile crime bill to which gun control measures are being
attached could perish by the middle of the week, a casualty in part
of partisan feuding and political jockeying.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on several television news programs Sunday morning,
Sen. Orrin G. Hatch, R-Utah, predicted that the safety device
amendment introduced on Friday would get enough Republican support
to succeed. The amendment was a slightly altered version of a
Democratic proposal that was rejected, 61-39, last July.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to pass,'' Hatch said on the ABC News program
``This Week.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch, the main sponsor of the juvenile crime bill, joined Sen.
Herb Kohl, D-Wis., as a co-sponsor of the safety device amendment.
Hatch voted against last year's version of the amendment, as did 51
other Republicans and nine Democrats. Three Republicans and 36
Democrats voted for it.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment would require all licensed gun dealers to include,
with the sale of any handgun, a device like a sealed storage
compartment or trigger lock that prevents the easy misuse of the
firearm by a child. It would be up to buyers to actually use the
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The principal concession that Democrats made to win Hatch's
endorsement was a provision granting limited protection from
liability for owners whose guns ended up causing accidental damage
despite the proper use of a safety device.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the majority leader, Sen. Trent Lott of
Mississippi, casually suggested that he had an open mind to a law
requiring the sale of safety devices. Lott's spokesman, John
Czwartacki, said Sunday that he was not sure how Lott would vote on
Kohl's amendment. But, Czwartacki added, ``This is an amendment
that seems reasonable and fair and smacks of an appropriate
compromise.''
</P>
<P>
   The measure could come up for a vote on Tuesday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On the CBS news program ``Face the Nation'' Sunday, Sen. Wayne
Allard, R-Colo., did not state his position on the amendment, but
he said, ``I suspect there will be some Republicans who support it,
and it may very well pass.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Senate approved amendments to the juvenile crime
bill that restrict access to semiautomatic assault weapons by
children under 18 and outlaw the importation of high-capacity
ammunition clips for such weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate also passed an amendment that would promote
background checks on all people who buy firearms at gun shows, not
just people who make their purchases from licensed dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, who voted almost unanimously against the amendment,
said it contained an enormous loophole that exempted many sellers.
They supported what they said was a stronger, more stringent
proposal by Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg, D-N.J.
</P>
<P>
   These measures probably would not have succeeded before a series
of school shootings that culminated in the bloodshed in Littleton,
Colo., last month.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Democrats continued to assert on Sunday that Republicans
were not doing nearly enough. Republicans, in turn, warned that if
new demands from Democrats and continued acrimony in the chamber
delayed a final vote on the juvenile crime bill beyond Tuesday,
work on the bill could be postponed indefinitely as the Senate
moved to other business.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch said that that might be what Democrats really wanted, so
they could then use the Senate's failure to approve new gun control
laws as a campaign issue in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   That Democrats indeed see gun control as a potent campaign issue
was clear in remarks by Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., on ``Face the
Nation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Where is George W. Bush?'' Schumer asked, referring to the
Republican governor of Texas, the early favorite for his party's
presidential nomination. ``Does he really support closing the gun
show loophole? Or does he support this kind of Republican sham?''
</P>
<P>
   Mindy Tucker, a spokeswoman for Bush, said Sunday that the
governor supported legislation that would not only require almost
all sellers at gun shows to conduct background checks but would
also make sure, as a first step, that the sellers had easy access
to the technology and records needed to perform that task.

MOST WOMEN SATISFIED WITH DRASTIC CANCER SURGERY, SURVEY SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Minn., Ga.) (mk) 
 By DENISE GRADY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new survey of women who took a drastic measure to prevent
breast cancer, having both healthy breasts removed, shows that
nearly 70 percent are satisfied with their decision and would make
the same choice if they had it to do over.
</P>
<P>
   The operation, bilateral prophylactic mastectomy, is an uncommon
procedure that has been performed since the 1960s in women with a
personal or family history that puts them at high risk for breast
cancer. There are no statistics on how many women have had the
operation.
</P>
<P>
   The surgery is a subject of debate, regarded by some as an
indefensible mutilation of healthy women and by others as an option
that women at high risk have a right to consider.
</P>
<P>
   The study, in which 572 women were surveyed, is not the first to
examine the question, but it is larger and more representative than
earlier ones. A major study on the same women published in January
showed reliably for the first time that the surgery reduced the
risk of getting cancer by 90 percent _ though some risk remained
because it was impossible to remove all breast tissue.
</P>
<P>
   The women in the new survey had the operation at the Mayo Clinic
in Minnesota between 1960 and 1993. Many had a mother, grandmother
or aunt _ or all three _ with breast cancer, or a personal history
of multiple breast lumps requiring biopsies. Now, 74 percent say
that the operation helped diminish their emotional concerns about
developing the disease.
</P>
<P>
   But the relief from worry had a price: 25 percent also said they
felt less feminine after the surgery, and 36 percent were less
satisfied with the way their bodies looked. Eleven percent were
dissatisfied with their decision; 9 percent very dissatisfied.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Marlene Frost, a nurse and research associate at the Mayo
Clinic, who presented the findings Sunday at a cancer conference in
Atlanta held by the American Society of Clinical Oncology, pointed
out that because ``prophylactic mastectomy is irreversible,'' the
survey provided ``important information that women need in
contemplating this decision.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision is very complex and personal,'' Frost said in a
telephone interview, ``and a woman herself must take the lead. Our
role is to provide women with the best data, both positive and
negative.''
</P>
<P>
   She and her colleagues sent questionnaires to the women asking
how they had decided to have the surgery, and how they felt about
it later. They were also asked to explain why they were satisfied
or dissatisfied.
</P>
<P>
   In important areas of their lives, many women felt the operation
did not change their feelings: self-esteem, sexual relationships
and emotional stability.
</P>
<P>
   Factors that contributed to the women's overall satisfaction
included positive feelings about their appearance, lower levels of
stress and worry afterward, satisfaction with sexual relationships
and absence of problems with breast implants. Although 95 percent
of the women had their breasts reconstructed with implants, those
who did not were among the most satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our thought is that women who went into this with the decision
that they wouldn't have reconstruction were those who probably
placed less emphasis on their breasts in measuring their
self-esteem,'' Frost said.
</P>
<P>
   She said she and her colleagues were concerned that 25 percent
felt a loss of femininity after their mastectomies. ``But a lot of
people are making claims that this is mutilating, and in light of
that, 25 percent isn't a phenomenal number,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A study last year by other researchers had even more positive
results, finding that only 5 percent of 370 women surveyed in 43
states regretted the operation.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Patrick Borgen, lead author of the earlier study and chief
of breast surgery at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New
York, cautioned that the study may have been unrealistically
positive, because the women who took part were those who answered
magazine advertisements inviting them to participate. Those in the
Mayo Clinic study, by contrast, were sought by researchers who
identified them from medical records.
</P>
<P>
   Borgen said his team had found that the women most likely to
have regrets were those who felt they had let themselves be
pressured into the operation by their doctors.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Lynn Hartmann, an oncologist at the Mayo Clinic, said
there were also women who regretted being talked out of the
procedure. She described a patient whose mother, grandmother and
aunts had had breast cancer. But when the woman asked her doctor
about prophylactic surgery, he said, ``Why would you want to do
that to yourself?'' When she went to the Mayo Clinic several years
later, she had metastatic breast cancer, and only a 20 percent
chance of surviving five years.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Three copulating couples populate Peter Ackerman's
new sex comedy, ``Things You Shouldn't Say Past Midnight,'' but
only a single pairing arouses more than a few predictable snickers.
It's the one that pits straitlaced Jeffrey Donovan against naughty
Clea Lewis. He plays a prudish mobster with a hankering for
highbrow culture; she is, in Ackerman's symmetrical scheme, a randy
art historian looking for some down-and-dirty pleasure. When these
naturally funny actors are negotiating the terms of their bedtime
arrangements, they turn the mating dance into a ribald gavotte.
</P>
<P>
   Ackerman's play, which opened on Thursday at the Promenade
Theater, is all about the mindless extremes we go to in
categorizing one another, by race, age and sex, and how these
labels get in the way of a good time. What is so endearing about
the work of Donovan and Ms. Lewis is that they transcend the
outrageous labels. Donovan's Gene is a hit man with an
obsessive-compulsive disorder _ the mob doesn't call him Clean Gene
for nothing _ and Ms. Lewis' Grace has a yen to be dominated,
gangland-style. Yet when engaged in the business of explaining
their wants and needs, they are any New York couple on the
believable brink of long-term connection or fast-approaching
flameout.
</P>
<P>
   The playwright, a young actor receiving his first major
production, gives this pair its due of clever repartee. (Listen for
Ms. Lewis' witty thesis on how a shoe becomes art, or better yet,
make it your business to savor Donovan's smooth transitions from
tough guy to sensitive guy, and back again.)
</P>
<P>
   Thus, it is all the more disappointing that the other couples in
this bedroom farce, constructed in the spirit of a round-robin Alan
Ayckbourn comedy, are so awkwardly conceived and unevenly realized.
</P>
<P>
   Although the level of pep pumped into the intermissionless play
by the director, John Rando, is unassailable, ``Things You
Shouldn't Say Past Midnight'' is on the whole too obvious and
vulgar for the wicked look at sexual relationships that is
intended. Ackerman is of the belief that euphemistic discussions of
sex onstage are passe; one result is a coarse frankness in the
dialogue that suggests a rather jejune sensibility. But then any
romantic comedy whose complications are provoked by the coital
remark ``Do me, you hook-nosed Jew!'' is never going to inspire
comparisons to Noel Coward.
</P>
<P>
   This salvo is tossed in the opening moments of the play by Erin
Dilly, playing Nancy, a perky Midwestern Gentile, in the midst of
lovemaking with Mark Kassen, who portrays Ben, a studly young
Manhattan Jew. The flustered Ben artlessly poses a hypothetical to
Nancy in which he hints that he is gay, which sends the distraught
Nancy in the middle of the night to the apartment of Grace, who is
about to bed Clean Gene. Grace immediately calls Gene's gay
brother, Mark (Andrew Benator), who happens to be her therapist and
is himself in bed with Donald (Nicholas Kepros), an older Jewish
man.
</P>
<P>
   Among various portable and speakerphones, and between the sheets
of three beds, Ackerman's comedy works itself into a minor frenzy.
Rando, who recently directed ``Do Re Mi'' for the Encores series of
musicals in concert, keeps the traffic moving, even when the
plotting is at its most chokingly unconvincing.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Odorisio's set, a wall of cushions dotted by night lights,
is functional and reflective of the tawdriness of much of the
playwright's material. Ms. Dilly and Kassen have the least
flavorful assignments; Kepros and Benator are mere caricatures.
Donovan and Ms. Lewis have all the fun: they're in the bed on the
left.

SPORTS COLUMN: FOR NOW, ALL QUIET ON THE YANKEE FRONT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ During batting practice Sunday, Don Zimmer was
sitting in the Yankee dugout, talking about how Joe Torre's return
was approaching. One educated guess was that Torre will be managing
the Yankees on Friday night in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad Joe hadn't come back any sooner,'' Zimmer said,
``because I wouldn't want him to go through what we have the last
10 days.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer was alluding to the Yankees' recent 4-6 slump, including
a five-game losing streak that had dropped the Yankees into a
Sunday morning tie with the Boston Red Sox for first place in the
American League East. But in the dugout now, Derek Jeter suddenly
sat down next to Zimmer. Moments later, they were laughing.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was about George, our new batboy,'' Zimmer would say
later. ``Derek told me the players were telling him: `You're on
thin ice. We better win pretty soon or you'll be gone.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Jeter was joking. George Steinbrenner has never fired a batboy.
Now and then a secretary, never a batboy. But through the years
``gone'' is a word many Yankee managers, pitching coaches and
players have understood. Shortly after noon Sunday, the man behind
that word strode into the clubhouse, then into the players' lounge.
Moments later, Bernie Williams noticed more than a dozen reporters
standing around in silence, staring at the door to the players'
lounge.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's going on?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``George just came in,'' the Yankee center fielder was told.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Oh. But when the Yankees' principal owner was confronted by
reporters on the elevator to his upstairs office, he appeared to
accept the Yankee losing streak with rare serenity. Perhaps because
he had been on his own losing streak when he attended the Preakness
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had every other horse except Charismatic,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Torre's return, he said: ``That's strictly up to
Joe. He's got to have a complete sign-off from the medical
authorities.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the recent slump after the Yankees had won 125 games
last year, including their World Series sweep of the San Diego
Padres, Steinbrenner steamed slightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to hear about last year,'' he said. ``We just
want to win one more game than everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   He had checked how Yankee teams in 1928, 1937 and 1962 had
reacted to the Yankee record of the year before: 101 victories in
1928 after 110 in 1927, 102 victories in 1937 after 102 in 1936, 96
victories in 1962 after 109 in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the 1978 Yankees,'' somebody said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's right,'' he said. ``We were 14 games behind the Red Sox
in August.'' It really was July, but close enough.
</P>
<P>
   But what even Steinbrenner seems to have realized about this
year's Yankees is just that: it's this year, not last year. In
sports, teams, like players, have ``a year'' every so often. As the
Yankees did last year. As Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa did last
year. As Roger Maris did in 1961. As Joe DiMaggio and Ted Williams
did in 1941.
</P>
<P>
   When ``a year'' is as historic as those years were, it's just
not going to happen again. The Yankees' five-game losing streak
wasn't an aberration. Their 125 victories, including a World Series
sweep, was an aberration.
</P>
<P>
   Even with Sunday's 2-1 victory over the Chicago White Sox that
ended the losing streak and helped the Yankees claim first place
for themselves again, they know enough to realize that last year
isn't going to happen this year. Zimmer has been preaching that
philosophy ever since he was named manager while Torre was
recovering from surgery for prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who expects a team to do that again?'' Zimmer was saying after
the losing streak had ended. ``All I said in the spring was, `I
hope we win the Eastern Division championship.' This is a different
team than last year's.''
</P>
<P>
   This year Tim Raines is in Oakland. Darryl Strawberry is in
court. David Wells, Graeme Lloyd and Homer Bush are in Toronto.
When Wells pitched his perfect game a year ago today, the Yankees
not only were 28-9, but they were also about to sweep the Orioles,
then take two out of three in Boston to open a six-game lead.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Clemens, obtained in the trade for Wells, Lloyd and Bush,
is on the disabled list with a deceptive 2-0 record that includes a
5.47 earned run average. Jeff Nelson is on the disabled list, too.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night the Yankees will be in Boston again, playing for
first place in a three-game series before going to Chicago, when
Torre might return. Then the Red Sox arrive at Yankee Stadium next
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   But it's this year, not last year. At least for now George the
batboy seems to be safe from George the principal owner. &QL;

WITH 4.5 SECONDS LEFT, HEAT TURN OVER GAME 7 TO THE KNICKS

<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ When it was over, Tim Hardaway sat slumped against a
wall in the Miami Heat locker room, his face reduced to a lifeless
stare.
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway, the Heat's point guard, committed two turnovers in the
final three minutes of Sunday's playoff finale against the Knicks _
including a pivotal one with 19.9 seconds left _ as the Heat fell
in the final seconds, 78-77, at Miami Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``I let my team down by turning the ball over,'' Hardaway said
softly, surrounded by a crush of reporters. ``I put it all on my
shoulders because those turnovers cost us the game.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Heat ahead by 77-76, Hardaway passed up a 3-point
attempt to penetrate between Latrell Sprewell and Charlie Ward, and
Sprewell knocked the ball out of his hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just lost it,'' Hardaway said.
</P>
<P>
   That set up the Knicks for the fateful running jumper by Allan
Houston that hit off the front of the rim and the backboard before
going through the hoop.
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway failed to score in the second half, settling for 9
points. It was typical of his production in this series, as he
averaged almost 8 points a game less than his 17.4 regular-season
average.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired of talking about my productivity,'' he said to a
question about his dropoff. ``It's over.''
</P>
<P>
   As reporters walked away, Hardaway covered his eyes with his
left hand and sat frozen in that pose for several minutes.
</P>
<P>
   He had plenty of company. Not far away, center Alonzo Mourning
studied the labeling on a mineral water bottle for the longest
time, forward Jamal Mashburn stared aimlessly into space and guard
Voshon Lenard peered down at the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adversity introduces a man to himself,'' Mourning said later.
``You can only get better from this.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone asked Mourning if he felt particularly sorry for
Hardaway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you blaming this on Tim?'' Mourning said, glaring. ``I
feel for all my teammates, not just Tim. We came up 4.5 seconds
short.''
</P>
<P>
   In the sequence before Houston's shot, Miami's backup point
guard, Terry Porter, had grappled with Sprewell for a loose ball
that went out of bounds. Officials awarded possession to the Knicks
with 4.5 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he hit it out,'' Porter said. ``He reached out and
it looked like the ball went off his hand. But I'd have to see the
replay to be sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Heat Coach Pat Riley said Porter's hustle turned out to be
fortuitous for the Knicks. ``Basically they had nothing with five
seconds to go,'' Riley said. ``It gave them a chance to get
organized and get a play set, and that's all she wrote.''
</P>
<P>
   During the timeout before the winning shot, the Heat went over
the scenarios involving the three Knicks most likely to get the
ball _ Houston, Sprewell and Patrick Ewing.
</P>
<P>
   After Houston got the ball, Ewing was able to screen Dan Majerle
out of position, allowing Houston to penetrate the middle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew what the play was going to be in that situation, once
Allan got the ball,'' Majerle said. ``I probably should have gotten
on top of him and made him go the other way. Made somene else take
the shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the ball left Houston's hand and bounced on the rim,
Majerle feared the worst.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it was going in,'' he said. ``That's pretty much the
way things happened for us in this series.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly the Heat's season was over. ``I didn't want it to end
like that,'' Mourning said. ``It kind of makes you angry a little
bit.''
</P>
<P>
   In the locker room afterward, Riley was brief with his players,
thanking them for their effort. Then he was gone, leaving his
players to wonder how many of them will return next season.
</P>
<P>
   Majerle, for one, wants to stay, but his contract is up and the
Heat has given no indication of its intentions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I intend to play somewhere,'' he said. ``I'd like for it to be
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Near where Majerle sat, a sheet of paper bore what Riley was
trying to accomplish in Sunday's game. It said in part, ``All great
leaders since Moses have known that feared enemies must be crushed
completely.''
</P>
<P>
   A crushing of the Knicks would have sent them spiraling into an
off-season of doubt and changes. As it turned out, the top-seeded
Heat is the team facing serious doubt and probable changes.
</P>
<P>
   Mourning said the best team did not win Sunday's game and he
would like the Heat's nucleus return. After Riley left the locker
room, Mourning told his teammates his feelings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them to keep their heads up,'' he said. ``We don't have
any reason to hold our heads down. We all left it out there on the
court.''
</P>
<P>
   Except on this day, it wasn't quite good enough.

RANGERS WATCHING FOR PITCHING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
ARLINGTON, Texas _ The Rangers continue to monitor the potential
breakup of the Baltimore Orioles, who are 13-24 despite an $84
million payroll. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Rangers likely would be interested in right-handers Mike
Mussina, Scott Erickson and Juan Guzman should the Orioles decide
to begin a rebuilding phase. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mussina, a legitimate No. 1 starter, would be of most interest
to the Rangers. Mussina, whom the Cleveland Indians also covet, is
in the second season of a three-year contract worth $20.45 million.
However, Mussina (5-1, 4.89) is the one player the Orioles would
prefer to keep, major-league officials said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Erickson is in the first season of a five-year contract worth
$32 million, but his 1-5 record and 6.51 earned-run average could
scare some organizations. Guzman can become a free agent after this
season, but his inability to stay healthy remains a concern. Guzman
(1-4, 5.88) pitched only four innings Saturday before leaving with
stiffness in his lower back. &QL; 
The medical view &QL; 
Dr. John Conway, the Rangers' orthopedic consultant, examined
shortstop Royce Clayton and left-hander Eric Gunderson yesterday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The results: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clayton (torn muscle, right shoulder) received medical clearance
from Conway, and manager Johnny Oates indicated the shortstop could
begin a brief medical-rehabilitation assignment. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Friday's magnetic-resonance-imaging test revealed partial tears
of the rotator cuff and labrum in Gunderson's left shoulder. The
Rangers plan to treat the injury conservatively, and Gunderson will
be sidelined at least three to six weeks, Conway said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Other injury updates: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Oates indicated right fielder Juan Gonzalez (strained right
hamstring) could return to the lineup as early as Friday. Gonzalez
missed his fourth consecutive game yesterday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman Todd Zeile jammed his ankle at first base in the
sixth inning while running out a grounder. Reserve infielder Jon
Shave replaced Zeile, who is day to day. &QL; 
Briefly The Rangers promoted left-hander Robert Quarnstrom from
Class-A Charlotte to Double-A Tulsa and purchased Ryan Karp's
contract from the Atlantic League and assigned him to Tulsa. The
Drillers needed fresh relievers. Quarnstrom will return to
Charlotte in the near future, assistant general manager Dan O'Brien
said. Karp, a left-hander, made 16 major-league appearances for the
Philadelphia Phillies in 1995 and '97. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers signed Mel Rosario and assigned the 25-year-old
catcher to Tulsa. Rosario appeared in four games with the Orioles
in 1997. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday's game was played with only three umpires. Durwood
Merrill missed the game with the flu. &QL;

   BIG COMPANIES FALL BEHIND IN FIXING YEAR 2000 GLITCH
</P>
<P>
   The largest companies in the nation continue to fall behind
their schedules for fixing the year 2000 problem, and most suspect
that their budget estimates for the remaining work are too low,
according to a survey in April that was the latest in a closely
watched series that began in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   About 22 percent say they do not expect to have all of their
critical systems tested and ready to adjust when the clock ticks
over to Jan. 1, 2000. That is up from 16 percent in November. The
number of companies that have encountered a failure stemming from
year 2000 problems jumped to 72 percent in April from 55 percent in
November.
</P>

   SEARCH ENGINE FOR AUDIO AND VIDEO
</P>

   Real Networks, a multimedia software maker, and Snap.com, an

on the Web.

   PAUL ALLEN GETS A MAKEOVER Paul Allen, the co-founder of
Microsoft and owner of the Portland Trail Blazers basketball team,
looks a lot more dapper these days as he takes his accustomed seat
courtside at Trail Blazers games. Appearing on television
frequently as the Trail Blazers are having their best season in
years, the 45-year-old billionaire looks much more like a
high-technology investor than the guitar-playing hacker geek that
many recall. Gone are the rumpled sport shirts and the beard,
replaced by clean-shaven cheeks and well-cut suits.
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET RADIO MOVES BEYOND NICHE
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, listening to the radio on the Internet was
considered the domain of the 20-something set. But recent deals
show the growth of a multilayered industry with players convinced
that the personal computer will be the radio tuner for the next
generation.

   BORROWING FROM FACTS FOR FICTION

   Kurt Andersen _ a staff writer for The New Yorker magazine, a
former editor of New York, a founding editor of Spy magazine and a
former writer for Time _ has drawn extensively from his media world
for the plot of ``Turn of the Century,'' a social satire set in
2000 that skewers cyberspace, television, Wall Street traders,
marriage and the media.

   A HUMBLE GUY NOW WORTH MILLIONS

HOLLANDWORTH DOES GOOD JOB AS UNDERSTUDY
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ When the Los Angeles Dodgers return to action
Tuesday night against the Houston Astros, Devon White is expected
to be back in center field. But Todd Hollandsworth, who started the
last six games while White was nursing a strained right hamstring,
did all the Dodgers asked.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did he go 7 for 20 during that span, including a triple
and two singles in Sunday's 5-4 loss to the St. Louis Cardinals,
Hollandsworth opened the bottom of the seventh by making a superb
running catch in right center to take away extra bases from Darren
Bragg.
</P>
<P>
   Hollandsworth's triple came in the first inning off Cardinals
starter Juan Acevedo, and he scored on a sacrifice fly by Gary
Sheffield.
</P>
<P>
   Hollandsworth, the Dodgers opening-day left fielder the previous
three seasons, is strictly coming off the bench these days. To make
it worse, he missed most of the first month with a strained left
hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball is a game of rhythm, getting a feeling on the bases,
at the plate and in the field,'' said Hollandsworth, who now is
batting .294 (10 for 34). ``These last few games have given me a
chance to get that back, but I have no illusions that this means
I'll play any more than I am.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it does do is let them know that they can put me out
there and know that I'll do the job.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Day of rest: Hollandsworth wasn't the only bench player to
start Sunday. The Dodgers went with Paul LoDuca behind the plate in
place of Todd Hundley, Dave Hansen instead of Eric Karros at first
and Jose Vizcaino at third for Adrian Beltre.
</P>
<P>
   After Saturday night's 8-5 loss, manger Davey Johnson told
Beltre, who came in with a .333 (19 for 57) average in his last 16
games, that he wasn't starting. Jose Vizcaino started at third, but
Beltre entered the game in the third after Vizcaino left with a
strained muscle behind the left knee and went 0 for 2. Vizcaino
will be examined today.
</P>
<P>
   LoDuca went 0 for 4 and is batting .056 (2 for 36) with no home
runs or RBI. Hansen, the team's top pinch hitter, went 1 for 2 with
a run and is batting .462 (12 for 26) with two homers and five RBI.
</P>
<P>
   __ Brown goes home: The Dodgers flew back after the game and are
off today before opening a three-game series against Houston at
Dodger Stadium. They play the Cardinals again this weekend for the
final time this season.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Brown, who will pitch Wednesday, flew back to his home in
Macon, Ga., after Sunday's game. He used a plane provided by Fox,
as part of the seven-year, $105 million contract signed last
winter.

REFERENDUM VOTE COULD GRANT RIGHTS TO INDIGENOUS PEOPLES  
</HEADLINE>
  (js)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHIMALTENANGO, Guatemala _ In a country where the indigenous
majority has faced genocide and poverty and long been excluded from
power, Elias D. Chitamul, like so many other voters on Sunday,
faced his chance to change Guatemala with tempered optimism.
</P>
<P>
   Casting his ballot in a referendum that would declare Guatemala
``multiethnic'' and rein in the military, Chitamul, 19, said he
expected ``not total change, but the beginning of change.'' To him,
that meant living in a peaceful country that no longer feared its
own army.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hope is that people can leave their home and return the
same way they left _ without any harm befalling them outside,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Another voter, Florentina Sintu, 28, said she would be satisfied
with even ``meager'' results. ``We want to change the way things
are for us but we have to resign ourselves to whatever we get,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the ballot measure, if approved as expected,
would for the first time grant equal status to the languages,
religions and traditional laws of the Mayan peoples, who account
for about 60 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
   The vote, on 50 amendments to the Constitution, posed what
President Alvaro Arzu Irigoyen called ``a decisive test'' of
Guatemala's willingness to build a more just society after 36 years
of war between the government and leftist guerrillas that killed
about 200,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals would make the first tangible changes in the army
and government called for by peace accords signed in 1996, which
supporters consider crucial to the country's lasting transformation
to an inclusive, democratic state.
</P>
<P>
   The amendments would restrict the army to territorial defense
and end its control of internal security, a role that has led to
scores of political killings and human rights abuses. The
presidential general staff, the military unit found to have engaged
in many abuses, would be replaced by civilians. The post of defense
minister could now be also filled by a civilian.
</P>
<P>
   Other important changes aim to increase checks on the executive
branch and reform the judicial system, which has routinely allowed
much crime to go unpunished.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the wide range of the proposals, public debate before
the vote focused almost exclusively on the handful of amendments
that recognize the rights of the Guatemala's indigenous peoples.
</P>
<P>
   For centuries, they have been excluded from government and
relegated to alarming rates of poverty and illiteracy in a country
where wealth and power have been dominated by the ladinos, the
mostly white and mestizo minority.
</P>
<P>
   One amendment would define this country of 11 million as
``multiethnic, multicultural, multilingual,'' specifically
acknowledging not only the Mayan majority but also minorities like
the Garifunas, descendants of Caribbean blacks, and the Xinca, a
nearly extinct indigenous group.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Another grants official status to 24 indigenous languages, a
change whose effect in making education, health care and other
public services available in languages other than Spanish will
depend largely on bringing indigenous people into civil service
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The amendments also grant indigenous groups the right to visit
sacred places, denied by some private land owners. Another change
would acknowledge the legitimacy of indigenous traditional law,
currently used to settle disputes, as long it does not conflict
with the national legal system and is done voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   The reforms would boost a Mayan movement that has become more
united in the last decade, bringing together hundreds of groups
despite language and other differences.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're beginning is a new social contract for Guatemala,''
said Alvaro Pop, a founding member of the Coordinator of Guatemalan
Mayan Organizations, a major indigenous group, and a negotiator of
the proposed reforms. ``We're building the nation we never had, a
nation within our own diversity.''
</P>
<P>
   But the reforms were vigorously opposed by powerful sectors,
including business people, politicians and intellectuals who warned
of the cost involved in carrying out some of the measures and of
the danger of ``Balkanizing'' the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``This can bring about another war,'' said Roberto Orozco, 50, a
businessman in the department of Sacatepequez, east of here.
``We're going to turn into Kosovo, with each tribe taking up arms
to go to war.''
</P>
<P>
   Many opponents objected to the decision by the Guatemalan
Congress, which designed the measures, to make voters decide on
blocks of reforms rather than to vote on each one separately.
Others criticized the reforms as an imposition by international
agencies and foreign countries, including the United States, which
have given $2.4 billion in loans and grants to carry out the peace
accords.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the measures charged that many of the arguments
against the reforms were tinged with racism and fear by the upper
classes that equal conditions imply a loss of political and
economic power.
</P>
<P>
   Turnout was expected to be well below a third of four million
registered voters, some officials noted, because of the thin effort
to inform people about the measures in what is the first vote since
peace was reached.

<TEXT>
<P>
   UPINGTON, South Africa _ Even out here in this arid, desolate
part of the country where the polls say the National Party _ now
rechristened the New National Party _ will do well, Marthinus van
Schalkwyk does not make a stop without lashing out at the
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, he also hits out at President Nelson Mandela's party, the
governing African National Congress, saying it has failed to
control crime and to deliver on its promises of jobs for all. But
his real passion seems to be saved for warning voters about the
evils of South Africa's once tiny liberal party, known here as the
DP.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Party, says van Schalkwyk, leader of the party
that created apartheid, is flirting with the racist right ``and
they will die of that political cancer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere the gods of politics must be howling with laughter.
</P>
<P>
   If South Africa's second postapartheid election campaign has
offered any surprise at all, it is the fuss that the Democratic
Party has engendered. The party and its antecedents, which
traditionally represented wealthy, English-speaking white liberals,
consistently opposed apartheid and were small but nagging irritants
to the white-supremacist Afrikaans-speaking former regime.
</P>
<P>
   But even the African National Congress, which is expected to
coast to victory, perhaps with a two-thirds majority, has turned
its guns on the Democratic Party. It began a poster war suggesting
that the party, which even fought to upgrade conditions in the
prison where Mandela was held, is now running a racist campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Leon, the boarding-school-educated chief of the party,
shrugs off the accusations. He is gaining in the polls and could
even displace van Schalkwyk as South Africa's official opposition
leader. But the contest for that seat has been bitter, laced with
assertions of racism and deceit and exposing the deep racial lines
that still divide South African society.
</P>
<P>
   Despite public statements that they are looking for voters of
all races, the Democratic and National Parties, running virtually
neck and neck, are engaged in a fierce fight for the allegiance of
the nonblack vote. (The majority of blacks remain loyal to the
African National Congress.)
</P>
<P>
   In luring supporters, they are both playing on the fears of
South African minority groups _ whites, ``coloreds'' and Indians _
who still have most of South Africa's wealth but worry about having
no say in the government.
</P>
<P>
   Though Leon's party won just 1.7 percent of the vote in 1994,
giving it only seven of the 400 seats in Parliament, it has been
hugely successful over the last five years as a burr under the seat
of government.
</P>
<P>
   By leaking stories to the press, harshly questioning Cabinet
ministers during public debates and filing lawsuits when it could
not stop legislation, the Democratic Party has become the chief
watchdog on government corruption, incompetence and cronyism.
</P>
<P>
   All seven of its members of Parliament are nimble-tongued, but
none more so than Leon, who is a walking sound bite. When Mandela
recently sneered that white parties were ``Mickey Mouse,'' Leon
instantly shot back that Mandela was ``running a Goofy
government.''
</P>
<P>
   He has consistently pushed a liberal agenda _ more
accountability in government, less interference with private
enterprise, more power in local hands. And he has been particularly
visible in opposing affirmative action without quotas or time
limits, which he calls apartheid in reverse.
</P>
<P>
   On the campaign trail, Leon suggests that giving the African
National Congress a two-thirds majority, which would allow it to
change the Constitution, would be a catastrophe. Thabo Mbeki, who
almost certainly will replace Mandela as president, could decide to
make it a job for life, Leon says.
</P>
<P>
   Or, he says, hitting South Africa's affluent whites squarely in
the wallet, he could ``fool with the property clauses'' in the
Constitution, which prevents the government from expropriating
property without paying fair market prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't let it happen,'' Leon told white farmers near
Pietermaritzburg recently. ``Not because the ANC is the evil
incarnate. They aren't. But because no government in this country _
with our history _ should ever have that kind of power.''
</P>
<P>
   His pitch is clearly hitting home. Polls show that his party is
the fastest-growing one, with as much as 10 percent of the vote
now. Not much, perhaps, but maybe enough to beat the New National
Party, which got 20 percent in 1994, but has been sinking in the
polls ever since. At the moment, polls show them about even.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts say they believe that a large chunk of Leon's
support is coming not from liberal Afrikaners but from conservative
ones, a traditional National Party power base.
</P>
<P>
   They deem the old right-wing parties like the Conservative Party
and the Freedom Front ineffective, and resent the old National
Party for handing over the reins of power to blacks in 1994. They
see the Democratic Party's fight for individual rights and minimal
government interference as the best protection for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``What seems to be happening is the opposite of what you would
expect,'' said Rod Alence, who heads the polling team for the Human
Sciences Research Council, a nonprofit research organization. ``The
DP is taking the far-right votes. These are people who are looking
for protection and see the DP as the party that can do that for
them.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some critics have said that the Democratic Party's campaign
slogan _ ``The Guts to Fight Back'' _ is directly appealing to the
right wing. At one point, the African National Congress put up its
own posters playing on the theme: In DP colors, they said, ``Don't
Fight Blacks.'' But when the DP threatened to sue, the ANC took its
2,000 posters down.
</P>
<P>
   Leon defends the slogan. ``It is the peculiarity of our times
that anyone thinks that an opposition party should spend 28 days of
campaigning saying nice things about the government,'' he said.
``If what my party does appeals to people who are fed up, so be it.
They have a right to fight back.''
</P>
<P>
   In battling to keep his place as the official opposition leader,
van Schalkwyk has myriad problems. When F.W. de Klerk left the
National Party in 1997, his departure triggered an exodus of senior
party officials. Van Schalkwyk, at 37, too young to be held
responsible for any apartheid-era atrocities, emerged as the new
leader. But his stature does not approach de Klerk's. His round,
youthful face has earned him the nickname ``kortebroek'' _ ``short
pants'' _ a reference to the khaki shorts worn by Afrikaner farm
boys.
</P>
<P>
   And completely unfamiliar with opposition party politics, the
National Party has often seemed adrift. Early on, it often took a
day or two to issue responses to news events, by which time
newspapers were no longer interested. And it has not proved nearly
as adept as the Democratic Party at debating.
</P>
<P>
   But van Schalkwyk is pressing ahead with de Klerk's efforts to
transform the party into a nonracial party that will do a better
job of governing than the African National Congress, which has had
trouble improving schools, health care and other services.
</P>
<P>
   Most of his campaign stops start with a prayer. Van Schalkwyk
bows his head, closes his eyes and clasps his hands. Then he points
out that in the one province where the National Party won a
majority in 1994, the Western Cape, 80 percent of the students
passed their high school exams last year. In the country as a
whole, 50 percent did.
</P>
<P>
   And he says, the economy is growing at four times the national
rate in the Western Cape. To get a grip on crime, he wants the
death penalty restored.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know how to govern,'' van Schalkwyk says at every stop.
``We know how to create jobs. We know how to provide a good
standard of education to our children. We know how to deal with
criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the party for decent people,'' he said.

GIRARDI HAS THE REINS AS PETTITTE HALTS SLUMP
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ George Steinbrenner, who grabbed tickets on every
horse other than Charismatic on Saturday, tried picking another
winner Sunday at Yankee Stadium, a task complicated by the fact
that his team had lost five consecutive games. ``You've always been
our stopper,'' Steinbrenner told Andy Pettitte, the left-hander
with the broad shoulders eight hands wide.
</P>
<P>
   Every winner needs a good jockey, and it was left to catcher Joe
Girardi to guide Pettitte through the heavy traffic created by the
Chicago White Sox. Pettitte and the New York Yankees could have
been bumped off at several different turns in the game; they could
have faltered. But Girardi either made plays or coaxed Pettitte
through, and the Yankees edged Chicago, 2-1, before 51,046 at
Yankee Stadium. Somehow.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got some breaks, sure, a couple of things went our way,''
said Don Zimmer, the Yankees' interim manager. ``After the past
week, I think we're entitled.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer never claimed the Yankees suffered from bad luck in the
past week. No, the Yankees could take full credit for their losses,
caused by a collective hitting slump _ their batting average shrank
from .283 to .272 in six days _ and inconsistent starting pitching
and consistently erratic defense.
</P>
<P>
   After Pettitte allowed a first-inning run, Chili Davis correctly
anticipated a first-pitch fastball from Mike Sirotka in the second
inning and lashed a two-run home run, and Zimmer turned to Mel
Stottlemyre, the Yankees' pitching coach, and said, ``It's all up
to you now, Pal.''
</P>
<P>
   With his gallows humor, Zimmer was referring to the fact that
the Yankees are not generating many runs, and that Stottlemyre and
the pitchers would be responsible for maintaining the one-run lead.
</P>
<P>
   Girardi had already saved the Yankees a run in the top of the
second inning. With runners on first and third and two out,
Pettitte flipped a changeup that bounced in the dirt, and Girardi
blocked enough of the ball to keep it close to home plate and
prevent Chicago's Craig Wilson from scoring.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte nodded at Girardi, nice play, unspoken. Pettitte has
come to rely on the crew-cut Girardi, in the way a private looking
for structure relies on his sergeant. Pettitte likes Girardi to
call pitches for him, likes following his orders. Girardi:
Fastball, outside. Pettitte: Yes, sir.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really trusts Joe,'' said David Cone, whose own
pitcher-catcher relationship with Girardi is somewhat different _
Girardi is the sergeant, Cone the four-star general preferring
absolute control.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte never shakes off signs from Girardi, as he occasionally
does from Jorge Posada. The results are different as well:
Pettitte's earned run average when pitching to Posada this season
is 14.04, but it is 2.36 when throwing to Girardi. There's a
certain level of comfort working with Girardi, Pettitte said,
because they are familiar with each other; maybe Girardi helps
Pettitte's confidence, the pitcher agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte shut out the White Sox in the third inning, just after
Davis' home run in the second, and he continued to stifle them in
the fourth. Wilson singled and took second on a wild pitch leading
off the fifth inning, and Pettitte walked Brook Fordyce, Chicago's
No. 9 hitter. First and second and nobody out. As he prepared to
pitch to Ray Durham, Pettitte got a sign from the first baseman
Tino Martinez for a pick-off; neither Pettitte nor Martinez would
say how this was communicated.
</P>
<P>
   No matter: Martinez darted to the bag as Pettitte began his
delivery, the throw was perfect and Fordyce was out, the first out
of the inning. Pettitte would get the last out by striking out
Frank Thomas, who had been 10 for 21 in his career against
Pettitte.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' lead was in jeopardy again in the sixth (and there
was always the sense they were going to blow the game). Magglio
Ordonez ripped a leadoff double between outfielders, and then Paul
Konerko extended his arms across the plate and flipped a single to
right, Ordonez stopping at third. First and third; nobody out,
again.
</P>
<P>
   Darrin Jackson dumped a grounder in front of home plate, about
15 feet away from Girardi, on the first-base side. Edging down the
third-base line, Ordonez waited, hesitated, until he saw Girardi
move in pursuit of the ball, and then Ordonez charged down the
line. Zimmer saw the play begin to develop, assumed Ordonez would
score and silently lamented the bad luck.
</P>
<P>
   Girardi reached down and barehanded the ball. Pettitte screamed
at him that Ordonez was trying to score, and Girardi reversed
direction, going back to the plate. The Chicago runner stopped and
tried going back to third, but was nabbed in the rundown. It was
the biggest out of the game, Zimmer agreed. Pettitte got two more
outs and was relieved by Jason Grimsley in the seventh and eighth
innings, and Mariano Rivera in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``A huge win,'' Cone said. ``It stops the bleeding.''
</P>
<P>
   Jose Cardenal, the Yankees' first-base coach, held up a bottle
of red wine and asked Zimmer if he wanted to celebrate the victory.
Paul O'Neill slumped into the chair in front of his locker and when
asked if he was anticipating the start of the three-game series
with the Boston Red Sox on Tuesday. O'Neill said dryly, ``The only
thing I'm anticipating is a day off tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   But the respite didn't come so easily for Zimmer and the
coaches. They joined Steinbrenner and manager Joe Torre and general
manager Brian Cashman for a staff meeting Sunday night, reviewing
the roster and the recent losing streak. Tuesday night, Cone and
the Yankees will face Boston's Pedro Martinez, the best pitcher in
the American League, and Steinbrenner will look for another horse
to take the lead.

<P>
   It was a few days before Miningco.com was scheduled to go public
in March. Scott Kurnit, the company's founder and chief executive,
called its lawyer to ask whether there was any law that prevented a
company, on the day it goes public, from changing its name.
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly, the lawyer said _ but if he was going to do that,
Kurnit should alert Bear, Stearns, the investment bank managing the
offering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bear, Stearns would freak and make me pull the offering,''
Kurnit said recently, explaining why he did not go ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it was only on Sunday that Kurnit told his bankers that
as of Monday morning Miningco.com was to become About.com. Kurnit
says the new name better expresses the nature of the service, a
collection of 600 sites on various topics, each run by a
specialist. His New York company hopes to compete with big sites
like Yahoo by being more selective and having more of its own
content.
</P>
<P>
   It may come as no surprise, however, to the bankers and others
that something has been up at Miningco.com. The company is behind
an elaborate $15 million teaser promotional campaign over the last
two weeks that spread the question ``Hello, is anybody out there?''
in advertisements, in anonymous e-mail messages, and through
tactics like holding up signs with the slogan behind the set of the
``Today'' show.
</P>
<P>
   The tease seems to have attracted some attention. ``Hello, is
anybody wondering about those mystery ads?'' wrote The Wall Street
Journal in a short item in its advertising column that quoted
advertising industry executives speculating that Miningco.com was
behind the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The whole affair shows how the fast-moving Internet and the even
faster-moving market for Internet stocks has warped the traditions
that companies have followed for generations. Not too long ago, for
example, it would have been considered bad form, at the least, to
change the name and key elements of a company's strategy six weeks
after raising $75 million from investors.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is so sure. Analysts were split when told of the
name late Friday by a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all about brand,'' said Paul Noglows, an analyst at
Hambrecht &AMP; Quist, noting that at least some of the success of
Yahoo, for example, has been its lively moniker. ``But at the end
of the day, Miningco is taking a risk, given the success it has
achieved to date. It remains to be seen whether About.com will be
worth the effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrea Williams, an analyst with Volpe Brown Whelan, one of the
underwriters of Miningco.com, was more positive. ``The old name was
fine,'' she said. ``In fact, I liked it more than some people. But
About is simple and easier to remember.''
</P>
<P>
   A bigger question, of course, is whether the name change, and
all the capital that the company is using to promote it, can blast
Miningco.com from the middle of the pack.
</P>
<P>
   Media Metrix, the Web audience measurement company, said
Miningco.com was the 24th-most-visited site in March, just ahead of
the Weather Channel, owned by Landmark Communications, with 5.8
million users. So far the company's sales of advertising _ its
principal hope for making money _ have been modest, with $3.7
million in sales for 1998. Kurnit says another use for the money
from the initial public offering is to hire more salesmen.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond cosmetics, Kurnit says the name change is the centerpiece
of a strategy that will pit About.com more directly against the big
portal sites like Yahoo, Lycos and America Online's service.
</P>
<P>
   The company lost that battle once already. At first, the company
was positioned as a human alternative to what were then known as
search engines, which simply found Web pages with words that
matched whatever a user typed in. It hired part-timers, whom it
called guides, to create handmade lists of the best sites in their
specialties. The name, at first Mining Co., evoked images of the
guides panning for gold amid the dross of the Net.
</P>
<P>
   Miningco.com attracted a certain following, but it hardly kept
pace with the portal sites, which have added a wide range of
services, from e-mail to stock quotes. Kurnit said the company
would use some of the capital it raised to add features to match
the offerings of the portals.
</P>
<P>
   As for revenue, the site's new design gives a large portion of
each screen to links to various shopping sites, which all pay the
company a commission on sales.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the new name helps highlight some of the
differentiating features that the service has developed over the
last few years in addition to its Web directory. The guides write
articles on their subject areas, now amounting to the largest
collection of original content on any Web site, Kurnit says. And
they run chat rooms and message boards on related topics.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Kurnit says that each guide's site _ now called About Fly
Fishing, About Anesthesiology, and so on _ is positioned as a
center of information on its topic.
</P>
<P>
   So why didn't he change the name before he went public? That is
what Audionet did, becoming Broadcast.com on the eve of its public
offering. And Dejanews, a site that searches Internet news groups,
has just redubbed itself Deja.com in an effort to broaden its scope
in preparation for a stock offering.
</P>
<P>
   Kurnit said he did not think he could afford the advertising
campaign that was necessary to change names until it became clear
the stock market was so hot that Miningco.com could raise twice as
much money as it had originally proposed. But if the company
delayed its offering to alert investors to the name change, the
froth on the market could subside and Miningco.com could lose its
windfall. Even now, he's not sure of the reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the stock will go up by $20 or down by $20 _ I'm not
sure which,'' he said. ``But we're not going to be a $20 billion
company digging up the gems of the Web.''

ODDS ON ARIAS, DULL FOR CSUN ATHLETIC DIRECTOR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It could be the most important athletics decision
during Cal State Northridge President Blenda Wilson's seven-year
tenure.
</P>
<P>
   Just days before she leaves the university to become the
president and chief operation officer of the Nellie Mae Foundation
in Braintree, Mass., Wilson will select CSUN's new athletic
director. The athletic department has been without a leader since
Paul Bubb resigned under pressure seven months ago.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of this month, the A.D. search committee will send
Wilson its three recommended candidates, from which she will select
one. Four finalists have interviewed: Robert Arias, Myles Corrigan,
Richard Dull and William Lide.
</P>
<P>
   Handicapping the finalists, it appears two have gained favor. An
overview:
</P>
<P>
   __ Arias: If the voting would have been made the day of his
interviews, he would be the choice. Even though he hasn't been
involved directly with college athletics since 1985, this former
A.D. at Loyola Marymount impressed the coaching staff with his
enthusiasm and charisma.
</P>
<P>
   Personality only gets one so far, though. There are legitimate
questions about Arias' long absence from the college realm _ he is
president of One to One/Los Angeles Communities in Schools _ and
CSUN can't afford to wait for him to learn on the job.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; !bold! &LR; Odds of hire: 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   __ Corrigan: He was the leading candidate when the finalists
were announced; his resume leans heavily to football, which is
CSUN's No. 1 sport.
</P>
<P>
   But according to some department employees, Corrigan, an
assistant to the athletic director at Washington, came on too
strong in his interviews, appearing almost arrogant. Because of
Washington's status as a viable, enriched athletic department,
Corrigan also hasn't been forced to make the kind of cost-cutting
decisions he would be asked to make at CSUN.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; !bold! &LR; Odds of hire: 25-1.
</P>
<P>
   __ Dull: His greatest weakness when he was the A.D. at Maryland
in the early 1980s _ playing to win at the expense of the
student-athlete ideal _ might now be his greatest strength.
</P>
<P>
   Dull learned from those mistakes he made and went through 10
years of soul-searching after being forced to resign in the wake of
the Len Bias scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Dull, the A.D. at Moravian College in Bethlehem, Pa., didn't
come off as the most energetic finalist, some coaches joked that
his demeanor lived up to his surname, but he is professional and
realistic about CSUN's strengths and weaknesses. He knows how to do
the job better than any other candidate. Whether that makes him the
favorite remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; !bold! &LR; Odds of hire: 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   __ Lide: His resume is impeccable and his list of
accomplishments are nonpareil in this group.
</P>
<P>
   But Lide, the athletic director at North Carolina Central, has
been operating under a different scope: a Division II school of
6,000 enrollment with 11 sports. CSUN is Division I in almost all
of its 21 sports and has an enrollment of 27,000.
</P>
<P>
   Although he might be the brightest candidate and excellent at
what he does, Wilson won't gamble with her choice.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; !bold! &LR; Odds of hire: 15-1.
</P>
<P>
   __ Finishing the job: The softball team's streak of seven
consecutive playoff appearances didn't end in 1999, in part because
the Matadors finished the regular season on a high note.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN swept Utah State this past weekend to finish 29-22, 15-9
and third in the Big West. Senior right-handed pitcher Tara
Glaister (20-13) provided the highlight of the three-game sweep
with a no-hitter on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   __ Flying: The future is certainly bright for the women's track
and field team.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman sprinter Krystal Harris was selected as the Big Sky
Conference women's track athlete of the week after she ran a
wind-aided time of 11.87 seconds in the 100 meters at the Modesto
Relays on May 8.
</P>
<P>
   Harris' time was in a preliminary heat; she finished third in
the 100 final. She also ran the Big Sky's second-fastest 200 at
Modesto _ 24.29 seconds _ which trails teammate Annetta Wells, who
is only a sophomore.
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore Anthony Colson won two events in Modesto _ long jump
(22-6{) and triple jump (48-10{).
</P>
<P>
   __ Net effect: CSUN women's tennis players Isabella Peintner, a
junior from Germany, and Kendra Segura, a sophomore from Los
Angeles, were selected to the Big Sky's all-conference first team.
Shaheen Bhanji was honorable mention.

BYRD OUTDUELS HERSHISER AS PHILLIES TOP METS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Philadelphia Phillies pitcher Paul Byrd staggered
into Veterans Stadium Sunday looking like a man who had not had
much recent contact with his pillow or his hairbrush. He rubbed his
red-rimmed eyes and headed drowsily for the clubhouse, having spent
a nearly sleepless night trying to contain his toddler son Colby,
who recently learned how to get out of his crib.
</P>
<P>
   But Colby's father had just enough energy in his pitches _ and
just enough jump in his step on a wild defensive play _ to contain
the New York Mets for 6 1/3 innings and deliver the Phillies a 5-2
victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' loss wasted an encouraging outing by Orel Hershiser.
Although he dropped to 2-4, he pitched six innings, and only in the
last one did he look vulnerable. Until then, Hershiser had allowed
no runs and scattered four hits.
</P>
<P>
   The vision problems that had diminished his ability to see where
he was throwing _ and which resulted in a terrible performance
against Arizona on May 7, in which he yielded nine runs on nine
hits in 4 1/3 innings _ have been solved by a trip to the doctor.
And, despite the inability of the offense to garner him enough
runs, Hershiser could take comfort in the improvement in almost
every facet of his pitching.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a normal loss, not a debacle, so it's something to build
on,'' he said. ``I felt better, more like myself. You look under
every rock when you're in a slump. The vision was a part of it.
Your vision affects your concentration and your balance and
rhythm.''
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser's only bad inning was the sixth. With the Mets
leading, 1-0, Hershiser gave up a Marlon Anderson leadoff single
that went over the mound.. He got Scott Rolen to fly out, but then
walked Bobby Abreu. Mike Lieberthal singled to tie the score. The
next batter, Rob Ducey, hit a 3-1 pitch high to left field. Matt
Franco, playing in left, made a run at it, but the ball sliced
toward the left-field line. As the ball plummeted, Franco tried a
desperate headfirst slide. The ball went past him, two runs scored
and Ducey ended up on third. He scored next, when Kevin Jordan
grounded out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I could catch it,'' Franco said. ``One or two steps
before I dove, I realized I was in trouble. It sunk more than I
thought. I had a split second of, `Try to stop and knock it down.'
But it was too late; I was already committed. I feel terrible for
Orel. That play cost us the game. I told him I was sorry about it.
It cost us three runs and we lost by three.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Mets, who generated plenty of runs even while their
pitching was shaky on this 4-5 road swing, had several
opportunities to make up for Franco. In the first inning, with one
out, Edgardo Alfonzo singled. John Olerud doubled to center field,
and the throw to the plate was wild. Alfonzo scored, but Byrd,
backing up the play, prevented Olerud, who went to third on the
throw, from scoring.
</P>
<P>
   The pitcher flew to the edge of the Mets' dugout, like Charles
Oakley trying to prevent a basketball from bouncing out of bounds,
to grab the ball before it went into the dugout. Byrd, a
right-hander, banged his left arm on the top of the dugout, but he
struck out Mike Piazza, then walked Robin Ventura before striking
out Brian McRae to strand Olerud at third.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of the most athletic plays I've ever seen,'' Mets
manager Bobby Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets finally chased Byrd (5-2) in the seventh inning, when
he gave up a leadoff double to McRae, then, after getting Franco on
a fly ball, delivered two straight walks to load the bases. Roger
Cedeno singled to right to score McRae and make the score 4-2, with
the bases loaded and still only one out. But reliever Wayne Gomes
got Alfonzo, who had a full count, to chase what would have been
ball four. Olerud grounded out weakly to first base to end the
inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made the right pitches at the right times,'' Valentine
said. ``We had the right guys up and we didn't cash in.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, this was a relatively untroubling loss at the end of the
season's longest road trip. After going 2-4 on the Western leg of
this trip, the Mets (21-16) took two of three from the Phillies
(20-16) _ who entered the series ahead of the Mets in the National
League East _ and in the process got solid outings from two of
their three starting pitchers, Masato Yoshii and Hershiser.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like the longest road trip of the season,''
Valentine said. ``I'm glad it's over. But I like the way the guys
are playing. We get to crossroads during the season, and we took
the right road.'' &QL;

BRADLEY THREATENS GORE'S CHANCES; EX-BASKETBALL STAR COULD SPOIL
DEMOCRAT'S PLAN FOR PRESIDENTIAL RACE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)
<TEXT>
<P>
   By CRAGG HINES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   c. 1999 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NASHUA, N.H. _ A counselor hustles teen-agers into the Ash
Street community center, telling them that Bill Bradley is about to
arrive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's that?'' asks a kid in baggy jeans and a yellow jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Good question, and one being asked all the way from this
early-primary state to the White House, where Bradley represents
the only challenge to the Democratic establishment's long-nurtured
plan for Vice President Al Gore to be the party's choice to succeed
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Is Bradley, at 55 still probably best known as a former
basketball star, a quixotic spoiler on an ego trip two years after
huffing out of Washington with a denunciation of the political
system as ``broken?``
</P>
<P>
   Or is the former three-term senator from New Jersey a serious
presidential prospect, whose intense intellect and disarming style
could prove irresistible to dispirited Democrats, independents and
maybe even some Republicans hungry for a different kind of national
leader?
</P>
<P>
   One of the nation's most cautious and experienced political
observers, David Broder of The Washington Post, has formed a
tentative judgment that sent shudders through the Clinton-Gore
organization: ``The script for a possible upset is becoming
clear.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, 51, still leads Bradley among Democrats by as much as 2 to
1 in national polls, but incipient signs that a real race may be on
could be felt as Bradley traversed New Hampshire for three days
last week.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Spiegelman is a die-hard Democrat. For a Bradley speech at
Londonderry High School he wore a T-shirt that read: ``I don't care
if he's dead, I still want to IMPEACH NIXON.''
</P>
<P>
   After listening to Bradley talk about his youth in Missouri, his
days as a basketball player in college, the Olympics and the NBA,
his views on Kosovo, racial division, campaign finance and a dozen
other issues, Spiegelman said:
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Gore is horrible. If Bradley weren't in the
race, I'd be for Gore. But Bradley is so appealing.''
</P>
<P>
   For some Democratic activists, Bradley is a reminder of the days
of earlier party mavericks _ Eugene McCarthy, George McGovern, Paul
Tsongas.
</P>
<P>
   Also with Bradley, Spiegelman said, ``there's none of that ego,
that need to get elected.''
</P>
<P>
   With the first votes still nine months away, the main difference
between Gore and Bradley, in fact, may be their contrasting
personal seismic readings.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, edgy and wound tight, seems consumed by the campaign.
Clinton, acknowledging concern about Gore's campaign, told the New
York Times last week that he had urged his vice president: ``Go out
there and enjoy this.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, on the other hand, seems supremely comfortable running
a race he knows he may lose. He's loose, humorous and even admitted
to reporters he was unsure whether the natives were called ``New
Hampshirites'' or ``New Hampshireans.'' (It's the former.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm starting at the bottom; I only have one way to go,''
Bradley told early-morning radio host Don Imus. ``Some days I think
I ought to be paying people to do this, I enjoy it so much.''
</P>
<P>
   This exultation runs counter to the dour Bradley who, disgusted
with politics, decided not to run for a fourth Senate term in 1996
_ after passing up presidential runs in 1988 and 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a power in giving up power,'' Bradley says of his
decision to leave Washington. In just two years, as a college
lecturer, writer and investment banker, Bradley claims, ``I
rejuvenated.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore partisans are not impressed.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley ``is a guy who couldn't stand the heat, so he got out of
the kitchen,'' said a vice-presidential adviser. ``And before that
he almost got beat'' _ a reference to Bradley's unexpectedly narrow
victory over Republican Christine Todd Whitman in his last race,
the 1990 U.S. Senate contest in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, occupied with weighty global macroeconomic work on the
Senate Finance Committee, failed to take account of a virulent
anti-tax backlash at home, and struggled at the last minute to hang
on to his seat by only 2 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he is now the underdog, Bradley insists his fate is
not dependent on Gore making some big mistake or becoming the fall
guy for public disenchantment with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't have gotten into this if I couldn't see 270,''
Bradley said of the number of electoral votes needed to win the
White House. ``My premise is that I go out and tell people what I
believe, present a positive vision of what I think the future can
be.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley refuses to be drawn out on most major policy positions
and precise political plans. His campaign is in what he calls the
opening ``vision-thematic'' phase. Detailed position papers are
promised in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   And Bradley says they will be about ``big ideas,'' not the
narrowly focused proposals that have marked the later Clinton-Gore
years.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley knows it would be difficult to sustain a hard-bitten
one-on-one campaign through three seasons, so more direct whacks at
Gore are down the road. ``At some point this will be comparative,''
Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   But the sideway slams are already there. Bradley's emphasis on
reform of the campaign finance system is a not-too-subtle reminder
of Gore's own solicitations from the White House and the Clinton
administration's shady fund-raising activities.
</P>
<P>
   Controlling money in campaigns, Bradley says, is ``the critical
issue in our democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has trouble spelling out many significant policy
differences with Gore. They had similar left-of-center voting
records when they were both senators.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a more varied life experience,'' Bradley offered, when
reporters pressed for some sort of differentiation. Bradley
referred to Gore's upbringing in Washington as the son of a senator
and his own as the son of a small-town banker.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's more cautious,'' Bradley added.
</P>
<P>
   In logistical terms, Bradley has the luxury of being able to
campaign full time, which can be a special boon in New Hampshire,
traditional site of the opening primary, and in Iowa, where the
first important presidential caucuses are held. Both states' voters
value face-to-face contact with presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's trip to the Granite State was his fourth since
announcing a presidential campaign in January. Although New
Hampshire may look small, Bradley said, ``it's a big state if you
have to measure it in terms of living rooms.''
</P>
<P>
   The opening months of Bradley's campaign have been solid, at
least in terms of a man who is taking on the vast majority of his
party's loyal-to-Gore establishment.
</P>
<P>
   In the first quarter of the year, Gore raised $8.9 million, but
Bradley held his own with $4.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has run up a huge lead in endorsements, but Bradley has
scored key hits, including Sen. Paul Wellstone, the liberal
Minnesota Democrat who considered a presidential campaign of his
own; former Texas Comptroller John Sharp; former New York Mayor Ed
Koch; and former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volker.
</P>
<P>
   Some Bradley backers have their eye on national polls that show
Gore losing to at least two Republican presidential prospects _
Texas Gov. George W. Bush and former Cabinet official Elizabeth
Dole.
</P>
<P>
   That status soon will worry even establishment Democrats, said
Susan Calegari, who helped organize Gary Hart's New Hampshire
campaigns in 1984 and 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Bill Bradley doesn't beat Al Gore,'' Calegari predicted,
``then a Republican's going to beat Al Gore.''

HAVING HIT BOTTOM, A WISER KERRY COLLINS PICKS UP HIS CAREER  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., N.C., La.)   By BILL PENNINGTON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kerry Collins has seen the videotape of himself walking from
North Carolina's Mecklenburg County Jail last November, a cigar in
his mouth and a slight smirk on his face, four hours after his
arrest for drunk driving.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, he offered a self-analysis:
</P>
<P>
   ``What a dirt bag. I looked like a dirt bag. I mean, I did.''
</P>
<P>
   The arrest, the scene outside the jail, Collins' apparent
soulless impertinence, it was all as repugnant as it would have
been inconceivable a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Collins, a high school and collegiate all-American and a
National Football League star by the time he was 24, saw his life
unravel in swift and ignoble steps, a descent that transformed him
from hero to cad while he was just 25.
</P>
<P>
   He ignited a racial firestorm with the use of a slur, albeit in
jest, as he joked with black teammates on the Carolina Panthers. A
reputation for late-night carousing was aggravated by the
drunk-driving arrest. Then, the Panthers' coach announced that
Collins had abandoned a reeling team by asking out of the lineup.
That led to his outright release.
</P>
<P>
   Collins is fond of summarizing his public tailspin by saying:
``I've been called a racist, a drunk and a quitter. Other than
that, I'm fine.''
</P>
<P>
   If his resume was suddenly crowded with demerits, it did not
stop the New York Giants from believing there was a better Collins
if examined in the whole. While other NFL teams ignored him, the
Giants signed the troubled Collins to a four-year, $16.9 million
contract on Feb. 19 and set about helping him bring order to a life
where there was only a developing chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Three months later, and after an eight-week stay in a
rehabilitation clinic, Collins believes he is poised to reclaim his
past successes. More important, for the first time, Collins
believes he will be capable of enjoying them.
</P>
<P>
   Collins' life is a complex narrative, one in which the primacy
of football contributed to a strikingly unconventional fracturing
of a family. It is a tale in which Collins' identity as an athlete
consumed his sense of self to the exclusion of everything else, a
story where the pursuit of football distinction was painfully
ordained _ even at the expense of Collins' relationships, most
notably with his mother.
</P>
<P>
   Collins' willing sacrifice and headlong chase ultimately
produced success in his chosen profession. A little more than two
years ago he was playing for a berth in the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   It was at that moment that Collins was the most depressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plan for my life had worked, I had it all _ fame, money,
cars, NFL stardom,'' Collins said in a long, emotional interview
last week, hours after his first workout at the Giants' annual
veterans' minicamp. ``The thinking had always been that everything
I went through was going to be worth it if I ever made it this far.
But when I finally got there, you know what I thought? I thought:
`It wasn't worth it.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I had everything and I had nothing.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Collins and his family, nothing really has been the same
since a high school football practice 12 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The 1987 team at Lebanon High School that went to practice that
October afternoon had lost three of its first four games despite
all the potential so manifest in the 6-foot-5-inch body of the
team's 14-year-old quarterback prodigy, Kerry Collins. The losing
brought pressure in Lebanon, a gritty Pennsylvania town of 27,000,
a onetime railway hub where the high school football games often
drew crowds of 5,000.
</P>
<P>
   There was an edge, an agitation as the coaches zealously led the
team through a series of fierce exercises and then directed Collins
to run a quarterback keeper during a full-contact scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point was to punish us and the hitting had become vicious
_ guys were foaming at the mouth,'' Corey Thomas, a Lebanon lineman
and Collins' friend since kindergarten, said recently. Thomas was
part of the pileup that flattened Collins on the keeper.
</P>
<P>
   ``We heard something snap and Kerry start screaming,'' Thomas
said.
</P>
<P>
   Collins' left ankle was broken in two places. As Kerry screamed,
his father, Pat, who was Lebanon's offensive coordinator, began
yelling. A loud, bitter argument ensued between the elder Collins
and the head coach, Hal Donley, over the keeper call _ whether it
was thoughtless, reckless, even spiteful. It was a showdown between
longtime coaches and onetime friends that people in Lebanon say had
been building for years.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Collins declined to be interviewed for this story, but
Donley defended the drill, insisting that Pat Collins had approved
it.
</P>
<P>
   Several Lebanon players said they stood by uncomfortably as the
coaches shouted, then suddenly saw Pat Collins turn from Donley
toward Kerry, who was face down in the grass. Pat Collins reached
down and picked Kerry up from the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Father and son left the practice field and never returned to
Lebanon High.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, over breakfast, Pat Collins told his wife,
Roseanne, Kerry and Kerry's older brother Patrick, who was also a
member of the Lebanon football team, that he wanted the family to
move 30 miles east to West Lawn, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   There Kerry could attend a school district with a far superior
football program.
</P>
<P>
   Roseanne Collins also declined to be interviewed for this story,
but her sons said she was against the family's moving simply for
football. She defiantly refused to leave Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Within a week, Pat Collins had rented a one-bedroom apartment in
West Lawn, 40 yards from a noisy railroad trestle but just a
half-mile down the hill from pristine Wilson High School, where
Kerry could launch his dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Roseanne, whose marriage to Pat would end in divorce a couple of
years later, remained in Lebanon with Kerry's brother Patrick.
</P>
<P>
   Pat and Kerry uncomfortably shared a cramped bedroom in the new,
modest apartment, often eating take-out since neither cooked.
Laundry was shuttled to a grandmother in Lebanon, where Pat still
worked as a teacher of children with disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I adopted an attitude that I had to forget about very strong
relationships, even a relationship with my mother,'' Collins said
last week. ``If I thought about how I'd barely had any relationship
with her now, then I don't survive.''
</P>
<P>
   Surviving meant making it to the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the message sent,'' he said. ``It was worth it to
break up the family to become a top-notch athlete. Kerry the
quarterback mattered more than Kerry the person.''

ELBOW HAS IMPROVED ONLY SLIGHTLY FOR RICE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ They survived the biggest game of the season
without their best shooter. Now the Lakers face a tougher playoff
opponent and still might not have the services of Glen Rice.
</P>
<P>
   The team reported slight improvement in Rice's sore right elbow
Sunday, but he couldn't shoot and remains questionable for
tonight's conference semifinals opener against the Spurs. His
status will be a game-time decision.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the stakes, Rice said he'll be tempted to play in
pain, if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have to see (tonight). With my competitive nature, I
probably would (play),'' he said. ``It feels OK. I still haven't
had total movement.''
</P>
<P>
   A steady diet of ice and electric stimulation has restored some
of Rice's range of motion in his shooting arm. So far, however,
he's only shot layups since the pain and stiffness set in Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is a fluid buildup that might be related to the
elbow surgery Rice had in January. The elbow is otherwise fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Confidence-wise, I'll be all right. I just want to get the
movement back into the arm,'' he said. ``I'm really not worried.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was tough to be in street clothes Saturday, when the
Lakers desperately needed to eliminate Houston and avoid having the
series move back to L.A.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pretty bitter,'' Rice said. ``I really wanted to play.
It was hard for me to swallow that I wasn't going to be able to go
out there and help the team.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Reid feels fined: After flooring Houston's Scottie Pippen
with a hard foul in the third quarter Saturday, J.R. Reid walked
off the court and taunted the crowd with profane shouts that
equated to ``forget Pippen!''
</P>
<P>
   The NBA took the same approach to Reid, fining him $10,000 for
the hit, which left Pippen's vision temporarily blurred.
</P>
<P>
   Reid defended his play but didn't dispute the fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's what the league thought it was worth, then I'll take
it. It's part of the game,'' he said. ``It's a physical time of the
season here in this league, but I didn't think it was that bad of a
hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't try to level him, I didn't try to follow through with
it, I just stopped him from getting to the rim and that was it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Pip, I would never try to hurt him.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Just another win: Rookie coach Kurt Rambis got his first
career playoff-series victory with the 3-1 win over Houston. That
alone might earn the interim coach the permanent job. But he wasn't
putting much stock in the accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think it's rewarding for the team; I don't look at it
as an accomplishment for myself,'' he said. ``When I played, I
never worried about the coaches, how they felt. It's an
accomplishment the players achieved in a very difficult season for
us and all the stuff we've gone through.''
</P>
<P>
   __ The emperor's luggage: For the second time this season,
Shaquille O'Neal arrived in a city without his clothes. His bags
were apparently lost in transit from Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``It only happens in San Antonio and Orlando. My luggage never
seems to make it. They stole everything _ my underwear, my
deodorant,'' he said, sniffing his armpit. ``They took it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone suggested he buy more clothes. ``I ain't got no money,''
quipped O'Neal, who makes $183,000 per game this season. ``I'll
just be like Dennis (Rodman) and walk around naked.''

UNDATED: Kerry the person.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kerry led Wilson in three sports, pursuing an athletics-only
course so completely that he was taunted for never hanging out
late, never indulging when one of the guys had a six-pack of beer.
A wild Saturday night for that Kerry Collins was an extra two
quarters in the batting machine at the local range.
</P>
<P>
   People in West Lawn got used to seeing Pat Collins at each of
Kerry's games, even if always off in the distance, away from the
rest of the parents. Roseanne Collins, whose marriage to Pat was
rocky before the separation, was sighted more rarely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen a lot of interaction between parents and kids,''
John Moyer, Wilson's longtime athletic trainer, said. ``But Kerry
and Pat were almost like acquaintances. After a game, there was not
a lot of huggy-feely stuff. It was: `Good game. OK, see you later.'
That's it.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Barb Heckman, one of Kerry's teachers at Wilson, said: ``You
could see he lacked a woman's influence in his life. There are some
things only a mother can give.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry wrote letters to his Lebanon friend Corey Thomas, letters
Thomas has kept. They describe how depressed Kerry felt without his
Lebanon friends and family.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I know he never lashed out,'' Thomas said. ``He never said
anything to his Dad or anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Kerry's final football game at Wilson was a loss in the state
championship game. A scholarship to Penn State was waiting for him.
</P>
<P>
   His time in Happy Valley was sometimes frustrating. He did not
start until late in his junior year. But as a senior, he led Penn
State to an undefeated season and a Rose Bowl victory.
</P>
<P>
   With the fifth pick in the 1995 NFL draft, Carolina, an
expansion team, made him the first player in its history.
</P>
<P>
   Collins' life could have come apart anywhere; it just happened
to be North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Almost everyone interviewed for this article, Collins included,
thinks his problems of the last two years stemmed from a hazardous
mixture: immaturity, wealth beyond anything he had known and a
burgeoning confusion over football's positive or negative role in
his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things at school had always been structured,'' Collins said.
``Then I was on my own with all this money and attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to explore the other side of me, the guy who has
nothing to do with football. It wasn't Kerry Collins the
quarterback 24 hours a day. I wanted to let the other, fun guy out.
Then I took it too far.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he was an immediate star in Carolina, there were early
signs of trouble. Privately, former teammates criticize him for
spending too much time in Charlotte's nightclubs. Returning to the
team's dormitory after a drunken binge on the final night of the
Panthers' 1997 training camp, Collins tried to joke around with a
group of black teammates in the hallway, using a racial slur and
unwittingly creating the incident that became the preoccupation of
the Panthers' season.
</P>
<P>
   Collins apologized, tried to get people to understand how
aberrant one remark was in the context of the rest of his life.
Hadn't he invited a former teammate in college, a black running
back, to live in his Charlotte house during tryouts that very
month?
</P>
<P>
   Most of his black teammates never forgave him.
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, a brutal hit in an exhibition game broke
Collins' jaw. The free fall had begun.
</P>
<P>
   When Collins was released from the hospital after several hours
of surgery to wire his jaw shut, hospital attendants were perplexed
that there was no one from the team there to drive him home.
Collins had them call his housekeeper.
</P>
<P>
   After an uneven 1997 season for the Panthers and Collins,
Carolina opened last season by losing its first four games.
</P>
<P>
   At 8 in the morning of Oct. 7, 1998, Collins walked into
Panthers Coach Dom Capers' office. When Capers emerged from the
meeting, he stunned his players with the announcement that Collins
had said he no longer had the heart to lead the team.
</P>
<P>
   Collins' teammates were repulsed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a hard thing for me to say, but he's quit on us,'' center
Frank Garcia, one of Collins' friends, told reporters in the
Carolina locker room. ``He jumped ship.''
</P>
<P>
   Carolina released Collins six days later.
</P>
<P>
   Contacted last week, Capers, now the defensive coordinator for
the Jacksonville Jaguars, said he did not want to rehash the
episode.
</P>
<P>
   Collins refused to make any comment last week on his meeting
with Capers. But when asked if he was fully aware of what he was
doing when he met with Capers, Collins said: ``Through all the
things that have happened to me, I have never pushed the panic
button. Never.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins was taken off the waiver wire for $100 by the New
Orleans Saints, who in an unkind twist returned to play Carolina
less than a month later. Booed and jeered throughout the Nov. 1
game, Collins stayed in Charlotte afterward, went to a party with
some former teammates and was stopped by the police on the way
home.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Collins called his brother after his arrest for drunk
driving. ``I said to him, `What the hell were you thinking?'''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry responded, ``I don't know what I'm thinking half the time
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins got the order to report to the Menninger Clinic in
Topeka, Kan., late last year. The NFL wanted him there by Jan. 24,
the beginning of Super Bowl week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to go,'' Collins said. ``But I got to a point
where I said to myself: `If you don't start letting people help
you, you're going to implode.' I went into rehab two weeks early.''
</P>
<P>
   He went to group meetings, met with his counselors, read
voraciously, wrote in a journal throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I checked Kerry Collins the football player at the door,'' he
said. ``And he's a guy I had lived with since I was 14. I took
eight weeks out of my life to concentrate solely on me and the
problems I was carrying around.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins came to grips with his inglorious stumble, saw that its
roots went far beyond the last two tormented years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to make sense of your life when you don't have any
sense of who you are,'' he said. ``People make football a game. I
had it the other way around. Football made me.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   ``Todd Marinovich is a good example. He was brought up as an
athlete his whole life. Couldn't go to Burger King and all that
stuff. At some point, he started to look at the other side of who
he was. And look at all the troubles he's had.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   In time, Collins stopped lamenting the pain of the lesson
learned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'm lucky to have the unique talent I have,'' he said.
``It gives me opportunities others don't have. I didn't see that
two years ago. Was there a bit of a price to pay to get to where I
am? For me, yeah, there was.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did it have an effect on me? Yeah, no doubt about it. Do I
make any excuses about it? No.''
</P>
<P>
   He stopped drinking alcohol, he says, though he believes his
drinking only played a part in what he terms his erratic behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was misusing alcohol, no question,'' he said. ``It played
too much of a role in my life. And I know my quality of life has
picked up since I stopped drinking.''

UNDATED: stopped drinking.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   Months before Collins entered rehab, the Giants were
surreptitiously monitoring him, compiling a dossier. They made a
trip to Wilson High, and sat down for hours with Gerry Slemmer, the
school's principal and Collins' high school football coach.
</P>
<P>
   Slemmer told the Giants all the stories about the Kerry Collins
who made all the teachers smile and made all the coaches he played
for look smarter.
</P>
<P>
   Giants General Manager Ernie Accorsi had a personal vantage
point. Accorsi grew up in Hershey, Pa., 12 miles west of Lebanon.
His father had died in the hospital where Collins was born. He knew
people there.
</P>
<P>
   Accorsi had also worked for Penn State Coach Joe Paterno, a
Collins mentor. Accorsi's daughter had shared a class with Collins
as a Penn State student. Paterno, among others, defended Collins'
heart and character.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe people with a good foundation who stray will revert
to the strong foundation if given the chance,'' Accorsi said last
week.
</P>
<P>
   But how did the Giants get past the notion that Collins quit on
the Panthers?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to stick my nose in Carolina's business,''
Accorsi said. ``But I believe in case history, and when you look at
what he's done from 14 years old on, you're not going to tell me
he's not a competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins is the backup quarterback to Kent Graham on the Giants,
which has helped him regain his professional footing largely out of
the spotlight. He works out weekdays at Giants Stadium and has
begun spending his weekends in Lebanon, where both of his parents
still live. Home has never seemed closer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love hopping in that car and being home in about two
hours,'' he said. ``It's the most exciting thing in my life right
now. I'm getting back to being a son to my mother, and that's a
bond you can't replace with all the money and fame in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom gave me time. It took me a while, but I realize she
knew I'd have to reach a certain point before we could get back
together. We're rebuilding the relationship in stages.''
</P>
<P>
   Estranged from his father for much of his time in Carolina,
Collins is rebuilding their relationship, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wouldn't speak for a year at a time,'' he said. ``It was my
doing. But we're OK now. I don't blame my father for anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knew my only chance at college was probably a football
scholarship and he was trying to give me the best opportunity. My
Mom and Dad were loving parents, doing the best they could.''
</P>
<P>
   Seated in a New Jersey restaurant, more than two hours into
examining the vicissitudes of his life, Collins was asked what he
thinks of it all now, and was it worth it, the move, transferring
schools, losing touch with his family?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, that's the question, isn't it?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He paused for several seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he finally answered. ``But you have to get past all that
and say that's the way it was. Where am I now?''
</P>
<P>
   Collins smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Football is fun again,'' he said. ``I'm 26. My relationships
with my family are better. I've got as good an opportunity as you
can get in life.''

KNICKS ELIMINATE HEAT ON HOUSTON'S JUMPER IN LAST SECOND 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ There was the deafening noise, and still Alonzo
Mourning's baritone voice was able to cut through a vibrating Miami
Arena, as he cried out: ``One stop. One stop.'' One surreal instant
later, Allan Houston put down a forceful dribble, curled around Dan
Majerle as tightly as a stripe on a candy cane and discovered a
shaft of light.
</P>
<P>
   With a clear view of the basket, Houston planted a foot on the
free-throw line, tilted forward and tossed destiny up in the air.
As his 10-foot jumper licked the front of the rim, bounced up and
hung as if filled with helium, there dangled Jeff Van Gundy's job
as the Knicks' head coach, Patrick Ewing's future and the path of
the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Then, gravity brought down the Heat, and devastated coach Pat
Riley as Houston's shot touched the backboard and then fell softly
into the net with just eight-tenths of a second left. The lead,
Game 5, and another dramatic series with their loathed rival
belonged to the Knicks in an unfathomable 78-77 victory that
eliminated the Heat for the second time in three years. The Knicks
advanced to the second round of the playoffs and will play either
Detroit or Atlanta in a best-of-7-game series to begin Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about me,'' Van Gundy said. ``I didn't do anything
today. I just rode these guys. It says a lot about the character of
this team that they stuck with me. I'm thankful for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, it seemed fitting that it was one of Van Gundy's core
supporters, Houston, who shrugged off his flat start to this game
and delivered the game-winning shot that propped up a Knicks team
teetering on extinction.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can only put so much into a shot,'' said Houston, who made
just one of his first seven shots in the game but was 2 for 3 in
the fourth period. `'If we didn't get the bounce, we'd be talking
about something totally different right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the floor was open for a discussion about a Knicks team
that would not die, about a former outcast finding his niche among
the tenacious, and about an aging center standing up to his
Georgetown apprentice, Mourning, and beating pain.
</P>
<P>
   `` Mr. Breaks Down,'' Van Gundy said with a smile, referring to
Patrick Ewing. ``Amazing, but he came through again.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Latrell Sprewell and Ewing who allowed Houston to be in
the position to win the game. After the Heat took a 3-point lead
with 58.5 seconds left, Ewing fought off Mourning, grabbed an
offensive rebound and was fouled hard. With his right side aching
from a third-quarter rib injury, with his Achilles' tendon
throbbing through the tape, Ewing coolly hit two free throws to
pull the Knicks to within one point, 77-76 with 39.7 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Then Tim Hardway, the bane of the Knicks during three straight
playoff meetings, dribbled the ball up the court and was beginning
to drive by Charlie Ward when Sprewell cleverly stuck his hand in
and poked the ball away from him with 19.9 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels bad,'' Hardaway said. ``I didn't come through,
especially at that moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Then a snapshot of the defensive intensity of this game
unfolded. Terry Porter harassed Sprewell, bumped and banged him
with his forearm and body. Sprewell tried to free himself for a
shot but Porter forced him toward the sideline. Sprewell lost the
ball, but the official ruled it went off of Porter with 4.5 seconds
left in the game. That was the prelude to the inbounds pass to
Houston and the shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like it hung for 2 minutes, not 2 seconds,'' Houston
said. ``It's the biggest shot ever for me.''
</P>
<P>
   It carried so much weight. It meant the Knicks became only the
second eighth-seeded team to beat a No. 1 seeded team. It left
Riley heartsick after another first-round exit at the hands of his
former team. It meant everything to Van Gundy's job stability.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the game, I just went in and told him, `Thanks for
staying with it,''' Van Gundy said of Houston. ``He did. He'd been
struggling. But he needed to be in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Next to him were Ewing, Sprewell, Ward and Larry Johnson. Ewing
led the team with 22 points and 11 rebounds, Sprewell added 14
points off the bench and Johnson came up with 12 points. They were
the ones entrusted with the outcome of the game. But as wrenching
as the finish was, the Knicks may have won this game in the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   They were down 21-8 and on the verge of being knocked out of
this series-deciding game early, just as they had been in Game 7
two years ago. That was a game in which Houston started out 1 for
9, a game the Heat owned from the start. This time, Childs, limping
off the bench with a thigh contusion, pushed the ball, looked for
Sprewell running down the floor and took the Knicks on a 13-0 run
to tie the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know about what has happened in the past,'' Sprewell
said. ``But this time, we wanted it. We wanted it with everything
we had. When you're out there, you can't believe you're part of a
game like this. It was draining emotionally, physically,
everything. I've never been in a situation like this.''
</P>
<P>
   He'd never seen one shot unleash so much pandemonium. As
Houston's jumper was swallowed by the net, Ewing let out a howl and
Sprewell ran in circles around the court with an elated Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just hoping one of Charlie Ward's prayers would come
true when that shot went up,'' said Childs, referring to his devout
teammate. ``I hoped that would help in go in.''
</P>
<P>
   One more divine moment later, after Porter's desperation shot
bounded off the rim at the buzzer, Houston stood on the court as he
was hugged by his teammates and embraced by destiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just feels good, well beyond that,'' Houston said. ``It's
all just so indescribable.''

REFUGEES REPORT SLAUGHTER OF CIVILIANS IN KLA REGION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to add four grafs with additional reporting, beginning: The
most recent reports ...)  (mk) 
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   SKOPJE, Macedonia _ Yugoslav forces have killed more than 100
civilians in three villages in the region that is the birthplace of
the guerrilla group fighting for Kosovo's independence, refugees
arriving in Macedonia in recent days have reported.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees, describing attacks in the Drenica region, said
that in one instance, soldiers herded as many as 60 women and
children into a house and then threw hand grenades and fired
assault rifles through its windows and doors, killing those huddled
inside. The civilians were reported to be family members of a rebel
commander, and the reports came from villagers who said they had
spoken with survivors.
</P>
<P>
   None of the reports could be independently confirmed. But human
rights investigators said initial refugee accounts suggest that
Drenica is emerging as a second area in Kosovo where particularly
ruthless attacks are being carried out.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Ward, a researcher for Human Rights Watch, said initial
reports suggest that the scale of killings in Drenica may rival
those reported to have occurred in a region along Kosovo's border
with Albania. That area is also a stronghold of the rebel group,
the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   ``The emerging picture from Drenica suggests a scale of violence
that rivals the killings on the Albanian border,'' Ward said. ``We
are extremely concerned about the fate of people still trapped
inside Drenica.''
</P>
<P>
   The refugees say that the killings occurred in April and that
the Yugoslav forces systematically emptied villages around the town
of Glogovac as part of an effort to eradicate the rebels from the
area, Ward said. After tens of thousands of villagers were herded
into Glogovac, they were forcibly expelled to Macedonia during the
first week in May, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The most brutal attack occurred in the village of Poklek in late
April, the refugees said.
</P>
<P>
   Miradije Haxhiu, 45, said her family and others in the village
tried to flee to nearby Glogovac in the early morning of April 30,
but were turned back by Yugoslav soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   That afternoon, she said, Yugoslav soldiers entered the village
and opened fire on her home and others in the village. She and her
children dove onto the floor and then hid in the basement for the
next six hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their shots hit the wall,'' she said. ``They nearly killed one
of the children.''
</P>
<P>
   When they emerged after dark, the home of Hallil Muqolli, a
local rebel commander, was burning, she said. The group made their
way to a nearby village, Vasileve, where they found a group of
women and children from Poklek.
</P>
<P>
   There, she and other villagers spoke with Lumnija Muqolli, the
daughter-in-law of the rebel commander. She said that Ms. Muqolli
told her and the others that the Yugoslav soldiers had forced 64
people, most of whom were from the rebel commander's family, into
his home. The group consisted of four men and sixty women and
children, including five infants, Ms. Haxhiu said she was told.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslavs threw hand grenades and fired assault rifles into
the house, Ms. Muqolli said. Ms. Muqolli told the other villagers
that she, her daughter and another child survived by playing dead
and then climbing out a back window before the Yugoslavs set the
house on fire. Rebel soldiers later entered the home and found the
bodies, according to Ms. Haxhiu said.
</P>
<P>
   Ward and Fred Abrahams, a second Human Rights Watch
investigator, said they had spoken to three other villagers who in
separate interviews gave similar accounts of the attack and the
killing of 60 women and children. None of the villagers personally
witnessed the attack, but Abrahams said he found the accounts
credible, given the area's history and the fact that the Kosovo
Liberation Army was active in Poklek.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pattern of abuse in Kosovo and Drenica specifically make
these allegations very credible, although still unconfirmed,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Wiping out members of rebel leaders' families is not
unprecedented in the area. In September 1998, Yugoslav forces ended
a summer offensive in the Drenica region by killing 21 members of
the Delijaj family, including eight women and five children, in the
village of Gornje Obrinje, according to Human Rights Watch. The
family had several rebel members.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent reports from refugees said that, in addition to
the attack involving about 60 people, the Yugoslav forces had
killed as many as 40 people in two nearby villages in the Drenica
region on April 16 and 17.
</P>
<P>
   Rifat Nika, 73, one of 800 refugees who arrived in Macedonia on
Sunday, said that at least 23 men and three women were killed in
Glanasela on April 16. Hyra Morina, a 29-year-old mother of three,
said she saw her husband and eight other men gunned down by
Yugoslav soldiers in Cikatovo on April 17.
</P>
<P>
   Ward said witnesses he had interviewed saw the bodies of 12 men
in Cikatovo, and that another 13 men from the village are missing
and presumed dead. Unlike Poklek, the village does not have a
history of rebel activity.
</P>
<P>
   One refugee reported another mass killing in the nearby village
of Vrbovac in late April, though it could not be confirmed. Shqipe
Nika, 20, who arrived in Macedonia Sunday, said Yugoslav soldiers
killed 26 men, including her uncle. ``They made them line up and
put their hands on a wooden fence,'' she said. ``We heard them
execute them.''

HOUSTON'S SHOT GIVES VAN GUNDY A SHOT TO STAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ When Allan Houston was playing at the University of
Tennessee, his coach and father, Wade, used to tell him to block
out everything. Half-crazed fans. Defenders trying to bait him into
a bad shot. Off-court controversy surrounding the team. Everything.
</P>
<P>
   Two things were supposed to matter in a tight game: the rim and
putting the ball inside it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned a long time ago, you can't let outside forces get
inside your head and affect how you play,'' Houston said. Then,
referring to New York Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy, he added: ``Jeff
stresses that a lot. Be it family, media or stuff going on in the
organization, you have one job. And when you're doing it, only the
other 12 players and the coaching staff matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston spoke in the visitors' locker room at Miami Arena
Sunday, pausing to reach into a cooler and grab a can of
orange-flavored Gatorade. Thirty minutes earlier, the player with
one of the prettiest shooting strokes in the game hit a
hideous-looking shot to win Game 5 _ a running jumper that bounced
off the front of the rim, off the backboard and in.
</P>
<P>
   That shot ended a 78-77 heirloom of a victory over the Miami
Heat. It resurrected a Knicks season. It made the arena dead quiet,
a wake for Pat Riley's team. And, as Houston took a sip, the
magnitude of it began to set in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty big, huh?''
</P>
<P>
   For at least another series, the son of a coach saved Jeff Van
Gundy's job.
</P>
<P>
   That thought was dismissed by Dave Checketts, the Madison Square
Garden president, after the game. But there has been no
endorsement, no guarantee, and if anyone had told you that Van
Gundy would still be the coach after a first-round exit, well,
let's just say it was not likely.
</P>
<P>
   Houston understood what long odds Van Gundy was facing Sunday.
Wade Houston, like Allan's current coach, worked hard and did his
job. But he was ultimately relieved of his duties after his son
graduated as the school's career leading scorer. It was one of the
three times in Allan's life when he learned about the heartless
side of sports and business.
</P>
<P>
   The first was when the University of Louisville, where Wade had
been a loyal assistant to Denny Crum for 13 seasons, would not
immediately release Allan from his scholarship so that he could
play for his father. When he decided to sign with the Knicks rather
than stay with the Detroit Pistons, the outpouring of criticism he
received from his former team reaffirmed the feeling that loyalty
goes only so far in sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can put so much into a shot,'' Houston said. ``Bottom
line, if we didn't get the bounce, now all of those things can be
talked about. We don't go out there thinking about Jeff's job, just
about the next round.''
</P>
<P>
   Later he added, ``Just the same, everyone knows how I feel about
Jeff.''
</P>
<P>
   Their relationship started out on a bad note, with the coach
often sitting the new starting shooting guard down in fourth
quarters of the 1996-97 season. They had numerous meetings inside
Van Gundy's office. The usual subject: Houston's confidence, or
lack thereof.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy likened it to the relationships he has had this season
with Latrell Sprewell, Kurt Thomas and Marcus Camby, new
acquisitions who were unhappy at times with their roles. ``Allan
thought John, Patrick and Charles were my guys,'' Van Gundy said,
referring to the veterans John Starks, Patrick Ewing and Charles
Oakley. ``And it was understandable.
</P>
<P>
   ``But everybody that's given me the time eventually trusts me
after a while. And I end up trusting them.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston said: ``A lot of people want to question Jeff's decision
to use people, but you have to earn some belief in him at some
point. Jeff saw in me more than I thought I ever saw in myself
sometimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston did not have the type of game to celebrate until that
shot. Harangued and bothered by a game Dan Majerle, he had made
only four of his 12 previous shots. His 12 points to go along with
four turnovers could have easily been seen as an indictment of his
ability to perform in a crucial moment _ if not for that softly
released shot that nearly touched every part of the cylinder before
going in.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Knicks' coach often says, ``Sometimes, this game
ultimately comes down to makes or misses.''
</P>
<P>
   With Van Gundy's job and his team's season on the line, the son
of Wade Houston delivered. He blocked out everything. The crowd.
His defender. And all the rumors and speculation about what's going
to happen to this flawed but fearless team after it gets done with
its wild and improbable ride through the post-season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a coach's son, you got to think about the game and
nothing else when you're taking that kind of shot,'' Houston said.
``Otherwise, you don't make the shot.''
</P>
<P>
   The shot went in. The coach stays. &QL;

E-COMMERCE REPORT: THE BUSINESS OF PAYING BILLS ONLINE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By BOB TEDESCHI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seeing opportunity in every crevice of the economy, a growing
number of Internet commerce companies now want to serve as the
bearers of bad news _ in this case, delivering bills online.
</P>
<P>
   And the idea seems to be catching on, with some of the nation's
biggest billers adopting online systems and one of the Internet's
most popular Web sites expected to offer similar billing services
by the end of the summer.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is simple. A company sends e-mail to customers,
notifying them to check a Web site for new bills. Or, alternately,
customers simply know to check the site at regular intervals. In
either case, the billing agent charges merchants a small fee while
allowing them to save the $3 or so that it typically costs to print
and mail a paper bill. Customers pay their bills online without
incurring postage or check-processing fees. And banks save on
processing costs, because there is no paper to push.
</P>
<P>
   One key to the success of this approach, analysts and executives
say, is to aggregate the billers on a single site to make bill
delivery and payment as quick and painless as possible for
consumers. Unless enough large billers are willing to move to
online billing, though, the practice appears to have little chance
of proliferating.
</P>
<P>
   Among the companies competing to bring more billers online are
the Checkfree Corporation, the industry leader so far, and
Transpoint, a joint venture of Microsoft, First Data and Citigroup.
As billing agents, Checkfree and Transpoint work with companies
like BellSouth and Consolidated Edison to deliver their bills
online and with banks to work out the online payment process.
</P>
<P>
   Transpoint and Checkfree are racing to create partnerships with
the biggest billers, such as electric utilities, credit card
companies and mortgage lenders. Checkfree's early lead in the field
comes in part from its having started sooner, in early 1997; the
company says it has signed up many of the nation's top billers,
including GTE, Chase Credit Card and MCI Worldcom.
</P>
<P>
   Both Checkfree and Transpoint are also signing partnerships with
banks, so that a customer can visit his or her own bank's Web site
and view and pay the bills of every company signed up by either
billing agent.
</P>
<P>
   Since banks have offered various types of proprietary online
bill-payment services for years, consumers can be expected to
gravitate first toward bank Web sites to view and pay their bills.
But stiff competition for the banks is on the way from portal Web
sites, the gateways to the Internet that are visited by millions of
Internet users each month. Though no portal deals have been made
public, analysts say Checkfree and Yahoo have reached an agreement
for Yahoo visitors to receive and pay the bills issued by each of
Checkfree's merchant partners. (Yahoo and Checkfree declined to
comment on the deal.)
</P>
<P>
   ``This technology is unbelievably sticky,'' Robert Sterling, a
Jupiter Communications analyst, said, using industry jargon for
features that keep viewers coming back to a particular site.
Customers who pay bills on one site will not only return out of
habit, Sterling said, but will be reluctant to learn another site's
system. With tens of billions of bills mailed in the United States
each year, at least millions of repeat site visits could be at
stake.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is potentially a King Midas technology,'' Sterling said.
</P>
<P>
   But if online bill delivery can save customers time, save
merchants and banks money and provide Web sites with guaranteed
visitors, why are fewer than 1 percent of the nation's merchants
offering the service?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a chicken-or-egg problem,'' said Lewis Levin, chief
executive of Transpoint. ``Billers have been saying that they'd do
something like this if there were billions of customers who were
dying to get their bills on the Internet. Customers say they'd love
to get their bills on the Internet if only billers would deliver
them. I think the billers have finally realized they're the
chickens and they have to invest in order to get this started.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The investment, however, is significant. It costs an average of
$150,000 to build a Web site with the technology to present bills
to customers and accept payments online, executives from Transpoint
and Checkfree said. Both companies provide the software that
enables consumers to view and pay their bills online, and they
charge merchants roughly the price of a stamp for each bill
processed.
</P>
<P>
   For AT&AMP;T, one of the nation's biggest billers, such an
investment was well worth the price, said Daniel H. Schulman,
executive vice president for consumer markets. AT&AMP;T introduced its
online billing service in March 1998, using a system designed in-
house, Schulman said. Hoping to gain broader exposure for this
service, AT&AMP;T is now negotiating to have its bills offered through
Checkfree, too.
</P>
<P>
   Schulman said the company had been aggressively promoting the
service. He would not disclose the number of customers using the
system, ``but we do well over a couple hundred million dollars in
electronic billing per year,'' which he said could save up to 60
percent of the cost of paper bills. The system, at www.att.com,
also enables customers to apply online for on-the-spot credit for
disputed long-distance charges and to learn about special pricing
plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could see if someone is making a slew of international
calls,'' Schulman said, ``and we could offer them a plan for that
when they're paying at our site.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the online billing service makes it easier
for customers to obtain a wealth of information about their
accounts _ such as the name of each person called rather than just
the phone number. In addition, customers who set up an online
billing account receive a discounted long-distance rate of 9 cents
a minute, with no monthly fee, as compared with 10 cents a minute
and a $4.95 monthly fee for AT&AMP;T's ``One Rate Plus'' calling plan.
</P>
<P>
   Banks are also offering incentives for consumers to pay their
bills online. The Union Bank of California, for example, offers
free banking and checking for a year when customers join its online
program. Analysts and executives say that creating such consumer
inducements is crucial to the success of online bill delivery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billers save money, but there aren't really enough incentives
yet for consumers,'' said Ullas Naik, senior vice president for
research at FAC Equities/First Albany, an investment banking firm.
``Only when they offer those incentives will we see a broad-based
migration.''
</P>
<P>
   Naik suggested one such incentive: ``Take a buck off each bill
if you receive and pay it online. That could save you $10 a
month.''

TRYING TO MOVE ONLINE RADIO BEYOND A NICHE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Mass.)  (js) 
 By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ Until recently, it might have been fair to
enlist the cliche ``those crazy kids'' to describe people who
listened to radio on the Internet. But a series of announcements
last week signals that the demographic profile of online listeners
is expanding beyond 20-somethings to include the corporate set.
</P>
<P>
   Last Monday, Yahoo started a Web radio service called Yahoo
Radio (http://radio.yahoo.com/), comprising 10 audio channels that
visitors can listen to using software called the Realplayer G2 from
Real Networks. The audio programming for Yahoo's service is
provided by Spinner.com, a San Francisco company that announced
plans last week to go public in September. Separately last week,
Looksmart, another search engine, announced plans to produce an
online talk show devoted to Internet topics.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes, these deals underscore the growth of a
multilayered industry with players convinced that the PC will be
the radio tuner for the next generation. The entrepreneurs driving
the convergence of radio and the Internet say that listeners will
flock to specialized audio programming delivered over the PC,
sponsored by advertising aimed at individual listeners. But the
emergence of the technology poses a question for the industry: Is
the business proposition sound, or is it more white noise about the
Internet?
</P>
<P>
   Spinner.com illustrates one example of the type of business
model these companies are relying upon. The company, founded in
1996 as TheDJ.com, offers 175,000 songs on 120 channels; the fare
includes punk, funk, gospel, gumbo, surf and swing. Visitors to the
site download a player called Spinner Plus, which enables them to
listen to the channels.
</P>
<P>
   Like traditional radio stations, Spinner.com and its competitors
license the songs at a per-play fee from music industry groups like
the American Society of Composers, Artists and Performers.
</P>
<P>
   Spinner.com makes its money by several means: displaying banner
ads on the site; embedding audio commercials within the programming
_ 90 seconds each hour _ and by taking a cut of transactions when
visitors buy music at the site.
</P>
<P>
   The company also displays banner ads on the audio player, but
because listeners can minimize the image of the player, they might
not see those commercials, the company acknowledges. Still, Josh M.
Felser, president of Spinner.com, said that the site's traffic was
growing 25 percent a month and that Spinner.com had 1.3 million
unique listeners last month.
</P>
<P>
   People who register to use the site's audio player must divulge
their sex, age and some musical interests, allowing the company to
give highly targeted information to advertisers. ``We do what radio
does, only better,'' Felser said. ``It's going to take time for ad
buyers to wake up to our capabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment and the Spinner.com business model are copied by
several competitors, including Rolling Stone Radio, a partnership
between the online music hub Tunes.com and Real Networks.
</P>
<P>
   Another competitor, Imagine Radio, which was acquired in
February by the MTV Networks unit of Viacom, creates individually
customized radio stations. Visitors to the site can choose the
genre of music they want to hear and indicate which artists they
would like to hear more or less often.
</P>
<P>
   These Internet companies are vying for consumer attention with
some 1,600 traditional radio stations that have made their
programming available over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Verdino, vice president of Arbitron New Media, which
studies radio listening patterns, said more than 3,500 radio
stations were still not online. But he said they had better start
thinking about it, citing studies showing that people who listen to
radio on the Net listen to less radio on traditional stations.
``It's potentially'' a threat, he said. ``It's also potentially an
opportunity.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A study released in April by Arbitron New Media found the
portion of Internet users who had listened to radio online more
than doubled in the previous six months to 13 percent from 6
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be huge,'' said Rotem Perelmuter, former chief
executive of Imagine Radio and now vice president for strategy at
MTV, referring to online-only radio content. ``The operating
profits from radio are $6 billion,'' he said. ``We're going to take
a big chunk of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is so optimistic, at least in the short term. Some
industry analysts say that despite the recent growth, most radio
listeners will not regularly turn to their PCs for listening.
Skeptics point out that the audiences even for the most popular
online radio hubs remain in the low tens of thousands of visitors
daily.
</P>
<P>
   ``A radio advertising executive is going to look at that traffic
and go, `Come on, I can't sell advertising on that,' '' said Mark
Hardie, a senior analyst with Forrester Research in Cambridge,
Mass. Hardie thinks online radio will remain a niche market.
</P>

   Patrick H. Keane, an analyst for Jupiter Communications, a
market research firm in New York, is less pessimistic. Keane said a
new category of at-work radio listener was emerging. He said he
thought there was a growing market for online audio programmers to
reach into offices where employees may listen while they work.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're definitely looking at a niche audience, but I'm firmly
convinced it's going to grow,'' Keane said.

 &HT;    Boone's 2 homers spark Braves' resurgence
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Bret Boone kept pounding away, and the Braves lineup
eventually followed his lead Sunday and broke out of its catatonic
state.
</P>
<P>
   Helped by a left-field-bound breeze at Wrigley Field, the Braves
hit four home runs, two by Boone. His first helped them take their
first lead in a game since Tuesday, and the second started a
three-run eighth-inning rally that brought the Braves an 8-5
victory against the Cubs and a little peace of mind at the end of a
3-6 trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first one, I smoked,'' said Boone, who was 3-for-5 with a
double, two runs scored and three batted in. ``The second one, the
wind helped it. I hit it 350 feet, it went 380 feet. I'll take
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 5-3 after seven effective innings by Cubs rookie Kyle
Farnsworth, of Roswell, Ga., the Braves got their first taste this
series of a Cubs bullpen that has blown eight of 17 save
opportunities. They feasted on Rodney Myers for three consecutive
hits, including home runs by Boone and Brian Jordan, to take back
the lead, 6-5. They got two more runs off Rod Beck in the ninth to
seal the victory.
</P>
<P>
   The rally salvaged an uncharacteristically ineffective start by
John Smoltz. The five runs he allowed in six innings were the most
he has given up in 16 starts, dating to Aug. 9, and his earned run
average climbed to 2.59, the first time this season it has gone
above 2.00.
</P>
<P>
   The two home runs he allowed _ Mark Grace's with the bases empty
in the fourth inning and Tyler Houston's with a runner on base
during a four-run sixth _ equaled the number he had given up in
seven previous starts this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``As off-kilter as I felt, I didn't feel like I'd give up five
runs,'' Smoltz said. ``Those two (home runs) were fly balls, but
that's what you get when you play in this park. We took advantage
of it too. We needed a win like this.''

DODGERS PITCHING HITS ROCKY ROAD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ There are no lazy Sunday afternoons in May, not with
Mark McGwire at the plate and the Dodgers playing reliever's
roulette.
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh inning of the Dodgers' 5-4 loss to the St. Louis
Cardinals, McGwire nearly won it with a home run that hooked just
foul. In the ninth, he was walked only to let Ray Lankford hit a
two-run homer off closer Jeff Shaw that sent the Dodgers home
wondering about their pitching staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``The book on him is you don't let him beat you,'' Shaw said of
McGwire, whose record 70 homers last year weighs a lot more than
his 2 for 19 against the Dodgers this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there is a reason they have Lankford behind him. The guy
is a hitter, too. I didn't do my job.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw entered the game eight for eight in save situations, but
this was not a day for perfection.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Osuna relieved starter Ismael Valdes with one out in the
sixth and hit a batter to load the bases before pitching out of
trouble. Alan Mills came in for the seventh and appeared to give up
a two-run homer to McGwire, but the ball sailed a few feet foul.
</P>
<P>
   ``It definitely was gone,'' Dodgers catcher Paul LoDuca said.
``But it hooked at the end and we still had a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Mills struck out McGwire but walked Lankford and Fernando Tatis
to load the bases. He retired former Baltimore teammate Eric Davis
to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting Eric could be a turning point for me,'' said Mills,
who has struggled since giving up a game-winning grand slam to
Florida's Bruce Aven 10 days ago. ``You just have to go out there
and give it everything you have.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Davey Johnson isn't worried about that as much as he is
his starters. He looked pretty drained in the clubhouse after
watching the team blow 4-1 leads in the last two games.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers open a six-game homestand Tuesday, against NL
Central-leading Houston, with their most ineffective starter,
Carlos Perez (1-4, 6.23 ERA).
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was hoping to leave St. Louis in first place in the
National League West and start putting a little distance between
the Dodgers and the rest of the division. But will he have the arms
to survive the long hot summer?
</P>
<P>
   ``Your starters have to go longer than 51/3 innings,'' Johnson
said after watching Chan Ho Park and Valdes get chased in the sixth
inning the last two games. ``That sets up everything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Valdes led 4-1 after two innings, 4-2 after three and was ahead
in the sixth when Lankford hit his first homer, an opposite-field
shot that landed into the Dodgers bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes, who has suffered from blisters on his throwing hand
throughout his career, was pitching with a split nail on his right
hand. He had endured a sprained left ankle running the bases in the
second but stayed in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't have his good stuff today. And when he started to
get the ball up in the sixth, it was time for a change,'' Johnson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals manager Tony La Russa should be so lucky. He entered
this series with his starters having failed to pitch six innings in
six of the last nine games. Sunday, he turned to his closer, Juan
Acevedo, to start against the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Acevedo pitched only two innings and allowed five hits and four
runs. Three came in the second inning on RBI by Valdes, Jose
Vizcaino and Todd Hollandsworth.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the Dodgers, the St. Louis bullpen did not fall
apart. Four Cardinals relievers allowed four hits and no runs over
the final seven innings. This is a group that is groping, entering
games too early with a 4.92 ERA as a result.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today was a tough game all around,'' Shaw said. ``We struggled
and I didn't do my job. But that is a life of a reliever. There's
always tomorrow.''

 &HT;    BRAVES NOTEBOOK: Jordan homers without trying
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Brian Jordan knew when he left San Francisco that he'd
have to quit swinging for home runs, even though he was the cleanup
hitter and the team was slumping.
</P>
<P>
   He figured that would get him back into his game _ driving in
runs with singles and doubles and using the occasional home run to
clean the bases.
</P>
<P>
   His patience was rewarded with a two-run home run to center in
the eighth inning Sunday, which gave the Braves the tying and
go-ahead runs in an 8-5 victory against the Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan was only 6-for-29 on this trip entering Sunday's game,
and after going 0-for-3 on Saturday his average had dipped to .294.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the team started slumping a little bit, instead of
playing within yourself, you try to carry the team on your
shoulders,'' Jordan said. ``I was overswinging, trying to hit home
runs. I'm not a home run hitter. My dad reminded me of that. I
should know better.'' Roster watch
</P>
<P>
   Manager Bobby Cox replaced a slumping Otis Nixon (.181 batting
average) in Sunday's lineup with Gerald Williams, and the move paid
off with a 1-for-3 day from Williams, who also scored a run, drove
in a run and stole a base.
</P>
<P>
   Williams normally starts and bats leadoff against left-handers,
but against right-hander Kyle Farnsworth he batted in the No. 8
slot. Walt Weiss led off for the first time this season and reached
base twice in five plate appearances, with a walk and a single,
drove in a run and scored one.
</P>
<P>
   First baseman Randall Simon is expected to rejoin the Braves
today from AAA Richmond, and catcher Pascual Matos will return
there. Matos was up to back up Eddie Perez while Javy Lopez was in
Puerto Rico after his mother died.
</P>
<P>
   Reliever John Hudek is unavailable for a day or two because of a
blister on his third finger, which burst during his inning on
Friday. Adjusting the rotation
</P>
<P>
   Cox originally wanted to pitch Odalis Perez today and Kevin
Millwood on Tuesday to get Perez back on the mound on five days'
rest, but he decided to go with Millwood on his regular four days'
rest and push Perez back a day.
</P>
<P>
   Perez has struggled in the two starts he's made with long rest _
of 12 and nine days _ but will have his next three starts with
somewhat regular rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will be more comfortable,'' Perez said. ``It's hard when you
don't see a hitter for 10 days. The next three starts I'll pitch
regular, and it will be much better for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez gave up a season-high seven runs in his previous outing
against the Giants, including six in the first inning, and his ERA
climbed to 5.46.

CASEY JACOBSEN LEARNED LESSONS WELL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ If you ask Casey Jacobsen where he learned
the importance of working hard without the ball, or where he
learned the necessity of having an inside game to go with an
outside game, or where he learned that the mind really does matter,
he'll point to the back seat.
</P>
<P>
   It's there that little Casey Jacobsen sat on the way home from
hundreds of basketball games of his older brothers, Adam and Brock,
and listened as they talked with their father, Von, about what went
right, what went wrong and what they would do better next time.
</P>
<P>
   It was basketball by osmosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being in the car rides home while my dad analyzed the game, I
must have soaked things in that I didn't even know,'' Jacobsen
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I experienced two pretty good basketball players first hand.
They made mistakes and had some victories and I jotted all that
down in my mind why do they win, why do they lose? My brothers gave
me a mental advantage over everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, these days Jacobsen needn't worry about taking a back
seat to anyone.
</P>
<P>
   He recently concluded his career at Glendora High as the CIF
Southern Section's all-time leading scorer, and nobody in the
nation has had a more eye-catching postseason. His performances
this year have helped Jacobsen become the leading vote-getter in
the 23rd annual
</P>
<P>
   Press-Telegram Best in the West poll.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobsen, a 6-foot-6, 205-pound swingman, received 280 points
from college coaches and scouts, outdistancing the other unanimous
first-team selections, Artesia forward Jason Kapono (255) and
Juneau, Alaska, forward Carlos Boozer (245).
</P>
<P>
   THE TOTAL PACKAGE
</P>
<P>
   Jacobsen is just as well regarded off the court.
</P>
<P>
   He's a thoughtful, articulate young man speaker
</P>
<P>
   who was the guest speaker at the Glendora Little League's
opening-day ceremonies, and last Sunday addressed his church on
Mother's Day. He carries a 3.9 grade-point average, has scored 1040
on the SAT and has accepted a scholarship to Stanford in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Casey there's an understanding that there's more to
school than just playing basketball,'' said Mike LeDuc, who has
also coached NBA journeyman Tracy Murray, his brother Cameron and
Adam Jacobsen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've become a society that looks for players instead
of one that looks for great kids and great student athletes.
There's nothing you can say about the boy except that you'd like to
have him as your own son. He's just a classy young man.''
</P>
<P>
   Von Jacobsen has raised his four sons Adam, 24; Brock, 22;
Casey, 18; and Derek, 12; as a preacher might. But instead of the
good book, he's put a basketball in their hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gotten in their blood real early,'' said his wife, Becky.
``Some like it more than others, but they all really like the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   THE FAMILY TREES
</P>
<P>
   Von, who played at San Diego State and in Europe, knocked down
citrus trees to build a regulation half-court in his backyard,
replete with lights, a regulation college 3-point line and
break-away rims.
</P>
<P>
   He later leased out the family's home in Glendora and moved them
20 miles west to La Crescenta so that Adam, in his senior year in
high school, wouldn't have to play a subordinate role to Cameron
Murray, who would go on to play at USC and Louisville.
</P>
<P>
   The end game was to garner a free education for his sons, and on
that account the Jacobsens are three for three.
</P>
<P>
   Adam played with Clippers center Michael Olowokandi at Pacific,
where he earned a Master's degree and was recently hired as an
assistant coach. Brock, meanwhile, played at the University of San
Diego, where he'll graduate with a business degree next weekend and
then begin working for Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   That Casey is expected to surpass them is no surprise to his
older brothers.
</P>
<P>
   They came home from school three summers ago to find that they
were suddenly getting schooled by the scrawny 15-year-old kid they
used to pick on.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first it was pretty hard when your younger brother is
kicking the crap out of you,'' said Adam. ``He didn't beat us every
single time like he can now, but it really opened both of our eyes
as to the development that he'd gone through and the potential that
was there. We realized he was going to be very, very good and be
one of the best players in the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobsen, as one might expect of such a prolific scorer, is as
polished an offensive player as you'll find in high school. He's an
excellent perimeter player he made 92 3-pointers his senior season
and is equally adept at beating defenders off the dribble.
</P>
<P>
   Yet what distinguishes him among the elite isn't his skill but
his psyche.
</P>
<P>
   ``What sets Casey apart from most players around the country is
his toughness,'' said Joel Francisco, who runs So. Cal's Finest
Scouting Service. ``He wants to tear your hat off he wants to
compete. A lot of the top players I've seen are dogs. They kind of
coast until the competition gets better. With Casey, it doesn't
matter who's out there, he's out for blood. He wants to dominate
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you watch players you can usually point to a specific
game where they make an impression. Casey's the same every time. He
might be the most consistent player in Southern California. He's so
mentally tough. A lot of the top kids kind of float, and that's
what is going to set him apart among the top freshman. I think he's
going to be among the top five in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Determination didn't just arrive at the door one day. It came
long before his jump shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even when he was 12 and I was 18, he thought he should be able
to beat me,'' Adam said. ``We're all pretty competitive whether
it's at the dinner table, in the back yard or in school with
grades. It's something that becomes part of you.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing that I think makes Casey different from the rest
of us is he's a little stubborn. He doesn't take no for an answer
and doesn't see things other people's way. He's going to do
whatever he thinks he has to do to be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   This has resulted in a clinical approach to the game. Each time
a roadblock is presented, Jacobsen examines it, analyzes it and
finds his way around it.
</P>
<P>
   After he distinguished himself as a freshman he scored 30 points
in the state playoffs against eventual champion Crenshaw Jacobsen
began seeing defenses geared to stop him the next summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first started seeing a box-and-one defense I was
getting shut down. I wouldn't even get double digits,'' said
Jacobsen. ``I thought, `No way am I going through my career like
this.' I worked on being able to catch and shoot very quickly. Then
I learned to develop my ball-handling skills and to shoot deeper.
Even the best defenders can't take away everything.''
</P>
<P>
   He's evolved into a player who can score consistently off the
dribble and this year he's learned to be even more relentless in
working without the ball, as opponents increasingly clutched,
grabbed and sometimes succeeded in wearing him down.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to see why teams would go to such extreme measures.
Jacobsen, as a junior, averaged 45 points per game in the playoffs
as Glendora won the CIF Southern Section Division I-A title. In one
game he made 11 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   This season at the Martin Luther King Classic a day-long series
of games at UCLA's Pauley Pavilion he scored an event-record 43
points against Capistrano Valley.
</P>
<P>
   His senior season came to a disappointing end when Glendora was
beaten by Mater Dei for the Division I title and eliminated in the
second round of the state playoffs by Artesia and Kapono.
</P>
<P>
   SEEING THE WORLD
</P>
<P>
   When Jacobsen has stepped out of his Glendora uniform and onto
the national and international scene, he has acquitted himself just
as well.
</P>
<P>
   He captained the United States to the gold medal last summer at
the World Youth Games at Moscow as the Americans beat Russia in
overtime in the title game.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobsen counts the experience as the highlight of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had conflicts on the team and as the captain I was always
in the middle of it,'' said Jacobsen, who led the U.S. with 25
points per game. ``We had some characters who didn't get along and
I was very involved in trying to get everybody involved. All the
odds were stacked against us. We hadn't played with each other
before. We all really wanted to win the gold medal, we just didn't
know how to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somehow along the way I still don't know how we all came
together. To represent your country rather than your high school or
your city is quite an amazing experience. You don't know what it's
like until you put on the jersey. Just to see the American flag up
there after we won the gold medal was pretty overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   To play in Moscow, Jacobsen passed up the Nike Camp, one of the
showcase summer events where reputations are cemented. Hence, out
of sight, out of mind, Jacobsen was not among the 20 players
selected for last month's McDonald's All-American Game the
nationally televised showcase for the nation's top high school
seniors.
</P>
<P>
   After some late lobbying, he was added as the game's 21st player
and justified his selection by scoring 22 points.
</P>
<P>
   The next week, at the nationally televised Hoop Summit, he
scored 31 points, including 6 of 8 3-pointers, to lead the U.S.
Junior Select team over an international all-star team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd never played with a group so talented before in my life
and I could hold my own,'' Jacobsen said of the McDonald's game.
``It was a humbling experience that I could play with the best. I
think anybody who was at that game would say that. There wasn't one
guy that you'd say, `This guy doesn't belong here.' It was a big
confidence builder. I learned I can do whatever I want to do as far
as basketball is concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, it seems, Casey Jacobsen is in the driver's seat.

JASON KAPONO CREATED HIS OWN LEGACY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LOUIS JOHNSON  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LONG BEACH, Calif. _ Jason Kapono didn't expect to be linked to
Ed O'Bannon when the basketball standout decided to attend Artesia
High. But like O'Bannon, Kapono won a CIF title, was named a
McDonald's and Parade All-American, and rewrote the school record
book during his tenure at the school.
</P>
<P>
   Kapono and O'Bannon have another achievement in common: a
perfect score in the Best in the West basketball poll.
</P>
<P>
   Kapono joins O'Bannon as the only players from the same school
to be unanimous selections, and gives the Pioneers program five
first-team selections overall.
</P>
<P>
   During Kapono's freshman and sophomore seasons at Artesia,
O'Bannon and several other former Artesia stars would return to the
school in the summer to work out and share their experiences with
the current players. It was a moment not lost on Kapono, who was
well aware of the numerous accomplishments by O'Bannon on the
court.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would tell me to keep working and playing hard, and you had
to respect that because he was the college Player of the Year and
had made a name for himself,'' Kapono said. ``I had heard about him
being the best player in high school back (in 1990). I actually saw
his highlight tape, and it looked pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   While Kapono never led the Pioneers to state titles like Ed and
sibling Charles O'Bannon did, he most certainly has created his own
legacy within the Pioneers program, according to Coach Wayne
Merino.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each one of those guys is a different individual, but they're
all very talented,'' Merino said. ``Most coaches are lucky if
they've had one guy at that level and I've had three or four. But
Jason's left his own mark and his own level of excellence (on) our
program, as have the others before him.''
</P>
<P>
   Artesia went 119-14 during Kapono's four-year career, and the
player holds all of the school's major statistical records,
including the scoring mark with 2,678 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Pioneers won their second consecutive CIF Southern Section
Division I-AA crown this season, and came within a game of playing
for the Division I state title.
</P>
<P>
   Not a bad legacy for a player who just wanted to make the
varsity team as a freshman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to fit in and play a little when I started
out,'' Kapono said. ``I didn't think I had a chance to get a
college scholarship or anything like that. But as each year went
on, Coach Merino started telling me I had a great shot at getting
one, and that fired me up.''
</P>
<P>
   His performances this season including a game in which he had 52
points, 18 rebounds and nine assists in only 24 minutes combined
with a 3.9 GPA and 1,120 SAT score are more than enough to have
fired up the college basketball coaching community. After putting
together a list of schools he was considering at the beginning of
his senior season, Kapono has a new one that includes Missouri,
Utah, UCLA and Arizona. He has tentatively planned to announce his
collegiate choice on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Making a decision) is a little tougher now because it's so
late in the game and I've been going through some family problems
with my grandpa,'' said Kapono of his grandfather, Joe Kapono II,
who is one of his biggest fans. The elder Kapono desperately needs
a liver transplant. He has found a matching donor, but must first
pass a battery of tests to determine if his heart is strong enough
for the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   While his grandfather's health will carry some weight on his
decision, Kapono said it won't be the determining factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wouldn't mind if I left home to go to college,'' Jason
said. ``My grandfather wants what's best for me, and I'm sure he
wouldn't be disappointed just because I left (the area) and he
couldn't see me play.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most high school basketball players, Kapono has dreams of
one day casting jump shots in the NBA. But he's also intelligent
enough to realize that basketball isn't a lifetime job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basketball is only going to be with me for so many years,'' he
said. ``I may have to stop playing after college because I'm not
good enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, I want to make it to the pros, but even that ends at
(the age of) 35. So I'm going to make sure I take care of business
in the classroom, because I know that life goes on.''

SPORTS COLUMN: A BANGED-UP EWING WON'T TAKE BACK SEAT
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Alonzo Mourning turned to face Patrick Ewing, with the
ball, to the left of the basket, a one-point lead set up perfectly
to become three. One on one, friend on friend, student against
teacher. There was a minute and a half left in Game 5 Sunday, the
Knicks and the Heat, survival at stake, and here was Mourning's
chance to emphatically state that his time had come and Ewing's had
passed.
</P>
<P>
   Mourning, brutish and quick-footed, against Ewing, 36 and banged
up. Pat Riley had called this play, the one that should have been
Miami's ticket to the second round.
</P>
<P>
   The low post was where the Heat could supposedly punish the
Knicks, where Mourning could school his lame fellow Georgetown
alum. Ewing could not move laterally, remember? His injured left
Achilles' tendon had rendered him immobile, a relic in need of
grease and oil.
</P>
<P>
   Now Ewing, foot aching, knees creaking, hip muscle piercing,
found himself in the last place he wanted to be, positioned where
Mourning had only moments before blown past him, into the lane, for
a jump hook and that one-point Miami lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could see Alonzo giving Patrick every move, trying to get
to the middle, and Patrick trying to force him baseline,'' said
Chris Dudley, the Knicks' backup center, who makes a living with
post defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the end of the game,'' Dudley said, ``and your emotions
and the adrenaline overcome a lot of things.''
</P>
<P>
   This was not quite the end, but Ewing's defense resulted in a
24-second violation for Miami when Mourning gave up the ball and
Terry Porter failed to get off a shot. It was a symbolic conflict,
a prescient moment, of a friendly bounce to come for Allan Houston,
of a stunning 78-77 victory for Ewing's team over Mourning's.
</P>
<P>
   The body language of the big men on that one play was a
microcosm of the game, if not the series. The younger center,
promoted by even Ewing as the league's most valuable player, still
doesn't have a classic go-to move. He was not up to the task of
taking a first-round series when it was waiting for him, a quick
first step away.
</P>
<P>
   He couldn't get around the old man, to the lane or the second
round.
</P>
<P>
   ``He let the young fellow know he wasn't getting to the
basket,'' said Herb Williams, from the locker stall next to Ewing.
``He did that on one leg.''
</P>
<P>
   On one leg, in obvious pain, Ewing outscored Mourning, 22-21,
and outrebounded him, 11-5. If anyone deserved the friendly bounce
on Houston's runner off the inbounds pass by Charlie Ward with 0.8
seconds left, it was him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the playoffs,'' Ewing said, ``and we've lost a lot of
games on last-second shots. It was sweet for it to be reversed.''
</P>
<P>
   There are times when the game's winning shot should not be its
lasting memory, and this was one of those games. Ewing, often
defined by the shots he has not made, carried the Knicks to the
threshold of victory, first against Mourning and then by dragging
his brittle bones to the basket at the other end, after two free
throws by Porter had given the Heat a 77-74 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Latrell Sprewell backed Porter into the lane, and Mourning
jumped out to help. The shot bounced off the rim, to Ewing on the
right side. He was fouled by Mourning on the put-back. Ewing walked
to the line, where he has disappointed people so many times before,
and made two shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest play of the game,'' Riley said, though he later
admitted he would have a sleepless night or two recalling Mourning
and Ewing on the left side, the floor balanced, set up as if the
players were those little men on the magnetic board.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patrick's who he is,'' Riley said, not bothering to say more.
</P>
<P>
   The past failures are still there, and there are still clouds in
the Knicks' long-range forecast. This was not about the last 13
years or coming ones, though. It was not about Ewing's headstrong,
even foolish, insistence that he won't play for Phil Jackson any
more than it was about saving Jeff Van Gundy's job.
</P>
<P>
   This was about Ewing being just as stubborn about stepping aside
for the next generation, much in the way Utah's John Stockton and
Karl Malone held their ground against the Sacramento Kings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bittersweet,'' Ewing called the victory, referring to his
friendship with Mourning, taken out in the first round by the
Knicks for a second straight year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where's your boy?'' Williams teased Ewing in the locker room.
``Probably home by now.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Mourning was up in the interview room, sounding much
like Ewing in post-season defeat, insisting the Heat were the
better team.
</P>
<P>
   Williams looked down at a seated Ewing, and said, ``You let him
know you're still in the house.''
</P>
<P>
   Ewing smiled. He sat there with his left foot in an ice bucket,
with packs on his knees, on his hip and on last season's broken
right wrist. He was still in the house, refusing to move. The proud
man plays on.

THE NEW PAUL ALLEN 
REAL NETWORKS TRIES TO DODGE A BULLET
</HEADLINE>
   (mk) 
 By LAURIE J. FLYNN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hey _ didn't that used to be Paul Allen?
</P>
<P>
   Techies who are also professional basketball fans may have
noticed that Allen, a co-founder of Microsoft who owns the Portland
Trail Blazers, looks a lot more dapper these days as he takes his
accustomed seat courtside at Trail Blazers games.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing on television frequently as the Trail Blazers are
having their best season in years, the 45-year-old billionaire
looks much more like a high-technology investor than the
guitar-playing, hacker geek that many recall. Gone are the rumpled
sport shirts and the beard, replaced by clean-shaven cheeks and
well-cut suits.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of Allen's Vulcan Ventures investment firm,
which is based in Seattle, declined to discuss his makeover, though
one employee estimated that it began two years ago. That would be
around the time that Allen was said to be dating the tennis star
Monica Seles.
</P>
<P>
   But the spotlight is shining even more brightly on him in the
current National Basketball Association playoff season. Last week,
his team swept the Phoenix Suns in three games to advance to the
next round _ the first time the Trail Blazers have won a playoff
series since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Curious techies and sports fans alike can get more details about
Allen at the Paul Allen Web site (www.paulallen.com). There, one
can read about his interest in music education and philanthropy,
his numerous telecommunications investments and his teams (he also
owns the Seattle Seahawks football team) _ and learn that one of
his favorite movies is ``La Dolce Vita.''

<P>
   Lessons in Not Blocking the Ads That Feed You
</P>
<P>
   Real Networks is trying to dodge a bullet, one that is headed
straight for its own foot.
</P>
<P>
   The software company, which is based in Seattle, produces
so-called streaming media technology that can be downloaded free
from the Web and enables personal computers to receive live audio
and video feeds on the Web. But Real Networks has also been selling
another company's program, called At Guard, that enables PC users
to block out Internet advertising. And that doesn't sit well with
Real Networks' paying customers _ operators of Web sites that
employ Real Networks technology and that in many cases depend on
advertising for their revenue.
</P>
<P>
   After Real Networks sent e-mail a few weeks ago to tens of
thousands of people offering At Guard for half the usual $29.99
price, some Web developers fired off e-mail of their own to Real
Networks and engaged in heated debates on industry bulletin boards.
Some have threatened boycotts or even defections to other brands of
streaming media, like Apple's or Microsoft's.
</P>
<P>
   Real Networks got the message. Last week, the company decided it
would stop selling At Guard altogether after June 15, Steve
Haworth, a spokesman, said.
</P>
<P>
   Ad-blocking software like At Guard is intended to speed Web
viewing by stopping graphics-laden ads from downloading to a user's
PC. But many of Real Network's customers contend that widespread
use of ad-blocking software could seriously hurt their industry.
</P>
<P>
   Web viewers need to accept advertising if they want free
programming, said Scott Mathias, managing editor at ITVWorld.com, a
producer of online programming. ``If ad blocking is freely
available,'' he said, ``how will everyone's needs be met?''
</P>
<P>
   Although ad-blocking software has been available for several
years, it has been slow to catch on.
</P>
<P>
   But Anne Marshall, a product marketing manager at WRQ, the
Indianapolis company that produces At Guard, said the Real Networks
promotion had been generating strong sales for her company.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Marshall said that regardless of what Real Networks had
decided, At Guard is a product that ``puts choice back in the hands
of Internet users.''

A NICE PIECE OF CHANGE FOR A SIMPLE GUY  
 NEW DICTIONARY DEFINES AND ADVISES  
 PULITZER PRIZE JUDGES SPEAK THEIR MINDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Individual bylines follow first two items.) 
(lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Internet is responsible for some odd things _ the ability to
monitor strangers' lives 24 hours a day comes to mind _ but last
week it created something truly weird: a wealthy magazine editor.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Kansas, 32, editor in chief of TheStreet.com, was once a
humble radio sports announcer on WKCR-FM, the radio station of
Columbia University. Later, he was a newspaper reporter, writing
about sports for Newsday, then about the stock market for The Wall
Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   While he was an undergraduate at Columbia College, he sang with
the Kingsmen, an a cappella group, and remarked about that period,
``My favorite moment was singing the national anthem and then
broadcasting it live right before a basketball game.'' In short, a
man of simple humility and earthy flair.
</P>
<P>
   But last week, TheStreet.com _ an Internet magazine that
provides financial news and analysis, and of which The New York
Times is a backer _ offered its stock to the public for the first
time.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the first day of trading, the shares rose $41, to
$60, and the 3-year-old money-losing operation suddenly had a
market value of $1.41 billion. And Kansas, who shares an apartment
with a roommate and says he has a hole in the toe of his right
loafer, was worth $9.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, James Cramer, 44, the hedge-fund manager,
financial columnist and a co-founder of TheStreet.com, saw his
stake grow to $202.6 million. In a profile in the June issue of
Vanity Fair, Cramer is reported to have looked around the room at a
wedding in the early 1980s, at which many of the guests were
journalists, and remarked, ``These are all $30,000-a-year men.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has surely proved that journalists need not all be
$30,000-a-year men, or women. And Kansas defends TheStreet.com,
even if it has not made a profit. ``We have a great product and a
good brand and popular writers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There was only one overnight change. ``Everyone expects me to
buy them dinner now,'' Kansas said. ``And of course I do, because
I'm from Minnesota.'' Which means what? ``That I'm a generous
person.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Kansas cannot have access to his wealth for six months,
he is rich only on paper. But his desires are minimal. ``The one
thing I think about is: Wouldn't it be nice to have my own place to
live? Or to buy a really nice titanium bicycle?'' He paused. ``And
maybe a bed,'' he said. ``Right now I sleep on a futon on the
floor.''

   New Dictionary Defines and Advises
</P>
<P>
   The newest version of the Random House Webster's College
Dictionary makes its debut this spring with ``New Words for the New
Millennium'' plus a reader-beware feature: warning labels for some
300 words that are flagged for odiousness.
</P>
<P>
   The editors reserved their harshest description for a racial
epithet that they called ``probably the most offensive word in
English.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Its degree of offensiveness has increased markedly in recent
years, although it has been used in a derogatory manner since at
least the Revolutionary War,'' they wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Wendalyn Nichols, the dictionary's editorial director, said she
was considering adding the usage warnings earlier this year when a
language snarl hit the rival dictionary publisher Merriam-Webster
Inc.
</P>
<P>
   In that episode, the publisher and America Online Inc. removed
an electronic version of Merriam's classic collegiate thesaurus for
revisions after complaints that a word list for ``homosexual''
included synonyms without any warning that the words were slurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``That only confirmed to me that it's not only a good idea but a
great idea'' to provide warnings, Ms. Nichols said. ``Increasingly,
people also expect a dictionary to give guidance about words that
are better avoided for fear of accidentally causing offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Random House is owned by Bertelsmann AG. The bright-red dust
jacket for its new 1,571-page dictionary promises ``more new words
than any other dictionary'' and ``clear guidance on avoiding
offensive language.''
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the word warnings appear even before the
definitions. ``Holy roller,'' for example, is first labeled: ``A
slur and must be avoided. It is perceived as insulting.'' Then
comes the definition: ``A contemptuous term used to refer to a
member of a Pentecostal sect.''
</P>
<P>
   Milder words with double meanings come with weaker alerts.
``Babe,'' for instance, is first defined as ``a baby or small
child.''
</P>
<P>
   But the dictionary adds a final note, leaving it to the reader
to decide whether to use it as a term of endearment or insult:
``sometimes used with disparaging intent and perceived as insulting
or demeaning to women'' as well as ``an affectionate term of
address used by a man or woman to a sweetheart.''

   Pulitzer Prize Judges Speak Their Minds
</P>
<P>
   Every April, the Pulitzer Prizes are announced with trumpets
blaring. But the selection process, which is run by the Graduate
School of Journalism at Columbia University, usually goes
unexamined.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest Columbia Journalism Review, the curtain is pulled
back, if only a bit. An article asks the question: What did the 77
nominating jurists _ senior journalists and academics, who pored
over entries for three days in March _ think of the process?
</P>
<P>
   Those who judged the coverage of the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal
said, among other things: ``I was so sick of that story''; ``The
stories were all about the same''; ``Even the best of the coverage
was flawed in some way.''
</P>
<P>
   Orville Schell, dean of the Graduate School of Journalism at the
University of California at Berkeley, said of the entries reviewed
by his international panel: ``Fully half to two-thirds of those 48
submissions never would have been written were there not a Pulitzer
Prize. They were complex and not read by many people, though
they're essential for a small number of people to be well informed
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Mel Opotowsky, ombudsman for The Press-Enterprise in Riverside,
Calif., described the competition in his beat reporting category as
tough: ``Of the 150 entries we had in my panel, I'd say that only
about 10 shouldn't have been there, and of the rest, 20 or 30 were
serious, serious contenders.''
</P>
<P>
   Some editors complained about the length of articles, saying
that the unwieldiness of several entries damaged their chances.
``We started calling it the spare-tire problem _ good stories that
were too fat in the middle,'' said Wendy Zomparelli, vice president
of The Roanoke Times in Virginia, who judged in the feature-writing
category.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Shales, television critic at The Washington Post, was the
most blunt: ``There is so much sameness and flatulence and
pomposity in the writing I read about film that it didn't seem to
me that any film critic this year really stood out.''

U S WEST EXPECTED TO MERGE WITH GLOBAL CROSSING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo., Bermuda)  (lb) 
 By LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Global Crossing Ltd., the telecommunications upstart that went
public only last year, is expected to announce Monday that it is
merging with U S West Inc., the smallest of the regional Bell phone
companies, in a stock swap valued at about $37 billion, people
close to the talks said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The merger would bring Global Crossing, a 2-year-old company
with headquarters in Bermuda, one step closer to taking on AT&AMP;T
Corp. and MCI Worldcom in its bid to build a global fiber-optic
telecommunications network.
</P>
<P>
   A combination with U S West, which has been largely left behind
in the recent telecommunications merger boom, would give Global
Crossing a presence in the United States as well as a platform from
which to expand into Europe, Asia and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Any combination of the two, which was expected to be announced
this week, is bound to be complicated. Global Crossing has yet to
complete its $10.8 billion acquisition of Frontier Corp., the No. 5
long-distance company, which was announced two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   More important, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 bars the
Bells from offering long-distance service within their operating
territory until they convince the Federal Communications Commission
that they have opened local phone networks to rivals.
</P>
<P>
   The Global Crossing-U S West deal is not expected to be
completed for more than a year. That could give the Bell companies
plenty of time to open their regions to competition, though there
is no guarantee that will happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of history of the Bell companies promising
things and not delivering,'' said Richard Klugman, an analyst at
Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette. Any overlap of Frontier's current
business in U S West's territory could be divested to satisfy
regulators, or Global Crossing could seek a waiver.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms being proposed, the two companies will combine
in a merger of equals, but for accounting purposes U S West, which
is based in Denver, will technically be the acquirer. The new
company, to be named Global Crossing Corp., would be incorporated
in Delaware and have its headquarters in New York. It would be
equally owned by shareholders of Global Crossing-Frontier on one
side and U S West on the other.
</P>
<P>
   U S West's board approved the deal Sunday afternoon. Global
Crossing's board met Sunday night and was expected to approve the
deal. Frontier's board also met late Sunday. As with any deal,
talks could still fall apart.
</P>
<P>
   The new Global Crossing will be made up of two separately traded
stocks: one for Frontier's and U S West's traditional telephone
assets, and the other for the combined companies' fast-growing data
and Internet properties. A chief operating officer will be named
for each of those businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Upon announcement of the merger, U S West is expected to begin a
tender offer for about 9.5 percent of Global Crossing's stock at a
price of about $62.50, people close to the talks said. When the
deal is closed, U S West shareholders are expected to receive about
1.2 shares of each of the separately traded stocks for every U S
West share they own. Global Crossing shareholders will get one
share in each of the separate stocks for every share they own.
Investors can then choose how much of each stock they want to own.
</P>
<P>
   Global Crossing's shares closed at $61.375 on Friday, while U S
West closed at $62.25.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In addition to any regulatory issues the two companies will have
to overcome, the companies will have to sort through management
issues. Global Crossing went public last year in a $399 million
initial stock offering. It is backed by its founder, the financier
Gary Winnick, who is the main architect of Global Crossing's
strategy. He is a former associate of the junk-bond financier
Michael Milken.
</P>
<P>
   But along with Winnick, Global Crossing has an executive suite
already packed with high-powered executives. Global Crossing's
chief executive is Robert Annunziata, the former founder of
Teleport Communications Group, a company acquired by AT&AMP;T last year
for about $12 billion. Annunziata worked briefly at AT&AMP;T before
joining Global Crossing and has said that he was willing to quit
AT&AMP;T only if he could run a company again.
</P>
<P>
   But in the combined company, he will have to share the
chief-executive spot with Solomon Trujillo, chairman and chief
executive of U S West. They will be advised by a board of 22
directors, 10 from U S West and 10 from Global Crossing-Frontier,
with two to be added later.
</P>
<P>
   Global Crossing was advised by Salomon Smith Barney and Chase
Manhattan Bank. U S West was advised by Merrill Lynch. Frontier was
advised by Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.

PERSEVERANCE PAYS FOR ROBERTS AT THE BYRON NELSON CLASSIC  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The first six times that Loren Roberts entered
the GTE Byron Nelson Classic, he missed the cut.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts kept coming back, however, never succumbing to the
disappointment, always believing one of his trips to Texas would
result in victory.
</P>
<P>
   That perseverance paid off for Roberts Sunday, as in his 17th
appearance at the Nelson, he found the winning formula. After
surviving several precarious moments on the back nine, Roberts
outlasted Steve Pate, who bogeyed the first hole of a sudden-death
playoff to open the door for Roberts, who made a winning par.
</P>
<P>
   Both Roberts and Pate set a tournament record, finishing at 18
under par (262), and ran away from the rest of the field. Four
players finished tied for third at 11 under par _ Lee Janzen,
19-year-old Sergio Garcia, Chris DiMarco, and Brian Watts. Garcia
earned $144,000, taking a major step toward earning a PGA Tour card
for next season.
</P>
<P>
   The sixth tour victory of Roberts' career earned him a $540,000
check, the largest of his career, and it was his first victory
since the 1997 CVS Charity Classic. Roberts shot a two-under-par 68
today, but it was his sizzling 62 on Saturday that vaulted him into
the lead at the TPC of Las Colinas. Pate shot a final-round 66. But
this time, instead of leaving the Nelson discouraged, Roberts left
with a trophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``About two months ago, I was thinking, `I'm 43 years old, maybe
I'm too old for these young guys,''' said Roberts, whose
83-year-old father, Hugh Roberts, watched from the gallery to
witness a victory by his son for the first time. ``I can't tell you
how good it feels to get back in the winner's circle. You start to
doubt yourself. It feels really good to play well under the heat.''
</P>
<P>
   The tournament ended at the par-4, 479-yard No. 18, the first
playoff hole. After their drives, both players missed the green on
their approach shots. Pate hit a 4-iron shot that was caught by the
wind and drifted right into the green-side bunker, 60 yards from
the pin. Roberts hit his approach shot into the left bunker, about
20 yards from the pin.
</P>
<P>
   After Pate pitched to 15 feet, Roberts hit a great bunker shot
that stopped 3 feet short. Pate knew that if he missed his 15-foot
putt for par, he would probably lose. He hit a firm putt, but it
slid past the hole and he tapped in for bogey. Roberts ended the
tournament by making the three-foot par putt, then raising his arms
in triumph.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second runner-up finish for Pate this year, but with
four top-10 finishes, he is enjoying a career season, having
already earned $1,334,637, fourth on the tour money list. Pate was
also the runner-up at the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic in January,
when David Duval shot a final-round 59.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played very well; unfortunately, it wasn't good enough,''
said Pate, who has recovered from a serious 1996 car accident that
forced him to take a year off the tour. ``If I hang around the lead
enough times, something good will happen. I can't really control
what Loren did, or what Duval did at Palm Springs.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting the day with a two-stroke edge over Pate, Roberts lost
the lead at No. 14 when he hit his second shot into the water and
double-bogeyed. That gave Pate a one-stroke lead, but Roberts
bounced back with a birdie at No. 15, hitting an approach shot to
within four feet, followed by a three-foot putt to tie Pate.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a pretty impressive comeback,'' Pate said of Roberts'
birdie at No. 15. ``That's not an easy hole. Hitting a 3-iron to
four feet is pretty good, especially after making a double-bogey.''
</P>
<P>
   Pate and Roberts parred the last three holes to force sudden
death, though Roberts had a chance to win in regulation at No. 18.
Pate's approach shot was short and left of the green, about 40
yards from the pin, while Roberts hit a fine second shot that
landed 20 feet below the cup.
</P>
<P>
   After Pate chipped to five feet, Roberts could have ended the
tournament by making his 20-foot birdie attempt. But Roberts' putt
stopped a foot short and Pate converted his five-foot putt to force
the playoff.

EDITORIAL: IDLE HANDS IN ALBANY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, May 17:
</P>
<P>
   The idea was that it would be a good political ploy. To rally
support for their candidate for a state Senate seat north of New
York City, several Democrats endorsed what has long been little
more than a suburban whim. They announced that they wanted the
state Legislature to end a commuter tax for suburbanites who work
in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   State Republicans, not to be outdone on what is normally a
Republican issue, quickly supported the concept, adding that the
Republican-controlled state Senate would approve legislation.
Because the governor could be expected to endorse the measure, the
Democratic Assembly with its Democratic speaker, Sheldon Silver of
New York City, was considered the fail-safe that was sure to stop
it this week.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, for a muddle of mostly political reasons, Silver
has promised that his Democratic Assembly will vote with the
Republicans. So, New York City stands to lose at least $210 million
a year in taxes from commuters who live elsewhere in New York. If
the state ends this tax on its own commuters, the commuters from
Connecticut and New Jersey, who pay an additional $150 million a
year, are sure to challenge their contribution.
</P>
<P>
   Silver argues that the city has a fat surplus and can afford the
loss. This shortsighted view does not recognize that the surplus is
probably temporary while the loss of commuter revenue would
undoubtedly be permanent.
</P>
<P>
   Silver's supporters accuse Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Gov.
George Pataki of playing pre-election games that could force
Democrats to defend this tax while Republicans, especially Giuliani
in a possible statewide race, would benefit. However, Giuliani has
spoken out vehemently against the end of the commuter tax, an
appeal that certainly cannot help him in the city's suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic speaker is also said to be mindful of Democrats
in ``marginal'' seats that are often challenged during elections.
Given that no incumbents lost in the legislative elections last
year, this would seem to be a dubious concern. Nevertheless, if
Republican state senators vote to abolish the commuter tax,
Silver's Democratic state legislators are set to do the same soon
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   This legislative battle feels like a schoolyard dare. Silver's
excuses have a particularly hollow ring for someone whose home base
is New York City. For years, New Yorkers have negotiated to keep
this crucial income as a way to help pay for services used by
commuters who often earn far more than city residents. It is not
clear what, if anything, Silver gained for the city in exchange for
this whopping loss.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this is what happens in Albany when nothing else is
happening in Albany. The state budget is stalled, the governor is
often absent and an entire state Capitol full of unpaid legislators
is idle. It is time to end the games. A very large city could get
hurt.

SUCCESS HELPS EASE JARRETT'S MIND 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By TARIK EL-BASHIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHMOND, Va. _ Dale Jarrett had been stuck in second for much
of this season. Consistently good, he had not been good enough for
victory lane. The frustration of coming so close week after week _
he had finished second three times _ was wearing at his team's
morale, and his own.
</P>
<P>
   But the frowns in his pit disappeared on Saturday night, when
Jarrett coupled another good run with some rare good luck at
Richmond International Speedway and got that elusive first victory
in the Pontiac Excitement 400. His face and body language were the
picture of relief. Todd Parrott, Jarrett's crew chief, smiled for
the first time in weeks.
</P>
<P>
   By leading the final 32 laps, and holding back the hard-charging
Mark Martin and Bobby Labonte, Jarrett drove his Ford Taurus from
second place in the Winston Cup point standing to first. And if
this season becomes Jarrett's season, Saturday will be the day it
was defined.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett's victory was worth 118 points, moving him from 55
points behind Jeff Burton to a 63-point lead. Burton dominated
Saturday's race but succumbed to a transmission problem and
finished 37th.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to take the points lead,'' Jarrett said, beaming
after the victory. ``We've fought back since the accident at
Daytona and kept battling.'' Jarrett went spinning into the wall on
Lap 135 of the Daytona 500 in a crash that took out 12 cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even on days where it seemed we might not be the best car or
we were struggling,'' he said, ``it was real important for a couple
of reasons for us to take this points lead.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett, 43, is a veteran of 13 seasons and a son of the
two-time Winston Cup champion Ned Jarrett. He has won the big races
_ the Daytona 500 (twice), the Coca-Cola 600 and the Brickyard 400
_ but he does not have a championship. He has come close, finishing
second to Jeff Gordon in 1997 and third twice, most recently in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend figured to be a challenge for Jarrett and his team,
owned by Robert Yates, because their luck had not been good lately
at Richmond International. Last year in this race, after a
controversial red flag with six laps left, he lost the lead to the
eventual winner Terry Labonte, who bumped Jarrett's car with two
laps remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Jarrett started seventh in the Exide 400 here but
finished 16th. That cost him 60 points when Gordon and Martin ran
second and third to Burton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we had a good car coming to Richmond,'' Parrott said.
``This was the same car we had last year, but we've made some
changes to it. The extra effort adds up and makes the end result so
sweet.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Just as Jarrett's season seems to be coming together, everything
seems to be falling apart around Gordon, the two-time defending
series champion. He nursed an ill-handling car all night and
finished 31st.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon's troubles began on Lap 81, when he was bumped from
behind by Steve Park. After the nudge, Gordon's car shimmied and
then slowed. As a result of the contact, the front end of his car
began to vibrate. By Lap 94, the vibration was so bad that Gordon
pitted for repairs. He lost two laps, which, in effect, ended his
chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what really ruined our night,'' said Gordon, who is in
fifth place in the point standing. ``We probably still would have
had tire problems that we would have had to deal with, but I think
we could have worked with it.''
</P>
<P>
   It was another blow to Gordon's hopes of repeating as champion.
Gordon's 250-point deficit in the point standing is by no means
insurmountable, but it will certainly be an uphill battle for him.
Gordon has three victories and three thirds this season, but he
also has four finishes of 31st or worse.
</P>
<P>
   And a struggling Gordon can mean nothing but good things for
Jarrett.

EDITORIAL: SOUTH AFRICA AFTER NELSON MANDELA 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, May 17:
</P>
<P>
   Few nations that have made a transition to democracy have
emerged with as solid a political system as South Africa's. The
five years of Nelson Mandela's presidency, which ends next month,
have seen a genuine change of political power, widespread respect
for the rule of law and none of the political revenge killings that
have marked other societies in transition.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa has many problems, such as desperate poverty and
terrifying crime. But its suffering would have been infinitely
greater absent the moral authority and democratic, inclusive spirit
that made Mandela a giant as leader of the liberation movement and
as president.
</P>
<P>
   On June 2, South Africa will hold parliamentary elections, after
which the winning party _ undoubtedly Mandela's African National
Congress _ will name the new president. That will undoubtedly be
Thabo Mbeki, Mandela's deputy president.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki has essentially been running South Africa for years, even
leading cabinet meetings. He is widely seen as sophisticated,
effective and honest. But he has weaknesses that he must overcome
if the country's healing is to continue.
</P>
<P>
   The contrast between Mbeki and Mandela is visible in their
reactions to the report the country's truth commission released six
months ago. The commission blamed the apartheid regime for the vast
majority of human rights violations and called the ANC's struggle a
``just war.'' But it criticized the ANC for some crimes. Mandela
embraced the criticism and the report. Mbeki attacked the report,
and said the truth commission had unfairly equated the ANC and
apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   The effectiveness of Mandela's moral leadership comes from his
stature. As a leader of the liberation movement who spent 27 years
in prison, he could speak for South Africa's blacks. His authority
allowed him to bully F.W. de Klerk, the last apartheid president,
into taking ANC demands seriously. He did not have to placate the
more destructive factions in the ANC.
</P>
<P>
   After the murder of the beloved Communist leader Chris Hani in
1993, Mandela's calming speeches averted widespread violence. His
conversion to market economics broke the taboo on such views inside
the ANC, which had favored nationalizations.
</P>
<P>
   Although he established and led the ANC's first guerrilla army,
in 1961, Mandela spent the racially divisive years of armed
struggle in prison. For decades, he has held that South Africa
needs all races to thrive. While Mandela has occasionally made
anti-white outbursts, his emphasis has been on reconciliation, a
policy that Mbeki, more than 20 years his junior, is not expected
to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela's stature could have harmed his country had he been
autocratic. Fortunately, he is a committed democrat. His decision
to serve only one term set a crucial precedent for transfer of
power.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki, who spent much of his life in exile as a diplomat for the
ANC, is a more knowledgeable and experienced administrator than
Mandela. But he has no power base within the party. In an effort to
win support, he has appointed some party hacks and curried favor
with some of the ANC's most dangerous demagogues, such as Winnie
Mandela. He has also used some of his speeches to the ANC to pander
to extremist race-baiting.
</P>
<P>
   This tendency may continue if South Africa's economic problems
do not improve. The country's economic policies _ largely fashioned
by Mbeki _ are unlikely to change. But the poor will undoubtedly
have less patience when Mandela steps down. Mbeki will have to
resist the temptation to exploit racial resentment as a substitute
for economic progress.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki also needs to overcome an oversensitivity to criticism and
an obsession with the press. But even his adversaries call him a
democrat, who will not tamper with the basic freedoms South
Africans enjoy, in large part thanks to Mandela.

SPORTS COLUMN: PENGUINS FACING A DOUBLE KNOCKOUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ They joke in Pittsburgh, ruefully, that the Penguins
could leave the Steel City and even exit the National Hockey League
before they are out of the current Stanley Cup playoffs. That was
never quite true, but any of the above could occur soon. Injured
and fatigued on the ice while battling bankruptcy in court, the
Penguins could be eliminated Monday night by the Toronto Maple
Leafs in Game 6 of the Eastern Conference semifinals in
Pittsburgh's Civic Arena.
</P>
<P>
   And on Wednesday, lawyers and accountants will bring arguments
and balance sheets into U.S. Bankruptcy Court to again debate the
future of the debt-ridden franchise. Should the Penguins be moved
or dissolved this spring, Monday night's game could be the last
ever for a team that began during the ``big bang'' expansion of
1967, when the NHL doubled in size from six teams to 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knows what's going to happen,'' said Jaromir Jagr, the
star right wing and captain of the Penguins who is the top scorer
in the NHL and is likely to win the Hart trophy as most valuable
player. ``These fans, and even us, we cannot control what is going
to happen after the season.'' Monday, he said, is ``going to be a
special night,'' for many reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``After we lose, I'm going to worry about it,'' Jagr said. ``But
right now, no.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not mean to predict defeat, although the mood was heavily
pessimistic here Saturday night in Air Canada Center, where the
Leafs defeated the Penguins by 4-1 to take a 3-2 lead in the
four-of-seven-game second-round series. Jagr had no goals or
assists, was on the ice for the first three Toronto goals and took
a penalty for slashing defenseman Dmitri Yushkevich, assigned to
check him. Although Jagr said he was no longer troubled by the
groin injury that kept him out of four games in the first round
against the Devils, other Penguins are ailing. Among them is
Aleksei Kovalev, Pittsburgh's second-best attacker, who missed his
second consecutive game with a bruised right foot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're missing Kovie,'' Jagr said. ``It's a big loss. We have
to switch the lines. Everyone is switching now. Nobody knows where
to play. Centers play wing. Wings play center. It's kind of
confusing for everybody. It's kind of frustrating. In playoffs,
Games 5, 6 and 7, you're so tired you don't even have enough power
to shoot.''
</P>
<P>
   Also confusing and frustrating is the ownership question. Mario
Lemieux, who led the team to cup championships in 1991 and 1992,
leads a group bidding to buy the team from Roger Marino. Lemieux is
motivated in part by a debt of more than $30 million still owed to
him by the team. The NHL recently said that another bidder, which
it declined to name, could buy the team for $85 million and move it
out of town. This escalated the war of words last week.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Tom Murphy of Pittsburgh said ``this is just a ploy'' by
the league and said the NHL is ``legally prohibited from leaving
Pittsburgh'' because of the terms of the arena lease. The NHL
requested a speedy hearing, saying that scheduling requirements for
next season constituted an emergency. James Weisman, who represents
Marino, said, ``If there is an emergency, it's one of their own
making.'' Judge Bernard Markovitz asked a league bankruptcy lawyer,
Jeffrey Levitan: ``Why did you wait so long? Why didn't you file
something back in March?''
</P>
<P>
   None of this is flattering to the image of NHL Commissioner Gary
Bettman, who came to hockey from the National Basketball
Association in 1992 with a reputation for sharp business instincts.
During Bettman's tenure, two owners have gone to jail for financial
fraud. Even with the Penguins bankrupt, the league will expand to
three more cities in the next 14 months. Some franchises change
owners as often as they change coaches. Since the 15-week labor
lockout of 1994-95, salaries and franchise prices have continued to
rise.
</P>
<P>
   Fantasy leagues can make any fan an ersatz owner, so here's a
suggestion from a make-believe judge to solve the bankruptcy
problem and help creditors get their money while saving hockey in
Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine if the court would order the contracts of the Penguins
players to be sold _ not through a league draft, but through an
open auction _ to the highest bidders among all teams in and out of
the NHL. (What would Jagr's rights bring on the open market? Or
Kovalev's?) Take the money from this sale and pay off the
creditors. Then award another expansion franchise to Pittsburgh, a
hockey version of the new Cleveland Browns in football. Take
Pittsburgh's $75 million entry fee, finish paying off the
creditors, and let the rest of the owners split what is left.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, sure, such a solution might sound preposterous to the
hustling entrepreneurs and financial wizards who run the fin de
siecle NHL. How dare we tell them how to manage their affairs? But
this farfetched formula is no less ludicrous than the reality of
the embarrassing mess surrounding the Pittsburgh Penguins, weary
and hurting, on and off the ice, in the Stanley Cup playoffs of
1999.

 &HT;    High school prom ends abruptly after bomb found on premises
 &HT;    By Noah Bierman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Prom night ended three hours early for
Palm Beach Lakes High School Saturday when security guards
discovered a powerful bomb just outside the Sheraton Hotel
ballroom.
</P>
<P>
   The nail-studded bomb was not set to explode, but someone could
have detonated it within seconds and injured or killed any of 500
students, said Ed Halley, spokesman for the federal Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
</P>
<P>
   An unknown number of guests and hotel staff were also in the
building. Anyone on the first floor was in harm's way, Halley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very powerful kind of bomb.''
</P>
<P>
   Palm Beach County School District officials on Sunday were
planning heightened security for the one remaining prom of the
year: this Friday's dance for Spanish River High School students in
Boca Raton.
</P>
<P>
   They also planned a security sweep of Palm Beach Lakes High
School before the start of classes today.
</P>
<P>
   West Palm Beach and the ATF had no suspects Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   All that was certain was that this prom night would be
remembered for all the wrong reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Hotel security guards discovered the device sometime between
8:30 and 10 p.m. inside an indoor tree planter by the ballroom
entrance. Authorities had varied accounts of the timing. No threat
had been received.
</P>
<P>
   Students were evacuated around 10 p.m. and sent to the parking
lot. They were told only that it was an emergency and that they
would be allowed back in soon.
</P>
<P>
   But the students would not return.
</P>
<P>
   A sheriff's bomb squad dog sniffed the device before West Palm
Beach police destroyed it with a powerful stream from a water
cannon, Halley said. He described the explosive as similar to other
homemade pipe bombs, simple enough to build with directions on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Halley would not elaborate further on its contents or its size
except to say it was ``considerable.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts in the ATF's Atlanta lab are now examining the bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Police and school officials are working with the ATF.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, they searched the school campus but turned up nothing,
said Jim Kelly, chief of school police. Kelly said the school would
conduct a security sweep sometime before classes start today and
that staff would be on a heightened state of alert.
</P>
<P>
   Halley could not recall hearing of a similar incident in his 18
years with the ATF.
</P>
<P>
   The prom's theme was ``These are the Times.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, said Lynne Humphries, a chaperone who has missed two, at
most three, proms since she began teaching at the school 35 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Humphries remembers what were previously considered notorious
prom incidents. One year, a girl drank a little too much and got
sick, publicly. A boy was caught smoking marijuana in the bathroom.
Such problems now sound quaint.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this what we have to look forward to now every time we have
large gatherings?'' Humphries wondered. ``Should we give up
graduation?''
</P>
<P>
   Although the prom officially started at 8 p.m., students started
arriving en masse between 9 and 10. Many had yet to enter through
the two archways of dark green and gold balloons. Some hadn't seen
the centerpieces or cast their ballots for king and queen.
</P>
<P>
   Gloria Suit, 17, spent 30 minutes inside the prom before school
officials ``shuffled us out into the parking lot.'' Her date had
taken her to dinner. They shared a black limousine with two other
couples.
</P>
<P>
   She did ``the hair, the nails, the toes, all the jewelry,
everything.'' It probably cost $600, including the long champagne
dress with the sparkled top and the gloves. Others spent more, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Even if school officials decide later this week to hold a
replacement prom, Suit doesn't think she and her friends can afford
to recreate the evening. And there's really no way to recreate the
whole thing anyway, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my senior prom,'' she said. ``It's very sad that we
didn't have any time to spend there.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the students were sent to the parking lot, many milled
around for 60 or 90 minutes until they realized they wouldn't be
allowed back.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one ever informed us what was going on,'' said Danielle
Solomon, 19, a senior.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon wore a purple dress with matching shoes and a long scarf
to the go-cart park. Her mother had saved money for the special
occasion, so she wasn't about to change.
</P>
<P>
   Celita Lozado said everything had gone perfectly for her, until
the evacuation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of us were actually crying because, I mean, this is our
senior prom and we don't have a second chance,'' Lozado said.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly, the schools police chief, said the county has just one
prom left this year. Spanish River High School's prom will go on as
scheduled Friday, at the Boca Raton Resort and Club, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll do a sweep of the place well before the prom and keep it
secured,'' Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   The Sheraton's banquet room was back in use Sunday, as the Hugh
O'Brian Youth Leadership organization held a banquet for 150
Florida sophomores who have shown leadership in their schools and
communities.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel's Grand Regency Ballroom, where the prom was held, is
6,615 square feet. The hotel employs about 250 workers.
</P>
<P>
   It underwent a four-month renovation that ended last December.
There have been no construction workers on site recently, said Saun
Lightbourne, the manager on duty.
</P>
<P>
   The ballroom _ the hotel's main banquet room _ opens into a
small lobby with easy access to a parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   The bomb was found in a large tree planter, in a corner about 12
feet from the far-right entrance to the ballroom, according to one
employee.
</P>
<P>
   The planter sits next to an entrance about 15 feet from a
parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   Humphries, chairwoman of the social studies department, lamented
how the world of high schools has changed since 12 students and a
teacher were massacred in Colorado last month.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's incident was ``a marker of our time,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is exactly what this person wanted,'' Humphries said.
``They wanted all those kids' night to be ruined. And guess what?
It was.''

 U.S. FAULTS MEDICAL STUDIES IN NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By AMY WALDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A government watchdog agency has warned the City
University of New York and the Mount Sinai School of Medicine to
comply with ethical rules for federally financed research on human
subjects, an agency official said Sunday. Violating those rules
could imperil the institutions' permission to engage in such
research.
</P>
<P>
   The official, Michael Carome, the chief compliance officer of
the Office for Protection From Research Risks, which monitors
research centers to make sure they are following the rules, said he
did not have access over the weekend to records that would indicate
the nature of any violations, which were mentioned in this week's
U.S. News and World Report magazine.
</P>
<P>
   But he said that Mount Sinai had been placed on restrictive
status in March, making it subject to tighter federal oversight
until it complies with the rules, while the university's research
has been under a similar restriction for two years. The university
does not have a medical school, but some of its colleges conduct
medically related research.
</P>
<P>
   The university received the warning in February in a letter from
the agency, which is part of the National Institutes of Health. The
letter laid out in detail what the university still needed to do.
</P>
<P>
   Carome said Sunday that there had been ``persistent problems''
at the university, and that the violations over the last few years
were similar to those that led the agency to suspend briefly all
federally financed research on humans last week at Duke University
Medical Center in Durham, N.C. Duke was cited for 20 violations,
some of them involving insufficient record-keeping by its
Institutional Review Board.
</P>
<P>
   Such boards must follow federal rules in determining which
experiments are allowed and the risks to which participants may be
exposed.
</P>
<P>
   CUNY's vice chancellor for university relations, Jay Hershenson,
said on Sunday: ``The university is working with the Office of
Protection From Research Risks to improve precautionary procedures
where warranted. CUNY has requested greater specificity from OPRR
to assure accuracy, and a plan will be filed by June 15 addressing
any revisions of procedures that are necessary to minimize risk.''
</P>
<P>
   A university official said there were no allegations that the
``procedural problems'' had harmed any subjects. The official said
that some of the problems seemed to stem from having separate
institutional review boards at all 20 of its colleges, as well as a
central research foundation, and that the university was working on
a way to bring greater uniformity to its institutional review.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the federal agency visited the Mount Sinai
School of Medicine in March, Carome said, and the warning followed.
Its license to continue research using human subjects in federally
financed experiments was placed under review, Carome said, until it
implements a plan to correct the deficiencies.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Phillips, an associate dean at the medical school, said in
a statement on Sunday that the federal agency had ``approved Mount
Sinai's full continuation of its clinical research activities.''
</P>
<P>
   But her statement said: ``The review did identify several issues
for which OPRR asked that Mount Sinai take corrective action. None
of the identified issues involved risks to those individuals
participating in research at Mount Sinai.''
</P>
<P>
   A separate investigation into whether psychiatric experiments at
the New York State Psychiatric Institute at Queens College, which
is part of CUNY, and the Mount Sinai School of Medicine violated
the federal ethical guidelines is continuing, Carome said.
</P>
<P>
   In those experiments, which took place over three years and
ended in 1996, 100 boys in New York City were given the now-banned
drug fenfluramine, which researchers believe triggers the
production of chemicals in the brain. The study sought to determine
whether measuring the levels of such chemicals could predict
violent behavior.

CIVILIAN CASUALTIES ACKNOWLEDGED BY NATO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO leaders said Sunday that allied airstrikes
have caused ``perhaps hundreds of innocent casualties'' and warned
that they cannot guarantee the safety of a UN team that arrived in
Serbia for the first independent inspection of the Kosovo province
since the bombardment began.
</P>
<P>
   But NATO officials, citing new estimates that Serb forces have
executed at least 4,600 ethnic Albanian men and possibly as many as
100,000, decried Serb criticism of the fatal allied attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the Serbs to lament publicly about the deaths of these
refugees is almost tantamount to Adolf Eichmann complaining about
allied forces bombing the crematoriums,'' said Defense Secretary
William S. Cohen. ``These are crocodile tears coming out of mass
killers.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Sunday, a senior Pentagon official said the two Serb
soldiers held as prisoners of war by US military authorities in
Germany will be released, possibly Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are going to be released,'' the official said, speaking
on condition of anonymity. ``We're just working out the details
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen strongly hinted a few weeks ago that there was a
possibility that the prisoners would be released.
</P>
<P>
   Three US Army soldiers captured along the Kosovo-Macedonia
border were released two weeks ago, but there was no indication of
any linkage between the two releases.
</P>
<P>
   In Brussels, NATO officials Sunday dismissed Yugoslav assertions
that escalating allied airstrikes have prevented Serb troops from
withdrawing from Kosovo. Yugoslav leaders said last week that they
had ordered a partial troop withdrawal because they had completed
their operations against ethnic Albanian rebels.
</P>
<P>
   NATO spokesman Jamie Shea called it ``perverse'' for Yugoslavia
to blame the airstrikes for the failed troop withdrawal. ``It's
like an alcoholic blaming a whiskey company for his problem,'' Shea
said at NATO headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The 15-member UN team, scheduled to meet Monday with Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic, vowed Sunday to visit every corner of
Kosovo to assess the depth of the humanitarian crisis that has
unfolded as Milosevic's forces have committed a number of alleged
war crimes in driving 1.5 million ethnic Albanians from their
homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first time we are able to embark in this kind of way
and right in the middle of a war,'' said Sergio de Mello, the UN
undersecretary for humanitarian affairs, in the Yugoslav capital of
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The UN mission follows the arrival in Kosovo on Friday of the
first Red Cross convoy to deliver relief supplies to the province
since the airstrikes began on March 24.
</P>
<P>
   NATO warplanes, meanwhile, are pounding Serb targets in Kosovo
around the clock.
</P>
<P>
   ``We support these humanitarian convoy efforts,'' Shea said.
``But obviously we cannot guarantee the security of those
humanitarian convoys and our air operations will continue.''
</P>
<P>
   There were these other developments Sunday:
</P>
<P>
   --About 800 ethnic Albanians reached Macedonia and described
enduring weeks of terror as they tried to elude Serb forces who
were searching door to door for members of the Kosovo Liberation
Army. UN officials expect thousands more refugees to flee to
Macedonia, which reopened its border last week with Kosovo after
closing border stations for several days because of overcrowding in
the refugee camps.
</P>
<P>
   --General Henry Shelton, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of
Staff, refused to speculate when, if ever, the Apache helicopters
that were sent last month to Albania would be used against Serb
troops in Kosovo. The New York Times reported Sunday that the
Pentagon is blocking deployment of the helicopters. ``Basically, we
will use them at a time and place of our choosing,'' Shelton said
on CBS's ``Face the Nation.''
</P>
<P>
   --Under pressure from the peace movement in Germany, Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder is preparing to step up his pursuit of a
settlement of the Kosovo crisis. ``Given the current developments
in the Kosovo conflict, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has decided to
intensify efforts for a political solution,'' his administration
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   --A rocket struck the German ambassador's residence in Athens,
apparently the latest in a series of attacks in Greece against
businesses and interests linked to NATO countries involved in the
Kosovo campaign. The ambassador and his wife were in the residence
at the time, but no one was reported hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Amid controversy over a NATO raid last week that killed many
ethnic Albanian civilians in the Kosovar village of Korisa, US
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and British Foreign
Minister Robin Cook expressed deep regret Sunday that ``there have
been perhaps hundreds of innocent casualties as a result of NATO
action.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Pickering, a US undersecretary of state, reaffirmed the
NATO assertion that the Korisa victims were being used as human
shields. He said there is an unconfirmed report of a survivor
saying Serb troops forced the ethnic Albanians to the target site
and told them, ``Now you will feel the brunt of the NATO bombing.''
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav authorities called the allegation ``crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright and Cook, in an op-ed article in the Washington Post,
also cited the deadly, ``mistaken'' airstrike recently on the
Chinese Embassy in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO has gone to extreme lengths to avoid civilians and to
attack military targets,'' Albright and Cook wrote. ``But with
thousands of missions being flown every week, perfection is
unattainable.''
</P>
<P>
   Chinese officials remained unsatisfied. Warning that US-China
relations have ``suffered very serious damage,'' the Chinese
ambassador to the United States, Li Zhaoxing, said on NBC's ``Meet
the Press,'' ``The US-led, US-NATO force should bear all the
responsibility arising therefrom.''
</P>
<P>
   The mistaken deaths in NATO bombings prompted a prominent US
ally, Argentine President Carlos Menem, to urge NATO to send ground
troops into Kosovo. ``This will continue if there is no decision to
occupy part of the territory,'' Menem said in Buenos Aires.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's reliance on airstrikes also was questioned by retired
General Colin Powell, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, who commanded US forces during the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   ``In due course, Milosevic may blink, but the danger with this
particular strategy is that it is up to Mr. Milosevic to decide
when he is gong to blink,'' Powell said on ``Meet the Press.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember what winning means,'' Powell added. ``In this case,
the political objective is that we will allow Mr. Milosevic to let
us bring troops into Kosovo to allow the Kosovar Albanians to go
home. In Desert Storm, we took that decision away from Saddam
Hussein when we launched the ground attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Newsweek reported that the Joint Chiefs have informed
Cohen that ground troops will be necessary to ``guarantee
fulfillment of the administration's political objectives,''
particularly helping the Kosovar refugees return home before snow
begins falling in October.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, appearing on CBS's ``Face the Nation,'' said NATO stands
by its belief that the airstrikes will achieve the allied goals.
``We are going all out to win,'' Cohen said. ``We are going to win
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said the Kosovo Liberation Army is regrouping and gaining
strength and will pose increasing problems for Milosevic. ``They
will prove to be his quagmire,'' Cohen said, ``his Vietnam.''

SHAQ WON'T SPUR CONTROVERSY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Shaquille O'Neal never lacks for motivational
tools. And wherever motivation lacks, he invents something. His
imagination might be the only thing more active than his low-post
game.
</P>
<P>
   So here are O'Neal's favorite play toys for conjured motivation,
the San Antonio Spurs, and what does he do? He goes conservative.
This must be the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ain't gonna say anything to get the town pumped up. . . .
I'm gonna watch what I say this time,'' O'Neal said Sunday, on the
eve of the Lakers' conference semifinals opener against the San
Antonio Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, O'Neal began the season in a snit over a national
publication's prediction the Spurs would win the Western
Conference. Then he dissed Spurs big men David Robinson and Tim
Duncan. All part of the complex Shaq psychology.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's silent, even complimentary toward the Spurs, apparently
saving his energy for those low-block wrestling matches with
Robinson and Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, O'Neal found new material for his unique brand of
self-motivation. Now he's grumbling about being picked third team
All-NBA, a notion he dreamed up himself. The votes have not been
released.
</P>
<P>
   As far as the Lakers are concerned, he can manufacture whatever
bogeymen he wants as long as he keeps producing as he did in the
Lakers' 3-1 first-round victory over the Houston Rockets. O'Neal's
inspired 37-point, 11-rebound performance in Game 4 clinched the
series, setting up this best-of-seven showdown with the top-seeded
Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   The similarities in the series are worth noting. Like the
Rockets, the Spurs lost twice to the Lakers early in the season,
then routed them in late April. Like the Rockets, the Spurs can
knock the Lakers off balance with a dominant frontcourt.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs finished the season with the NBA's best regular-season
record and the best performance over the last two months before
dispatching the Minnesota Timberwolves 3-1 in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   But O'Neal and Kobe Bryant, and Glen Rice when healthy, have
been more than a match for any team lately. The Lakers have won
seven of their last eight games, by an average of almost 13 points.
</P>
<P>
   Said O'Neal: ``I like our chances.''
</P>
<P>
   Much will depend once again on J.R. Reid. Installed as the
Lakers' starting power forward just a month ago following the
termination of Dennis Rodman, Reid has become the defensive focal
point of their postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Reid did just enough to slow Houston's Charles Barkley in the
first-round series, earning high praise from teammates for his
aggressive, physical play. Now he'll be counted on to keep Duncan,
the most versatile low-post player in the league, from
single-handedly dismantling the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's tough, he's one of the best big men out there,'' Reid
said. ``Everybody in this league loves a challenge. I'm a very
competitive guy and I love to get after it. It makes it a physical
game. I'm not a shot-blocker or anything like that, so we have to
keep him off the box and keep him off that sweet spot in the low
post. Its gonna be a lot different (than guarding Barkley). He's
not a physical player, but he mixes it up.''
</P>
<P>
   And certainly, Reid has proven now that he can play the role of
sacrificial lamb on defense. A 15-point-per-game scorer in
Charlotte before his trade to the Lakers in March, Reid is fine
with his new station.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of confidence in what he can do,'' coach Kurt
Rambis said. ``I think he gained some confidence in himself in how
valuable he can be to this franchise and to our success. . . . We
asked him to do a particular thing and he put all his energy into
that, and that's why he had a lot of success and we had a lot of
success.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the Lakers face a true test of how far they've come in the
last few weeks, since the routs by Houston and San Antonio and the
amazing turnaround that's followed. But they don't have the luxury
of relying on prior experience to gauge this matchup. Are the Spurs
such an improved team that they can beat the Lakers by 27 points,
as they did April 24? Or were the Lakers just that bad then?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know, we really can't say,'' Derek Fisher said. ``I
mean, we beat them early, when they weren't playing that well. They
beat us late, when we weren't playing that well. So we really don't
know how good they are, because we haven't played our best (against
them). We'll find out (tonight) how good they really are.''

SOME PREDICT FIRST-ROUND VICTORY FOR BARAK
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ With Israelis heading to the polls Monday to vote
for prime minister, two images of the candidates in the campaign's
11th hour seemed to capture their political character and the
direction this race is headed.
</P>
<P>
   Ehud Barak, the Labor party's challenger to incumbent Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, is enjoying a commanding lead in the
polls. At a sun-drenched rally Sunday in an open field north of Tel
Aviv, Barak told voters, ``Our way will bring us to unity.''
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu, meanwhile, his hold on power threatened, scowled
under the glaring lights of television cameras at a press
conference inside the prime minister's office in Jerusalem and
lashed out at Israel's traditionally left-leaning media for ganging
up against him.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu, whose rightist coalition unraveled last winter,
forcing him to call early elections, Sunday turned up the heat on
his opponent, warning voters that Barak ``cut deals'' with the far
left and Israeli Palestinians that threaten the nation's security.
</P>
<P>
   A swirl of activity Sunday, including the withdrawal from the
race of the Center Party candidate, Yitzhak Mordechai, who gave his
support to Barak, left the highly decorated general poised to win a
majority Monday.
</P>
<P>
   What began as a five-way race for prime minister became a
showdown between Barak and Netanyahu. Hours after Mordechai
withdrew, ultranationalist Benny Begin also pulled out, but
declined to endorse Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   Mordechai and Begin, both former Cabinet ministers under
Netanyahu, defected as his fractious coalition crumbled.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the first-ever Israeli Arab candidate for prime
minister, Azmi Bishara, also pulled out. That meant that the Arab
vote, about 15 percent of the electorate, would not be drawn away
from Barak.
</P>
<P>
   The narrowing of the race to two candidates means Israel will
not, as most analysts predicted, face a runoff June 1. And this,
most analysts said, will benefit Barak.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the last-minute political jostling, Israel's most
established and independent pollster, Hanoch Smith, forecast Barak
would win 54 percent of the vote and Netanyahu 46 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu insisted Sunday the polls would be proven wrong, just
as they were in 1996 when he won an upset over Labor's incumbent
Shimon Peres.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to surprise people. We're going to determine the
outcome of this thing and we're going to win,'' Netanyahu said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, sounding as though he was delivering a victory speech,
told supporters, ``We now have a real challenge of unifying the
country, of switching from divisiveness and dissension to unity and
hope for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel's 4.3 million voters will cast two ballots Monday, one
for the 120-member Knesset, or parliament, and the other in the
direct election for prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, the campaign focused on personalities and
soundbites more than substantive issues, an American approach to
politics imported to Israel by both Barak and Netanyahu. Both of
the candidates have enlisted some of America's top political
strategists to shape their message.
</P>
<P>
   For Netanyahu, the message worked on by Ipswich resident and
conservative political consultant Arthur Finkelstein was security,
as Israel heads toward the final phase of the peace agreement with
Palestinians. The prime minister warned that Barak would cede too
much land to the Palestinians, allow them to establish an
independent state, and allow them to divide Jerusalem by declaring
a Palestinian capital in East Jerusalem, which Israel captured in
the 1967 war.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has also talked tough on security and assured voters that
Jerusalem is the eternal and indivisible capital of the Jewish
state. But his message, honed by Washington's liberal strategist
James Carville, is how Netanyahu has left Israel ``stuck'' in a
deadlocked peace process and faltering economy.
</P>
<P>
   Partly because Netanyahu succeeded in creating more security
through his hard-line policies and partly because Barak convinced
voters that he, too, will be tough on security, Israeli voters have
not focused attention on relations with their Palestinian
neighbors. Instead, they have looked within Israeli society to its
deepening ethnic tensions and its religious-secular divide.
</P>
<P>
   On these issues within Israel, the differences between the
candidates, both their personalities and their political heritage,
became stark.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it appears that Barak, who at the beginning of the
race was seen as a brilliant military thinker but a bungling
politician, has out-maneuvered Netanyahu whose MIT education and
polished marketing skills gave him the image of a political wizard.
</P>
<P>
   The two men are a study in contrast.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, 57, is a mixture of hawk and dove, the most highly
decorated general in Israel's history who also relaxes by playing
Beethoven piano sonatas.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu, 49, is a tough-talking hard-liner who showed his
world-class ability to communicate as a frequent guest on
``Nightline'' when he was UN ambassador from 1984 to 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Barak enjoys tinkering with the mechanisms of pocket watches and
clocks. Netanyahu unwinds with a Davidoff cigar.
</P>
<P>
   Barak was raised on a kibbutz. He was a rising star in Israel's
liberal, secular elite who was groomed for leadership. He became a
national hero in 1972 by leading the storming of a hijacked Sabena
Airlines passenger jet by elite Israeli commandos disguised as El
Al mechanics.

<P>
   Netanyahu came of age in a conservative home steeped in his
father's scholarly research. The father's right-wing politics
alienated him from a liberal academic establishment, friends said,
and fostered family resentment against the elite. Netanyahu had a
respectable, though not distinguished military career. He lived in
the shadow of his gifted and gregarious brother, Jonathan, who died
a national hero while leading the raid at Entebbe, Uganda, to free
103 Israelis from a terrorist hijacking in 1976.

   Barak was a protege and admirer of Yitzhak Rabin, the prime
minister whose assassination in 1995 and bold moves toward peace
transformed him into a national martyr. Barak has vowed to continue
Rabin's legacy for peace.

<P>
   One of Israel's leading political commentators, Zeev Chafetz,
who writes a weekly column for the Jerusalem Report, said that
Sunday the two men were both in their element on the final day of
campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barak was out there in a field playing off the image of a
Zionist kibbutz and acting like a commander marshaling his military
general buddies,'' said Chafetz.
</P>
<P>
   ``And there was Bibi hunkered down with TV lights bouncing off
his forehead,'' he added, ``looking like a cornered animal and
surrounded by the tattered remains of his party.''

YELTSIN SURVIVES ATTEMPT TO IMPEACH HIM
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ President Boris N. Yeltsin survived an attempt to
impeach him Saturday, as opposition legislators, crumbling under
intense Kremlin pressure, failed to amass the necessary number of
votes on five counts against the Russian leader.
</P>
<P>
   But Russia's political crisis showed no signs of easing. Yeltsin
faces a new showdown with parliament this week after outraging
lawmakers by dismissing the popular prime minister, Yevgeny
Primakov.
</P>
<P>
   And in a potential sign of new health woes for the aging
president, whose penchant for erratic public behavior has grown in
recent weeks, Yeltsin made a surprise hospital visit Saturday that
the Kremlin described as a ``routine planned checkup'' that just
happened to be scheduled for the day of the impeachment vote.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's vote laid bare the deep divisions in Russian society.
Although Yeltsin is universally disliked _ the approval rating of
Russia's first popularly elected leader has diminished to 2 percent
_ some Russians believe the democratic and market transformation he
began are moves in the right direction, no matter how flawed the
results so far.
</P>
<P>
   But a much larger number, represented by the Communists and
their allies in the Duma, believe that Yeltsin's policies have been
a cynical and corrupt exercise aimed at destroying the country. As
life for most Russians gets worse, this split could widen and
drastically affect the results of planned December parliamentary
elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lies, hypocrisy, and cynicism have become the foundations of
Yeltsin's policy,'' Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov told the
State Duma before the vote. ``Yeltsin is absolute evil for
Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin Saturday was silent. A Kremlin spokesman said Yeltsin
had held meetings at one of his suburban residences. Yeltsin, who
has appeared unsteady and has had trouble speaking in recent weeks,
has a long history of serious illnesses played down by his
spokesmen.
</P>
<P>
   The state of Yeltsin's health has become important again since
he fired Primakov and threatened to disband the Duma and set new
elections if the opposition-dominated lower house of parliament
voted for impeachment. The unpredictable Yeltsin, who thrives on
confrontation more than day-to-day governance, could still lash out
if the Duma refuses Wednesday to approve Sergei Stepashin, his
choice to replace Primakov as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Duma leaders said they would consider Stepashin's candidacy, but
most were noncommittal. Stepashin said: ``Thank God, disaster has
been averted.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, the closest Yeltsin's opponents came to a ``yes'' vote
came on a motion accusing him of illegally waging war in the
separatist republic of Chechnya. The motion received 283 votes,
short of the 300 needed in the 450-seat legislature to begin
proceedings to remove Yeltsin from office, and far less than the
312 votes Duma speaker Gennady Seleznyov, a Communist, had
predicted a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The other counts all failed by larger margins. Those charges
accused Yeltsin of betraying the Soviet Union, destroying the
Russian military, illegally using deadly force by sending tanks to
end a 1993 standoff with parliament, and conducting economic
policies that brought about ``genocide'' of the Russian people.
</P>
<P>
   As angry Communist supporters in the Duma shouted ``Shame!
Shame!'' at legislators who opposed impeachment, their disconsolate
leaders sought to put a brave face on the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see it as a defeat because the majority of deputies
voted for impeachment,'' Zyuganov said. Before voting, Zyuganov had
accused Yeltsin of destroying thousands of years of Russian
civilization.
</P>
<P>
   Grigory Yavlinsky, head of a pro-democracy bloc that supported
impeachment only on the Chechnya accusation, said it was the
Communists who had destroyed Russia during their 70-year rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Communists killed tens of millions of people in this country,
brought the country to collapse,'' Yavlinsky said, adding that the
Communist Party ``has no right to power in the country, and no
impeachment can help it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You will share Yeltsin's responsibility,'' Zyuganov shot back.
The Communist leader later said he believed heavy lobbying by the
Kremlin had pressured some lawmakers to change their minds.
</P>
<P>
   While other legislators charged that Yeltsin's administration
was offering money, perks, and plush government jobs in return for
``no'' votes, a more likely reason for the turnabout is that some
lawmakers did not want to risk losing the jobs and perks they
already have. Then there were those who could not be bothered, like
the lawmaker who sent in a telegram wishing the Duma well from his
vacation spot in the Canary Islands.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was Mayor Yury Luzhkov, a likely contender in
next year's presidential elections whose new political party,
Otechestvo, is not eligible to take part in parliamentary elections
until December. Duma sources say Luzhkov ordered some 30-odd
supporters in the Russian Regions bloc, many of whom had supported
impeachment on the Chechnya motion, to vote against it.

NEW YORK STATE SET TO RELAX RESTRICTIONS ON RENTAL CAR COMPANIES  
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ After two years of intensive lobbying by rental
car companies, the Legislature appears poised to repeal, or at
least soften, the state's stringent law on insuring rental cars,
several lobbyists and key legislators say.
</P>
<P>
   The companies have chafed for a decade under the law, which caps
a driver's liability for damage to a rental car and outlaws the
sale of collision-damage waivers, added insurance that consumer
advocates have long condemned as a waste of renters' money.
</P>
<P>
   The advocates say that the law, the nation's toughest, has
curbed the abusive practices of rental companies. But the industry
has protested that it costs too much, raising rental prices and
sending small companies out of business.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York has by far the most restrictive laws in the
country,'' said Ray Wagner, legislative vice president for
Enterprise Rent-a-Car, based in St. Louis. ``They are oppressive to
the industry and to consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   While the industry has occasionally found a sympathetic ear in
the Capitol, particularly in the Republican-controlled Senate, its
requests for action have never gone far in the Legislature. But
this could be the year.
</P>
<P>
   A bill now moving through both houses would eliminate the cap on
a driver's liability for car damage _ currently $100 _ and allow
the sale of collision damage waivers again. The bill is expected to
reach the Senate floor for a vote this week, and lobbyists and
lawmakers say it is likely to pass.
</P>
<P>
   The potential turnabout is a tale of fierce debate over the
merits of the law, but it is also a lesson in the workings of
Albany. Each year, hundreds of interest groups seeking changes in
state law are unable to rise above the din and inertia of the
Capitol. The advantage belongs to those who put large sums of money
to the task.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, there were widespread complaints about rental car
companies, and a particular irritant was the collision damage
waiver. Critics said the waiver was too expensive, a huge profit
maker for the industry, and that drivers were often pressured to
buy it even if they did not need it, because they had their own
insurance, or their credit cards covered the damage.
</P>
<P>
   Growing interest in the bill follows an aggressive effort by
several of the Capitol's most powerful lobbyists, on behalf of
Enterprise, Avis, Hertz Corp. and Republic Industries, which
recently changed its name to Autonation, owner of Alamo Rent-a-Car
and National Car Rental.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill, rental companies would be allowed to charge up
to $9 a day for the collision-damage waiver for most cars, and up
to $12 for luxury cars, but they could not require that anyone buy
it. Industry officials say that nationally, about one renter in
eight buys the policy.
</P>
<P>
   At $9 a day, the waiver would be equivalent to paying more than
$3,000 a year. On average, New Yorkers pay less than $1,000 a year
for auto insurance _ about $2 to $3 a day _ and that covers all
manner of things, like medical bills, while the waiver covers only
damage to the car.
</P>
<P>
   New York's current rules force rental companies to buy more
insurance for their cars or to absorb the cost of damages. Critics
say that significantly raises rental rates, which are higher in New
York than around the country. And they say that repealing the law
would lead to lower prices.

VERN COUNTRYMAN, 81, EXPERT IN COMMERCIAL LAW 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Mont., Wash., Conn., Calif.)  (lb) 
 By NICK RAVO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vern Countryman, a nationally renowned expert on commercial law,
particularly bankruptcy, died on May 2 at Mount Auburn Hospital in
Cambridge, Mass. He was 81 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Countryman, a retired professor at Harvard Law School, lived in
Cambridge and was born in Roundup, Mont., on May 13, 1917. He
received a B.A. in political science in 1939 from the University of
Washington and a law degree in 1942 from the University of
Washington School of Law.
</P>
<P>
   He worked as an assistant regional attorney with the National
Labor Relations Board in Seattle before serving as a clerk from
1942 to 1943 for U.S. Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   Countryman then served with the Air Force in Italy during World
War II, rising to first lieutenant. After the war, he served as
assistant attorney general of Washington state in 1946 and as an
instructor at the University of Washington Law School from 1946 to
1947.
</P>
<P>
   He held a fellowship at Yale Law School from 1947 to 1948. He
became an assistant professor of law from 1948 to 1950 and an
associate professor from 1950 to 1955.
</P>
<P>
   Countryman left Yale after he was denied a full professorship in
1954. He believed, as did many of his colleagues, that he was being
punished for criticizing the hunt for communists during the
McCarthy era.
</P>
<P>
   He practiced law as a partner with Shea, Greenman &AMP; Gardner in
Washington, D.C., from 1955 to 1959 before becoming dean of the
University of New Mexico School of Law in 1959. He served there
until 1964, when he became a professor at Harvard Law School. And
in 1973, he was named the Royall professor of law, the oldest
professorship at the Law School. He became a professor emeritus in
1987.
</P>
<P>
   At Harvard, Countryman was a strong supporter of the rights of
debtors. He was also a specialist in commercial law,
secured-transactions law and civil liberties.
</P>
<P>
   His books included ``The Lawyer in Modern Society'' (Little,
Brown, 1976) with Ted Finman and Theodore J. Schneyer; ``Commercial
Law'' (Little, Brown, 1982) with Andrew Kaufman and Zipporah
Wiseman; ``Debtors' and Creditors' Rights'' (Bender, 1951) with
James William Moore, and ``The Judicial Record of Justice William
O. Douglas'' (Harvard University Press, 1974).
</P>
<P>
   Countryman was a founding trustee of the National Consumer Law
Center, which annually presents the Vern Countryman Award to honor
lawyers who have contributed to the rights and welfare of
low-income consumers.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by two daughters, Debra Green of Freestone,
Calif., and Kay Briggs of Lafayette, Calif.; two grandchildren; and
three brothers, Roy of Bozeman, Mont., Robert of Seattle, and
Charles of Yakima, Wash.

PARTIES SEE ROCKLAND-ORANGE SENATE RACE AS CRUCIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW CITY, N.Y. _ Seats in the state Senate become vacant with
all the frequency of snow in May, and incumbents usually depart for
better jobs, retirement or the hereafter, not because they have
lost an election. A real contest is rare. One with implications for
control of the Senate is rarer still.
</P>
<P>
   That state of affairs explains why New York's top political
figures have lavished so much attention on the May 25 special
election in Rockland and Orange Counties to replace Sen. Joseph
Holland, a Republican. In one of the state's few true swing
districts, each party is heaping resources on the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really the first contest of the 2000 elections,'' said
Kenneth Zebrowski, the Democratic candidate and majority leader of
the Rockland County Legislature. ``It's the first step to the
Democrats taking a majority in the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   His Republican opponent, Thomas Morahan, minority leader of the
county Legislature, rejected the notion of this contest as a
harbinger, but said, ``It's crucial because we've got to keep the
Senate Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of this campaign, a long-simmering issue _ the tax on
suburban commuters who work in New York City _ has suddenly become
the most compelling topic in state politics. Both candidates
proclaimed plans to eliminate the tax, a common stance for suburban
politicians that had long been dismissed. But within days,
Republicans and Democrats, calling each other's bluff, had an
apparent deal to repeal the tax, which brings in about $360 million
annually for the city, including $210 million from commuters who
live in the state.
</P>
<P>
   That this turnabout could occur at such head-snapping speed,
amid the general torpor of the Capitol, demonstrates how high the
stakes are in the race for the 38th District seat. Each candidate
has eagerly taken responsibility for the shift, trying to turn it
to his advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats far outnumber Republicans statewide, but Republicans
hold a 36-25 majority in the Senate, partly because they hold seven
districts, including the 38th, where there are many more registered
Democrats than registered Republicans. The last time one of those
swing seats was up for grabs was in 1990, when Holland was elected.
</P>
<P>
   Although no one is predicting that the Democrats will gain
control of the Senate any time soon, the Republican majority
leader, Joseph Bruno, is worried about the 2000 elections because
presidential elections, with their high turnouts and New York's
Democratic bent in national politics, have helped Democrats in
legislative races. Republicans lost two seats in 1996, and a loss
of two or three more would make it harder for Bruno to control
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Republican senators in swing districts who have
wanted to retire have instead been persuaded by nervous party
leaders to run for re-election. Last year, when Holland decided to
accept the job of social services commissioner of Rockland County,
he was pressured to run for re-election in November before leaving
for his new job early this year. That way, his successor would be
chosen in a special election, when turnout is low, a circumstance
thought to favor Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republican officials estimate that more than $1 million
will be spent on Morahan's campaign, an extraordinary sum for a
state legislative race, but Bruno insists the figure is closer to
$400,000. Several Senate Republicans are campaigning for Morahan,
as is Gov. George Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno said: ``We're pulling out all the stops, and they're
pulling out all the stops. It's the kind of district that goes
either way, so it really matters. We're not going to lose it.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are blunt about their candidate's primary appeal:
the pork-barrel advantages of being in the Senate majority. ``Being
in the majority means more and better things for the district, and
minority members aren't in a position to do much by way of bringing
home the bacon,'' Bruno said.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate recently approved $4 million in transportation aid
for the East Ramapo school district, a decision that senators
conceded was timed to benefit Morahan.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats say they will spend $300,000 to $500,000 on
Zebrowski's effort. His stumping companions have included a raft of
state legislators, and are expected to include U.S. Sen. Charles
Schumer, state Comptroller H. Carl McCall and state Attorney
General Eliot Spitzer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's simple,'' said state Sen. Eric Schneiderman of Manhattan
and the Bronx, chairman of the Senate Democratic Campaign
Committee. ``We've got better issues and a better candidate, versus
Joe Bruno's power.''

BRUINS DON'T HELP THEIR CAUSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Now the decision lies in the hands of the
selection committee. That's not what the UCLA baseball team wanted.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins needed a victory over fifth-ranked Stanford Sunday
afternoon to solidify their chances for an at-large berth in the
NCAA playoffs. Instead, the Cardinal, with a Pac-10 championship
already secured the day before, pummeled the Bruins 14-4 at Jackie
Robinson Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA (30-29) finished 13-11 and in a tie for third place in the
Pac-10 with Arizona. Four teams are expected to be taken from the
conference for the 64-team tournament field, which means the Bruins
could get invited.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're good enough to be tied for third place . . . you
think there would be room enough to take a few more Pac-10 teams,''
said UCLA head coach Gary Adams. ``We deserve to go. We've earned
the right to go. I don't care if we're greasing our way in. I'll
bet there's a lot of teams that don't want to play us.''
</P>
<P>
   Losing two weekend games to Stanford (40-13, 19-5) _ and getting
blown out in game it had to win _ didn't help UCLA's cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a tough loss Friday,'' said sophomore outfielder Bill
Scott, referring to a game the Bruins were leading 7-0 through
seven innings and lost 8-7. ``I don't think we got over that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinal hit four home runs Sunday, including a ninth-inning
grand slam by designated hitter Craig Thompson, but their battery
was the story. Catcher John Salter _ a backup who entered the game
with a .182 batting average, no homers and 1 RBI _ went 4 for 5
with two homers and four RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Salter, a senior who was starting his third game of the season,
hit a three-run homer in the fifth to give the Cardinal a 5-0 lead.
That was enough for freshman right-hander Brian Sager, who showed
why he was among the nation's top recruits last year.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA only hit the ball hard against Sager (5-0) in two innings _
the fifth and sixth. Scott's record-breaking two-run homer in the
sixth cut Stanford's lead to 5-4. It was the sixth consecutive game
in which Scott hit a homer, and it was also the 25th homer for the
former Alemany High standout.
</P>
<P>
   Sager wobbled after Scott's homer, giving up a single to Garrett
Atkins, but UCLA's Eric Reece grounded into an inning-ending double
play.
</P>
<P>
   Sager allowed seven hits, struck out six and came two outs away
from his second complete game of the season. He also walked one;
four UCLA pitchers combined to walk 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a great pitching performance and that helped us,'' said
Stanford coach Mark Marquess.

<P>
   On a bluff overlooking the Mississippi River, a statue of
Jefferson Davis stands tall in the middle of Confederate Park in
Memphis, Tenn. Appropriately, his back is turned to the river, and
he peers east into downtown.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was here that Memphians gathered on June 6, 1862, to watch
the Battle of Memphis in the river below. The Yankee ironclads
quickly whipped the Southern gunboats. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But May 11, the Confederacy -- or its descendants -- won one.
The Memphis Park Commission retreated from a plan to oust the Rebel
president and rename the 90-year-old park. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The name would have been familiar to those in Kansas City, Mo.:
the Richard and Annette Bloch Cancer Survivors Park, similar to the
one west of the Country Club Plaza. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Despite the setback, the R.A. Bloch Cancer Foundation is still
willing to give Memphis up to $1 million for a park. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Opponents have no quarrel with a cancer survivors park -- so
long as it's not in Confederate Park. To them, the park board's
plan was an attempt to sweep away a symbol of a lost cause. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``When you say `Confederate,' people have been brainwashed to
think slavery and racism,'' said Ronnie Mangrum, heritage director
of the Tennessee Division, Sons of Confederate Veterans. ``They
picked this park because they thought, `Who'll support a
Confederate symbol?' '' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   John Malmo, the park board chairman who said it was his idea,
rejected suggestions of ``political correctness.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But he's backing down. ``Even my wife and son think it was a
nutty idea,'' he said. ``I didn't want that fringe ... of the
public here to hold a grudge against the survivors park.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Memphis is now an African-American majority city with its first
black mayor. The park board says it offered up Confederate Park
because the Bloch money would help maintain the 2.5 acres of green
space. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Fred Davis, a former city councilman and one of two
African-Americans on the five-member park board, played down any
racial element of the issue. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I don't have much heritage in Jefferson Davis,''
he said, ``but I don't want it responded to on that level.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After the park board selected Confederate Park, the editorial
cartoonist for the Memphis Commercial Appeal drew a cartoon that
asked: ``Which symbol speaks better for Memphis?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Over a rebel soldier carrying a Confederate flag, a caption read
``Fought to preserve slavery and lost,'' while the caption over a
cancer survivor in a wheelchair read ``Fought to preserve life and
won.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't that sad?'' Richard Bloch said of the dispute. H&AMP;R Block
Inc.'s co-founder, who has twice survived bouts with cancer, said
his foundation had nothing to do with selecting Confederate Park,
and he regretted the hard feelings. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Before last week's turnaround, Bloch sounded like a man ready to
compromise. Even the Davis statue could have stayed where it was. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``They wouldn't have to do a thing. We can build around
anything.''  &QL; 
Another Kansas City link &QL;
</P>
<P>
   About 1907, Kansas City, Mo., landscape architect George
Kessler, who earlier had designed Kansas City's park and boulevard
system, laid out the Memphis parks. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Confederate Park, with its trees, walkways, flowers and benches,
is considered the best remaining example of Kessler's work. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson Davis didn't arrive until 1964, after a public fund
drive. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In its two-year search for a place to direct the Bloch effort,
the commission rejected two other sites. Malmo said Confederate
Park was ideal because of its downtown location accessible to
pedestrians. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He said the statue could have been moved to the smaller
Jefferson Davis Park about 300 yards away. That would have left the
city with two parks dedicated to Civil War figures. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The other is the much larger Forrest Park, the site of the tomb
of Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest, the first grand wizard of the Ku
Klux Klan. &QL; 
Voice of opposition &QL;
</P>
<P>
   John T. Wilkinson III, second in command of the Tennessee
Division, Sons of the Confederate Veterans, can see Confederate
Park from his downtown law office. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He's the great-great-grandson of a Confederate soldier, and he
disputed the park board on nearly every point: One of the other
sites more centrally located would have been perfect; Confederate
Park is in good shape except for some repair needed on a stone
rampart; and he didn't want to move the statue into Jefferson Davis
Park, a sliver of land he calls a park in name only. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rallies were planned. The park board and the Bloch Foundation
received complaints from people across the South. Wilkinson was
ready to mount a legal effort. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He hesitates to speak directly to the motives of those who
wanted to rename the park. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, ``monuments as our ancestors saw fit to erect
should be preserved ... . People ought to respect each others'
heritage and let them be proud of what they want to be proud of and
work toward a little mutual education.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Slavery, he said, ``might have been the occasion for the war,
but certainly not the cause of war. The problem primarily was a
sectional conflict with economic overtones.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Colin Pulley, national heritage director of the Sons of
Confederate Veterans, said ignorance of history is behind
``heritage violations'' across the South, whether efforts to keep
rebel flags out of cemeteries or to ban the wearing of Confederate
symbols in schools. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``As heirs of Confederate soldiers, we are the legitimate heirs
of Confederate symbols'' and have the right to control their use,
he said. He opposes hate groups that ``misuse the Confederate flag
in a racist manner. That is offensive to us.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Johnnie R. Turner, executive director of the Memphis branch of
the NAACP, wasn't surprised that the park board backed down. ``I
knew they would have a fight on their hands, that those Civil War
buffs would come out of the woodwork.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Her group took no stand on the matter, although Turner thinks a
remake of the park would have meant ``one more reminder of slavery
gone.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To her, Confederate symbols are detestable. ``You would have a
hard time convincing my Jewish friends that anything having to do
with Hitler has any historical value.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Blacks in Memphis, she said, also have to put up with Forrest
Park, where the Klan founder is buried. ``We despise and detest
that park.'' &QL;

THE HANDS THAT GUIDE RUSSIA ARE SHAKING, UNCONTROLLED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By C.W. GUSEWELLE  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It may be that a reliable psychiatric diagnosis cannot be
rendered on the basis of pictures in the newspaper. But all the
same, the photos that accompanied the report of yet another
shake-up in the Russian Cabinet were more than a little
disturbing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Probably it does not matter so much whether Yevgeny Primakov or
Sergei Stepashin occupies the post of prime minister. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It would matter a great deal, however, if one of the largest and
most dangerously disordered nations on the face of the planet
happened to be led by a man whose years of dissipation and
consequent wretched health have left him too unstable to govern
even himself and his erratic impulses, much less the affairs of his
country. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The two pictures of Boris Yeltsin that ran with stories about
his dismissal Wednesday of his premier presented the swollen,
flushed and contorted visage of a sick man _ a man out of control. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They were, one might almost think, portraits of a madman. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Before these words see print, events in Moscow may have taken
yet another lurch, with a vote in the Parliament on a motion for
Yeltsin's impeachment. He has weathered legislative storms before,
and his gift for surviving _ if not for leading _ is as prodigious
as his thirst. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But however this crisis plays, it is clear that time has run out
on the West's implicit policy of ``better Boris, with all his
faults, than the dangerous unknown.'' What Yeltsin provides isn't
stability but paralysis, and the two are not to be confused. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the spectacle of his disintegration resembles
nothing quite so much as the last years of the old Communist bosses
before Mikhail Gorbachev. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Stumbling and witless, they were propped up like puppets on
ceremonial occasions to watch the tanks and missiles grind across
Red Square -- the theory being that a dead man at the helm was
better than the risk of change. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And, in the end, the theory was absolutely right. Gorbachev
brought change that cost the Communists their monopoly of power and
Russia its empire, but opened the way to the possibility, at least,
of a better and decent future. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Uncertainty? Of course that will come with the transition. It's
said that the Chinese character for ``crisis'' can serve to mean
either ``danger'' or ``opportunity.'' In any case, what could be
more dangerous than the confusion and drift that characterize the
present state of affairs in the Kremlin? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is much greatness in Russian culture and in the suffering
Russian people. The land is a storehouse of natural riches. Though
disfigured by history, it is a country waiting to be led to
greatness. But there's no use pretending Boris Yeltsin is the man
for the work. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Certainly he had an important role to play in Russia's time of
transition, just as Lech Walesa played a role in the winning of
Poland's freedom. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Who can forget those dramatic days and nights in August 1991,
when, barricaded inside the Russian Parliament building, he defied
the guns and armor of the hard-line junta drawn up on every side? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Like Walesa's, though, his moment passed. He's finished --
politically, physically, emotionally. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The need now isn't for an icon but for competence, a quality
that Yeltsin seems notoriously unsuited to provide. It's time to
identify and prepare to work with the ones who must shortly
follow. &QL;

SOCIAL SECURITY REFORMS WOULD PERPETUATE THE SYSTEM'S PROBLEMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Prospects for Social Security reform between now and next year's
election appear nil, which is probably just as well given the fact
that Washington doesn't understand what needs fixing.
</P>
<P>
   For the next decade or so, Social Security will be substantially
overfunded. Given that most of the reforms are designed to ``save''
the surplus Social Security revenue, real reform won't be possible
until the law is changed to allow Washington to ``save'' in the
sense most people understand the concept.
</P>
<P>
   What needs fixing are the legal barriers to true reform. As
things stand, Washington can either spend its revenue or pay down
federal debt. Period. Savings can be achieved only as a pretense,
with bookkeeping entries representing offsetting assets and
liabilities. Then everyone makes believe the result has actual
financial value.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Archer is a leading would-be reformer, but he seems to
suffer the same blind spot as most other agents of change. He
doesn't trust taxpayers with their own money. The House Ways and
Means Committee chairman's plan would create private retirement
accounts, which sounds like a step in the right direction. Archer's
approach, however, gives government control over all the money,
which is the root of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel J. Mitchell, a Heritage Foundation expert on Social
Security reform, denounces the plan as the worst of all worlds,
because it addresses the wrong problems. The problems of
excessively high payroll taxes and shamefully low rates of return
on Social Security contributions are ignored, Mitchell says.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Archer plan, Social Security tax levels would remain
unchanged, while government would fund each personal retirement
account with contributions amounting to 2 percent of the taxpayer's
wages up to a maximum of $1,500. When the taxpayer retires, the
government would use the money to pay the retiree's Social Security
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``In other words,'' Mitchell recently explained in an analysis
in The Wall Street Journal, ``the legislation makes all of us pay
twice. We (continue to pay) a payroll tax to Social Security. But
now the government will take a big chunk of our income taxes,
redistribute those funds to savings accounts for the overall
population, and then use the interest and principal from these
accounts to fund our Social Security benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, Mitchell contends, ``borrows the worst features of
the Clinton plan and then adds some warts for good measure.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell doesn't get into it, but the Archer approach also runs
into the same legal wall that is a barrier to nearly every proposal
for real reform. It apparently works off the assumption that
government's money can be ``saved,'' when it can't under current
law. For reform to make a difference, personal retirement accounts
must be funded with real-world assets having marketplace value
rather than fictional government accounting contrivances. As the
system is currently constituted, this can't be done.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, no matter what form change takes, the only Social
Security reform worthy of the name will provide for real people
channeling real money into real investments. In other words, more
control of the process must be given to the taxpayers in whose name
the funds are being set aside for retirement.

AFTER LITTLETON, REPUBLICANS REPOSITION THEMSELVES IN GUN DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID GOLDSTEIN  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Last month, Sen. John Ashcroft could be heard
throughout Missouri trumpeting the benefits of a ballot question to
remove the ban on carrying concealed weapons. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But last week, the Missouri Republican was in the thick of the
Senate gun control debate, winning passage of an amendment to
restrict the possession of assault weapons by juveniles. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even the staunchest supporters and biggest financial
beneficiaries of the gun rights lobby _ and Ashcroft is one _ are
scrambling for political cover after the massacre last month that
left 15 dead at a Colorado high school. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Littleton has crystallized this debate, making it
significantly more salient in the minds of voters and moving this
up to one of the top concerns people have,'' said Neil Newhouse, a
Republican pollster. ``Republicans have got to be more responsive
to American public opinion.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And they tried to be last week by agreeing to limited weapons
restrictions for juveniles. But by week's end, the political chaos
on Capitol Hill offered proof that the fallout from the Littleton
shootings would linger and become one of the currents in the 2000
election. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole has set herself apart from other Republican
presidential candidates by backing child safety locks and the
assault weapons ban, and opposing the right to carry concealed
weapons. The leading contender, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, favors
background checks for those who purchase guns at gun shows. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Post-Littleton politics is a vastly changed landscape when it
comes to guns, an issue that the Republican Party has long relied
upon to galvanize opposition to Democrats and produce a healthy
stream of campaign money. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1997-98, gun rights groups gave Republican candidates almost
$1.6 million, with the bulk coming from the National Rifle
Association. Democrats received $310,000. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Polls after the Colorado school massacre show the public
supports stiffer gun control laws. And suburban voters,
particularly women, could become a potent force for the candidate
who taps into their concerns. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri, the House minority leader,
described a recent moment in his St. Louis district that he said
captured the mood. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going to a meeting,'' Gephardt said.``Two women outside
the meeting cornered me, and they kept saying, `What are you going
to do to protect our children? We want to take our kids out of the
school because we're afraid for their safety. What are we -- what
are you -- going to do to help solve this problem?' '' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft is a strong supporter of gun rights who faces a
re-election battle -- and suddenly is exposed to a different
political climate. Gun rights groups contributed $15,850 to him
between 1993 and 1998, according to the Center for Responsive
Politics. Only seven other senators received more during that
period. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Missouri Gov. Mel Carnahan, a Democrat seeking to unseat
Ashcroft next year, has been trying to paint him as politically
extreme. And the gun control debate might have given him a broader
brush. Carnahan was quick to attack Ashcroft on Wednesday after
Ashcroft opposed a Democratic amendment requiring mandatory
background checks at gun shows that was part of a youth violence
bill. Ashcroft voted for a Republican version that called for
voluntary background checks. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Sen. Ashcroft has proven once again that he cannot be trusted
to make sound decisions about gun safety issues,'' Carnahan said.
``He continues to carry the (NRA's) water.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft spokesman Steve Hilton said he saw no connection or
conflict between the senator's strong support of Proposition B, the
NRA-backed measure to lift Missouri's ban on concealed weapons that
failed last month, and his efforts to curb juvenile violence.
Hilton mentioned Ashcroft's push, which dates back to last summer,
for tougher penalties for disturbed students who bring weapons to
school. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But in post-Littleton politics, Republicans are playing defense
and Democrats have the momentum. The response to the first Senate
vote Wednesday was quick and stinging. Voting largely along party
lines, senators defeated an amendment that would have required
background checks for anyone who purchased guns at a gun show. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I am stunned that less than one month after the worst school
shooting in our nation's history, the Senate has decided to make it
easier for felons, fugitives and other prohibited purchasers to buy
guns,'' Attorney General Janet Reno said at a news conference
Thursday morning. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By that afternoon, Republicans had regrouped. Republican Sen.
Larry Craig of Idaho, an NRA board member, offered a plan that the
NRA helped craft that would require background checks for all
purchases at gun shows. Their version required the checks to be
done within 24 hours, not 72 as the Democrats had envisioned. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It passed 48-47, with Ashcroft in favor, and with 40 Democrats
and seven Republicans opposed. Opponents claimed that it was a sham
proposal, merely a political veil to protect them from criticism. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a related move, Ashcroft trumped Democratic Sen. Dianne
Feinstein of California, who had been pushing a juvenile
semi-automatic assault weapons ban for some time. Ashcroft offered
an amendment to require parental consent for youths to obtain such
weapons. But it also contained more exceptions than Feinstein's,
including loopholes if the weapon is used for work, the military,
ranching, farming, hunting, target practice or self-defense. Her
exception largely dealt with military uses. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Ashcroft measure passed 96-2.
</P>
<P>
   But Fred Yang, a Democratic pollster working for Carnahan,
called Ashcroft's positioning in the gun debate ``transparent.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``A month ago, he was the poster boy for Proposition B,'' Yang
said. ``Now he's reversed course and tried to say he really
believes in gun control. It's saying they're worried about this.'' &QL;

CO-OP SHOPPING ONLINE IS AIM OF NEW MERCATA VENTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN COOK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ In September, Tom Van Horn sat in a room with
Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen discussing the hottest trend in
business: electronic commerce. Thinking in grandiose terms _ in a
way only a multibillionaire can _ Allen asked Van Horn if he would
like to build an e-commerce company that sells everything.
</P>
<P>
   Van Horn, who had previously run two of Allen's software
companies, knew it was a huge opportunity. But he still had one
question.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said would it be OK if we started with less than everything
and built our way up,'' Van Horn recalls. Allen agreed, and
Bellevue-based Mercata was born.
</P>
<P>
   Mercata (www.mercata.com), which takes its name from the Latin
word for market, officially launches its electronic commerce store
today. Mercata differs from other e-commerce sites, allowing groups
of users to form what are essentially virtual co-ops where shoppers
can get volume discounts on merchandise ranging from garden tools
to camcorders.
</P>
<P>
   Mercata is by no means the largest e-commerce site on the
Internet, nor the first to sell a wide range of products. Still,
some industry analysts say that Mercata could transform the way
goods are sold on the Internet through a flexible pricing system
called PowerBuys.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is major,'' said Jack Staff, chief economist and director
of e-commerce at Zona Research in Redwood City, Calif. ``They are
going to be a potent player.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken Cassar, a technology analyst at Jupiter Communications,
agreed. He said Mercata's method of selling products is intriguing
and one that could have wide appeal for shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, what they are doing is what I call syndicated
buying,'' said Cassar. ``They get people together who want to buy
the same product, and then they try to negotiate the best price for
that group with wholesalers.''
</P>
<P>
   As more people sign up to buy an item _ say, a set of golf clubs
_ the price drops.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike EBay's auction site, where only one person ends up with a
winning bid, Mercata's model allows multiple buyers to be winners,
Van Horn said. Unlike Amazon.com, which warehouses and ships the
books and music its customers order, Mercata is strictly a broker.
</P>
<P>
   Working solely as a middleman, Mercata could be the biggest
winner of all. Van Horn would not comment on revenue projections
but did say he is confident the company can reach profitability
sooner than other e-commerce start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Although some say Mercata provides an interesting spin on
electronic commerce, it is not an entirely new concept.
</P>
<P>
   For years, corporations have used their buying power to
negotiate discount prices with manufacturers. Mercata is using the
Internet to organize Web shoppers into a massive consumer
co-operative that works much the same way.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can bring people together through the Internet both to
have buying power and to share their common interests in a way that
you never could (before),'' said Van Horn, who came up with the
idea he calls ``We-Commerce'' after evaluating dozens of other
electronic commerce businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the new venture has generated a lot of interest
among analysts, Mercata now has the tough task of wooing customers.
After all, the company's success depends on the number of users who
place orders to buy on the products.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Mercata only brings together 10 people to buy the same
product, then they are not going to be able to successfully
negotiate with manufacturers,'' Jupiter Communications' Cassar
said. ``So at the end of the day, their success will be determined
by their marketing budget.''
</P>
<P>
   Reports are circulating that Mercata may spend more than
$10million on an advertising campaign beginning this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Priceline.com, a Connecticut company which launched its
innovative airplane ticket buying service in April 1998, last year
spent
</P>
<P>
   $24 million on a sales and marketing push that included
advertisements narrated by actor William Shatner. Van Horn has not
yet beamed up the services of Captain Kirk, but the chief
executive's goals are just as ambitious as Priceline or EBay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want people in a diner in Kansas City to be talking about
this while they are sipping a cup of coffee,'' he said. Already,
the company has doubled employment in the past two months to more
than 50 workers.
</P>
<P>
   Van Horn would not comment on the $10 million marketing figure
or the amount of financing the company has raised through Vulcan
Ventures, Paul Allen's venture capital business.
</P>
<P>
   But Van Horn did say the company has developed some unique
marketing tricks to lure users. One feature on the Web site is
called ``Share The Power,'' a button that allows users to e-mail
friends and family about product offerings. If one or two of those
people place a buy order on a product, the price will drop for all
involved, Van Horn said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think about it as the power of six degrees of separation,''
Van Horn said. ``This uses word of mouth marketing in a way that is
very different than most e-commerce sites.''
</P>
<P>
   Competition is looming just around the corner. A San Francisco
start-up called Accompany.com recently launched a similar service
for computer hardware, and several Silicon Valley companies are
rumored to be eyeing the market.
</P>
<P>
   Accompany.com _ which recently closed on $4 million in financing
and boasts Forbes publisher Rich Karlgaard as a board member _ does
not view Mercata as a major threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a bit of a different model than Mercata; they are
trying to build a destination site,'' said Accompany.com co-founder
and chief executive Jim Rose.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Van Horn, who has an MBA from the Wharton School at the
University of Pennsylvania, is not too worried about the
competition. Instead, the veteran businessman is concentrating more
on expanding the company's customer base and product mix.
</P>
<P>
   Just how many products does Van Horn hope to add in the coming
months? Put it this way: Mercata has already registered the Web
address for www.everything.com.

COLLEGE GENDER GAP MEANS MORE WOMEN THAN MEN ARE GRADUATING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNN FRANEY  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Peggy Nothnagel was fed up with trying to
raise two kids on the pay she earned from minimum-wage jobs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She decided to go back to school. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now, she's a student at Penn Valley Community College in Kansas
City, Kan., and plans to become an administrative assistant, a
position she hopes will bring better job security, pay and
benefits. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nothnagel, 27, is part of a wave of women swamping college
campuses today. Women graduates will outnumber men at many
commencements this spring. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, men's share of bachelor's degrees declined from 81
percent in 1900 to less than 45 percent today. Missouri and Kansas
mirror that decline. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The trend is cause for both celebration and concern, educators
say. While increased education may help women take a step forward
in salaries and prestige, it could create new tensions among men
and women as they adjust to changing roles. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``(The trend) is absolutely staggering. It's a change that's so
profound and pervasive,'' said Thomas Mortenson, a higher education
researcher from Iowa who has analyzed the graduation gender gap.
``But because it's happening so slowly we don't perceive it or talk
about it.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not everybody agrees. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Joni Finney, vice president of the National Center for Public
Policy and Higher Education in California, believes the trend
unfairly has eclipsed concerns such as improving higher education
access for poor people and racial minorities. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We're making a bit more of it than is really there,'' she
said. `` ... Men were ahead for so long and people didn't have the
same reaction.'' &QL; 
By the numbers &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Women in 1900, then not quite half of the U.S. population,
earned less than 20 percent of the bachelor's degrees. By 1997,
women -- now 51 percent of the population -- earned more than 55
percent of the degrees. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-seven percent of all 1997 college graduates in Missouri
and Kansas were women. Women earned 55 percent of the bachelor's
degrees and 62 percent of the graduate degrees in Kansas. Women
earned 57 percent of both bachelor's and master's degrees in
Missouri. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The trend has set off debate about the the college gender gap's
effect and what it says about our society and economy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Bernard, president of the American Association of
University Women, said highlighting the college gender gap deflects
attention from women's continued inequality in the work force,
including college teaching. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bernard and other educators also argue that although women earn
the majority of college degrees, they are still overrepresented in
traditionally female disciplines such as education and nursing.
Women still lag in earning degrees that lead to higher-paying jobs
in engineering and computer technology. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Anthony Carnevale, vice president for public leadership with
the Educational Testing Service, said 85 percent of women with
bachelor's degrees in 1959 worked in education and health care.
Today, fewer than 40 percent do. &QL; 
Financial reality &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Amber Eppinger graduated Saturday with a master's in business
administration from Park College in Parkville, Mo. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City, Kan., resident sought self-fulfillment and
financial security with her degree. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something I've always wanted,'' said Eppinger, 26, who
works in the insurance industry. ``I also want to be able to be
self-sustaining. I want to know I can get a job and take care of
myself.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Finney said the need for financial security usually drives
women's educational success. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The cold, hard reality is that (higher education) pays,'' she
said. ``For women, the payoff is pretty significant.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some high-paying jobs that typically attract men -- such as
construction and manufacturing -- don't require college education.
Women who don't go to college face bleak financial prospects. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Women need far more education than men to achieve the same
income, Carnevale said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, he said, women with bachelor's degrees earned
$33,000 on average in 1997, compared with $53,000 for men with
bachelor's degrees. Women with graduate degrees earned $43,000. Men
with graduate degrees earned $70,000. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Other, harder-to-measure social reasons besides economic
motivation may underlie women's success in higher education,
observers say. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some educators say women are more focused in school. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Doug Toma, an assistant professor of education at the University
of Missouri-Kansas City, works with graduate students. His female
students tend to do better, paying attention to details and
striving to do everything the best they can. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The ones that power through tend more often to be women,'' he
said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In high school, girls generally get better grades while boys
tend to get higher scores on standardized tests. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Toma said habits learned early on have prepared women to
persevere in college. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a law student back in the late '80s, I spent most
of my time drinking coffee and drinking beer and reading novels and
eating donuts,'' he said. ``The women in our class were just more
serious. Maybe they felt they had something to prove.'' &QL; 
Implications &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With more women taking their new skills into the career world,
salaries and promotions could equalize. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Men's lagging success in higher education also could mean
problems for men financially and socially. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As the U.S. economy moves from manufacturing to service, men
without post-high school training could be squeezed out. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Men are angry and women are stressed,'' Carnevale said.
``Women are working and raising families and not making enough
money. Men are angry because they're losing their place ... . A lot
of men feel disenfranchised.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The gender gap also could affect personal relationships. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The most immediate consequence is a huge number of
college-educated women who are not going to find a college-educated
man to marry,'' Mortenson said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Recent college graduate Trina Philpot understands the
predicament. She and her sorority sisters at William Woods
University have lamented the dearth of men to date who share their
intellectual interests. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very frustrating,'' said Philpot, 21, who went to Park
Hill High School in Kansas City, Mo., and plans to apply to law
school. ``Many guys are complacent with just working. Complacency
is just not where I'm at.'' &QL;

COMMENTARY: CAN SUMMERS EXTEND RUBIN'S WIN STREAK? 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Never succeed a legend.
</P>
<P>
   That is good advice for college sports coaches asked to replace
a man who set the standard for excellence. If the new coach manages
to carry on the tradition, he gets little credit. If not, he is
hounded out of town by disappointed fans.
</P>
<P>
   All of which brings us to Larry Summers, who gets to follow
Robert Rubin as Treasury secretary. Rubin is viewed by almost
everyone as having done a brilliant job while presiding over the
most amazing economic growth this country has seen in many decades.
</P>
<P>
   It often seemed as if Rubin and Summers, as his peripatetic
deputy, were running the State Department, not the Treasury
Department. When Mexico collapsed, they were the people who decided
what to do. Ditto for Asia. It was Rubin who played the leading
role in deciding to arrange an International Monetary Fund package
to help Russia last year, and who then decided, when things got
much worse, not to pony up more billions.
</P>
<P>
   In all the commentary that accompanied Summers' nomination last
week, it was remarkable how much of it dealt with overseas events.
Would he be diplomatic enough to not offend Japanese sensibilities
while pushing Japan to adopt growth-oriented policies? Could he do
anything to repair our relations with China? It was as though the
American economy were the least of the concerns for a Treasury
secretary, circa 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Summers knows better. He knows that he is walking into a
situation ripe with complacency from Washington to Wall Street to
Main Street. Politicians assume that the unusually favorable
economic conditions that have produced budget surpluses, full
employment and low inflation will last forever. The stock market is
valued as if recessions and inflation had been abolished, while
computer-related productivity gains were certain to boost growth
for years to come. Consumers have _ at least until the past couple
of months _ been spending with abandon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Complacency,'' said Summers in a recent speech, ``will be
self-denying prophecy if it leads to unrealistic expenditure plans,
excessive capacity creation, inappropriate asset valuations, or
misguided credit expansion.'' In fact, it is probably doing all of
those things.
</P>
<P>
   One part of that complacency has been Wall Street's confidence
that the Federal Reserve Board will not dare to try to slow things
down by raising interest rates. That assurance was shaken a bit by
Friday's report that consumer prices rose faster than expected last
month.
</P>
<P>
   It should be no surprise that inflation is ticking up. The
pressures that forced down prices last year _ rising unemployment
and collapsing currencies in Asia _ are reversing. That does not
mean prices will zoom, but it might alarm investors who have
assumed inflation is dead.
</P>
<P>
   Summers has also called attention to the country's trade
deficit, which is rising to record levels. Without last year's
chaos in world markets _ and the current crises in Europe _ the
rising deficit would have caused the value of the dollar to fall,
as foreigners who were being paid in dollars for their goods tried
to sell the bucks.
</P>
<P>
   But there has been no currency that people were eager to buy.
The yen is hurt by the sluggish Japanese economy, while the euro
suffers from government policies that limit growth and from worries
over Yugoslavia and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing on the immediate horizon to spoil this party.
But the kind of excessive trade deficit now being run cannot
continue indefinitely. If, or when, other currencies start to look
more attractive, we could run into an old-fashioned
foreign-exchange crisis, with inflation up and the Fed tightening
credit to protect the currency. With interest rates rising and the
economy slowing, stock-market valuations might come down rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   If that happens in the next 20 months, it will not be Summers'
fault. But he will be blamed as people recall how good things were
before he got the job. If our good fortune continues, however, he
probably will not be given much of the credit. That is what happens
to people who succeed a legend.

MADELAINE CHAMBERS, 72, OPERA SINGER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., N.J., N.Y.)  (lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Madelaine Chambers, a lyric soprano who sang at the Metropolitan
Opera and the New York City Opera in the 1950s and '60s, died on
April 30 at the University of Pennsylvania Hospital in
Philadelphia. She was 72 and lived in Allentown, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was leukemia, said Leyna Gabriele, a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chambers attended New York University, Teachers College at
Columbia University and the Juilliard School. She also won a
Fulbright Award for vocal studies in Italy. She made her
professional debut in the early 1950s as Musetta in Puccini's
``Boheme'' at the Teatro Nuovo in Milan, Italy. She also won
several competitions, including the international contest for opera
singers in Lausanne, Switzerland, and the Marian Anderson
Scholarship Fund Auditions in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chambers made her New York City Opera debut as Micaela in
Bizet's ``Carmen'' in 1954; the next evening she sang Zerlina in
Mozart's ``Don Giovanni.'' In 1955 she was a winner of the
Metropolitan Opera's Auditions of the Air and was signed to the
company's roster in 1956. At the Met she appeared in Verdi's
``Forza del Destino,'' Puccini's ``Madama Butterfly'' and Mozart's
``Nozze di Figaro.''
</P>
<P>
   After her retirement Ms. Chambers taught voice at Princeton
University and the State University of New York at Purchase.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by her husband, Alex Herenchak; a daughter,
Valerie, and a son, Gregory, all of Allentown, and a stepdaughter,
Linda, of Stroudsburg, Pa.

ASRAT WOLDEYES OF ETHIOPIA, DOCTOR AND DISSENTER, DIES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa.)  (rk) 
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Asrat Woldeyes, a British-trained Ethiopian doctor who was a
leader of opposition to his country's present government, died on
Friday in the hospital of the University of Pennsylvania in
Philadelphia. He was in his early 70s.
</P>
<P>
   The causes were complications from a heart ailment and general
physical deterioration, said a nephew, Youm Abey Fesseba, the
Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   The nephew said Asrat, who taught medical students in Addis
Ababa, the Ethiopian capital, arrived in Philadelphia last month
and was hospitalized for three weeks before his death. He also had
high blood pressure and diabetes that gravely affected his vision.
</P>
<P>
   Asrat had led the All-Amhara People's Party, which has
criticized the government.
</P>
<P>
   He was fervent in his own criticism of Prime Minister Meles
Zenawi's government, and in particular of the formation of new
autonomous regions reflecting ethnic and linguistic considerations.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994 he became a political prisoner in Ethiopia, and he
served out a five-year prison sentence on charges of having incited
an armed rebellion against the government through his party and of
complicity in organizing an anti-government uprising in part of
northwestern Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
   The British medical journal The Lancet reported in March that he
had been hospitalized for months in Ethiopia, had spent nine days
in the intensive care unit at Black Lion Hospital in Addis Ababa
after suffering cardiac failure and had been the subject of appeals
by Amnesty International and other medical and human rights
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   He was waiting to face another trial on similar charges when he
was temporarily freed from detention last December so that he could
travel to the United States for medical care. Then the prosecutor
withdrew the charges and said he was physically unfit to be tried
again.
</P>
<P>
   When Asrat was released, the British foreign minister, Tony
Lloyd, said, ``I believe this signals a clear commitment by the
Ethiopian government to uphold their human rights obligations.''
</P>
<P>
   Asrat practiced medicine in Ethiopia for more than a
quarter-century and was personal physician to Emperor Haile
Selassie, who reigned from 1930 to 1974 and died in 1975. When the
present government took power in 1991, Asrat founded the All-Amhara
People's Party. Soon afterward he was dismissed from his post at
Black Lion Hospital.

CO-OP SHOPPING ONLINE IS AIM OF NEW MERCATA VENTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN COOK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ In September, Tom Van Horn sat in a room with
Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen discussing the hottest trend in
business: electronic commerce. Thinking in grandiose terms _ in a
way only a multibillionaire can _ Allen asked Van Horn if he would
like to build an e-commerce company that sells everything.
</P>
<P>
   Van Horn, who had previously run two of Allen's software
companies, knew it was a huge opportunity. But he still had one
question.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said would it be OK if we started with less than everything
and built our way up,'' Van Horn recalls. Allen agreed, and
Bellevue-based Mercata was born.
</P>
<P>
   Mercata (www.mercata.com), which takes its name from the Latin
word for market, officially launches its electronic commerce store
today. Mercata differs from other e-commerce sites, allowing groups
of users to form what are essentially virtual co-ops where shoppers
can get volume discounts on merchandise ranging from garden tools
to camcorders.
</P>
<P>
   Mercata is by no means the largest e-commerce site on the
Internet, nor the first to sell a wide range of products. Still,
some industry analysts say that Mercata could transform the way
goods are sold on the Internet through a flexible pricing system
called PowerBuys.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is major,'' said Jack Staff, chief economist and director
of e-commerce at Zona Research in Redwood City, Calif. ``They are
going to be a potent player.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken Cassar, a technology analyst at Jupiter Communications,
agreed. He said Mercata's method of selling products is intriguing
and one that could have wide appeal for shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, what they are doing is what I call syndicated
buying,'' said Cassar. ``They get people together who want to buy
the same product, and then they try to negotiate the best price for
that group with wholesalers.''
</P>
<P>
   As more people sign up to buy an item _ say, a set of golf clubs
_ the price drops.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike EBay's auction site, where only one person ends up with a
winning bid, Mercata's model allows multiple buyers to be winners,
Van Horn said. Unlike Amazon.com, which warehouses and ships the
books and music its customers order, Mercata is strictly a broker.
</P>
<P>
   Working solely as a middleman, Mercata could be the biggest
winner of all. Van Horn would not comment on revenue projections
but did say he is confident the company can reach profitability
sooner than other e-commerce start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Although some say Mercata provides an interesting spin on
electronic commerce, it is not an entirely new concept.
</P>
<P>
   For years, corporations have used their buying power to
negotiate discount prices with manufacturers. Mercata is using the
Internet to organize Web shoppers into a massive consumer
co-operative that works much the same way.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can bring people together through the Internet both to
have buying power and to share their common interests in a way that
you never could (before),'' said Van Horn, who came up with the
idea he calls ``We-Commerce'' after evaluating dozens of other
electronic commerce businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the new venture has generated a lot of interest
among analysts, Mercata now has the tough task of wooing customers.
After all, the company's success depends on the number of users who
place orders to buy on the products.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Mercata only brings together 10 people to buy the same
product, then they are not going to be able to successfully
negotiate with manufacturers,'' Jupiter Communications' Cassar
said. ``So at the end of the day, their success will be determined
by their marketing budget.''
</P>
<P>
   Reports are circulating that Mercata may spend more than
$10million on an advertising campaign beginning this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Priceline.com, a Connecticut company which launched its
innovative airplane ticket buying service in April 1998, last year
spent
</P>
<P>
   $24 million on a sales and marketing push that included
advertisements narrated by actor William Shatner. Van Horn has not
yet beamed up the services of Captain Kirk, but the chief
executive's goals are just as ambitious as Priceline or EBay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want people in a diner in Kansas City to be talking about
this while they are sipping a cup of coffee,'' he said. Already,
the company has doubled employment in the past two months to more
than 50 workers.
</P>
<P>
   Van Horn would not comment on the $10 million marketing figure
or the amount of financing the company has raised through Vulcan
Ventures, Paul Allen's venture capital business.
</P>
<P>
   But Van Horn did say the company has developed some unique
marketing tricks to lure users. One feature on the Web site is
called ``Share The Power,'' a button that allows users to e-mail
friends and family about product offerings. If one or two of those
people place a buy order on a product, the price will drop for all
involved, Van Horn said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think about it as the power of six degrees of separation,''
Van Horn said. ``This uses word of mouth marketing in a way that is
very different than most e-commerce sites.''
</P>
<P>
   Competition is looming just around the corner. A San Francisco
start-up called Accompany.com recently launched a similar service
for computer hardware, and several Silicon Valley companies are
rumored to be eyeing the market.
</P>
<P>
   Accompany.com _ which recently closed on $4 million in financing
and boasts Forbes publisher Rich Karlgaard as a board member _ does
not view Mercata as a major threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a bit of a different model than Mercata; they are
trying to build a destination site,'' said Accompany.com co-founder
and chief executive Jim Rose.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Van Horn, who has an MBA from the Wharton School at the
University of Pennsylvania, is not too worried about the
competition. Instead, the veteran businessman is concentrating more
on expanding the company's customer base and product mix.
</P>
<P>
   Just how many products does Van Horn hope to add in the coming
months? Put it this way: Mercata has already registered the Web
address for www.everything.com.

Putt master Roberts takes sandy playoff win 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
IRVING, Texas _ Steve Pate never ventured into a bunker during the
GTE Byron Nelson Classic until his 73rd hole of the tournament. It
proved to be one trip too many.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Loren Roberts, meanwhile, established himself as the Sultan of
Sand Traps at the Four Seasons Resort and Club. He saved par after
every misadventure, with the most pivotal coming during yesterday's
one-hole playoff at the TPC at Las Colinas course.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Roberts closed out the biggest birdie barrage in
Nelson history with a sandy par. It was not the most artistic way
to end a two-year victory drought on the PGA Tour. But, at age 43,
it felt long overdue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd started doubting myself. I wondered if I had gotten too
old, with all these young guys out here,'' Roberts said. ``It's
nice to know I still have enough game to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicknamed the ``Boss of the Moss'' because of his putting
prowess, Roberts instead leaned on his sand wedge to pocket the
$540,000 winner's check. He closed with a 68, allowing Roberts and
Pate to finish 72 holes in a tournament-record 18-under par (262).
</P>
<P>
   To break the tie, the competitors returned to the 18th tee box
for a sudden-death playoff. Roberts stood over his second shot,
which he played from the right rough, with one thought in mind at
the par-4 hole guarded by multiple, greenfront bunkers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I didn't want to do was put it in the right
bunker,'' Roberts said, reflecting on a front-left pin placement.
``The way the wind was blowing, it was an almost impossible
up-and-down. It was too long of a shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he deposited a 5-wood approach in the left-hand bunker.
Pate, in turn, pushed an approach from the middle of the fairway
into the front-right bunker that Roberts took pains to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, Pate's lone bunker blast of the tournament hung
up in a 30 mph wind gust and stopped 20 feet short of the hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I hit it, I thought it would be within six feet,'' Pate
said, shrugging. ``I couldn't have done much more with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberts, in turn, blasted to within 18 inches to set up his
fourth sand save in four attempts during the tournament. It proved
to be the stroke that ended the first Nelson playoff since 1994 and
provided the third consecutive 40-plus winner at a PGA Tour stop in
Fort Worth-Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Watson, 49, is the defending champ at this week's MasterCard
Colonial. Roberts, 43, succeeds John Cook, 41, as the Nelson champ.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Pate, 37, he stood tall in swirling winds that blew
young hotshots such as Sergio Garcia (11 under) and Tiger Woods (9
under) out of contention. Garcia was in a three-player group that
tied for third, seven strokes short of participating in yesterday's
playoff.
</P>
<P>
   As their lead expanded throughout the final round, Pate said his
pairing with Roberts began feeling like a match-play competition.
If so, Roberts hit the most telling shot of the match with a
momentum-turning, 3-iron approach at No. 15.
</P>
<P>
   The 190-yard shot stopped three feet from the cup, allowing
Roberts to tap in for a birdie that offset a waterlogged, double
bogey at No. 14. The double bogey marked Roberts' lone over-par
score on his final 37 holes of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a pretty impressive comeback,'' Pate said.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts called it ``one of my best swings of the week.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of his other greatest hits were struck from sand traps,
including his tournament-clinching bunker blast at No. 18.
Suddenly, the ``Boss of the Moss'' had proved he could win more
than a putting contest on the PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, Tiger, Sergio and \RDavid\S Duval, that's the
future of golf right there,'' Roberts said. ``Mr. Nelson and Gene
Sarazen, that's the greatness of the past. I kind of fit somewhere
in the rest of the pack.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I know the young guys can't win every week. So I want to
be there with a chance to win when they're not on their games.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of whether Roberts needs a hot putter or a timely
bunker blast to return to the winner's circle on the PGA Tour. nn

`THE MUMMY' FAILS TO UNRAVEL AT BOX OFFICE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Action-adventure ``The Mummy'' continued to show
plenty of life at the nation's multiplexes as it dominated for the
second straight weekend with an impressive $25.1 million at 3,226
theaters during the Friday-Sunday period, studio sources said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Universal release, recalling the feel of the Indiana Jones
movies, lost 42 percent from its sensational $43.6 million debut
weekend. ``That's a fairly solid performance, particularly since
horror-type movies often don't have good legs,'' said movie analyst
Arthur Rockwell. ``It should have one more good weekend even with
the new `Star Wars' coming up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mummy,'' with Brendan Fraser battling an ancient evil
priest in 1926 Egypt, has hit $80 million in 10 days and is headed
toward joining the club of 60 films that have topped $150 million
domestically.
</P>
<P>
   It is also well-positioned to become the likely choice for
customers facing sold-out screenings of 20th Century Fox's ``Star
Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace'' after the prequel opens early
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   `` `The Mummy' was initially attracting teens and adults, but
it's not drawing a lot of kids even though it's pretty scary,''
said Robert Bucksbaum, president of the Reel Source tracking
service. ``It's going to be the main alternative to `Star Wars'
because there's just not much else, particularly for kids.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mummy'' has been the last major release prior to ``The
Phantom Menace'' with studios largely abandoning the weekend to
holdovers and a quartet of new niche films, which all finished in
the top 10. Leading the rest of the slate was Fox's third weekend
of ``Entrapment'' with a respectable $9.2 million at 2,878 theaters
to push its 17-day total to $51.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Fox Searchlight's opening of ``William Shakespeare's A Midsummer
Night's Dream'' followed in third with a moderate $4.6 million at
1,080 theaters as the latest version of the comedy, with Kevin
Kline and Calista Flockhart, benefited from strong reviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``I has the advantage of being the only new film in wide release
with a lot of appeal to women,'' Bucksbaum noted.
</P>
<P>
   Finishing a close fourth was Warner Bros.' seventh weekend of
``The Matrix'' with $4.5 million at 2,715 theaters as the
science-fiction hit topped the $145 million mark after 47 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Matrix'' is already the 65th-highest domestic grosser
ever, passing ``Beauty and the Beast.''
</P>
<P>
   Artisan's opening of martial-arts thriller ``Black Mask'' kicked
in a lukewarm $3.9 million at 979 theaters to finish fifth,
followed by Universal's fifth weekend of prison-comedy ``Life''
with $2.9 million at 2,240 theaters to top $55 million overall.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's sixth weekend of ``Never Been Kissed'' came in seventh
with $2.6 million at 2,282 sites, edging Artisan's opening of teen
comedy-romance ``Trippin' '' with a modest $2.5 million at 777
screens and Paramount's fourth weekend of critical favorite
``Election'' with $2.3 million at 827 theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Rounding out the top 10 was MGM's opening of World War II
comedy-drama ``Tea with Mussolini'' with a solid $1.5 million at
270 theaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can probably sustain that kind of performance if they
keep it in limited release,'' Bucksbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   Universal also reported strong response from its Saturday night
sneak preview of ``Notting Hill,'' a romantic comedy with Julia
Roberts and Hugh Grant slotted for a May 28 opening.
</P>
<P>
   The studio said attendance at the 856 theaters hit 90 percent
and was divided equally among male and female moviegoers.
</P>
<P>
   Bucksbaum said ``Notting Hill'' should perform well with a final
domestic gross of $65 million and added that Paramount's ``Runaway
Bride,'' another romantic comedy with Roberts, is likely to be
among the summer's top four performers after its July 23 opening.
</P>
<P>
   Overall business totaled a moderate $71 million, about the same
as the same weekend last year.

HOW LAKERS AND SPURS MATCH UP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Centers: When the Spurs' David Robinson was in his
prime, he could handle Shaquille O'Neal, and the Spurs won all five
matchups against O'Neal's Orlando Magic teams. Then O'Neal joined
the Lakers and his teams won five straight against the Spurs in
games in which he and Robinson both played. The Lakers' loss to San
Antonio on April 24 was their first with O'Neal in the lineup.
O'Neal averaged 26.7 points, 11.7 rebounds and 2.33 blocked shots
in three games vs. the Spurs this season. Robinson averaged 12.7
points and 6.0 rebounds. __ Edge: Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   __ Forwards: For the second straight series, the Lakers'
frontcourt will have its hands full. Tim Duncan, in just his second
year, is the premier power forward in the league and an MVP
candidate (21.7 points, 11.4 rebounds) who could overwhelm the
Lakers' J.R. Reid and Robert Horry. San Antonio's Sean Elliott, a
career of injuries behind him, averaged 11.2 points this season,
and his quickness could pose problems for Glen Rice. If Rice's
right elbow holds up, his 20 or so points per game could help even
this matchup. __ Edge: Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   __ Guards: Kobe Bryant will make the difference here, playing
against the older, less agile Mario Elie. Bryant averaged 17.0
points in three regular-season games against the Spurs. In Derek
Fisher and Avery Johnson, the Lakers and Spurs have two of the more
underrated point guards. Each has struggled, but each has turned
heads with strong playoff performances, particularly Johnson (19.5
points, 6.3 assists in Round 1). Fisher has cooled a bit since
scoring 36 points in the Lakers' first two playoff games. __ Edge:
Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   __ Bench: The Lakers' reserves have come on strong since a poor
Game 1 against Houston. Robert Horry (7.0 points, 6.5 rebounds),
Derek Harper (7.0 points) and Rick Fox (6.5 points) have made key
postseason contributions. The Spurs have plenty of toughness off
the bench in Jerome Kersey, Will Perdue and Malik Rose, but little
scoring punch. Jaren Jackson led Spurs reserves with 5.8 points per
game in Round 1 of the playoffs, followed by Antonio Daniels (2.8
points). Ex-Bull Steve Kerr has yet to make an impact. __ Edge:
Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   __ Coach: If Gregg Popovich were a more hasty boss, the GM-coach
might have fired himself earlier this season when the Spurs
stumbled to a 6-8 start. But Popovich stayed cool and his team was
the best in the league over the final two months, earning top
seeding in the Western Conference. Lakers rookie-interim coach Kurt
Rambis survived his own shaky stretches, turning his team around
just in time for the playoffs. He has his players believing in each
other and working together, winning seven of their last eight. __
Edge: Even.
</P>
<P>
   __ Overall: The Spurs routed the Lakers by 27 points in their
most recent meeting, on April 24, but the Lakers are not the same
team. The Lakers won the first two meetings of the season, in
February, but that was a different San Antonio team, as well. Both
teams are playing at their peak and no one will stop O'Neal or
Duncan from getting 25 to 30 points per game. The series will come
down to the Lakers' patience running their offense against the
Spurs' tough defense. As long as O'Neal, Bryant and Rice are all
involved, the Lakers have the edge. San Antonio doesn't have the
offensive firepower to match them.
</P>
<P>
   __ Prediction: Lakers 4-2.

MOYER MAKES QUICK WORK OF K.C. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ It's unclear just how many 10-year-olds in
double-knits showed up at the Kingdome Sunday. But 36,637 fans came
out for the finale of Little League Weekend, and this time the
Mariners brought their big-league game.
</P>
<P>
   This was a short-attention-span kind of day, completed faster
(2:37) than any other M's win this season and featuring timely
heroics by Alex Rodriguez and Ken Griffey Jr. And if the players in
the stands kept close attention, so did the players on the field,
thanks to Jamie Moyer's eight shutout innings.
</P>
<P>
   Moyer's performance, which highlighted the Mariners' 5-1 victory
over the Kansas City Royals, was welcome on a weekend that saw the
M's allow 23 runs while losing Friday and Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice when we can get a solid performance like that; it
takes the heat off us and makes it a lot easier to win,'' first
baseman David Segui said. ``Especially on defense, in the later
innings you're not mentally exhausted. It's a lot easier to
concentrate and play defense when you know a guy's in the strike
zone, not throwing ball after ball after ball. It makes it easier
to keep your concentration level high.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners played flawless defense behind Moyer, twice turning
double plays to end innings. The veteran left-hander struck out
five and walked two, speading eight singles over eight innings.
With runners in scoring position, he limited the Royals to one hit
in seven at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of outing that has eluded Moyer for much of this
season. Only twice in eight starts had he worked six innings and
allowed three runs or fewer, and one of those times _ Tuesday's win
at Boston _ he was not especially pleased with his command.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Moyer threw a greater percentage of strikes than he did
in Boston and lasted deeper into the game than he had all year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jamie's a veteran,'' catcher Dan Wilson said. ``He's always
looking for ways to improve. We all knew it wasn't very far away.
Today, he made his pitches and just pitched outstanding. That's his
type of ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   Moyer (3-4) threw 121 pitches, a figure he's topped only once
since last July. The effort was needed, as manager Lou Piniella was
undermanned in relievers he uses when he needs a win. Jose Paniagua
had thrown 40 pitches Saturday, leaving a bullpen of three rookies
and closer Jose Mesa.
</P>
<P>
   Moyer said he was vaguely aware of bullpen activity in the
eighth inning, but he didn't know who was up and didn't concern
himself with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever it takes,'' Moyer said. ``To me, it's just another
area to waste energy in. I have to put my energy toward what I'm
doing on the mound and how I'm pitching. If they want me to give
them nine, I'll do my darndest to get to nine.''
</P>
<P>
   Piniella needed only eight Sunday, turning to Mesa for the
ninth. Jermaine Dye doubled and scored to spoil Seattle's chances
for its first shutout this season, but by then the M's already had
scored five runs.
</P>
<P>
   In the eight losses among their previous 11 games, the Mariners
had surrendered 84 runs, never giving up fewer than six. But the
way Moyer pitched, Seattle got all the runs it needed right away.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Hunter led off the first inning with a single _ his first
hit in 15 at-bats _ and took second when rookie Chris Fussell's
pickoff throw eluded first baseman Jeff King. Hunter scored on a
double by Rodriguez, who scored on a Butch Huskey sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez set up the Mariners' next rally. After Fussell had set
down six M's in order, the shortstop doubled down the left-field
line and scored on a single by Griffey. John Mabry's single brought
in Griffey, who delivered again in the seventh, wrapping a Scott
Service pitch around the foul pole and into the second deck in
right.
</P>
<P>
   It was Griffey's major league-leading 14th home run and third in
as many games. The homer was for insurance, not for catch-up, a
pleasant change for an offense that scored 17 runs in losing the
first two games of this series.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey, however, said the whole team shares the burden.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a long season; even the best teams go through it,'' he
said. ``We win as a team, we lose as a team. That's just the way it
is. It's not one man's fault. Two days ago, if I would have gotten
a base hit, we could have tied the game. It would have changed
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's clear the Mariners will take plenty more games like
this, where pitching and defense reward offense for a job done
well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball's a game of pitching, isn't it?'' Piniella said.
``Five runs, when you get a good-pitched game, is enough to win a
ballgame. That's exactly what we did today. It goes to show you if
you get good pitching, defense and timely hitting, you can win with
regularity. Today, we got some good pitching. It's a start.''

</P>
<P>
   SAFRICA-POLITICS (Uppington, South Africa) _ If South Africa's
second post-apartheid election campaign has offered any surprise at
all, it is the fuss that the Democratic Party has engendered. The
party and its antecedents, which traditionally represented wealthy,
English-speaking white liberals, consistently opposed apartheid and
were small but nagging irritants to the former white supremacist
Afrikaans-speaking regime. But even the ANC, which is expected to
coast to victory, perhaps with a two- thirds majority, has turned
its guns on the DP. By Suzanne Daley.

   IRAN-ARABS (Cairo) _ With his first foray into the Arab world,

Jehl.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-PENSIONS (Ludony, Russia) _ Russian debts are a funny
business, as big Western banks have learned to their horror and
chagrin. A pensioner here long ago stopped trying to figure out
when she will get her money. As she sees it, retrieving a pension
from the backlog that has piled up at the regional administrative

California Research Institute was one of the most corrupt research
enterprises ever discovered by law enforcement. And the abuses of
this one doctor point to weaknesses in the new system that has

   HAWAII-BAYWATCH (Haleiwa, Hawaii) _ The biggest economic fish

biggest fish is David Hasselhoff, the head-lifeguard of
``Baywatch,'' which is to begin filming here in July, rechristened
``Baywatch Hawaii.'' By Todd S. Purdum.

<P>
   WRESTLING-POLITICS (Glastonbury, Conn.) _ There may soon be a
parade of professional wrestlers who hope to duplicate last fall's
upset victory by Jesse Ventura, formerly ``the Body'' of the WWF
and now the governor of Minnesota. With huge built-in followings
and a sweaty instinct for pleasing the masses, these candidates
hope to tap voters' disgust with the same old political faces.
</P>

   JEFFERSON-REUNION (Charlottesville, Va.) _ If descendants of

   CRIME-DECLINE (Undated) _ Crime in the United States dropped
dramatically last year, the seventh consecutive year it has fallen,

violent crimes and property crimes each fell 7 percent in 1998,
creating the largest annual decline since crime began to decrease
in 1992. By Fox Butterfield.
</P>
<P>
   BREASTCANCER-STUDY (Undated) _ A new survey of women who took a
drastic measure to prevent breast cancer, having both healthy
breasts removed, shows that nearly 70 percent are satisfied with
their decision and would make the same choice if they had it to do
over again.

   DOLE-CAMPAIGN _ For all his devotion to Elizabeth Dole, and for
all the blessings he offers her campaign for president, Bob Dole is
nobody's compliant, stick-with-the-script,
gaze-lovingly-at-your-mate political spouse. In his first extensive
interview about the progress of his wife's campaign, Dole said he
wanted to give money to a rival candidate who was fighting for much
of her support. He conceded that Mrs. Dole's operation has had
growing pains, was slow to raise money early and was only beginning
to hit its stride. And while Dole was hopeful, he allowed that he
was by no means certain she would even stay in the race. By Richard

paper's senior executives have raced, or been pushed, out the door.
Nonetheless, Willes' faith in his vision has not waned. By Felicity

studies. Fiddes was conducting research fraud of audacious
proportions, cutting corners and inventing data to keep the money

JEFFERSON-REUNION-2, 5-16 -- United for the first time, decendants
of Thomas Jefferson and of his slave Sally Hemmings gathered over
the weekend at Monticello, his plantation, in Virginia. While
Jefferson descendants have been meeting here for the last 86 years,
no previous reunion has matched this one for sheer drama. In
November, geneticists supported what Sally Hemings descendants
always contended, that at least one of Hemings' sons, Eston, was
probably fathered by Jefferson. (Shana Raab/New York Times Photo)

Sen. Gordon H. Smith, R-Ore., who has been endorsed by the National
Rifle Association, is also part of a Republican shift on gun
control. Still, critics would argue that the Republican Party's
shifting stance on gun control was less a profile in courage than
an effort to get in front of the public opinion polls, which many
strategists believe show an electorate increasingly open to
regulating guns. (Stephen Crowley/New York Times Photo)

-- A 75-year-old impoverished pensioner, Aleksandra Varfolomeyeva
speaks with her sister-in-law, gesturing at left, whose horse had
just run away. Ms. Varfolomeyeva keeps ``lending'' her meager
pension payments to the Russian government, but not cheerfully.
Mrs. Varfolomeyeva long ago stopped trying to figure out when she
will get her money. As she sees it, retrieving a pension from the
government backlog that has piled up is sort of like a lottery.

Mirror Co. ``What we said 18 months ago was we've got to reinvent
this very large, very complicated newspaper,'' said Willes.
``Still, there is going to be a large amount of change and breakage
in the process.'' (Kim Kulish/New York Times Photo)

Amanda Belge, Joan Prados, Charles Musson, Emma Glenny and Marie
Estelle Moyer; at far right, from left, Dolores Rillieux Turner and
Sidney and Edwina Rillieux. Two years ago a book by Christopher
Benfey, ``Degas in New Orleans,'' set the city astir by revealing
that a branch of the Degas family in this city is descended from a
black woman, Constance Vivant, who had six children with Vincent
Rillieux, a brother of Degas' maternal grandmother. (Lee Celano/New

close Sunday in Raanana. In a stunning turn of events, two minor

paving the way for what polls predicted would be a conclusive
victory in Monday's elections for Barak, the leader of the Labor
Party. (Rina Castelnuovo/New York Times Photo)

of ``Baywatch'' will bring back headier times to their state's
sluggish economy. The arrival of the ``Baywatch'' brand name is
being heralded as a return to the heady boom years when ``Hawaii
Five-O'' and ``Magnum, P.I.'' symbolized Hawaii's international
appeal and seemingly limitless growth. (David Scull/New York Times

sluggish economy, but there is hope that ``Baywatch'' will bring
back headier times. The arrival of the ``Baywatch'' brand name is
being heralded as a return to the heady boom years when ``Hawaii

staff and his wife Rebecca, center, celebrated another successful

   (NYT7) WHITTIER, Calif. -- May 16, 1999 -- DRUG-TRIALS-II-1,
5-16 -- Susan Lester, a former study coordinator of Dr. Robert
Fiddes, says patients were ``pushed'' to participate in drug
studies. Fiddes was conducting research fraud of audacious
proportions, cutting corners and inventing data to keep the money
flowing from the drug industry. ``Patients often would say, 'I
don't want to participate in this, but I don't want to make him
mad,''' says Ms. Lester. (Ed Carreon/New York Times Photo)

   (NYT6) CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. -- May 16, 1999 --
JEFFERSON-REUNION-2, 5-16 -- United for the first time, decendants
of Thomas Jefferson and of his slave Sally Hemmings gathered over
the weekend at Monticello, his plantation, in Virginia. While
Jefferson descendants have been meeting here for the last 86 years,
no previous reunion has matched this one for sheer drama. In
November, geneticists supported what Sally Hemings descendants
always contended, that at least one of Hemings' sons, Eston, was
probably fathered by Jefferson. (Shana Raab/New York Times Photo)

Sen. Gordon H. Smith, R-Ore., who has been endorsed by the National
Rifle Association, is also part of a Republican shift on gun
control. Still, critics would argue that the Republican Party's
shifting stance on gun control was less a profile in courage than
an effort to get in front of the public opinion polls, which many
strategists believe show an electorate increasingly open to
regulating guns. (Stephen Crowley/New York Times Photo)

   (NYT1) LUDONY, Russia -- May 16, 1999 -- RUSSIA-PENSIONS, 5-16
-- A 75-year-old impoverished pensioner, Aleksandra Varfolomeyeva
speaks with her sister-in-law, gesturing at left, whose horse had
just run away. Ms. Varfolomeyeva keeps ``lending'' her meager
pension payments to the Russian government, but not cheerfully.
Mrs. Varfolomeyeva long ago stopped trying to figure out when she
will get her money. As she sees it, retrieving a pension from the
government backlog that has piled up is sort of like a lottery.
