<HEADLINE> Railway Administration Inaugurates First Express Cargo Train </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The first express cargo train
operated by the Shanghai Railway Administration today departed the
Keqiao Railway Station in eastern Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
The 18-car unit train, the first of a number of unit trains
designated especially for cargo transportation, will mainly carry
light industrial products manufactured in Zhejiang to regions in
western China.
</P>
<P>
The trip to Chengdu, capital of southwest China's Sichuan
Province, will require 48 hours, or about the same time required
for express passenger trains operating on the same route. The
train route will be 24 hours faster than truck transportation.
</P>
<P>
Cargo units were previously integrated with passenger trains
and this way failed to meet the rapidly increasing demand for
cargo transportation.
</P>
<P>
The Railways has decided to begin operating special express
cargo trains in March and April. Private, collective and
state-owned enterprises are all eligible to ship cargo aboard the
trains.

<HEADLINE> Report: Investigation Shows New Conspiracy Claims in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Law enforcement officials in
Tennessee of the United States have closed an investigation into
new conspiracy claims related to the assassination of Martin
Luther King Jr. and said they remain "absolutely convinced" of the
guilt of James Ray, who admitted to the crime nearly 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The new investigation was launched in 1993 after the former
owner of a Memphis cafe came forward to say he had received money
to arrange King's murder, a story which the report rejected,
according to the Washington Post Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The report also dismissed claims by Ray and his latest attorney
that a mysterious gun runner known as "Raoul" set up Ray to be a
patsy in King's assassination.
</P>
<P>
Lee Coffee, a Tennessee prosecutor handling the case, said
"We're and have been convinced that Mr. Ray is the actual gunman.
We have tried to lay to rest some of the conspiracy theories."
</P>
<P>
Ray was arrested two months after King was killed. His
fingerprints were found on the alleged murder weapon, and fibers
from the crime scene were found in his car. There was also
evidence that he had stalked King prior to the assassination.
</P>
<P>
Ray pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 99 years in prison in
1969. but three days later, he recanted his plea, saying he was
pressured into it by his lawyer. In subsequent attempts to win a
trial over the years, Ray and his lawyers have offered widely
varying theories on the circumstances surrounding King's murder.

<HEADLINE> More Chinese Opt for Scattering Ashes at Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 28 (Xinhua) -- A couple from the Capital Steel &AMP;
Iron Corporation scattered the cremated remains of their daughter
Tingting at Bohai Sea this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"She loved the sea and I'm sure she would be delighted," said
the tearful mother.
</P>
<P>
The couple joined 300 Beijing residents who scattered the ashes
of their loved ones in the waters of Bohai Sea. The ceremony was
held to commemorate loved ones just prior to the Clear and Bright
Festival, a traditional festival during which the Chinese offer
sacrifices to the dead.
</P>
<P>
Today's activity, the eleventh of its kind since 1994, was
organized by the Funeral and Interment Office under the Civil
Affairs Bureau of Beijing and related government departments.
</P>
<P>
Yang Yanyin, vice-minister of the Civil Affairs Ministry, said
that similar activities are being held in Shanghai, Tianjin, and
the provinces of Shandong and Guangdong.
</P>
<P>
Chai Chengwen, 83, scattered the ashes of his wife at Bohai
Sea in a brief private ceremony witnessed by his daughter,
daughter-in-law and granddaughter.
</P>
<P>
"I and my wife have agreed that the one who dies later should
scatter at sea the ashes of the one who dies first," said the old
man. "The world is small and we want to leave living space for our
descendants."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese nation has practiced earth burial for thousands of
years.
</P>
<P>
However, the practice has brought a problem to China -- the
decreaing acreage of farmland. The country has to feed 22 percent
of the world's population with only seven percent of its arable
land.
</P>
<P>
Chinese leaders have advocated the reform of the funeral and
interment methods since as early as the founding of the People's
Republic of China in 1949.
</P>
<P>
Deng Xiaoping, architect of China's reform and opening drive,
passed away in February 1997, and his ashes were scattered at sea
in an ensuing ceremony, making a significant impact on the
ordinary Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Yang pointed out that "the nationwide cremation rate reached 37
percent in 1997."
</P>
<P>
The fact that an increasing number of people have abandoned the
traditional funeral and interment customs has enabled China to
save more than 60,000 ha of land and over ten million cu.m. of
timber since the early 1990s.

<HEADLINE> British PM to Visit Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 28 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
is to visit Egypt next week in a move reflecting a fresh European
interest in reviving the stalled Mideast peace process, Egypt's
Middle East News Agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted British Ambassador to Egypt David Blatherwick
as saying Saturday that Blair will hold discussions with Egyptian
leaders on the Middle East peace process in his country's capacity
as European Union's rotating six-month chairman.
</P>
<P>
Blatherwick expressed satisfaction over the outcome of the
visit by British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook to Egypt on March 16
as part of a six-leg regional tour designed to unblock the Mideast
peace stalemate.
</P>
<P>
"Cook's visit provided the first contact between the
newly-formed British government and the Egyptian leadership," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Hailed by Arab countries as a welcoming balance in the Mideast
peace-making, Cook's tour stirred a great controversy when he
visited Har Homa, a disputed site in East Jerusalem where Israel
is building a new Jewish settlement.
</P>
<P>
Cook reaffirmed EU's opposition to Israeli settlement
activities and urged a substantial Israeli troop withdrawal from
the West Bank. The two issues are the major obstacles of the
Palestinians-Israeli peace process.
</P>
<P>
The British ambassador termed Blair's upcoming visit as
"important."
</P>
<P>
Britain is now the second largest non-Arab investor in Egypt
after the U.S., he added.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Demands U.S. Cancel African Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The ruling South African
Communist Party (SACP) Saturday berated American President Bill
Clinton for preaching optimism about Africa while Washington
continued to refuse to block a debt reduction program.
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank had
been squeezing Africa dry for more than 20 years, and Western
banks had lent money to African countries in an undisciplined
manner, SACP General Secretary Charles Nqakula said at a meeting
of the National Union of Mine-workers in Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
"Since the 1980s the IMF and World Bank have been used to
squeeze Africa dry, to rescue the Western banking system from its
own problems. African households, peasants and workers have been
turned into human shock-absorbers by brutal structural adjustment
programs," Nqakula said.
</P>
<P>
As a result of this, Africa was poorer today than it was 20
years ago, he said.
</P>
<P>
This was why Clinton would find there was pessimism about
Africa. And his own administration played a part in this by
continuing to block a debt reduction program which, ironically,
even the IMF and World Bank had endorsed.
</P>
<P>
"We call on you (Clinton) to immediately work to cancel the
debt of the poorest African countries," Nqakula said.
</P>
<P>
The general secretary also questioned Clinton's understanding
of being a partner with Africa in the continent's renaissance.
</P>
<P>
"The official U.S. document 'comprehensive trade and
development policy for the countries of Africa' tells us 'Africa
is the last frontier for American businesses...'"
</P>
<P>
This was a distasteful reference, Nqakula said, noting that
"sometimes the idea of 'partnership' seems to have more to do
with U.S. ambitions to displace former colonial powers, like
Britain and especially France, as the major exploiter of African
resources and markets."

NEW DELHI, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Indian week-long Vajpayee
coalition government led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won a
vote of confidence in parliament Saturday night with 274 in favor
and 261 against after two days of discussion and debates.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, on behalf of his
government, presented a one-line motion to the lower house of
parliament Friday, asking it to put its confidence in his
government.
</P>
<P>
The coalition government with Prime Minister Vajpayee at the
head of a 43-member cabinet was sworn in on March 19. As directed
by President K. R. Narayanan last week, the new government would
have to prove its majority in the House and win the vote of
confidence within 10 days of its swearing-in.
</P>
<P>
The BJP and its allies have the strength of 264 out of 539 MPs
already elected in the just-concluded general election to the 12th
lower house of parliament. The opposition parties including the
Congress and the United Front enjoy 261 MPs.
</P>
<P>
A total of 535 MPs participated in the voting. The Telugu Desam
Party (TDP), which recently parted ways with the United Front,
supported the government with its 11 MPs voting in favor of the
government. The National Conference, another constituent of the
United Front, abstained in the voting.
</P>
<P>
The TDP said after voting that it voted for the Vajpayee
government to prevent the Congress from attempting a backdoor
entry to power. Ruling out the TDP joining the BJP government in
future, TDP leader C. Naidu said Saturday night that his party's
support to BJP "will be on the basis of issues and conditional."
</P>
<P>
India's industry on Saturday asked the BJP-led coalition
government to "kickstart" the economy now that it has won the
crucial confidence vote. Congratulating the Vajpayee government on
winning the vote, leading chambers of commerce and industry said
the government should now concentrate on economic issues as the
political uncertainty was over.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties assailed the TDP for bailing out the
Vajpayee government in the confidence vote. "If TDP was honest the
picture would have been different. But TDP played a dirty game,"
senior Congress leader Sharad Pawar said.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party of India (CPI) said Saturday night the
BJP-led coalition government would not last long as it was bogged
down with inherent contradictions and conflicts as well as the
compromises on which the coalition stands.

<P>
LONDON, March 28 (Xinhua) - Outline plans for a merger of four
European defense and aerospace firms to create a group to rival
the American firms were widely reported here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
British Aerospace, Dasa of Germany, the French-controlled
Aerospatiale and Casa of Spain have reached a wide measure of
agreement to produce a single unified company.
</P>
<P>
It will be a massive 25 billion pounds merger, with BAe,
capitalized at almost 9 billion, the biggest among the four,
Aerospatiale estimated to be worth 7 billion, Dasa 6 billion and
Casa 3 billion.
</P>
<P>
The companies were responding to a joint statement in December
by Tony Blair, UK prime minister, Chancellor Helmut Kohl of
Germany and Jacques Chirac and Lionel Jospin, president and prime
minister of France.
</P>
<P>
The government leaders had asked European aerospace companies
to explain by the end of March how they were going to restructure
their industry.
</P>
<P>
A merger report, presented to the three governments, says there
is a wide measure of agreement in principle on the objectives,
scope and operational structure of a possible merger.
</P>
<P>
But the companies recognize that "significant further work
remains to be done" to establish the feasibility and the basis for
the link-up.

ADDIS ABABA, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Commissioner of the Federal
Civil Service of Ethiopia Alemayehu Haile-Mariam Saturday urged
the public to raise the representation of women in the civil
service.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting here on raising public awareness on
gender issues, Alemayehu disclosed that only 1.32 percent of the
77,286 women civil servants in Ethiopia are engaged in
professional activities.
</P>
<P>
He said that nearly 98.7 percent of women employees in
Ethiopia are engaged in activities with lower statues.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner underlined that the figure shows how
insignificant the role of women play in decision making.
</P>
<P>
It is the duty as well as the responsibility of parents,
schools, government organizations and the public at large to
raise the representation of women in the civil service, he said,
adding that every citizen should respect the democratic and human
rights of the fair sex.

<HEADLINE> Kenya: UNHCR Flies Somali Refugees Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) kicked off its repatriation of
Somali refugees in Kenya with 121 refugees from the Dadaab camps
flying home on Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
In a press release issued Saturday, UNHCR said that more than
700 Somali refugees would return to Somalia's northeast region
within next six days.
</P>
<P>
According to UNHCR, each returnee will receive six months of
food aid or a cash equivalent, plus 30 U.S. Dollars for onward
transportation to their home areas.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR staff in Bossasso in northeastern Somalia will
distribute plastic sheeting, blankets and jerricans to each
family, the release said.
</P>
<P>
It noted that UNHCR staff in Bossasso have been working with
local and international aid agencies to implement quick impact
projects including funding for wells, hospitals and health care
centers and income generation projects.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, more than 115,000 Somali refugees have been
repatriated from refugee camps in Kenya which currently shelters
some 178,000 refugees.
</P>
<P>
Ten refugee camps across Kenya have been closed since 1992
with only three camps remaining near Dadaab in Northeastern
Province of kenya, one camp at Kakuma south of the Sudanese
border.
</P>
<P>
The last remaining camp at Jomvu in Coast Province will close
in April following the repatriation of its 1,400 refugees to
Somalia's Bajunis Islands.
</P>
<P>
In February this year, UNHCR returned 10,000 Somali refugees
from camps in Ethiopia to Hargeisa in northwest Somalia and UNHCR
plans to repatriate some 7,000 Somalis to Borama in early April.

<HEADLINE> Red Cross Sends Medicines to S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The International Committee of the
Red Cross (ICRC) has sent 700 kms of medicines to two clinics in
the war-ravaged city of Kenema in eastern Sierra Leone, according
to reports by the News Agency of Nigeria Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Medicines would also be supplied to the city's main hospital,
the agency quoted ICRC Deputy Head of Mission in Lagos Patrick
Megevand as saying.
</P>
<P>
The report of the ICRC delivery coincided with a United
Nations promise to provide 12 million U.S. Dollars for food,
shelter, medicine and other needs to people displaced by the war
in the country.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. fund will also be used for the repatriation,
rehabilitation and resettlement of refugees.
</P>
<P>
The ICRC, which had suspended relief work outside the capital
city of Freetown because of the recent fighting, has now been
able to assess the medical needs, food situation and clean water
supply of Kenema residents, displaced people and those detained
as a result of the fighting in the key town, Megevand said.
</P>
<P>
Hostilities broke out last month between the west African
peace-keeping force (ECOMOG) and the military junta, which seized
power in a coup last May.
</P>
<P>
The bitter war to dislodge the junta and restore the
legitimate government destroyed infrastructure in most of Sierra
Leone's major cities.
</P>
<P>
Megevand said in a statement issued here Friday that
distribution of food and other supplies to people in Freetown,
whose homes were destroyed, has been completed.
</P>
<P>
The food distribution has also been made to displaced people,
including Liberian refugees as well as some 6,500 people in
various public institutions, hospitals and orphanages.
</P>
<P>
"(ICRC) Delegates regularly visit more than 1,000 detainees
being held at Freetown's central prison, where they also
distribute personal hygiene items to new arrivals," said
Megevand.
</P>
<P>
"Delegates hope to resume relief work in the next few weeks in
areas where security conditions permit," he added.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the ICRC has launched a large-scale
agricultural aid program in northern Uganda to enable more than
260,000 people displaced by the conflict in the country to grow
their own food, according to the statement.

<HEADLINE> Rwandan Army Killed 20 Hutu Militiamen in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The Rwandan army killed 20 Hutu
militiamen in northern Ruhengeri prefecture this week, a special
dispatch to Xinhua by Rwanda News Agency (RNA) said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the "20 thugs" killed, some guns and grenades
were also seized in the mop-up operations, the RNA quoted an
army officer as saying Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The commander of the 105 Battalion, Major John Birasa told RNA
in Kigali that "the militiamen attacked early on Wednesday
morning and tried to set the student dormitory afire."
</P>
<P>
"these militiamen were just thugs involved in
acts of lootings, and terrorizing people," he noted.
</P>
<P>
It is said that about 300 militiamen participated in those
acts in Kirambo area of northern Ruhengeri, which mostly targeted
Nyamugali and Cyeru communes of this sub-Prefecture.
</P>
<P>
According to Major Birasa, some of the militiamen are
residents from distant communes who are forced by the Hutu
militiamen to engage in thuggish acts.
</P>
<P>
"You either follow them or you are killed," one villager who
managed to escape and reported to authorities confessed.
</P>
<P>
Major Birasa also gave details on the attack on Kirambo school
that also took place on the same Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
"The militiamen attacked the school, attempted to burn one of
its dormitories," explained Birasa. But a quick intervention of
security forces foiled this raid, he added.
</P>
<P>
Major Birasa further revealed that the militiamen asked the
students to separate along ethnic lines, but their order was not
obeyed.
</P>
<P>
Hutu rebels stepped up a campaign against Rwanda's
Tutsi-dominated army last December, killing around 271 refugees
from Democratic Congo in a single raid.
</P>
<P>
Hutu extremists connected to Rwanda's former Hutu government
played a leading role in the genocide in 1994 of over 800,000
Tutsis and moderate Hutus.
</P>
<P>
About two million Hutus fled Rwanda during the genocide before
the advancing Rwandan Patriotic Front army, but most returned
during a war in the former Zaire that brought Laurent Kabila to
power in May last year.
</P>
<P>
The mop-up operations conducted on Wednesday also involved
local residents who have joined security forces in fighting the
Hutu militiamen.
</P>
<P>
Since last May, parts of northwest Rwanda have been
experiencing acts of insecurity blamed on former government
soldiers and the notorious ''Interahamwe'' militia.

<HEADLINE> Rwandan Recovery Needs Aid: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 28 (Xinhua) -- President Pasteur Bizimungu said
that Rwanda needs assistance in its recovery, according to a
special dispatch sent to Xinhua Saturday by Rwanda News Agency
(RNA).
</P>
<P>
Rwanda needs to be assisted in its recovery process,
especially in relieving its heavy external debt, explained
President Bizimungu, who returned from Uganda after the Entebbe
summit on peace and prosperity attended by some African leaders
and visiting U.S. president Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The Rwandan President said Wednesady afternoon they "agreed
that the international community should assist Rwanda in
providing material means so that we may (be able to) deal with
acts of genocide."
</P>
<P>
Rwandan minister of foreign affairs Anastase Gasana also told
RNA, "The'1.6 billion external debt is extremely heavy for a poor
country that has been ruined by genocide and war."
</P>
<P>
Any assistance should go in the direction of relieving Rwanda
of this burden which hinders its recovery, Gasana noted.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his satisfaction about promises made by President
Clinton to help Rwandans cope up with the aftermath of the
genocide, but hoped that the promises will materialize.
</P>
<P>
Clinton had promised a two-million-U.S.-Dollar contribution to
the Genocide Survivors' Fund.
</P>
<P>
According to Gasana, the best way the U.S. government would
assist Rwanda would be to take the lead in pushing the
international community to devise a special financial program for
the reconstruction of the country, and the promotion of national
unity and reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the region agreed at the Entebbe summit to stop
these acts in checking cross-border infiltration and arresting
the authors of the genocide who are still active.

ADDIS ABABA, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Aerial spraying has been
carried out as from Thursday to prevent the spread of locust
invasion that surfaced in some parts of eastern Ethiopia, the
Ministry of Agriculture said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here, the ministry said the spraying has

The ministry urged residents to be vigilant in reporting any
such occurrences quickly to the nearest agriculture office.
</P>
<P>
Swarms of locust were surfaced in Ethiopia's Somali region

<HEADLINE> No Plot to Topple S. African Govt: SAPA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 28 (Xinhua) -- There was no plot to
overthrow the South African government as widely reported, South
African Press Association (SAPA) quoted a highly-placed source as
saying Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The investigative commission appointed by South African
President Nelson Mandela is trying to probe why a military
intelligence report lied to Mandela that there was such a plot.
</P>
<P>
The report, which was handed over to Mandela on February 5,
claimed that former soldiers of the armed wing of the African
National Congress (ANC), Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK), wanted to
overthrow Mandela's government.
</P>
<P>
"We don't believe there was such a plot. We're trying to
establish why the president was lied to by being given a false
report," SAPA quoted the source, who refused to be identified, as
saying.
</P>
<P>
According to SAPA, the source echoed previous information that
South African National Defense Force chief Georg Meiring was to
feature prominently in the inquiry, which will probe "how, why,
when the report was compiled, the motive behind it, and the way
it was handled."
</P>
<P>
Three of South Africa's top judges began their investigation
earlier Saturday at an undisclosed venue.
</P>
<P>
The president's office Saturday expressed concern about
"misleading" headlines in newspapers countrywide that the
commission would investigate a plot against the government.
</P>
<P>
"It is investigating the process relating to the compilation,
verification and subsequent treatment of the report."
</P>
<P>
In a statement on Saturday, Meiring welcomed the inquiry and
said he had the fullest confidence in members of the commission.
He also pledged the defense force's "maximum support" for the
judicial probe.
</P>
<P>
Allegations of a possible coup against the government surfaced
in news reports after senior Foreign Ministry official Robert
Mcbride was arrested in Mozambique on suspicion of gun-running.
</P>
<P>
The commission of inquiry, headed by chief justice Ismail
Mohamed, follows a March 18 statement by Safety and Security
Minister Sydney Mufamadi to parliament on Mcbride's arrest.
</P>
<P>
Mufamadi lashed out at "elements" in the security
establishment of attempting to destabilize the country.
</P>
<P>
"The government is perfectly familiar with misinformation
techniques used in the past to prepare for and to legitimize
destabilization programs," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mufamadi accused those security elements who had spread
information to the media that Mcbride might have been involved in
an overthrow plot by "left-wing generals," of being bent on
undermining peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
SAPA quoted another source as saying that the government was
immediately suspicious of the military intelligence report
because the report had been leaked to a journalist, who was
allegedly to be an "long-standing" military intelligence agent.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Keeps Close Eye on Ross' Mideast Tour, FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said Saturday that Egypt is watching closely U.S. Peace
Coordinator Dennis Ross' talks he held with Israeli and
Palestinian leaders.
</P>
<P>
Ross, who will pay a few hours' visit to Egypt for talks with
President Hosni Mubarak on Monday, began a new round of shuttle
diplomacy between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He is trying hard to sell a U.S. proposal, which calls for an
Israeli troop pullback from 13.1 percent of the West Bank over 12
weeks, with each gradual withdrawal accompanied by the PNA's
crackdown on terrorists.
</P>
<P>
Details of the initiative and the American offer have become
known and they are being followed closely and with great
attention, Egypt's Middle East News Agency quoted Moussa as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We are waiting to see the result of the American initiative
and the extent of Israeli cooperation with this initiative which
calls for (Israeli) withdrawal from parts of occupied territories
as a second stage to be followed by a third stage in the same
direction," he said.
</P>
<P>
The question of settlements and other issues related to the
interim agreement should also be taken into consideration in order
to move to the final phase negotiations, he said.
</P>
<P>
"An American initiative is wanted at the present time and the
American attitude is important in order to carry out agreements
and activate the peace process to move to the final phase
negotiations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said Egypt looks forward to the meeting with the
American envoy on Monday. Contacts are underway to know the
"measure of movement" which has taken place and possibilities of
the success of the U.S. initiative, he said.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that "All (in Ross' talks in Cairo) depends on
a balanced approach to the two parties and what they can accept."
</P>
<P>
"What is required from the two sides is to cooperate on the
basis of gradual withdrawal (of Israeli forces) from occupied Arab
territories, agreement on security for the two sides and dealing
with the subject of settlement," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli talks have been stalled over a year
over Israeli settlement building in Arab East Jerusalem and long
overdue Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank. Egypt, the first
Arab country to have a peace treaty with Israel, has played an
important mediating role in the Mideast peace process.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Regards Sudan Twin Brother: Moussa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Egypt said Saturday it regards
Sudan as its "twin brother" but denied it is arranging for a visit
by Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir, Egypt's Middle East News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"Sudan is Egypt's twin brother and everything that serves
Sudan's interests and security will in turn serve Egypt's and vice
versa," Presidential Political Advisor Osama el-Baz said after
receiving Sudanese Foreign Minister Mustafa Osman Ismail here on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
This strategic view, which emanates from Egypt's outlook
vis-a-vis the Arab future, does not change, said Baz, who is
believed to be the brain behind Egypt's foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
"We will cooperate in all facets to overcome existing problems
between any two neighboring countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said Saturday
after a meeting with Ismail, the Egyptian-Sudanese relations "are
as a whole progressing in the direction of setting up healthy
grounds."
</P>

But when asked if Bashir will visit Cairo next month, Moussa
said there are no such arrangements at present.

The Sudanese minister, who was in Cairo to chair meetings of
the 109th session of the Arab League foreign ministers' council
which opened Tuesday, was quoted as saying on Friday that Bashir
will visit Cairo next month for talks with Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak.

Egyptian-Sudanese relations have seen a turn for the better

The two neighbors had been at odds over a border dispute and

there were signs of a tentative thaw in relations recently.

<HEADLINE> Hot Debate in Jordan Parliament Over Privatization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's House of Representatives
saw a hot debate on the government's ambitious privatization plan
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Ghazi Obeidat, a physician without party affiliation,
criticized the government for rushing into privatization at a
time when everything was not fully prepared.
</P>
<P>
Privatization "must be accompanied by (relevant) regulation and
laws which guarantee the mechanism to protect the citizens from
(the possible harm) of monopoly and unjustified increase of
taxes," Obeidat told official Radio Jordan after attending a
full-day session devoted to the discussion of the privatization
process.
</P>
<P>
According to a memo released after Saturday's session, Obeidat
and other deputies proposed that the executive authority should
not embargo on privatizing any public utility service until the
government submitted a draft law on this subject to the house.
</P>
<P>
In response, Deputy Prime Minister for Development Affairs and
Minister of Foreign Affairs Jawad Anani was quoted by the radio as
saying that the government was determined to carry out the
privatization process and called for the law-makers' cooperation
in this regard.
</P>
<P>
He said "privatization has now become a strategy of first
priority." "Jordan should be a forerunner in this respect," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The 80-member Chamber of Deputies announced a 4-month summer
recess Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Jordan started the privatization process in 1995 by declaring
to sell partial shares of the state-run Telecommunications
Corporation (TCC) to private ownership step by step. In 1996, the
national airliner the Royal Jordanian was privatized.
</P>
<P>
This year, the targets of privatization expands to include more
shares of the telecommunications corporation, the Jordan Cement
Factories Company and the National Oil Company.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the privatization of the telecommunications
sector was finished recently, as the government received and began
to study applications submitted by overseas companies who are the
potential holders of some 40 percent of TCC's shares.
</P>
<P>
Four foreign companies, two from the United States, one from
Britain and one from Greek joined the bid. The partial sale of
shares will make Jordan the first Arab country to allow private
foreign ownership of its fixed network.
</P>
<P>
The government includes the privatization as a major component
of its reform program to trim the public sector which employs
about half of Jordan's work force and shift resources to private
owners.

<HEADLINE> UAE President Calls on Iraq to Cooperate With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, March 28 (Xinhua) -- United Arab Emirates' (UAE)
President Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al-Nahyan Saturday urged Iraq to
fully cooperate with the U.N. to help end trade sanctions against
Baghdad, the official Wam News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The president made the appeal during his meeting with Iraqi
Justice Minister Shabib al-Maliki who arrived here from Oman
Saturday afternoon on a visit.
</P>
<P>
Iraq should "continue complete cooperation with the U.N. so as
to step up efforts to put an end to the Iraqi people's misery
caused by the U.N. trade sanctions," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq and the U.N. signed an agreement over arms inspection late
February, under which Baghdad unconditionally allowed U.N. arms
inspectors access to all sites suspected of containing chemical
and biological arms.
</P>
<P>
The UAE and other Gulf Arab countries have repeatedly called on
Baghdad to abide by the U.N. accord to avert a possible use of
force by the United States and Britain, who keep strong military
presence in the region to monitor a test of the implementation of
the U.N.-Iraq deal.
</P>
<P>
They also urged the international community to help lift the
eight-year-long crippling sanctions imposed on Iraq following its
invasion of Kuwait in 1990 to ease the sufferings of the Iraqi
people.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Opens Trade Center in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. President
Bill Clinton opened a commercial center in Johannesburg Saturday
evening to promote economic cooperation between African and U. S.
businesses.
</P>
<P>
The Ronald Brown Commercial Center, named in honor of late
U.S. secretary of commerce Ronald Brown, will serve as a trade
center for 48 African countries, including South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Opening the center in Illovo in the wealthy Johannesburg
suburb of Sandton, Clinton said that trade could not replace aid
to uplift African countries.
</P>
<P>
"A new partnership in trade and investment should not come at
the expense of development assistance," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
He sought to quell concerns by some South Africans that the
United States intended to replace traditional foreign development
aid with trade and commercial measures.
</P>
<P>
"We agree that the aid programs should be extended, that it
should not be replaced by trade, but instead supplemented for
it," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated U.S. commitment to enhance trade and investment
ties with African countries.
</P>
<P>
The United States is one of the largest investors in South
Africa and some 3,000 American companies are operating in the
country.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Urges Resuming Arab-Israeli Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's Acting Prime Minister
Abdullah Nsour Sunday underscored the necessity to resume
Arab-Israeli talks on all tracks, particularly the negotiations
between the Palestinians and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Efforts should be made in this respect to break the impasse in
Middle East peace process, said Nsour at a meeting here with a
visiting delegation of the Arab Democratic Party of Israel led by
Israeli Knesset (parliament) member Abdul Wahhab Darawsheh,
Jordanian official news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Nsour, also deputy prime minister for development and minister
of information, reiterated Jordan's support to the "Palestinian
brothers" in their negotiations to realize legitimate rights and
establish their own independent state on their national soil.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians are entitled to return to their own soil,
have homes there and enjoy sovereignty, Nsour said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he expressed Jordan's appreciation of the role
undertaken by Arab political parties in Israel to promote the
concept of peace and perpetuate bridges of contacts between
Israeli Arabs and their Arab nation.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Darawsheh briefed Nsour on the efforts made by
his party to push the peace process forward and to urge the
Israeli government to commit itself to the implementation of
agreements earlier concluded with the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA).
</P>
<P>
The talks also dealt with the situation in the Palestinian
self-rule territories.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian-Israeli peace talks have been stalled for more than
a year since Israel began construction of a controversial Jewish
settlement in Arab East Jerusalem last March.

<HEADLINE> Undisputed King of Rugby Sevens Feels Pressure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 29 (Xinhua) -- World Cup Sevens champions
Fiji won a record eighth Cup title when it downed arch rival Samoa
28-19 in the final at the 510,000 U.S. dollar Credit Suisse First
Boston Hong Kong Hong Kong Sevens Rugby '98 here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
This was the Fijians' first title since 1992.
</P>
<P>
The Fijians, the unbeaten winner of Pool C in the single
round-robin preliminary stage, had wiped out Canada and South
Africa before facing Samoa in the title clash.
</P>
<P>
But even Waisale Serevi, the Fijian captain who was named the
three-day event's best player, felt the mounting pressure as the
tournament was getting harder every year.
</P>
<P>
Days were gone forever when there were almost no more strong
teams than New Zealand and Fiji themselves, he noted. "Now all
the teams know how to play Sevens," he said.
</P>
<P>
The format of the annual Hong Kong tournament meant that the
seven-time winner had to play all the strong sides along a tough
path before reaching the crown.
</P>
<P>
And the experienced Fijians had to dig deep into their reserves
for extra strength and wisdom for winning over the determined and
swift Samoans. They even had to "borrow" Bruce Rauqe from
Australia for the crucial final.
</P>
<P>
Marika Vunibaka opened the score for Fiji with his try in the
third minute and Jope Tuikabe added one in the ninth of the first
half. Both were with the team that won the World Cup here last
year.
</P>
<P>
Rauqe proved to be worthy of the Fijian expectation as he
scored a crucial final try in the dying minute.
</P>
<P>
Samoa lost to Fiji in the semi-finals in last year's World Cup
Sevens.
</P>
<P>
The Samoans could feel settled as Ailaoa Samania came out the
tournament's top try scorer with 11 and Toa Samania as the top
points scorer with 71.
</P>
<P>
The famed All Blacks side from New Zealand, with six titles to
their credit before this year's event, failed to make it to the
final as they crashed 19-7 in the hands of the Fijians in the
semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
The titles of the lower-ranked Plate and Bowl tournaments went
to South Korea and Morocco.
</P>
<P>
The injury-plagued South Koreans had to draft two players of
the Tonga side but managed to defeat Papua New Guinea 40-14 in the
Plate final to take its fourth title.
</P>
<P>
Morocco lifted its first ever title by beating Chinese Taipei
31-14 in the Bowl final.

<HEADLINE> Vanguards Huandao Take Lead in Chinese Soccer League </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Vanguards Huandao took the
limelight by beating Guangzhou Songri 1-0 for their second
consecutive victory at the Chinese soccer league on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The perfect record gave the Vanguards six points and the top
place in the 14-team Chinese soccer league after two rounds.
</P>
<P>
The low scoring plagued the second round matches as three of the
seven matches ended goalless, two played to 1-1 and the other two
were wrapped up at the identical score of 1-0.
</P>
<P>
The total scoring of six goals was a sharp contrast to the
first round in which a total of 17 goals were scored last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The only other match which produced a winner on Sunday was
between Beijing Guo'an and the Chinese Army team.
</P>
<P>
Casiano Wilberto Delvalle from Paraguay slamed home a cross
from Olivas Rubio Andres of Spain to give Beijing Guo'an a 1-0
victory.
</P>
<P>
Casiano, Andres, together with Jorge Luis Campos Velazquz, also
from Paraguay, have consolidated their place in Beijing Guo'an
through last season as they scored more than half of the goals of
the team.
</P>
<P>
Defending champions Dalian Wanda, which beat Guangzhou Songri
2-0 in the first round, were forced to a goalless draw by newly
promoted Shengyang Haishi.
</P>
<P>
The under-par performances of the defending champions will
probably cast a shadow over the future of coach Xu Gengbao, who
took over the team from Chi Shangbing just before the kickoff of
the season.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai Shenghua, the 1995 league champions, were also forced
to a 0-0 draw by Wuhan Yaqi, one of the four new-comers of the
league.
</P>
<P>
In the other matches played on Sunday, Guangzhou Songri drew
Shengzhen Pingan 0-0, Shandong Luneng tied Sichuan Quanxing 1-1,
Yanbian Aodong drew Qingdao Hainiu 1-1.

<P>
MOGADISHU, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Reports from Somalia's coastal
town of Hobyo indicate that the fighting has escalated Sunday
after reinforcement combat militiamen mainly from the Sa'ad
subclan reached the town.
</P>
<P>
Six more deaths, four of whom civilians, are reported Sunday
before the VHF radios of the town went out of the air early in
the afternoon. This makes the death toll to at least 19 while the
wounded are exceeding 20.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest reports, the heaviest clashes between
the Sa'ad and Suleman subclans militiamen took place near the
fishing facility along the beach of the town where lobsters,
various fish species and shark fins are prepared for export.
</P>
<P>
However a mini-factory for soft drinks and cooling system for
the lobsters is reported to be in safe hands unaffected by the
clashes.
</P>
<P>
Confirmed reports said the Suleman militiamen were forcefully
driven out of the town towards the village of El-Hur and the
district of Harardhere, about 120 km south of Hobyo.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the Suleman militiamen said their men ran out
of ammunition before they were forced to withdraw from the town.
</P>
<P>
With traditional leaders' efforts in pacifying the area yet to
take effect, both sides from the Habar Gidir clan of Hussein
Mohamed Aidid are getting ready for more clashes for control of
the town, which is rich in marine resources.
</P>

<HEADLINE> People of Northern China Doing Their Best to Help Giant Panda (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Shasha, a Giant Panda in Taiyuan,
the capital of China's Shanxi Province, who lost her eyesight
completely last year, has disappointed her numerous fans who have
been trying their best to help her.
</P>
<P>
Local doctors and some borrowed from Beijing concluded
yesterday that a cataract operation on the 32-year-old animal
would be too risky. She lost her eyesight because of old age.
</P>
<P>
Shasha is the last Giant Panda left in the city, which is one
of 12 in China that have the animals. A 36-year-old panda in
Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province, has been blind for 13 years
for the same reason.
</P>
<P>
If something happened during the operation it would be
difficult, says Wei Zezheng, the zoo's curator, and the best care
they can offer her is just to try to prolong her life.
</P>
<P>
The anesthesia needed for the operation could have
complications in such an old panda, says Guo Zheng, an
anesthesiologist. The Giant Panda's average life span is only 25
years.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of people have visited Shasha since she
became blind and she is an old friend of the people in the city,
many of whom feel obligated to help her.
</P>
<P>
Shasha came to the zoo when she was 17. And, even though it was
often short of cash, the zoo still managed to provide the best
conditions for its distinguished guest, by building a 200-sq-m
building for her, providing her with two keepers, and airlifting
fresh bamboo shoots from the south each week.

People have phoned to ask what they can do for her, like
donating money for surgery expenses. Letters also pour into the
zoo offering. One came form an elderly veterinarian recommending
an herbal medicine treatment, saying that it had worked
successfully for goats. Farmers have also suggested folk
prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
Shasha has spent most of her time lying in a corner since she
lost her eyesight, according to 29-year-old Li Wengjie, one of her
two keepers, who says, "It makes my heart ache to see her." When
she moves, she has to move cautiously, putting her forepaws out to
feel the way, and she sniffs her food before she eats it, and it
takes a long time to feed her.
</P>
<P>
Zheng Jianhong, the other keeper, says, "We have to watch her
carefully for anything odd in her excrements. She doesn't like
moving around since she lost her eyesight. We have to touch her
ears each day to give her hints, to make her move and give us a
chance to observe her."
</P>
<P>
"Shasha can't take a bath by herself, so we take her to bathe
every two or three days," Li told this reporter. At her side,
Shasha was slowly eating her meal, with her head lowered.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Inspections of Iraqi Sites Go on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations monitoring
groups and inspection teams carried out their mission in Iraq
smoothly on Sunday, the Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted sources at the Iraqi National Monitoring
Directorate as saying that nine monitoring groups visited on
Sunday 12 sites and helicopters were used to reach a number of
these sites while one helicopter's mission was canceled due to bad
weather conditions.
</P>
<P>
The sources said these visits had received full cooperation
from the Iraqi side.
</P>
<P>
The nuclear and missile teams continued talks at the National
Monitoring Directorate, the Iraqi peer of the U.N. Special
Commission (UNSCOM) on dismantling Iraq's prohibited weapons,
while the team entrusted with the task of surveying warheads
destruction sites also continued its activities, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, inspections of Iraq's three northern presidential
sites are under way. No information about these inspections is
available now.
</P>
<P>
U.N. arms inspectors and senior diplomats set out Saturday
morning for those sites in Iraq's northern province Salahuddin to
continue their mission.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources said that the inspectors and diplomats will
spend three days in Salahuddin, President Saddam Hussein's home
province, inspecting three presidential sites there -- Tikrit,
Tharthar and Jabal Makhul.
</P>
<P>
After that, they will go further northward to inspect Mosul
presidential site, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday and Friday, U.N. inspectors, accompanied by
senior diplomats from different countries, visited the Radwaniyah
presidential palace in the suburb of Baghdad, where they received
full cooperation from the Iraqi side.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement signed by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan and Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz last month, Iraq
agrees to open its eight presidential sites previously off-limits
to U.N. inspections.
</P>
<P>
A special group of senior diplomats appointed by Annan and
arms experts from the UNSCOM and the International Atomic Energy
Agency, headed by Sri Lankan Jayanatha Dhanapala, was assigned to
carry out the mission.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-imposed sanctions on Iraq after its invasion of
Kuwait in 1990 cannot be lifted until the UNSCOM certifies that
Iraq is free of weapons of mass destruction.

Shi told the nearly 100 people with Marchi that the financial
crisis in Southeast Asia has not affected China's overall economic
growth, but that it presents a serious challenge to its exports.
</P>
<P>
China will increase exports this year by reducing costs and
changing the mix, he said, and it will continue its preferential
policies to attract a broader range foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Relations between China and Canada are very good, he said, and
economic and trade cooperation have developed rapidly, and, since
Canada is a developed and industrialized country and China the
largest developing country, the two economies complement each
other and cooperation is beneficial to the two.
</P>
<P>
Marchi said that the size of his delegation indicates the
importance Canada places on economic and trade cooperation with
China.
</P>
<P>
Sino-Canadian trade last year was worth 3.9 billion US dollars,
and Canada has become China's 14th largest trade partner. It is
also a major investor in China.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Anniversary of Basic Law Marked in Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Macao grassroots organizations and
business communities have been holding various commemorative
events to mark the 5th anniversary of the promulgation of the
Macao Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
Seminars, knowledge quiz, galas and photography contests have
been held over the past week for the coming anniversary.
</P>
<P>
A group of senior Chinese officials, headed by Qian Weichang,
vice-chairman of the 9th National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), arrived in
Macao on Sunday, also for the commemorative activities.
</P>
<P>
Promulgated on March 31, 1993, the Basic Law will become
effective on December 20, 1999 when China resumes its exercise of
sovereignty over Macao. The law is regarded as a mini-constitution
for the Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
A seminar hosted by the Macao Society of Economics Study last
week concluded that members of the Preparatory Committee for the
Macao SAR, which will be established soon, should bear in mind
their responsibility and mission to conduct the transitional
affairs in accordance with the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
Participants at the seminar also called on Macao residents to
support, cooperate with and supervise the work of the Preparatory
Committee so that good preparations can be done for a smooth
handover.
</P>
<P>
At a lecture on the Basic Law hosted by the Macao Women's
Federation, the lecturer, a former secretary of the Basic Law
Advisory Committee, said that Macao women should join hands for
the realization of the concept of "one country, two systems" and
"Macao people administering Macao."
</P>
<P>
Participants at a separate seminar last Friday at the
University of Macao said the law has served as guidance over the
past five years for handling Macao's transitional affairs.
</P>
<P>
"The handling of transitional affairs has been proceeding under
the guidance of the Basic Law," said Zhou Ligao, president of the
University of Macao. "Practice has proved that the Basic Law plays
an important role in the process of China's resumption of its
exercise of sovereignty over Macao and in the stability of Macao."
</P>
<P>
While the Macao Chinese Education Association urges its member
schools to enhance education about the Basic Law among students
through more practical ways, several local business communities
have decided to launch a joint photo contest featuring the
commemoration of the 5th anniversary of the law.
</P>
<P>
In addition, The Federation of Macao's Neighborhood Communities
decided at a recent meeting to host more lectures, photos
contests, law publicity poster design contests and evening parties
to promote the law in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese channel of a television station will broadcast a
series of TV drama explaining to local residents the contents of
the law from Monday.

<HEADLINE> Rockets Easily Defend China's League Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, Northeast China, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Defending
champions the August First Rockets won the Chinese basketball
league title for the fourth straight time after they thrashed the
Liaoning Hunters 71-47 here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Rockets, who led 39-21 at halftime, secured the
championship in the third game of the best-of-five finals.
</P>
<P>
The Rockets won the previous two games in 90-56 and 84-75 in
their home court of Chongqing.
</P>
<P>
The sluggish Hunters, also finalists last season, had no way to
slice open the Rockets' solid defence and missed a series of easy
baskets.
</P>
<P>
The Rockets had extended the lead to 39-16 on guard Li Nan's
over-the-shoulder basket in the 18th minute, the biggest gap in
the first half.
</P>
<P>
The Hunters shifted their man-to-man marking to team defence
after they came back to the court but they could hardly stop the
surging Rockets.
</P>
<P>
The Rockets' pivot Wang Zhizhi scored a game high 18 points and
his teammate Liu Qiang grabbed a game high 10 rebounds. Li Nan
added 16 points, six rebounds and two assits.
</P>
<P>
"We played with better defence," said the Rockets' head coach
Wang Fei. "And our players had full confidence to win the game."
</P>
<P>
"Had we lost this game, the rest of the finals would be very
difficult," said Wang Zhizhi.
</P>
<P>
Wang Shongqiang led the Hunters with 16 points and eight
rebounds and Guo Shiqiang added 12 points.
</P>
<P>
"We were defeated by self-imposed pressure," lamented the
Hunters' head coach Wu Qionglong.

<HEADLINE> Macao Foreign Trade Declines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MACAO, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Both imports and exports in
January 1998 declined comparing with the same month last year, but
Macao still gained a trade surplus of 341 million patacas (about
42.6 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The latest official figures released by the Macao Census and
Statistics Department show that the exports in January reached
1.36 billion patacas (about 175 million dollars), down 15.6
percent from the same month last year.
</P>
<P>
The imports in January declined 24.4 percent, to hit 1.02
billion patacas (about 127.5 million dollars). The trade surplus
came to 341 million patacas, up 31 percent from the figure in
January 1997.
</P>
<P>
Of all exported goods, textile products and garments account
for 84.7 percent. They mainly headed for the United States and
European Union. Macao's other export goods included equipment and
machinery, footwear and cement.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the drop in imports was mainly caused by less
purchase of capital goods (-29.6 percent), raw materials and
semi-finished goods (-29.2 percent), consumer goods (-18 percent)
and fuel and lubricating oil (-6.9 percent).
</P>
<P>
The bulk of Macao's imported goods came from the Asian-Pacific
region, which supplied 79.6 percent. Its largest import market
was China's inland, followed by Hong Kong, Japan, Australia and
Taiwan.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Vice-Chairman Predicts Smooth Handover in Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MACAO, March 29 (Xinhua) -- A vice-chairman of China's top
advisory body said here on Sunday that it is certain a smooth
transition and handover of power will be achieved in Macao.
</P>
<P>
Qian Weichang, vice-chairman of the 9th National Committee of
the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC),
made these remarks upon arrival here with several other Chinese
officials to attend a series of activities marking the 5th
anniversary of the promulgation of the Basic Law of Macao.
</P>
<P>
"We are convinced that under the cooperation between China and
Portugal, the wide participation from all sides of Macao
residents, and under the guidance of the concept of 'one country,
two systems', a smooth transition and handover of power will be
realized in Macao," he said, adding "Macao will have a very good
tomorrow."
</P>
<P>
Qian is the highest ranking Chinese official to visit Macao
over the past several years. He was also a vice-chairman of the
Macao Basic Law Drafting Commission.
</P>
<P>
Adopted and promulgated by the National People's Congress on
March 31, 1993, the Basic Law of Macao serves as a
mini-constitution for Macao, which, like Hong Kong, will continue
its capitalist system for 50 years under the policy of "one
country, two systems."
</P>
<P>
Qian said certain progress has been achieved over the past
five years since the promulgation of the law.
</P>
<P>
"Over the past five years, Macao residents have took an active
part in the transitional affairs, and the law has been widely
publicized in various ways and through various channels," he
stressed. "Under the cooperation between China and Portugal, the
localization of civil service, the localization of law and the use
of Chinese as an official language, among other transitional
issues, have gained new progress," he said.
</P>
<P>
The vice-chairman said his current trip to Macao is aimed at
witnessing the changes over the past five years, and at further
publicity of the basic law.
</P>
<P>
During his three-day stay in Macao, Qian and his entourage
will attend a series of events to mark the 5th anniversary of the
law. Those events include a gala, a large-scale seminar and a
commemorative meeting.

<HEADLINE> Macao Banks to Cut Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Macao banks are to cut deposit
interest rates by 0.25 percent starting from Monday, following a
similar announcement earlier in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Macao Bankers' Association announced on Saturday that Macao
banks will trim bank deposit interest rate by 0.25 percent, from
5.25 percent to 5 percent. The rate for week-long notice deposit
will also be cut from 6 percent to 5.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
The rate cut was the first in two years in Macao.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts said that the decline of interest rate will help
revive local economic growth, although the margin is small.
</P>
<P>
"It will ease the high psychological pressure brought about by
the financial storms in Asia," said Chui Sai Cheong, president of
the Macao Society of Economics Study. "It will mean a stimulus to
the economy," he added.

<HEADLINE> Clan Fighting Kills 13 in Somali Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mogadishu, March 29 (Xinhua)-- Heavy fighting is being
reported from Somalia's coastal town of Hobyo between militiamen
from Sa'ad and Suleman subclans of Hanar Gidir.
</P>
<P>
According to early reports, the fighting which began Saturday
afternoon has so far claimed the lives of more than 13 and
wounded more than 15 others.
</P>
<P>
Reports received through field radios here in Mogadishu said
the fighting has once again recommenced at dawn Sunday morning
after it subsided early Saturday evening. More than eight battle
wagons are involved in this clan-based armed confrontation, the
report added.
</P>
<P>
There's no official word from any of the rival subclans over
the fighting nor the reason behind the clashes is disclosed.
However, it is believed that the animosity between the two sides
began when armed militiamen from the Suleman subclan ambushed a
car at ex-21 October road of Mogadishu where three men (mainly
from the Sa'ad subclan) were killed three days ago. The deceased
in the ambush included lobsters exporting businessman.
</P>
<P>
In retaliation for the ambush, a Suleman businessman was also
killed in the central town of Galkaio two days ago, and the
retaliation still continues. Businessmen from the Suleman subclan
Saturday accused the other side of attempting to kill Suleman sea
product exporters based at the beach of the town, about 650 km
northeast of Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Both sides have asked reinforcement militiamen and battle
wagons from their respective strongholds in the region. Likewise,
traditional leaders and peace lovers have left the towns of
Harardhere, Galkaio and others for Hobyo town in a bid to
extinguish the flames of the fighting between the two Habar Gidir
subclans.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Dhaka Cracks Down on Crimes Against Women, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government will
strive for enactment of an effective and complete law to crack
down on crimes against women and children, as such crimes are on
the rise in the country.
</P>
<P>
To this end, an experts' committee has been set up to
scrutinize every detail of the proposed law which will cope with
the changing nature of and a worrying rise in such crimes.
</P>
<P>
Cases relating to "terrorist acts" against women and children,
such as acid-throwing, rape, and trafficking in women and
children, should be dealt with quickly, Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina said recently.
</P>
<P>
Over 200,000 Bangladeshi women and children have been
trafficked to the Middle East and India in the past 20 years, and
about 20,000 Bangladeshi women are involved in prostitution in
Indian brothels alone, according to reports of human rights
organizations and newspapers.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladeshi government is deeply concerned about the
growing trend in women and children trafficking and has taken a
series of measures in this regard.
</P>
<P>
In the past few months, about 100 children and women have been
rescued by the Bangladesh Rifles troops from a human trafficking
point at Saidpur, 286 kilometers northwest of the capital Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
And police in Jessore district, 146 kilometers southwest of
here, recently arrested four human traffickers and rescued 69
people, including 34 children aged between three months and 10
years, and 15 women between 18 and 40 years old, press reports
said.
</P>
<P>
The four human traffickers were believed to be connected with
an international gang of human traffickers, which police said has
been spreading its network in Bangladesh, using different border
points at Jessore as their routes.
</P>
<P>
Human traffickers usually bring their children and women
victims to Mirpur, Dhaka, from different parts of the country, and
then take them to border areas in the country's southwest district
of Satkhira, where the victims will be trafficked across the
border, police say.
</P>
<P>
In India, the victims are sold to different hospitals and
clinics for their blood and human organs, or to Calcutta, Bombay
and Delhi as prostitutes. Male children between the age of 10 and
15 may also be used as "jockery."
</P>
<P>
"Addressing the offenses against women and children is very
important and is a must," as women and children constitute more
than two-thirds of the country's 124.3 million population, Hasina
said.
</P>
<P>
"The problem needs to be addressed from a regional perspective,
since trans-border trafficking from areas of poverty to areas of
prosperity involves more than one country," a government document
points out.

<HEADLINE> Beijing's Oldest Statue of Buddha Stolen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The oldest stone statue of Buddha
in China's capital was stolen four days ago, city authorities in
charge of historical relics announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Police have been working round the clock to locate the valuable
object. The 165-cm-high statue was carved in 499 AD and has
remained safe and intact in a stone house in the village of
Dong'erying in the western part of Beijing for the past 1,500
years.
</P>
<P>
According to police, robbers pried it off its base with
crowbars and hauled it away sometime from late Tuesday night to
early Wednesday morning. The family who have looked after it for
four generations reported it missing immediately.
</P>
<P>
Police had previously advised them to use better anti-theft
measures after the house was opened to the public, but the
smugglers seemed to be just one step ahead of them.
</P>
<P>
The statue has been listed as a relic by the Beijing government
since 1957.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Military Reassures Handover to Civil Rule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's military administration
has reassured its planned handover to civil rule in October this
year after the United States softens stance on the possible
presidential candidacy of the head of state, General Sani Abacha.
</P>
<P>
Chief of Defense Staff Maj.-Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar,
currently the number three military officer, gave the reassurance
to Nigerians and the international community at the weekend, This
Day newspaper reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton said Friday during his visit in
Johannesburg, South Africa that General Abacha could contest the
August presidential election as a civilian.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's remarks are seen as a step to soften the position of
the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
Shortly before Clinton's on-going African tour, U.S. Assistant
Secretary of State for African Affairs Susan Rice said an
electoral victory by any military candidate in Nigeria's
forthcoming election would be unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
There is yet no official response to the softpeddaled stance
of the U.S. from the Nigerian government, and whether or not
Abacha will decide to contest remains in the dark.
</P>
<P>
Even so, the defense chief said that despite the doubt being
expressed in certain quarters, this administration has been
unshaken in its determination to hand over power to a
democratically elected government at the end of the transition to
civil rule program.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi has
reaffirmed Nigeria's determination to maintain its sovereignty
rather than succumb to foreign pressures.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Nigeria would continue to relate and deal with
all foreign countries including members of the European Union
purely on bilateral reciprocity and would not succumb to the
whims and caprices of such nations.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Offer Fighter Jets to S. Africa: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The United States will
offer South African National Defense Force (SANDF) F-16 fighter
jets, local daily the Sunday Independent reported.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft, more than 4,000 of which have been produced and
put into service worldwide, would probably be second-hand U.S.
Air Force F-16 B and C variants, which are being phased out as
they are replaced by the latest D-series planes.
</P>
<P>
F-16s retails at about four million U.S. Dollars each,
considerably less than the estimated 20 to 30 million Dollars
cost of new competitors such as the French Mirage 2000 and
Swedish Saab Gripen.
</P>
<P>
The South African Air Force (SAAF) needs about 30 frontline
fighters to replace its squadron of Cheetahs by 2005. It also
needs light helicopters and training jets to replace its
equipment, which will become obsolete shortly after the turn of
the century.
</P>
<P>
South African defense industry sources believed that the
Americans might offer the F-16s at bargain prices, or give them
away as part of a donation of American equipment to an African
peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
Pretoria has remained cool towards taking part in such a force
because of defense budget cutbacks and because it does not want
to be seen to be acting as an American surrogate in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The SAAF was given a number of C-130 Hercules transport
aircraft by the Americans last year. However, the planes were so
worn out that they required extensive refurbishment, something
that, it is understood, has to be carried out by American
companies under the donation agreement.
</P>
<P>
There was speculation that a shipment of F-16s, which had
earlier been sold to Pakistan by the Americans, might be resold
to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Congress vetoed the export of those planes to
Pakistan because of that country's alleged involvement in nuclear
proliferation.

<HEADLINE> Mandela to Fire Military Chief Over Report: Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 29 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela is set to fire military chief Georg Meiring over a
suspicious military intelligence report alleging that senior
black officials were plotting with Winnie Madikizela-Mandela to
overthrow the government, the Sunday Times newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
The military report, which Meiring gave to Mandela at the
beginning of February, alleged that Madikizela-Mandela, Mandela's
ex-wife, United Democratic Movement co-leader Bantu Holomisa,
alleged arms smuggler Robert McBride and South African National
Defense Force (SANDF) Chief of Staff Siphiwe Nyanda were plotting
to overthrow the government. The head of the service corps,
Lambert Moloi, was also named, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Mandela is said to have dismissed the report as "ludicrous."
He announced a commission of inquiry Friday into how the report
was compiled and why it bypassed official intelligence
structures.
</P>
<P>
Sunday Times said it has been told by top government aides
that Meiring is to be relieved of duties if he fails to explain
to the commission why:
</P>
<P>
-- the report was based on the information of a single source
-- intelligence operative Vusi Mbatha, who was arrested with
McBride for suspected arms smuggling in Mozambique;
</P>
<P>
-- no effort was made to cross-check or verify the information
supplied by Mbatha;
</P>
<P>
-- the report was not presented to the National Intelligence
Coordinating Committee, in keeping with official procedure;
</P>
<P>
-- Defense Minister Joe Modise and his deputy were not shown
the report or told of the investigation;
</P>
<P>
-- Meiring, who is scheduled to retire in July, named his most
obvious successor, Nyanda, as the key coup plotter; and
</P>
<P>
-- the report was leaked to the media.
</P>
<P>
Sunday Times did not name the government aides.
</P>
<P>
Meiring Saturday pledged to cooperate with the commission but
defended the compilation of the document. "We would have been
derelict in our duty if we had not taken this action."
</P>
<P>
The commission of inquiry, which is hearing evidence in
camera, began their work Saturday at a secret venue.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Independent newspaper quoted Mandela as saying that
the military intelligence report might be a "diversion."
</P>
<P>
"What they are investigating is not whether the allegations
are true or not, but the process: how was the report compiled,
who was the source? You may trust people, but in actual fact
information may surface that shows they are using that trust as a
cover which may lead to the overthrow of the state," the paper
quoted Mandela as saying in an exclusive interview Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Mandela also emphasized his closeness to the African National
Congress (ANC) military men who had been named as possible
plotters.
</P>
<P>
"When I read the contents (of the report), I felt that there
was no substantial evidence," Mandela was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The paper said Mandela was "absolutely confident" that former
Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK) generals were loyal to him on both a
personal and a political level. Of Nyanda, he said: "I knew his
parents very well... I have always regarded him as my son."
</P>
<P>
MK was the former military wing of the ANC.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted government and intelligence sources as saying
that the report could be a right-wing attempt to mask a plot by
old-guard "securocrats" to destabilize the government.
</P>
<P>
The president's office could not be reached for confirmation
of Mandela's interview with Sunday Independent and of his remarks
quoted by Sunday Times. South Africa's Sunday newspapers are
usually not 100 percent reliable.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Offer(Fighter Jets to S. Africa: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The Unitud States will
offer South African Fational Defense Force (KANDF) F-16 fighter
jets, local daily the Sunday INdependent reported.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft, more than 4,000 of which have been produced and
put into service worldwide, would probably be second-hand U.S.
Air Force F-16 B and C varians, which are being phased out as
4hey are replaced by the latest D-series planes.
</P>
<P>
F-16s retails at about four million U.S. Dollars each,
considerably less than the estimated 20 to 3 million Dollars
cost of new competitors such as the French Mirage 2000 and
Swedish Saab Gripen.
" The South African P=I
(SAAF) nee
 =UQ30 frontline
fighters"to replace its squqdron$of Cheetahs by 200%. It alco
needs light helicopters and training jets to replace its
equipment, which will become obsolete shortly after the turn of
the century.
</P>
<P>
South African defense industry sources believed that the
Americans might offer the F-16s at fargain prices, or give them
away as part of a donation of American equipment do an African
peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
Pretoria has remained cool towards taking part in sch a force
because /f defense budget cutbacks and because it does no| want
to be seen to be actyng as an American surrogate in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The SAAF0was given a number of C-130 Hercules transport
aircraft by the Americans last year. However, the planes were so
worn out that they required extensive refurbishment, something
that, it is understood, has to be carried out by American
companies under the donation agreement.
</P>
<P>
There was speculation that a shipment of F-16s, which had
earlier be%n sold to Pakistan by the Americans, migxt be resold
to0South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Congress vetoed the export of those planes to
Pakistan because of that ckuntry's alleged involvement in nuclear
proliferataon.

<HEADLINE> Ross Continues Efforts to Advance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 29 (Xinhua) -- After two rounds of talks
with Israeli and Palestinian leaders, the United States Middle
East Peace Coordinator Dennis Ross will continue his efforts on
Sunday to break the deadlock in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
After his meeting with Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
President Yasser Arafat in Gaza city Saturday night, Ross told
reporters that more talks are needed to revive the
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, which have been stalled for
months over the extent of next Israeli troop pullback in the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Ross, who began his current peace mission Thursday, said that
the U.S. plan to break the stalemate was still under discussion
and he will hold a third round of talks with Arafat and Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported that Ross is expected to brief
Netanyahu on a detailed response from Arafat regarding Israel's
demand for security. And the extent of next redeployment will
also be discussed at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
David Bar-Illan, Netanyahu's communications advisor, said that
in their second meeting Saturday night, Ross and Netanyahu did not
discuss the scope of the withdrawal, but focused on security
issues and the question of reciprocity.
</P>
<P>
He said that "the main obstacle to continuation (of the peace
process) has not been the Palestinians' desire for territory, but
the possibility of further terrorism." He added that the
territorial issue will be discussed at Sunday's meetings.
</P>
<P>
The redeployment plan proposed by the U.S. on the eve of
Ross's mission reportedly calls for Israel to hand over 13.1
percent of the West Bank to the PNA, but it exceeds the Israeli
government's consensus adopted last Sunday, under which no more
than 9 percent can be given up. The plan has not been disclosed.
</P>
<P>
"We're not ready to accept a 13.1 percent withdrawal,
because it endangers Israel's security," Bar-Illan said.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Arafat told reporters in Gaza Saturday
that he expects Israel to implement the signed accords, adding
that he had not agreed to any U.S. proposals.
</P>
<P>
Nabil Amer, Arafat's political adviser, also said that "any
U.S. initiative must contain a timetable of the redeployment
stages" and demanded the U.S. stand by its commitments.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Economist: Asian Economic Crisis May Last for Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 28 (Xinhua) -- It would take several years
to resolve the financial and economic turmoil in Asia, a leading
U.S. economist predicted earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
"The financial crisis may be stablizing, but not the economic
crisis," said David Wyss, chief economist for Standard &AMP; Poor's
DRI, a major provider of economic data, analysis, forecasts and
advice, at a conference held in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
Economic growth of the United States will slow over the
next two years because of the economic crisis of Asia, said Wyss.
</P>
<P>
DRI'S baseline forecast calls for the U.S. economy, which grew
by 3.8 percent last year, to grow by 2.8 percent this year and 1.7
percent in 1999 before rebounding in 2000.

<HEADLINE> Red Cross Sends Medicines to S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The International Committee of the
Red Cross (ICRC) has sent 700 kms of medicines to two clinics in
the war-ravaged city of Kenema in eastern Sierra Leone, according
to reports by the News Agency of Nigeria Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Medicines would also be supplied to the city's main hospital,
the agency quoted ICRC Deputy Head of Mission in Lagos Patrick
Megevand as saying.
</P>
<P>
The report of the ICRC delivery coincided with a United
Nations promise to provide 12 million U.S. Dollars for food,
shelter, medicine and other needs to people displaced by the war
in the country.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. fund will also be used for the repatriation,
rehabilitation and resettlement of refugees.
</P>
<P>
The ICRC, which had suspended relief work outside the capital
city of Freetown because of the recent fighting, has now been
able to assess the medical needs, food situation and clean water
supply of Kenema residents, displaced people and those detained
as a result of the fighting in the key town, Megevand said.
</P>
<P>
Hostilities broke out last month between the west African
peace-keeping force (ECOMOG) and the military junta, which seized
power in a coup last May.
</P>
<P>
The bitter war to dislodge the junta and restore the
legitimate government destroyed infrastructure in most of Sierra
Leone's major cities.
</P>
<P>
Megevand said in a statement issued here Friday that
distribution of food and other supplies to people in Freetown,
whose homes were destroyed, has been completed.
</P>
<P>
The food distribution has also been made to displaced people,
including Liberian refugees as well as some 6,500 people in
various public institutions, hospitals and orphanages.
</P>
<P>
"(ICRC) Delegates regularly visit more than 1,000 detainees
being held at Freetown's central prison, where they also
distribute personal hygiene items to new arrivals," said
Megevand.
</P>
<P>
"Delegates hope to resume relief work in the next few weeks in
areas where security conditions permit," he added.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the ICRC has launched a large-scale
agricultural aid program in northern Uganda to enable more than
260,000 people displaced by the conflict in the country to grow
their own food, according to the statement.

<HEADLINE> Kenya: UNHCR Flies Somali Refugees Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) kicked off its repatriation of
Somali refugees in Kenya with 121 refugees from the Dadaab camps
flying home on Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
In a press release issued Saturday, UNHCR said that more than
700 Somali refugees would return to Somalia's northeast region
within next six days.
</P>
<P>
According to UNHCR, each returnee will receive six months of
food aid or a cash equivalent, plus 30 U.S. Dollars for onward

</P>
<P>
UNHCR staff in Bossasso in northeastern Somalia will
distribute plastic sheeting, blankets and jerricans to each

</P>
<P>
It noted that UNHCR staff in Bossasso have been working with
local and international aid agencies to implement quick impact
projects including funding for wells, hospitals and health care
centers and income generation projects.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, more than 115,000 Somali refugees have been
repatriated from refugee camps in Kenya which currently shelters
some 178,000 refugees.
</P>
<P>
Ten refugee camps across Kenya have been closed since 1992
with only three camps remaining near Dadaab in Northeastern
Province of kenya, one camp at Kakuma south of the Sudanese
border.
</P>
<P>
The last remaining camp at Jomvu in Coast Province will close
in April following the repatriation of its 1,400 refugees to
Somalia's Bajunis Islands.
</P>
<P>
In February this year, UNHCR returned 10,000 Somali refugees
from camps in Ethiopia to Hargeisa in northwest Somalia and UNHCR

ADDIS ABABA, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Commissioner of the Federal
Civil Service of Ethiopia Alemayehu Haile-Mariam Saturday urged
the public to raise the representation of women in the civil
service.

<P>
Speaking at a meeting here on raising public awareness on

</P>
<P>
He said that nearly 98.7 percent of women employees in
Ethiopia are engaged in activities with lower statues.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner underlined that the figure shows how
insignificant the role of women play in decision making.
</P>
<P>
It is the duty as well as the responsibility of parents,
schools, government organizations and the public at large to
raise the representation of women in the civil service, he said,
adding that every citizen should respect the democratic and human
rights of the fair sex.

<HEADLINE> Rwandan Recovery Needs Aid: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 28 (Xinhua) -- President Pasteur Bizimungu said
that Rwanda needs assistance in its recovery, according to a
special dispatch sent to Xinhua Saturday by Rwanda News Agency
(RNA).
</P>
<P>
Rwanda needs to be assisted in its recovery process,
especially in relieving its heavy external debt, explained
President Bizimungu, who returned from Uganda after the Entebbe
summit on peace and prosperity attended by some African leaders
and visiting U.S. president Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The Rwandan President said Wednesady afternoon they "agreed
that the international community should assist Rwanda in
providing material means so that we may (be able to) deal with
acts of genocide."
</P>
<P>
Rwandan minister of foreign affairs Anastase Gasana also told
RNA, "The'1.6 billion external debt is extremely heavy for a poor
country that has been ruined by genocide and war."
</P>
<P>
Any assistance should go in the direction of relieving Rwanda
of this burden which hinders its recovery, Gasana noted.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his satisfaction about promises made by President
Clinton to help Rwandans cope up with the aftermath of the
genocide, but hoped that the promises will materialize.
</P>
<P>
Clinton had promised a two-million-U.S.-Dollar contribution to
the Genocide Survivors' Fund.
</P>
<P>
According to Gasana, the best way the U.S. government would
assist Rwanda would be to take the lead in pushing the
international community to devise a special financial program for
the reconstruction of the country, and the promotion of national
unity and reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the region agreed at the Entebbe summit to stop
these acts in checking cross-border infiltration and arresting
the authors of the genocide who are still active.

<HEADLINE> Aerial Spraying in Ethiopia Against Locust </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Aerial spraying has been
carried out as from Thursday to prevent the spread of locust
invasion that surfaced in some parts of eastern Ethiopia, the
Ministry of Agriculture said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here, the ministry said the spraying has
been launched against swarms of locust from north Somalia in
areas between Jijiga and Dire Dawa in the east.
</P>
<P>
According to the ministry, an aircraft was obtained from the
East Africa Desert Locust Control Organization and the
organization has agreed to assign another aircraft to speed up
the surveillance and prevention campaign.
</P>
<P>
It says, if need be, a third aircraft will be hired from the
Ethiopian Airlines for spraying service.
</P>
<P>
The ministry urged residents to be vigilant in reporting any
such occurrences quickly to the nearest agriculture office.
</P>
<P>
Swarms of locust were surfaced in Ethiopia's Somali region
last Monday. A swarm at a point 25 kilometers from Jijiga covers
an area of up to 1,500 hectares, according to an earlier report
from the Somali region.

<HEADLINE> No Plot to Topple S. African Govt: SAPA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 28 (Xinhua) -- There was no plot to
overthrow the South African government as widely reported, South
African Press Association (SAPA) quoted a highly-placed source as
saying Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The investigative commission appointed by South African
President Nelson Mandela is trying to probe why a military
intelligence report lied to Mandela that there was such a plot.
</P>
<P>
The report, which was handed over to Mandela on February 5,
claimed that former soldiers of the armed wing of the African
National Congress (ANC), Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK), wanted to
overthrow Mandela's government.
</P>
<P>
"We don't believe there was such a plot. We're trying to
establish why the president was lied to by being given a false
report," SAPA quoted the source, who refused to be identified, as
saying.
</P>
<P>
According to SAPA, the source echoed previous information that
South African National Defense Force chief Georg Meiring was to
feature prominently in the inquiry, which will probe "how, why,
when the report was compiled, the motive behind it, and the way
it was handled."
</P>
<P>
Three of South Africa's top judges began their investigation
earlier Saturday at an undisclosed venue.
</P>
<P>
The president's office Saturday expressed concern about
"misleading" headlines in newspapers countrywide that the
commission would investigate a plot against the government.
</P>
<P>
"It is investigating the process relating to the compilation,
verification and subsequent treatment of the report."
</P>
<P>
In a statement on Saturday, Meiring welcomed the inquiry and
said he had the fullest confidence in members of the commission.
He also pledged the defense force's "maximum support" for the
judicial probe.
</P>
<P>
Allegations of a possible coup against the government surfaced
in news reports after senior Foreign Ministry official Robert
Mcbride was arrested in Mozambique on suspicion of gun-running.
</P>
<P>
The commission of inquiry, headed by chief justice Ismail
Mohamed, follows a March 18 statement by Safety and Security
Minister Sydney Mufamadi to parliament on Mcbride's arrest.
</P>
<P>
Mufamadi lashed out at "elements" in the security
establishment of attempting to destabilize the country.
</P>
<P>
"The government is perfectly familiar with misinformation
techniques used in the past to prepare for and to legitimize
destabilization programs," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mufamadi accused those security elements who had spread
information to the media that Mcbride might have been involved in
an overthrow plot by "left-wing generals," of being bent on
undermining peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
SAPA quoted another source as saying that the government was
immediately suspicious of the military intelligence report
because the report had been leaked to a journalist, who was
allegedly to be an "long-standing" military intelligence agent.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Opens Trade Center in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. President
Bill Clinton opened a commercial center in Johannesburg Saturday
evening to promote economic cooperation between African and U. S.
businesses.
</P>
<P>
The Ronald Brown Commercial Center, named in honor of late
U.S. secretary of commerce Ronald Brown, will serve as a trade
center for 48 African countries, including South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Opening the center in Illovo in the wealthy Johannesburg
suburb of Sandton, Clinton said that trade could not replace aid
to uplift African countries.
</P>
<P>
"A new partnership in trade and investment should not come at
the expense of development assistance," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
He sought to quell concerns by some South Africans that the
United States intended to replace traditional foreign development
aid with trade and commercial measures.
</P>
<P>
"We agree that the aid programs should be extended, that it
should not be replaced by trade, but instead supplemented for
it," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated U.S. commitment to enhance trade and investment
ties with African countries.
</P>
<P>
The United States is one of the largest investors in South
Africa and some 3,000 American companies are operating in the
country.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Suggests Total Debt Relief for Reforming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. President
Bill Clinton suggested here Saturday that the bilateral debt of
poorer African countries reforming their economies should be
canceled.
</P>
<P>
Opening the Ronald Brown Commercial Center on his four-day
state visit in South Africa, Clinton challenged other
industrialized countries to do the same.
</P>
<P>
"I have also asked Congress to wipe all bilateral and
sectional debt for the fastest reforming poor nations in Africa,"
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
"In total our budget request this year would commit up to 1.6
billion U.S. Dollars in bilateral debt relief. I challenge others
in the industrial world to come with more debt relief," he added.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. President said he intended raising the matter at the
summit of leading industrialized nations in Britain in May.
</P>
<P>
He said the debt relief would form part of the U.S.
partnership plan for economic growth and opportunity in Africa.
The program, which has still to be passed by the U.S. Senate,
would also offer African countries greater access to U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
African countries aggressively pursuing economic reforms under
the policies of the International Monetary Fund, according to the
plan, would be able to export almost 30 percent of their products
to America duty free.
</P>
<P>
"those with the greatest commitment to reform will benefit the
most, whether they are the richest or the poorest," Claimed Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. would also call on its industrial partners to secure a
commitment from the World Bank to increase lending to Africa with as
much as 1.1 billion U.S. Dollars, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the average annual return in U.S. investment in
Africa was 30 percent, adding, "this is a good deal."
</P>
<P>
Yet only one percent of U.S. trade and direct foreign
investment was in Africa. This could be much improved through new
partnerships, he said.
</P>
<P>
Describing his African tour as an incredible experience,
Clinton said his trip was not a one-off exercise. He intended
inviting foreign leaders to a summit in Washington as a follow-up
on his African trip.
</P>
<P>
A new trade partnership between the U.S. and Africa should not
be at the expense of development assistance, Clinton said, adding
trade could not replace aid while there were still many problems
such as poverty, illiteracy and disease.
</P>
<P>
The commercial center in Johannesburg was named after former
U.S. Commerce Secretary Ronald Brown who died in a plane crash in
1996.
</P>
<P>
Clinton winds up his South African visit on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Mozambique Seeks to Revitalize Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano started his week-long state visit Saturday to China,
aiming to enhance its relations with China, particularly in
economy.
</P>
<P>
This is the second visit to China for President Chissano as
head of state. Previously, he had been to China for four times.
</P>
<P>
President Chissano told Xinhua Wednesday: "We will reaffirm
our hope that the economic relationship can be as good as the
political one between the two countries."
</P>
<P>
The president said that he will invite more Chinese
businessmen to invest in his country, adding that recently, more
and more Chinese entrepreneurs came on study tours to Mozambique
and showed keen interest in investing in this southern African
country.
</P>
<P>
"The future is broad for our cooperation," said the Mozambican
president. His current visit at the invitation of Chinese
President Jiang Zemin signals a new era for Sino-Mozambican
relationship.
</P>
<P>
Chissano said they are interested in China's economic reforms
and its opening up to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
During the early period when Mozambican people were fighting
for their independence, China offered its generous support to
them.
</P>
<P>
China has provided over 38,000 tons of grains and other
materials to the southern African state since they established
diplomatic relations on June 25, 1975, the day of independence of
Mozambique, in addition to several loans with which 11
cooperation packages including five in agriculture are bearing
fruits.
</P>
<P>
Since 1976, 11 Chinese medical teams in Mozambique have earned
trust and credit from the Mozambican people for their efforts in
Maputo and the outlying regions in the west and the north. They
helped tens of thousands of patients get rid of pains.
</P>
<P>
But there was once a downturn in the economic cooperation.
Therefore, President Chissano said that his country will do its
best to strengthen cooperation with China in various fields such
as science, technology, trade and culture.
</P>
<P>
Mozambican government has consistently paid high attention to
its relationship with China. Former President of Mozambique
Samora Machel also paid five visits to China and a number of
cabinet ministers have been to China,too, which greatly promoted
the mutual understanding between the two nations and enhanced
their cooperation.
</P>
<P>
China has also attached great importance to the
Sino-Mozambican relations.
</P>
<P>
In May 1995, the then Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji who is now the
Chinese Premier paid a visit to Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
And last May, the then Premier and now Chairman of The
Standing Committe of the National People's Congress of China, LI
Peng visited the southern African state, pushing the friendly
relationship to a new stage.
</P>
<P>
Hu Jintao, member of the Standing Committee of the Central
Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, on February 16 told the
visiting Secretary-General of the Mozambique Liberation Front
Party (FRELIMO), Manuel Tome, that frequent visits of high-level
officials of both countries had further enhanced the friendly
relationship of cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
China and Mozambique respect, support and cooperate with each
other both in bilateral relations and on international stage.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican government firmly sticks to its one-China
policy. And it has given strong support to China in
international affairs, particularly the issue of human rights.
</P>
<P>
The trade between China and Mozambique grew from 2.32 million
U.S. Dollars in 1993 to about 16 million U.S. Dollars in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique has a coastal line of 2600 kilometers, 25 rivers
and 36 million hectares of arable land. Therefore, its
government attaches great importance to the development of
agriculture and fishery and has extended its welcome to foreign
investors for investment and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Mozambican leaders told Chinese ambassador Shao Guanfu late
last year that they wanted China to largely invest in the
agricultural development in the southern African country.
</P>
<P>
They agreed with the ambassador that China has rich
experiences in the development of agriculture and fishery, and
the potential is great for their cooperation.
</P>
<P>
As Mozambican Prime Minister Pascoal Mocumbi put it, China has
a rather big base of industry and it can set up factories and
business branches in his country, and the Chinese products can be
sold here and to other countries.
</P>
<P>
According to an agreement signed by the two governments when
Prime Minister Mocumbi was visiting China last year, a site in
Maputo has been chosen for constructing the China Trade Center of
Investment and Development. Anhui Province in east China has
initially planned to set up a ceramic tile plant, a
pharmaceutical factory in Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
Groups of experts have come from China to investigate the
situation of farming, shrimp raising and sugar cane planting in
Mozambique. They all believed that the conditions for cooperation
are fairly good.
</P>
<P>
As a member of both the World Trade Organization and the
Southern African Development Community (SADC) as well as that of
the British Commonwealth, Mozambique enjoys favorable trade
status.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique's industries are mainly devoted to the processing
of primary materials. Food processing formed the traditional
basis of this sector, with sugar refining, cashew-and
wheat-processing predominating.
</P>
<P>
However, textile production and brewing gained in importance
during the 1980s. Fishing is a relatively recent development on
this extensive coast. A promising future seems likely for
industrial fishing. Shrimps and prawns are Mozambique's major
export earners.

<HEADLINE> Weapon Dealers Captured in Gaza </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian security forces
in Gaza have captured a number of weapon dealers in a recent
crackdown, Israel Radio reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed Dahlan, head of the Palestinian security forces in
Gaza, was quoted by the radio as saying that no evidence of
connection has been found between the dealers and the radical
Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas.
</P>
<P>
Dahlan made the remarks amid reports that the Palestinian
security forces last week uncovered seven bomb factories in Gaza
operated by Hamas and arrested 10 of its members.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of hand grenades, anti-tank rockets and a large
quantity of explosives were uncovered in the raids, according to
the reports.
</P>
<P>
But Hamas leader in Gaza Abdul Aziz Rantisi denied the reports.
</P>
<P>
Israel, however, was suspicious of the reports, saying it could
be a Palestinian propaganda ploy.
</P>
<P>
"These things usually are dreamed up at very appropriate
moments," David Bar-Illan, media adviser to Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, said.
</P>
<P>
He implied that the disclosure, which he said has not been
confirmed by Israel, might be prompted by the ongoing visit of the
United States Mideast peace envoy Dennis Ross to Israel and the
Palestinian self-rule area.
</P>
<P>
"This only proves the need for cooperation between the two
security establishments," Bar-Illan added.
</P>
<P>
Ross is shuttling between Israeli and Palestinian leaders to
persuade them to accept a U.S. initiative, which reportedly calls
on Israel to withdraw from 13.1 percent of the West Bank met by
Palestinian fulfillment of commitments to security.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Seeks Protection of Rare Animals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnamese government is taking
measures to protect endangered animals, particularly tigers and
single-horned rhinoceros, from extinction.
</P>
<P>
Laws have been promulgated to ban the hunting of 36 rare animal
species including tigers, rhinoceros, five-colored monkeys and
spotted deer.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that tigers, thousands of which roamed in the
tropical jungles in the 1960s, now number only about 150 and are
scattered in 17 provinces from the north to the central highlands.
</P>
<P>
Single-horned rhinoceros, one of the rarest animals in the
country, have only eight survivors lingering in the jungles of Bal
Loc in Lam Dong Province.
</P>
<P>
The rapid disappearance of rare animals in Vietnam has been
contributed to such factors as overlogging of forests, man's
excessive intrusion into the forestry and the loss of natural food
due to ecological imbalance, with illegal hunting held as the most
damaging.

<P>
WASHINGTON, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Charles Brewer of the United
States retained his International Boxing Federation super
middleweight title in Atlantic City, New Jersey, on Saturday after
beating Herol Graham of Britain in the 10th round.
</P>
<P>
After a barrage of punches in the 10th round, Brewer sent the
38-year-old Graham defenseless against the ropes.
</P>
<P>
The 28-year-old Brewer raised his record to 31-5 while Graham
was 48-6.
</P>
<P>
Brewer came back from two knockouts in a span of five months in
1994 to win the IBF title by stopping South African Gary Ballard
in the fifth round last June, and retained the title against Joey
De Grandis on a 12-round decision in December.
</P>
<P>
Graham, who began his career in 1978, did not fight for more
than four years from 1992 to 1996. Saturday's fight was his fifth
since coming back in November 1996.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, one of the major
textile producers in China, plans to cut 682,000 outdated spindles
this year.
</P>
<P>
So far, 12,000 spindles have been cut.
</P>
<P>
The most difficult problem now is the reemployement of surplus
workers, according to the local government. The municipality will
lay off 27,000 workers from the current 270,000 in the industry.
</P>
<P>
The local government has worked out measures, such as expanding
employement opportunities, providing funds and training courses
for lay offs.
</P>
<P>
China's textile industry has been plagued by overproduction and
chronic inefficiency in recent years. The industry is taking
severe steps to cut down its bloated scale.
</P>
<P>
China plans to reduce 4.8 million outmoded spindles this
year. Since February, more than 220,000 spindles have been
destroyed.

WASHINGTON, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Lennox Lewis rallied to floor
Shannon Briggs three times to retain his WBC heavyweight title in
Atlantic City on Saturday.
</P>

Lewis was a 12-1 favorite, but he didn't look like one in the
first two rounds as Briggs hurt Lewis with a big left hook and a
barrage of punches in the first two rounds.

<P>
From then on, it was all Lewis until the fight was stopped at
1:45 of the fifth round.
</P>
<P>
Lewis had a big third round with several hard jabs and short
rights to the head. In the fourth, Lewis knocked down Briggs with
an overhead right and put him down again with a left as Briggs got
up at 6.
</P>
<P>
In the fifth round, Lewis floored Briggs the third time with a
left-right before referee Frank Cappuccino stopped the bout.
</P>
<P>
The victory raised Lewis' record to 33-1, including 27
knockouts, while Briggs fell to 30-2 with 24 knockouts.

<P>
BEIJING, March 29 (Xinhua) -- China is expected to produce 22
million tons of salt this year, of which 6.7 million tons will be
edible salt.
</P>
<P>
A recent report from the China Salt Association points out that
China will control the total salt output because the country now
has a large stock of salt.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the average annual salt output has topped
28 million tons in recent years. And the salt stock of the country
has reached 19 million tons.
</P>
<P>
To make full use of salt resources, China will make efforts to
develop salt chemicals.
</P>
<P>
China will complete its iodized salt project this year to form
an annual production capacity of 8.18 million tons.

<P>
SHENYANG, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Tourism has been booming in
northeast China's Liaoning province due to local efforts in
protecting and improving tourism resources.
</P>
<P>
Local statistics show that the province received 33.4 million
domestic and overseas tourists in 1997, including 390,000 from
overseas, an increase of 30 percent over 1996.
</P>
<P>
In the same year, the province gained 16 billion yuan from
tourism which has become Liaoning's pilot industry.
</P>
<P>
Seven state-level scenic areas, 14 state-level forest parks and
some unique scenic spots like Benxi Shuidong -- Asia's longest
subterranean river, have attracted more Chinese and overseas
visitors.
</P>
<P>
The local government has paid close attention to developing
tourism resources since 1992. Especially in Anshan, an important
industrial center, more than 100 million yuan from the city's
private enterprises has been invested in the construction of
tourism basic facilities.
</P>
<P>
While improving super-highway and railway facilities, the
province opened new flights from Shenyang and Dalian to Japan,
Thailand, Singapore and Malaysia last year. And the province has
120 star hotels mainly for overseas guests.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urges Bosnian Croats, Muslims to Do Much More </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The United States expects Bosnian
Croats and Muslims to do "much more" in strengthening peace, top
U.S. envoy to the Balkans Robert Gelbard said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after meeting Croatian President Franjo
Tudjman here, Gelbard said he was very frustrated with the
disputes between the Bosnian Muslim and Croatian sides.
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, I'm very tired and frustrated with both sides
pointing fingers at each other and accusing each other of not
doing enough, when they should be paying attention to do things on
their own," said Gelbard.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. envoy stressed: "Now that there is a positive,
pro-democracy, pro-Dayton government in the Republika Srpska, the
focus is much more on the federation."
</P>
<P>
Gelbard came to Croatia at the end of a one-day tour of Bosnia,
where he met leaders of all three ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
In Sarajevo, Bosnian Croat leader Kresimir Zubak abruptly ended
his meeting with Gelbard, protesting Gelbard's criticism of the
behaviors by Bosnian Croats.
</P>
<P>
Gelbard admitted that he had a very difficult meeting with
Zubak, who "only wanted to criticize the other side."
</P>
<P>
The United States and other western countries repeatedly have
criticized Bosnian Croats and Croatia for undermining the Dayton
peace agreement by stopping refugees from returning and stalling
the implementation of election results.
</P>
<P>
In February, the United States also put pressure on Bosnian
Muslim leaders, asking them to lift obstacles for Croats and Serbs
seeking to return to Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
Bosnian Serbs, who control the other half of Bosnia -- known as
Republika Srpska -- recently elected a relatively moderate
government and have expressed willingness to put the 1995 Dayton
agreement into effect.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Refutes Foreign Mediation in Kosovo Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav Foreign Minister
Zivorad Jovanovic on Saturday strongly refuted the proposal of
foreign mediation in the crisis of Kosovo, a Serbian province of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"Sending a special envoy to mediate in internal affairs of a
sovereign state violates the principles set by the Organization of
Security and Cooperation in Europe, which call for respecting each
country's territorial and sovereign integrity and denouncing
splittism and terrorism," Jovanovic noted.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav foreign minister made the remarks at a joint press
conference here after meeting Bulgarian Foreign Minister Nadezhda
Mihailova, who wanted to persuade the Yugoslav authorities to
accept foreign mediation in the Kosovo problem.
</P>
<P>
Jovanovic said the proposed foreign mediation would be a
support to the Kosovo separatists and worsen the situation.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav news agency Tanjug reported that Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic also talked with Mihailova and said
people in all the Balkan countries should decide their fate by
themselves.
</P>
<P>
During her talks with the Yugoslav leaders, Mihailova briefed
them about the joint declaration on Kosovo issue signed by the
foreign ministers of Bulgaria, Greece, Macedonia, Romania and
Turkey in Sofia earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
She said all the Southeastern European countries were concerned
about the possible spread of the Kosovo crisis into other
countries, which would have negative impact on the whole
Southeastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo has a 90 percent ethnic Albanian majority which has been
seeking independence from Yugoslavia since 1981. Violence there
has been growing this year following the non-implementation of an
education agreement reached between Milosevic and the leader of
the ethnic Albanians, Ibrahim Rugova.

PYONGYANG, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) on Sunday urged the United States to lift
all of its sanctions against other countries.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper, Rodong Sinmun, said in a commentary that the
recent U.S. partial lifting of sanctions against Cuba and Vietnam
was a proof that the policy of sanctions is going bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
It was a historical mistake that Washington tried, in its
efforts to create a U.S.-dominated world order, to isolate and
contain the countries it dislikes, said the official newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. sanctions are incompatible with the worldwide trend
toward peace and stability in the post-Cold War era, and have been
criticized and boycotted both at home and abroad, it said.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Warns Youths Against Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's Mental Health
Department has warned that increased drug use and sexual attacks
have posed a serious problem for youths in the country.
</P>
<P>
The department urged all educational institutions to pay more
attention to strengthening the "life skills" of young people.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Preecha Intho, Director General of the department, said
since youths were the most vulnerable, it was important to focus
on strengthening young people's decision-making process.
</P>
<P>
Advertisements and friends, which seem to have a strong
influence on the decision-making process of youths, may at times
be misleading and result in problems, Preecha said in remarks
published by Bangkok Post Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He said it was observed that most problems that occur among
youths were due to the lack of information.
</P>
<P>
"By involving students in a two-way communication with their
teachers, it would enable them to adjust themselves to the rapidly
changing environment, which is often the cause of the problem,"
Preecha said.
</P>
<P>
He said that by enabling youths to screen information they
receive before making decisions, there would be a reduction of
problems like unwanted pregnancy, HIV/AIDS, drug addiction,
accidents and nutritional problems.
</P>
<P>
Thailand was considering setting up an information network
among some 30,000 schools under the primary education office,
which is responsible for some 500,000 students throughout the
country, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
Many educational institutions in Thailand have been facing
problems in the past due to a shortage of the so-called "guidance
teachers" usually responsible for advising students on personal
issues, the paper said.

QUITO, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The Ecuadoran military has seized
20 tons of marijuana at a port of the coastal city of Guayaquil,
and detained a number of drug trafficking suspects.
</P>
<P>
The military said the drug, possibly from Columbia and worth
about 44 million U.S. dollars if it hits the street, was one of
the largest seizures in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The drug was in a container owned by a banana-exporting company
in Guayaquil, the largest industrial city of Ecuador now turned
into a major drug distribution center in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
It has reportedly become a usual trick by drug traffickers to
collude with local companies and mix drugs with export goods bound
for Europe and North America, where the drugs will be sold.
</P>
<P>
In the latest seizure, the drug traffickers were alleged to
have ganged up with the exporter and attempted to ship the drug to
the United States.

<HEADLINE> Thai Central Bank Urged to Halt Bank Competition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Thailand (BOT), the
country's central bank, should take measures to prevent excessive
competition among banks for deposits through the unchecked rise in
interest rates, the Sunday Nation reported.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Deputy Finance Minister Pisit Leeahtam as
saying that he would make a proposal to the BOT.
</P>
<P>
Pisit's words came after Bangkok Bank, the country's largest
commercial bank, complained that four commercial banks taken over
by the government had been offering high interest rates to win
deposits from other banks.
</P>
<P>
Besides the four banks, namely Siam City Bank, First Bangkok
City Bank, Bangkok Metropolitan Bank and Bangkok Bank of Commerce,
a new state bank, Radanasin Bank, is also trying to win deposits.
</P>
<P>
Small and medium-sized banks have complained more bitterly
about the competition from the recently nationalized banks, saying
they are using state credibility to compete and make other banks
suffer.
</P>
<P>
Pisit said a regulation dating back to September last year
forbids state banks such as Krung Thai, Government Savings Bank,
Government Housing Bank and Bank for Agriculture and Agricultural
Cooperatives to offer interest rates on deposits beyond the
official rates announced by Krung Thai Bank.
</P>
<P>
He said the four newly-nationalized banks must also abide by
this framework, which must be tightened.
</P>
<P>
"But i want the central bank to have a good understanding of
the entire picture first and not solve a particular aspect of the
problem," he added.
</P>
<P>
Pisit, a former central banker, said it was not the government's
policy to see the entire system competing excessively.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that the state banks should not compete through
pricing but quality of service.

<HEADLINE> China's Investment Package Lures Overseas Bankers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 29 (Xinhua) -- China's planned investment of one
trillion US dollars before the year 2000 will provide huge
opportunites for foreign banks seeking to flex muscles in the
world most populous nation, "China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The infrastructure projects, major targets in the country's
overall investment package, are sure to import equipment and
materials, resulting in opportunities for foreign banks to supply
trade financing including export buyer's and seller's credits,
John Beeman, corporate officer for China of the US-Based Citibank,
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Foreign banks will also be able to supply project financing for
infrastructure construction, and provide such services as loans
and securities issues.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Beeman said, foreign banks can arrange or take part
in international syndicated loans for Chinese projects, while
acting as a bridge between domestic firms and their international
clients.
</P>
<P>
As one of the foreign banks gaining a firm foothold in China,
Citibank will focus on large domestic and overseas-funded ventures

<HEADLINE> Nuclear Bid Draws World Power Giants to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The entering of US companies has
intensified the competition among international nuclear companies
bidding for one or two nuclear power projects to be announced by
the Chinese Government at the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Today's China Daily reported in a headline story that the US
government recently lifted its ban on the export of nuclear
technology to China.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper reported that Westinghouse Electric Co. and
General Electric have formed teams with Japanese counterparts
including Mitsubishi, Toshiba and Hitachi in the bid.
</P>
<P>
Westinghouse has promised to help China grow into an exporter
of nuclear power.
</P>
<P>
The commitment is aimed to meet China's requirement for
localization and mature, safe and advanced foreign technology.
</P>
<P>
Among the competitors for the projects are Framatome, a French
company that has already had four generators installed in two
nuclear power stations in China, and companies from Canada and
Russia.
</P>
<P>
"However there will be opportunities for more than one
company," the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
It quoted experts as saying that Russian and Canadian companies
are unlikely to make great progress in the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
Experts also said that competition will be among two groups.
</P>
<P>
One consists Westinghouse, ABB-CE and Framatome, which use
pressurized water reactors (PWR).
</P>
<P>
The other includes only one team formed by GE, Toshiba and
Hitachi. The team uses boiling water reactors (BWR).

<HEADLINE> Nicaraguan Minister Asks Doctors Back to Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Nicaragua's Health Minister
Lombardo Martinez has asked public health service professionals
back to work during the Holy Week that starts April 5.
</P>
<P>
"There are very serious problems and the situation could be
worse during the Holy Week, when more traffic accidents occur,"
Martinez was quoted as saying by a La Prensa report Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Public health professionals, including those in the emergency
services, have been on a nationwide strike for over a month, to
press for a pay rise 10 times of their current monthly average.
</P>
<P>
Their monthly incomes, now less than one hundred dollars, is
not enough even for most basic necessities, they say.
</P>
<P>
However, said Martinez, the situation will turn tragic if the
doctors continue their walkout during the Holy Week holiday. "We
will have to deplore many casualties."
</P>
<P>
There already have been cases of deaths in Jinotega, Matagalpa
and Managua departments as results of lack of medical attention
during the five weeks of the strike, he said.
</P>
<P>
In a document published Saturday, the Nicaraguan government
said: "we understand the logic of the salary rise demand, but the
strike, besides inhuman, is illegal."
</P>
<P>
In addition, it said "the government does not have resources
for this year."
</P>
<P>
A meeting of the so-called Consultative Group on April 2 and 3
in Geneva, Switzerland, could mean a flicker of hope to end the
dispute between the government and the medical professionals.
</P>
<P>
Martha MacCoy, deputy health minister, said Friday if the
international community decides to back Health Ministry projects,
part of the state budget could be used to satisfy, at least in
part, the salary demand.
</P>
<P>
As one of the Nicaraguan delegates to the meeting, MacCoy will
ask the cooperating group for a financing of approximately 55
million U.S. dollars for Nicaragua's health sector.

WASHINGTON, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Russian Olympic champion Ilya
Kulik withdrew from the World Figure Skating Championships in
Minneapolis on Saturday with a back injury.
</P>
<P>
No details of the injury were released, but Kulik missed the
European Championships earlier this year with back problems.
</P>
<P>
Kulik skated the most difficult technical program in Olympic
history to take the Nagano Olympic gold medal.
</P>
<P>
Yevgeni Pluschenko, the 1997 world junior champion, will
replace Kulik for the event that begins next week.
</P>
<P>
Kulik's withdrawal means all three men's medalists at Nagano
will not be in Minneapolis. Defending champ Elvis Stojko of Canada
has not recovered from a groin injury while Philippe Candeloro of
France has turned professional.
</P>
<P>
Also missing from the worlds will be defending champion Tara
Lipinski, the Olympic women's champion, who is out with a viral
infection.
</P>
<P>
Two-time Olympic dance winners Pasha Grishuk and Yevgeny Platov
have turned professionals and will not add to their collection of

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji will
begin his European trip on April 2 and is scheduled to attend both
the Asia-Europe Meeting (AEM) and the China-EU Summit.
</P>
<P>
Local observers point out that the first meeting between top
leaders from China and the European Union (EU), two important
partners in the international arena, will undoubtedly represent a
giant stride in China-EU relations.
</P>
<P>
Sources say that Zhu, leader of the new Chinese government,
will meet with British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who also serves
as rotating chairman of the EU, and Jacques Santer, president of
the European Commission (EC).
</P>
<P>
Joint efforts by China and the EU in recent years have already
resulted in noteworthy progress in political, economic and trade
cooperation and exchanges.
</P>
<P>
The EU has also adopted positive measures for improving and
strengthening ties with China.
</P>
<P>
The EU submitted a proposal to the EU Council of Ministers at
the end of last year calling for the removal the "nonmarket
economy" label applied to China in the EU Anti-dumpling Policy.
</P>
<P>
In January, the EU proposed holding the first China-EU Summit
during the Second AEM and called for establishing a regular
meeting system thereafter.
</P>
<P>
The February EU Foreign Ministers Meeting ended with a decision
that the presidency and member countries would refrain from
tabling or cosponsoring a draft resolution against China in the
next session of the U.N. Commission on Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
The latest development centered on the EU's March 25 adoption
of a new policy document entitled "Build a Comprehensive
Partnership with China". The new policy is based on the
organization's long-term China policy passed in 1995 and new
strategies formulated in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The move is expected to strengthen China-Europe relations, help
accelerate China's admission into the World Trade Organization
(WTO), and expand bilateral cooperation in wide-ranging areas.

<P>
The Chinese government has consistently attached great
importance and contributed unremitting efforts to developing ties
with the EU and its member states.
</P>
<P>
The EU's wide decisions concerning China have been both
welcomed and greatly appreciated.
</P>
<P>
The world has moved rapidly towards multipolarity since the end
of the Cold War with a strong momentum calling for peace,
stability and development. Major states have taken advantage of
current circumstances to continuously adjust relations with other
nations and form various types of new partnerships.
</P>
<P>
China and EU, two important forces in the increasingly
multipolar world, shoulder great responsibilities and share a
common interest in safeguarding world peace and stability and
promoting common economic development.
</P>
<P>
The EU has established regular meeting mechanisms with a number
of countries in recent years. China has moved in the same
direction by maintaining frequent visits and contacts with other
partners, particular contacts between top leaders.
</P>
<P>
Vhen viewed in terms of the current global backdrop, all of the
aforementioned measures meet the requirements of the current era
and the interest of the two sides, and have greatly benefited
Asia-European cooperation, as well as world peace, stability and
development.
</P>
<P>
Premier Zhu will join in an extensive exchange of views on
deepening Sino-European relations, as well as on other issues of
common concern in order to further promote understanding and
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is expected to add impetus to a long-term, stable
and mutually beneficial Sino-European relationship well into the
21st century.

<HEADLINE> Earliest Inscriptions on Oracle Bones Found (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chinese archaeologists have long held that the inscriptions
found in the Yin Ruins were mature enough and there should be a
period of origin and development of the language before.
</P>
<P>
No clue to the earlier period was found until the sheep blades
were unearthed in Shandong.
</P>
<P>
The sheep blades were stored in a pit made of beams. A group of
four beams crossed like a "#" and 27 of such groups were put on
one another to form the pit. Archaeologists have noted that the
beams on the upper layers had decayed but those on the bottom
remained intact.
</P>
<P>
More than 360 pieces of relics were found in the pits,
including a great number of pottery and stone, bone, horn and
shell pieces. The sheep blades were laid at the bottom of the pit.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists date the relics in the pit to the late Yueshi
Culture because the pottery and stone ware, which are usually used
as criteria in dating, were typical Yueshi ones.
</P>
<P>
Yueshi Culture, first found in the eastern part of Shandong,
dates back some 3,500-4,000 years.
</P>
<P>
Thus the inscriptions on the sheep blade are nearly 300 years
older than those in the Yin Ruins date back some 3,200 years, the
experts say.
</P>
<P>
"The inscriptions on the sheep blade are the oldest written
language ever found," they say.

<HEADLINE> Earliest Inscriptions on Oracle Bones Found (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeologists have
unearthed 3,500-year-old sheep bones bearing inscriptions which
are believed to be the earliest Chinese characters.
</P>
<P>
The bones, two pieces of sheep blades, were found in a pit at a
sacrificial site in Huantai county, east China's Shandong province.
</P>
<P>
Eight characters were carved on the bones, yet Chinese experts
recognized only two. One is a "V" upside-down that was deciphered
as "liu" (six) and the other, looking like the Chinese character
"ru" (enter), was read as "bu" (divination).
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the bones had been burnt and the characters
were roughly but deeply carved, signs of primitive stage of such
written language.
</P>
<P>
Inscription on oracle bones, like cuneiform writing of ancient
Near East and hieroglyphic writing of ancient Egypt, was one of
the oldest writings in the world. Its offspring, "han zi" (Chinese
writing), is still in use by one fourth of world's population,
which makes it different from the other two writings that have
gone with history.
</P>
<P>
Inscriptions on oracle bones were first found in the Yin Ruins,
or remains of the late Shang Dynasty (16-11th Century BC) in
Anyang, central China's Henan province. They recorded how and what
the imperial witches divined.
</P>
<P>
So far more than 10,000 characters have been found there, but
only some 1,000 have been deciphered.

<HEADLINE> Auction Industry Reports Upbeat Performance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 29 (Xinhua) -- While many industries in China
told tales of woe in 1997, the country's auctioneers were writing
a feel-good script that looks set to play on in 1998, China Daily
Business Weekly reported today.
</P>
<P>
In 1997 turnovers of China's auction sector exceeded 10 billion
yuan (1.2 billion US dollars) for the first time to reach 13
billion yuan, marking an end to 10 years of trial development.
</P>
<P>
Last year's figure was 30 percent higher than the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The rapid development indicates that China's auction industry
embraces huge potential, Zhao Jie, secretary-general of the China
Association of Auctioneers was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Under the guidance of the Auction Law that went into effect
early last year, the auction industry has made big strides in
terms of management, sales revenue and the standardization of its
activities.
</P>
<P>
China's auction houses, regulatory system and the investors
involved have all matured, Zhao said. China has more than 1,000
auction houses, employing a staff of 20,000.

HAIKOU, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Forest coverage in south China's
Hainan Province has risen from 18.4 percent ten years ago to the
current 50.5 percent, 36 percentage points higher than the
national average.
</P>
<P>
This is due to great local efforts in environmental control and
afforestation. Since the province was founded in 1988, the local
government has placed emphasis on local forestry development and
promulgated regulations in 1994 aiming to put an end to the
felling of primeval forest.
</P>
<P>
The coverage of local tropical rainforest has gone up to
600,000 hectares at present from 400,000 hectares ten years ago.
</P>
<P>
The province has completed building a shelterbelt along the
coast and has covered barren mountains and wasteland with green.
</P>
<P>
Hainan now has more than 733,000 hectares of artificial forest,
including nearly 467,000 hectares of cash forest like rubber and
fruit.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Nation to Seek Answers to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton on
Saturday urged the nation to find out reasons why two young boys
allegedly gunned down four classmates and a teacher outside their
school in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
"We do not understand what drives children, whether in small
towns or big cities, to pick up guns and take the lives of others.
We may never make sense of the senseless, but we have to try,"
Clinton said in his weekly radio address taped in Cape Town, South
Africa, where he was on a visit.
</P>
<P>
Two boys, 11 and 13, were arrested in connection with the
shootings Tuesday at West Side Middle School in Jonesboro,
Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
The president noted that the Jonesboro shooting was one of a
series of the kind in recent months that a quiet town was "shaken
by the awful specter of students being killed by other young
people at schools."
</P>
<P>
In December, a boy opened fire on a student prayer circle at a
high school in West Paducah, Kentucky, killing three students and
wounding five. Two months earlier, two students were fatally shot
in Pearl, Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said, "We have to understand that young children may
not fully appreciate the consequences of actions that are
destructive but may be able to be romanticized at a twisted
moment."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that efforts should be made to prevent them from
falling into that trap.
</P>
<P>
The president said, "We've worked hard to make our schools
places of learning, not fear -- places where children can worry
about math and science, not guns, drugs and gangs," he said. "But
when a terrible tragedy like this occurs, it reminds us there is
work yet to be done."
</P>
<P>
Clinton also said that he has ordered Attorney General Janet
Reno to organize experts on school violence to analyze the recent
school shootings and determine what they may have in common and
what steps can be taken to reduce the chance of a similar tragedy.

<P>
MOSCOW, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Former Russian Prime Minister
Viktor Chernomyrdin said Saturday that he took the decision to run
for Russian president in 2000 and President Boris Yeltsin agreed
with him, according to Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin made the announcement in an interview with ORT
broadcasting company, which broadcasted the interview in its
political news program Vremya Saturday evening.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin dismissed the whole government on Monday, stating that
the resigned prime minister would be concentrated on preparation
for the presidential elections in 2000.
</P>
<P>
In response to the question whose election and whether he is
going to put forward his candidacy at the elections, Chernomyrdin
said "I will indeed be involved in that work. I have made the
decision to put forward my candidacy for the post of president."
</P>
<P>
He meanwhile emphasized that this was coordinated between the
president and himself.
</P>
<P>
According to Chernomyrdin, Yeltsin was aware of his decision.
"I understood him as agreeing with my position," the former
premier said.
</P>
<P>
On the reasons for his move, Chernomyrdin said that he is ready
today to take all the responsibility for the country, "I know both
what needs to be done and how it should be done," he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked what he would do if the president named somebody else his
successor, Chernomyrdin answered, "I have made my decision and
will not go back."
</P>
<P>
Referring to the dismissal by Yeltsin from the post of prime
minister, he said "if I say I'm not hurt, hardly anybody will
believe me. They will say Viktor Stepanovich is not telling the
truth."
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin had been and still remains an ally of Yeltsin's,
"too much has kept (us) together in these difficult years", he
said.
</P>
<P>
As for the prospects for his party, the Our Home is Russia
(NDR) movement, Chernomyrdin said he is convinced, that "NDR will
be building up its influence."

<HEADLINE> Clinton Suggests Total Debt Relief for Reforming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. President
Bill Clinton suggested here Saturday that the bilateral debt of
poorer African countries reforming their economies should be
canceled.
</P>
<P>
Opening the Ronald Brown Commercial Center on his four-day
state visit in South Africa, Clinton challenged other
industrialized countries to do the same.
</P>
<P>
"I have also asked Congress to wipe all bilateral and
sectional debt for the fastest reforming poor nations in Africa,"
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
"In total our budget request this year would commit up to 1.6
billion U.S. Dollars in bilateral debt relief. I challenge others
in the industrial world to come with more debt relief," he added.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. President said he intended raising the matter at the
summit of leading industrialized nations in Britain in May.
</P>
<P>
He said the debt relief would form part of the U.S.
partnership plan for economic growth and opportunity in Africa.
The program, which has still to be passed by the U.S. Senate,
would also offer African countries greater access to U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
African countries aggressively pursuing economic reforms under
the policies of the International Monetary Fund, according to the
plan, would be able to export almost 30 percent of their products
to America duty free.
</P>
<P>
"those with the greatest commitment to reform will benefit the
most, whether they are the richest or the poorest," Claimed Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. would also call on its industrial partners to secure a
commitment from the World Bank to increase lending to Africa with as
much as 1.1 billion U.S. Dollars, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the average annual return in U.S. investment in
Africa was 30 percent, adding, "this is a good deal."
</P>
<P>
Yet only one percent of U.S. trade and direct foreign
investment was in Africa. This could be much improved through new
partnerships, he said.
</P>
<P>
Describing his African tour as an incredible experience,
Clinton said his trip was not a one-off exercise. He intended
inviting foreign leaders to a summit in Washington as a follow-up
on his African trip.
</P>
<P>
A new trade partnership between the U.S. and Africa should not
be at the expense of development assistance, Clinton said, adding
trade could not replace aid while there were still many problems
such as poverty, illiteracy and disease.
</P>
