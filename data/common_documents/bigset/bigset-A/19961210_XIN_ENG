<HEADLINE> Chinese And American Scientists Plumb Earth's Depths (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 9 (Xinhua) -- A joint project to study the
tectonic forces that created the Himalaya uplift, which has come
up with some important discoveries, is being carried out by
Chinese and American scientists.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Wenjin, the chief scientist from the Chinese side to be
involved in the International Deep Profiling of Tibet and the
Himalayas project said, "Scientists have gotten the first seismic
picture of the deep geological structure of the Qinghai-Tibet
Plateau, using deep seismic echo techniques."
</P>
<P>
Chinese and American scientists spent two years and more than
four million US dollars on the project, in the process setting off
more than 100 tons of explosives along the 340-km road from Pagri
to Darnxung in the Tibet Autonomous Region, to simulate
earthquakes, and recording the wave patterns coming back from the
depths of the earth.
</P>
<P>
The 2,000-km exploration of parts of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau
is a premier event in the study of continental collisions, and is
estimated at a cost of 200 to 300 million yuan (24-36 million US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Zhao said analyses have indicated that two partially-molten
fluid layers exist in mid-crust areas below southern Tibet, which
are divided by the Yarlung Zangbo river. The evolution of the
Himalayas is thought to be a record of the southward extrusion of
the partially-molten fluid layers, which are the source of magma
accumulating in the area.

<P>
Zhao also concluded that the split of the Yarlung Zangbo
fracture does not extend as deeply into the earth as many
scientists have thought, but probably stops at a depth of several
dozen kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The continental collision between India and Asia produced the
first continental thrust beneath the fracture, which was elevated
after an extrusion of the southern lower crust, so a second
continental underthrust was created.
</P>
<P>
The Himalaya range and adjacent Tibetan plateau, which forms
the Earth's largest region of elevated topography with anomalously
thick crust, is the result of a collision between India and Asia,
and is considered the archetypal continent-to-continent collision.
</P>
<P>
The region has long been the focus of attention by geologists,
who regard research work on it as the key to solving the
fundamental problems of continental dynamics.
</P>
<P>
The project is sponsored by the China Ministry of Geology and
Mineral Resources, the National Science Foundation of the US, and
the Chinese National Natural Science Foundation.
</P>
<P>
The project's third-phase is expected to begin next year, and
will cover the Nujiang River and the oil-rich Qiangtang Basin. It
will be the project's crucial phase, with the workload expected to
be 14 times as great.
</P>
<P>
China, the United States and Germany will participate in next
year's work.

<HEADLINE> Ruins of Earliest Daoist Temple Found in Hubei </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Archeologists in central China's
Hubei Province have claimed that they have found the ruins of a
Daoist temple dating back some 2,000 years, a century earlier than
the traditional date of the introduction of Daoism.
</P>
<P>
Daoism is said to have been founded by Philosopher Lao Zi in
the sixth century BC, teaching conformity to the Dao by
unassertive action and retirement from the world for pristine
simplicity.
</P>
<P>
But it later became a highly syncretistic religion, greatly
concerned with obtaining longevity and immortality, often by magical
means.
</P>
<P>
It is widely accepted that Daoism became a religion during the
reign of Emperor Shun of the Eastern Han Dynasty (126-144), at
least 120 years later than the newly-found temple ruins.
</P>
<P>
The ruins were found near the top of a mountain on the southern
bank of the Yangtze River in Badong County. A local legend has it
that a Daoist temple once graced atop the mountain.
</P>
<P>
A rusty iron wand, an iron axe, other fragments of iron ware
and a large number of tiles and pottery from the Han Dynasty (206
BC-AD 221) have been found at the site.
</P>
<P>
The experts have also collected iron padlock, coins, a potter's
wheel and a small bronze circle, which were picked up from
the site by locals.

<HEADLINE> SADC Food, Nutrition Seminar Opens in Harare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 9 (Xinhua) -- A three-day SADC food and
nutrition seminar started here today to discuss food insecurity
and malnutrition in southern Afrcia.
</P>
<P>
Managers of food and nutrition programs of the Southern
African Development Community (SADC) countries are attendting the
high level seminar.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony, Zimbabwe's Director for Plan
Implementation in the National Economic Planning Commission Edgar
Chigudu said that policy formulation on the matters of food and
nutrition in the region remained weak and not consultative
enough.
</P>
<P>
He stressed it was imperative for food and nutrition policies
to be part of economic reform packages ''not just on paper, but
in reality''.
</P>
<P>
He said recent evidence pointed to high rates of infant
mortality, deterioration in child nutritional status, increased
anaemia and malnutrition among women.
</P>
<P>
He said recurrent droughts that have affected the region
during the last decade brought to light the damage that could be
caused by lack of preparedness.
</P>
<P>
He noted the key challenge facing African governments at the
moment is the creation of necessary conditions for sustained
economic growth. enditem

HARARE, December 9 (Xinhua) -- A Zimbabwe minister today
hailed the just-ended 19th France-Africa conference held in
Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso for bringing to the fore the importance
of good governance and development.
</P>
<P>
Lands and Water Resources Minister Kumbirayi Kangai, who
represented President Robert Mugabe at the three-day summit, said
here that a number of resolutions and recommendations were made
to foster the link between good governance and development.
</P>
<P>
''The ultimate goal of development is to build a social order
conceived within a vision of justice and peace, accepted by the
majority but respectful of societies, which allows the welfare of
all and contributes to general welfare,'' Kangai said.
</P>
<P>
He said the heads of state and delegations at the conference
reaffirmed their position that the state should be the
driving force for development in any country.
</P>
<P>
''To be sustainable, development must be based on the
observance of the rule of law, and be achieved through an
efficient administration ensuring good governance, and allowing
the realisation of collective well-being,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Often blamed for abusing human rights, the heads of state
committed themselves to adopting democratic legal provisions, he
said. enditem

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Controversy Dominates Anglo-EU Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In late March, the EU imposed a global ban on British beef
products export after the British government admitted possible
links between BSE, or mad cow disease, and its human equivalent
Creutzfeldt Jacob Disease. In response, British Prime Minister
John Major immediately declared an overall non-cooperation policy
with the EU, blocking all agreements with various EU institutions.
</P>
<P>
Although both sides struck a compromise agreement at the
Florence EU Summit in June, when the EU agreed to a step-by-step
lifting of the trade embargo on British beef products, the
three-month "beef war" almost paralysed the operation of the
15-nation bloc. London's tactics were described by other EU
members as "sheer blackmail".
</P>
<P>
In mid-November, the European Court of Justice rejected
Britain's challenge to an EU law which sets a maximum average of
48 working hours a week. Prime Minister Major, under growing
pressure from the Tory "Euro-sceptics", once again resorted to
non-cooperation. Downing Street vowed to block all agreements at
the on-going Inter-Governmental Conference (IGC) until the working
time dispute was properly resolved.
</P>
<P>
The EU Commission staged an immediate counter-attack and urged
the British government to accept the court ruling
unconditionally. Jacques Santer, President of the EU Commission,
accused Britain of wishing to "return to the Dickensian sweatshops
of the 19th century".
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe that the repeated conflicts between Britain
and its continental allies are very likely to have a bearing upon
Britain's general elections to be held next May. The ruling
Conservative party, far behind its opposition Labor party in
opinion polls, is striving to reverse the unfavorable tide by
waging patriotic "holy" wars.
</P>
<P>
"Major's warlike rhetoric is aimed at British voters, rather
than European leaders," an expert said.
</P>
<P>
However, the Anglo-EU confrontations also reflect their
critical differences over basic issues of the European integration
process.
</P>
<P>
In a white paper entitled "Partnership for National
Governments", the British government expounded its stand on the
IGC, which is aimed at reviewing the Maastricht Treaty.
</P>
<P>
The white paper pointed out that Britain was totally opposed to
a "monolithic, centralized and federalist Europe" and the EU
should respect each member state's national identity.
</P>
<P>
It also pledged to preserve the national veto right and refused
to give more powers to Brussels, while keeping its "opt-out" right
on a single European currency and a common European foreign and
security policy.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a credible survey showed that Britain had rejected
98 out of 149 EU proposals on major EU reforms, putting London on
a head-on collision course with the other EU member states.
</P>
<P>
Observers said the British Conservative government, under
increasing pressure from both the Tory Euro-sceptics and the
aggressive opposition Labor party, was very likely to toughen its
stance toward the EU to assure a victory in next year's general
elections. The Anglo-EU confrontations would probably continue as
both sides seemed not yet ready to change their tough lines toward
each other.

<HEADLINE> Laborers in Shenzhen Prefer Skill to Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Since it became an
experimental economic zone in the early 1980s, the south China
city of Shenzhen has attracted numerous laborers from the rest of
the country's inland areas.
</P>
<P>
But their expectations have changed considerably over the years.
</P>
<P>
A poll conducted by the municipal Labor Bureau shows that over
half of the laborers said they came to the city to learn technical
skills, to seek new development opportunities and to broaden their
minds.
</P>
<P>
In comparison, the tens of thousands of laborers who thronged
to the new pilot city in the early 1980s said they did so only to
make money.
</P>
<P>
In the sample survey, over 50 percent of the respondents
saidthey did not feel it is especially important to earn money and
return to their hometowns to open their own businesses.
</P>
<P>
And 88 percent said that they do not plan to make money, return
home, build a house and get married.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, 74 percent emphasized the necessity of gaining
technical skills, while 63 percent said they wanted to seek new
development opportunities.
</P>
<P>
According to the municipal Labor Bureau, 2.05 million laborers
from the rest of the China's inland areas had registered to work
in the city by the end of last year.

<HEADLINE> US Government, Congress Agreed to Work on CPI </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. government officials
and congressional Republicans endorsed a Senate advisory penal's
conclusion that government statistics overstate inflation, The
Washington Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
The agreement has opened the door to a discussion that could
lead to lower Consumer Prices Index (CPI) in the U.S., resulting
in cutting federal benefit programs and boosting prospects for a
balanced budget deal.
</P>
<P>
In a report to the U.S. Senate Finance Committee last week, a
penal of five economists led by Michael J. Boskin, a former
adviser to the Bush Administration, estimated that the CPI
exaggerates yearly U.S. inflation by 1.1 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
Correcting the error could reduce by hundreds of billions of
dollars the total spending cuts necessary to balance the budget by
2002, the report said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. government, which had opposed the suggestion on the
adjustment of CPI before, has praised the efforts by the Boskin
committee and promised to work with them to correct the CPI.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said on Sunday that White
House economist would work closely with outside experts in
figuring out how to fix the index.
</P>
<P>
"I think Boskin had it exactly right," Rubin said. "He's put out
the report and now we have to let the experts digest that report
and get a sense of whether there is a broad-based agreement around
the country on changes that should be made."
</P>
<P>
White House budget director Franklin Raines also said On Sunday
that the administration would work with the U.S. Congress to study
the Boskin commission's recommendations in an "expeditious Way".
</P>
<P>
But Republicans in the U.S. Congress, while calling those
sentiments constructive, were suspicious of the government's
sudden change of position on the CPI.
</P>
<P>
Republican leaders reiterated warnings that they would make no
move to revise the CPI unless the administration takes the lead.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Students Leave Hebron Campus After </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of Palestinian
students today left peacefully the campus of Hebron University
where they broke in to hold protests against the Israeli-imposed
closure.
</P>
<P>
Tension rose in the volatile city of Hebron this morning as
the students defied the closure and forced their way into the
campus to resume classes and hold anti-Israeli protests.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian students strongly protested the nine-month closure
on the Islamic university imposed by Israel after four suicide
bombings launched by Islamic militants killed 58 people inside
Israel from late February to early March.
</P>
<P>
Israel regarded the university as a base for Islamic
extremist groups such as Hamas which often launches attacks
against Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Para-troops were sent to Hebron following the student
break-in to heighten security alert against possible violence,
but they did not intervene in the protests throughout the
stand-off which ended in mid-afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The students were finally allowed by the Israeli police to
leave quietly the campus following an agreement with Palestinian
police chief in the West Bank Jibril Rajoub. No arrest of the
student protesters was made.
</P>
<P>
Student leaders said that the Palestinian Authority (PA)
has clinched a deal with the Israeli government to reopen the
university within a week.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Israel Radio reported that Israel and
the PA have also agreed to extend the mandate for the team of
Norweigian peace observers in Hebron pending the imminent
agreement on Israeli troop redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Amid reports about the impending agreement on Hebron
redeployment, European Union's middle East envoy Miguel
Angel Marenos, who is visiting Jordan, today also expressed the
hope that the Hebron agreement could be reached this
week.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Ambassador Wang
Xuexian said here today that all countries should strengthen
cooperation, jointly manage, develop in a scientific manner and
intensify protection of marine resources so that they can bring
greater benefit to mankind.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly on the Law of
the Sea, Wang said that the future of mankind hinges on oceans. A
new era has come for the joint development and exploitation of
marine resources.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the 24th World Oceanic Peace Conference held in
Beijing last month adopted the Beijing Declaration on Oceans.
</P>
<P>
The declaration proposes the establishment of a new oceanic
order in the 21st century as well as joint management and
scientific development of marine resources on an equitable and
peaceful basis so as to maintain the ecological balance of oceans
and achieve sustainable development of marine resources.
</P>
<P>
It calls on state parties to the Convention on the Law of the
Sea of 1982 to strengthen cooperation and establish joint
management and development zones of marine resources, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Declaration also emphasizes peaceful settlement of
disputes between states over islands and territorial sea, he said.
</P>
<P>
China has a long coastline and numerous islands and its claims
of exclusive economic zone and continental shelf overlap with
those of some neighboring states with opposite or adjacent coasts.
These problems should be worked out through negotiations as
provided for in the Convention.
</P>
<P>
When ratifying the Convention on May 15 this year, the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China
called for delimitation of boundary of the maritime jurisdiction
through consultations with the states with coasts opposite or
adjacent to China respectively on the basis of international law
and in accordance with the principle of equity, he said.

<HEADLINE> Peace Monitors Investigate Cease-Fire Violation in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 9 (Xinhua) -- A five-nation group monitoring
a limited cease-fire between Lebanon and Israel decided today to
send a fact-finding team Tuesday to a south Lebanese village
where six people were wounded in weekend Israeli bombardment.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of France, the United States, Syria, Lebanon
and Israel held today a meeting in south Lebanese border town of
Naqoura to look into a complaint filed by Lebanon against the
Jewish state over Saturday's shelling at Kfartibinit.
</P>
<P>
This was the sixth meeting of the cease-fire monitoring
committee since it was set up in August.
</P>
<P>
The commettee was established under a cease-fire understanding
reached between Lebanon and Israel in April, and the
understanding ended a 17-day Israeli blitz in south Lebanon
which killed some 200 people, mostly civilians.
</P>
<P>
A source in the Lebanese delegation, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, clarified that during the meeting, the Israeli
delegates accused Lebanese guerrillas of firing from the village
of Kfartibinit, drawing retaliatory bombardment of Israeli forces.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese delegation presented to the committee's meeting
some pictures showing internationally-banned cluster bombs which
the Israeli forces used in the bombardment at Kfartibinit and
which could cause more casualties than normal shells, the source
said.
</P>
<P>
The bombardment came in retaliation for a attack by
guerrillas of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, on
an Israeli patrol in the Israeli self-proclaimed "security zone"
in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
One Israeli soldier was killed and another wounded in the
attack, adding to 25 the Israeli soldiers killed by the
Shiite Muslim guerrilla group in south Lebanon since this
year.
</P>
<P>
Under the April cease-fire understanding, both the combating
sides in south Lebanon are barred from attacking civilian targets
or launching attacks from civilian areas.
</P>
<P>
But it does not restrict Hezbollah from operating against
Israeli occupation forces in the buffer zone and gives the
Israeli forces the right of self-defense.
</P>
<P>
Israel established in south Lebanon the 1,100-square-kilometer
"security zone" in 1985 to prevent crossing-border attacks at
northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the Israeli occupation forces resumed
this afternoon bombardment at Iglim Al-Toffah, a mountain area
often used by Lebanese Moslem guerrillas as a springboard to
launch attacks at Israel's buffer enclave.
</P>
<P>
Security sources in the area reported that the Israeli
artilleries at the position of Zaffateh fired at Jebal
Al-Rafih and the vicinities of Sejoud without causing
casualties.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Cabinet Approves Additional Budget Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli Cabinet today
approved a controversial bill to further slash 600 million
U.S. dollars in the 1997 budget to control deficit and check
inflation.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet move followed an already-agreed cut of 1.6 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet passed the bill by a vote of 14-4, with Foreign
Minister David Levy, Tourism Minister Moshe Katsav, Interior
Minister Eli Suissa, and Labor and Social Affair Minister Eli
Ishai voting against the cut.
</P>
<P>
Today's proposed budgetary cut has already passed the first
reading in the Knesset (Parliament).
</P>
<P>
According to the bill, the additional cut will affect the
sectors of the police, defense and social welfare as well as the
economic spending and the administrative expenditure.
</P>
<P>
The new cuts were announced in view of the fact that the
government's deficit for this year has already climbed up to
almost 11 billion shekels (3.6 billion dollars), far exceeding the
anticipated 2.5 percent of the Gross National Product (GNP).
</P>
<P>
To minimize the already strong opposition from both within the
ruling coalition and the opposition camp, the bill did not include
raising new taxes. The remaining shortfall in the cut will be
covered partly by the planned sale of 3,000 housing units in the
Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
The new cut plan, proposed by Finance Minister Dan Meridor,
will be presented to the Knesset for final approval in the coming
days. The Knesset is expected to vote on the plan by December 31.
</P>
<P>
Meridor, who justified his action on bringing the economy
back on track by slashing the budget deficit and lowering
inflation, has required the ministers to present their own plans
on the expenditure cut within a week.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Labor party convened its Knesset caucus
meeting today on the budget cuts, during which Labor leader
Shimon Peres and other members denounced that the government's
move to further slash the budget has put the budget process in
disarray.
</P>
<P>
Peres criticized the total proposed cut of 7 billion shekels
(2.3 billion dollars), describing it as unrealistic and simply
impossible to implement.

UNITED NATIONS, December 9 (Xinhua) -- UN Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali today approved resumption of Iraq's oil
exports to import food and medicine for the first time in six
years, a UN spokeswoman announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Sylvana Foa, spokeswoman for the secretary-general, said that
Boutros-Ghali submitted a report to the president of the Security
Council saying the "oil-for-food" plan was ready.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general was satisfied that "all activities
necessary for effective implementation of resolution 986 have been
satisfactorily concluded", she said.
</P>
<P>
The pricing mechanism had been approved, the metering stations
had been tested, the oil monitors and customs inspectors had been
deployed, the escrow account had been ready to get its money.
Therefore, the secretariat stood ready to carry out its
responsibility 00:01 (EST) the day after the Security Council
members have received the report, she said.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations imposed economic sanctions against Iraq
after its invasion of Kuwait in August 1990. To alleviate the
hardships of Iraqi people, the Security Council adopted resolution
986 in April 1995, allowing Iraq to export oil worth 2 billion
dollars in six months for import of food, medicine and other
necessities.
</P>
<P>
The UN Secretariat and Iraq reached memorandum of understanding
for implementation of resolution 986 known as the "oil for food"
formula on last May 20.

<HEADLINE> US Software Firm Plans to Increase Basic Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The Microsoft Corporation, the
world's largest software company, plans to increase spending for
basic research by 300 percent in 1997, according to a report of
the New York Times today.
</P>
<P>
The increase will create the world's largest computer science
laboratory within the next two years, the report said, adding that
the company is also making the basic research investment, which
could run as high as 330 million U.S. dollars during the next five
years.
</P>
<P>
The decision to increase basic research spending comes at a
time when other computer research giants are generally cutting
back on fundamental research and focusing more on practical,
product-oriented projects.
</P>
<P>
The executives of the company view as short-sighted move to
shrink corporate research budget and to aim Government financing
at projects that offer an immediate payoff. "This is a dangerous
mistake," Nathan Myhrvold, the company's chief technology officer,
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The organization now has 170 scientists, and plans to increase
the number to 450 or 500.
</P>
<P>
The software giant's competitors responded positively to the
decision, saying that it would have positive impact both inside
and outside the computer industry.

Johannesburg, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The high level of support
from different levels of government for Cape Town's bid to stage
the 2004 Olympic Games impressed the Evaluation Commission of the
International Olympic Committee, Commission Leader Thomas Bach
said today.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference in Cape Town, Bach said his 20-strong
commission had achieved what they intended to do when they
arrived in South Africa's Mother City last Friday.
</P>
<P>
During the past three working days, the commission evaluated
the bid in the context id 19 Olympic themes and sought answers to
600 questions on matters as diverse as medical care, air quality,
public transport, accreditation, broadcasting and accommodation.
</P>
<P>
"We tried to dig up as many details as possible for our
report. There has been high expectations, but I must stress that
we are only compiling a technical report," said Bach.
</P>
<P>
Cape Town, one of the 11 cities worldwide bidding for the 2004
Olympic Games, was the last stop on the commission's world tour.
</P>
<P>
Reports on each of the 11 cities would be used to guide the
selection process. The race would be narrowed down to four or
five cities on March 7 next year and the winning city would be

<HEADLINE> Turkey Eyes Nigeria's Construction Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Turkey began exploratory talks
today with Nigeria's Ministry of Works and Housing, aiming to
play a role in the development of the country's construction
industry.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is interested in road building, housing, irrigation and
water engineering technology as well as high-rise buildings in
Nigeria, said Numan Hazar, the Turkish Ambassador to Nigeria who
is leading a five-man delegation from his country.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has the expertise and has made significant
contributions to the construction industry in many countries,
said Hazar, who handed over a letter from the government of
Turkey to Minister of State for Works and Housing Alhaji
Abduliahi Adamu, introducing a Turkish company.
</P>
<P>
"We want construction companies in turkey to come to Nigeria
to help in the construction sector," he said, quoted by the News
Agency of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
"This will be a starting point for a fruitful cooperation
between our two countries," he added.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has been carrying out a national housing program since
1994 with an aim of building a total of 121,000 housing units,
particularly for low-income public servants, throughout the
country. To date, only 3,270 houses have been built.
</P>
<P>
To boost housing construction under the program, the Nigerian
Ministry of Works and Housing extended readiness to welcome
Chinese partners to come to rescue the embattled program.
</P>
<P>
As a result, it signed in October this year a memorandum of
understanding with the China Civil Engineering Construction
Corporation, enabling the latter to be involved in housing
construction in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese company has been engaged in a project to repair
Nigeria's railway network.  enditem

<HEADLINE> British Foreign Secretary to Visit Cyprus as </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary
Malcolm Rifkind's visit to Cyprus on December 16-17, will take
place according to schedule, a government spokesman said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Yiannakis Cassoulides made the remarks
at his press briefing when asked whether the government will
ask for the postponement of Rifkind's visit after the reaction
caused here by his intention to meet Turkish Cypriot leader
Rauf Denktash in the Turkish-controlled northern part of the
island.
</P>
<P>
Cypriot politicians have said that Rifkind's proposed meeting
with Denktash in the northern part of Nicosia would imply
indirect recognition of the Turkish Cypriot regime, which was
only recognized by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus' House of Representatives President Spyros Kyprianou has
suggested to postpone the visit by Rifkind in the belief that
the visit is ill-intentioned.
</P>
<P>
Rifkind has also come under heavy fire on the island over
his comment in the British House of Commons that the entry
of a divided Cyprus to the European Union would be difficult.
</P>
<P>
The government spokesman said that some of Rifkind's previous
statements have created certain problems, but he added that there
is no question of postponing the visit.
</P>
<P>
Cassoulides revealed that the issue of Rifkind's planned
meeting with Denktash would be discussed Wednesday at a session
of the National Council, the island's top advisory body to the
president on the handling of the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to the island, Rifkind is expected to
meet with Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides, Foreign Minister
Alecos Michaelides and Denktash.
</P>
<P>
Rifkind's planned visit will be the first by a British
foreign secretary since 1960, when the island, a former British
colony, became an independent Republic, apart from a visit by
his predecessor Douglas Hurd during the Commonwealth Heads of
Government meeting in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Britain, Greece and Turkey were the guarantors of Cyprus'
independence under the 1960 Treaty of establishment of the Cyprus
Republic.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish-Cypriot community in
the north and the Greek-Cypriot community in the south since 1974
when Turkey sent troops and occupied the northern part of the
island following a short-lived coup by some Greek Cypriots seeking
union with Greece.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin to Stay in Resort for at Least Week: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
will stay in the government resort RUS near Moscow, where he moved
earlier today, "for at least a week," his spokesman Sergei
Yastrzhembsky said.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters here that Yeltsin's recovery after his
November 5 heart by-pass surgery is going "normally" and in
accordance with plan.
</P>
<P>
The president will meet government officials including Prime
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, when he is back in the Kremlin later
this month from the RUS spa 95 kilometers northwest of Moscow,
Yastrzhembsky said.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin was brought to the spa, where he will spend the last
stretch of his recuperation period, this morning from his Gorky-9
residence, which is closest to the capital city.
</P>
<P>
Observers here view this as a sign of Yeltsin's health having
improved to the extent permitting his move remote location from
stationary medical centers.
</P>
<P>
After his operation, Yeltsin spent nearly three weeks at
Moscow's best Central Clinical Hospital and moved to out-of-town
resorts of Barvikha and Gorky-9 on November 22 and December 4.
</P>
<P>
Last weekend, Renat Akchurin, who was chief surgeon during
Yeltsin's operation, assessed the president's health improvement
as "quite quick."
</P>
<P>
"The surgical problems are all over and we no longer regard him
as our patient," Akchurin said. Asked when Yeltsin could return to
the Kremlin, he said this depends on the president himself.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said on the same day that he was ready to resume his
work in the Kremlin on December 25.
</P>
<P>
The RUS government residence, laid out as the Zavidovo park
area and a hunting ground before World War Two, is also an
environment protection site, educational center and research hub.
According to the presidential press service, Zavidovo has all
necessary amenities to combine full recovery with work and active
recreation exercises.

<HEADLINE> Russia Calls for Armenian-Azeri Compromise Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov said today that Russia expects Armenia and Azerbaijan to
reach a compromise over their Nagorno-Karabakh dispute.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference this afternoon, Primakov said
Russia supports resolving the problem as soon as possible through
a search for "mutual compromises."
</P>
<P>
A compromise solution to the problem lies in Azerbaijan's
territorial integrity and Nagorno-Karabakh's highest possible
autonomy within Azerbaijan, Primakov said after talks with his
visiting Armenian counterpart, Alexander Arzumanyan,.
</P>
<P>
"A solution should be found on the basis of recognition of
Nagorno-Karabakh's right to self-determination and
self-government, while preserving the territorial integrity of
Azerbaijan," Primakov said. "Such a right can be laid down in a
corresponding agreement."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that further Armenian-Azeri consultations on these
issues should be accompanied by their "contacts" with
Nagorno-Karabakh.
</P>
<P>
However, the Russian top diplomat gave differing assessments of
the parliamentary elections held in Nagorno-Karabakh in November.
</P>
<P>
He said, "If the elections had been held as local elections in a
region of Azerbaijan, there would have been no question."
</P>
<P>
"The Russian side was against them because it believed that
they should not be held before a mechanism for resolving the
Nagorno-Karabakh crisis is worked out," Primakov said.
</P>
<P>
In response, Arzumanyan told the news conference that Armenia
does not consider the polls as "an extraordinary event going
beyond the logic of the negotiating process (between Armenia and
Azerbaijan)."
</P>
<P>
He recalled a decision reached within the framework of the OSCE
(Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe) Minsk Group
that the talks would involve Armenia, Azerbaijan and elected
leaders of Nagorno-Karabakh.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, elections do not break the harmony of the
negotiating process and go in line with its spirit and
principles," the Armenian top diplomat pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The bloody conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan over
Nagorno-Karabakh began in 1988, and the leaders of the two former
Soviet republics reached agreement on a cease-fire and search for
a peaceful settlement in 1994.
</P>
<P>
At today's news conference, Primakov and Arzumanyan also said
that they reached at their morning talks understanding on all
economic and political issues they discussed and agreed to
invigorate consultations between their ministries and develop
fraternal and friendly relations between Russia and Armenia.
</P>
<P>
Arzumanyan, who arrived in Moscow early this morning for an
official visit, told reporters that he was pleased that he paid
one of his current trips to Russia, which has "an exclusive place
in Armenia's foreign policy." This is his first visit to Moscow
since he became Armenian foreign minister last month.

<HEADLINE> Liberian Factions Urged to Join in Rehabilitating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the various factions
in the Liberian crisis have been urged to take practical steps to
complement the efforts being made by the international community
to rehabilitate their fighters.
</P>
<P>
The leaders have a responsibility to participate in the
international effort to rehabilitate their fighters as a token of
appreciation to the "young men and women who risked their lives
and fought for them over the past years," said Major-General
Victor Malu, Commander of the West African Peacekeeping Force,
known as ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
"It is by the sweat of these young men and women that faction
leaders are what they are today," said Malu, quoted by the News
Agency of Nigeria today.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, it is morally imperative for the factional leaders
to help the fighters re-chart the course of their lives, he
added.
</P>
<P>
According to the commander, plans have been concluded by
relevant bodies to provide gainful employment training and
educational opportunities.
</P>
<P>
But he cautioned that these should not be perceived as a
bribery to induce them to disarm, adding that ECOMOG would hunt
down those who refuse to disarm in keeping with the January 31
deadline.
</P>
<P>
He also warned the factional leaders against breaching the
prevailing peace in Monrovia, capital of Liberia, and other parts
of that war-ravaged country, stressing that ecomog has the
capacity to deal decisively with any such breach.
</P>
<P>
As part of the international efforts to help disarmed
combatants, 1,000 fighters were awarded scholarships during a
ceremony hosted by a local humanitarian organization, Susukuu
Incorporated, in Monrovia over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
At the ceremony, Malu commended the organization for its
pledge to rehabilitate 10,000 of the fighters. The 1,000 fighters
receiving the scholarship awards are part of them.  enditem

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Lebanon Strives for Success of Donors' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon is gearing up the
preparations for a forum of donor countries in Washington this
weekend to ensure the maximum gains to finance a continuity of the
country's ambitious reconstruction plan.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri said today the first-ever
holding of the conference itself proves "Lebanon's recovery of its
presence" on the Arab and world political stage after a long civil
war.
</P>
<P>
The conference will give Lebanon an opportunity to exhibit its
demands in various aspects in front of the international
community, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese government has prepared a report for the
conference containing 31 development and reconstruction projects
estimated to cost 5 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Hariri added that more than 80 percent of the projects are in
line with a policy statement the government issued following its
formation last month.
</P>
<P>
In the policy statement, which helped Hariri's third government
win a overwhelming vote of confidence from the parliament, the
prime minister shifted the priority to the country's social
problems for the first time since he took the power in October,
1992.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister today summoned to his office U.S. Ambassador
to Beirut Richard Jones and discussed the final preparations for
the conference.
</P>
<P>
According to Jones, no country invited has refused to
participate the conference.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton has invited some 30 countries and
leading international lending institutions to attend the
conference, which was arranged by the U.S. in the wake of the
April Israeli blitz in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
After another meeting with Lebanese Minister of State for
Financial Affairs Faud Sinyoura today, Jones said that it would
not be difficult to raise 800 million dollars at the conference.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz today held a meeting in
his office with ambassadors of Arab countries in Lebanon. During
the meeting, he called for an "effective Arab participation in the
conference."
</P>
<P>
Hariri will head a Lebanese delegation, comprising Sinyoura,
Boueiz and Yassin Jaber, minister of trade and economy, to
the conference, which is to be opened by U.S. Secretary of
State Warren Christopher.
</P>
<P>
Official sources were quoted by the Beirut Eco News business
weekly Monday as saying that "unless Hariri obtains satisfaction
from the Washington meeting, his national reconstruction plan
would be in serious jeopardy due to lack of funds."
</P>
<P>
Boueiz said Sunday that the participation of Arab countries,
especially the oil-rich Gulf states, "will be a real test of Arab
credibility toward Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
"It is awkward for non-Arab countries to express willingness
to participate, while Arab countries stay behind," the foreign
minister said.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov is expected to leave for Brussles, Belgium, Tuesday to
meet his counterpart of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO), sources in the Russian Foreign Ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
In Brussels, Primakov will take part in a session of the North
Atlantic Cooperation Council (NACC) and a meeting of NATO forein
ministers, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
He will meet with the Belgian leaders including prime minister,
parliament speakers, foreign minister and defense minister
Wednesday and Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He may also hold bilateral meetings with some NATO foreign
ministers.
</P>
<P>
"However, it is participation in the NACC session and the
meeting of NATO foreign ministers that is the main purpose of the
Russian minister's trip to Belgium," one of the sources noted.
</P>
<P>
"In particular, Primakov plans at his meeting with NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana to find out how true the
unofficial signals and reports are of the alliance's readiness to
take into account Russia's concern about its expansion eastward,"
one of the sources added.
</P>
<P>
Russia's negative attitude to NATO's eastward enlargement plans
has remained unchanged, the sources stressed.

Primakov is expected to return to Moscow Thursday afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Russia Reiterates Opposition to NATO Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Russia's approach to the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization's (NATO) eastwards enlargement
remains "unchanged, firm and even tough," Russian President Boris
Yeltsin's spokesman said today.
</P>
<P>
Sergei Yastrzhembsky told a news briefing in the Kremlin that
there had been no "cardinal changes" in the Russian stance
following the summit of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), in Lisbon, Spain, on December 2-3.
</P>
<P>
"It would be strange to expect any," Yastrzhembsky noted.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Russia's position had been the same even
though "our partners (the West) in the dialogue tried to send
different signals to the world from time to time, saying there
have been certain shifts, and Moscow has become more flexible on
the NATO enlargement."
</P>
<P>
"This has created the illusion that Moscow accepted the
enlargement plan," Yastrchembsky said. He called the signals
"assumptions built on sand".
</P>
<P>
"We think there are no arguments in favor of NATO enlargement
to the east.
</P>
<P>
"NATO's eastwards enlargement may have only negative
consequences, primarily for Russia and its national interests," he
added.
</P>
<P>
In his opinion, to a certain extent NATO's enlargement would
oust Russia from Europe, isolate it and create future potential
threats including military ones to its national interests.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Moscow had expressed this attitude at the
OSCE summit in Lisbon, and the stance would be once again voiced
at a meeting of NATO foreign ministers in Brussels scheduled to
open today.
</P>
<P>
Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov left earlier today
for Brussels to take part in the meeting.

<HEADLINE> China to Focus on Adjusting Economic Structure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Restructuring the national
economy to improve its efficiency will become the top priority in
China's development strategy, said a senior official here today.
</P>
<P>
Qiu Xiaohua, chief economist with the State Statistics Bureau
(SSB) pointed out at a seminar that the worsening problem of
duplicate economic structures in different regions calls for an
urgent solution, and a market-oriented economic mechanism should
be formed for the survival of the superior and for the elimination
of the inferior.
</P>
<P>
To improve its economic structure, China will focus on
urbanizing its rural areas and promoting scale economy in the
urban regions, said Qiu.
</P>
<P>
"The lack of market competition has led to the irrational
distribution of resources and a flawed economic structure,
which in turn has caused low efficiency," Qiu explained.
</P>
<P>
Another major factor behind the low economic efficiency,
according to Qiu, is the disparity between the rural and urban
economies.
</P>
<P>
"A lack of appropriate purchasing power in the rural areas has
stopped urban industries tapping the huge rural market, which,
with 70 percent of the national population, has only 20 percent of
the nation's gross savings deposits," he added.

<P>
Duplicate economic structures in different regions is another
outstanding problem facing China's economy, Qiu pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"The development strategies of different regions have to be
pursued in line with the overall economic layout and regional
characteristics," said Qiu, adding that high economic efficiency
can come about only with a rational regional distribution of
the national industries.
</P>
<P>
To further adjust its economic structure, China needs to
quicken its steps toward a socialist market economy, deepening the
reform of property rights system, redoubling efforts to set up a
proper social security system and strengthening supervision of the
market, he concluded.

PARIS, December 10 (Xinhua) -- A bomb alert today in the Paris
Bourse at 13:15 p.m. (12:15 GMT) caused the evacuation of all
stock dealers and staff from the Brongniart Palace in central
Paris.
</P>
<P>
Agence France Presse (AFP) reported that no bomb was found
after police circled the square outside the stock exchange center,
which is next to the headquarters of AFP and near the Paris Opera.

About 30 bomb alerts have been made each day in Paris since an

<HEADLINE> China's Auto Market Seen to Grow Steadily Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 10 (Xinhua) -- China will need 1.66 million
motor vehicles to meet the market demand in 1997, up eight percent
from this year, according to Zhang Lianyou, general manager of the
China Automotive Trade Corporation.
</P>
<P>
China has achieved a "soft landing" for its economy,
maintaining an economic growth rate of 9.6 percent, bringing down
the inflation to 6.5 percent and making industry grow by 18
percent. In addition, the foreign exchange reserve has topped 100
billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
This has laid a solid foundation for the recovery of the auto
market, said Zhang, who is also president of the China Automotive
Circulation Association, while addressing the China Auto Market
Forum here today.
</P>
<P>
China motor vehicle supply is expected to reach two million
units in 1997, which will include 1.65 million newly-produced units,
100,000 to 120,000 imported units and 250,000 in stock left over
from this year.
</P>
<P>
Zhang predicted that China's auto industry will enjoy a
favorable policy environment next year, since the country will
resume the exercise of its sovereignty over Hong Kong and stage
the 15th National Conference of the Chinese Communist Party, which
are widely regarded as two major factors which will boost China's
economy in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Zhang noted that the country's auto market for commercial and
official purposes, the largest of its kind in China, has fully
developed over the past few years. The market demand for private
vehicles, which is still in the initial stage of development, has
been growing rapidly.
</P>
<P>
China is expected to build 1.55 million motor vehicles this
year, and the number of imported cars is estimated at 80,000
units, which account for five percent of the country's total
automotive resources.

SINGAPORE, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The negotiations on the

spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Peter Guilfort, the spokesman for the EU delegation to the

the European Council of Ministers held a meeting earlier in the

<P>
"There is no agreement yet. But the progress was good," he
said, adding that the message was to continue the talks on ITA.
</P>
<P>
He said that the EU ministers do favor a deal in Singapore
because the deal will be harder to get after the Singapore
conference.
</P>
<P>
The Quad -- the United States, the European Union, Japan and
Canada -- met twice during the day in a bid to iron out their
differences on the issue, the spokesman said.

starting at 11:00 p.m. local time, in an another effort to win

FUZHOU, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Taiwanese businessmen put 430
million yuan (51.8 million US dollars) into real estate in Fuzhou,
the capital of east China's Fujian province, during the
January-November period, according to "China Land News".

<P>
The Beijing-based newspaper reported that a total of 74

The Taiwan-backed enterprises have become a major force in

government has adopted policies and regulations that protect and
encourage investment.

Fuzhou is also close to Hong Kong and Macao, and speaks the

spokesman Shen Guofang today urged the ongoing Ministerial
Conference of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in Singapore to

However, Shen said, according to the Chinese government, it has

main obstacle to China's bid is political considerations, with
some Western nations putting excessive demands on China, he said.

BEIJING, December 10 (Xinhua) -- China and the Republic of
Korea (ROK) today signed a General Contract on Commodity Trade to
provide exemplary forms of contracts to companies of both
countries involved in Sino-ROK trade.
</P>
<P>
The contract was formulated based on international conventions
that the two countries have joined and is designed to reduce
disputes related to trade between firms from the two countries.
</P>
<P>
China has signed similar agreements with a number of other
countries, including Japan and Germany.
</P>
<P>
Since China and the ROK established diplomatic relations in
1992, the bilateral trade volume has kept increasing at a yearly
rate of over 50 percent. In 1996 the figure is expected to exceed
20 billion US dollars-worth.
</P>
<P>
Some foreign trade experts estimate that the bilateral trade
volume may shoot up to 50 billion US dollars-worth in a couple of
years, to make China the ROK's largest trading partner.

<HEADLINE> First Ukrainian Ready For Space Flight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Leonid Kadenuk could be the first
Ukrainian to fly in outer space, the local Independence News
Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The 42-year-old Kadenuk, born in the small village of
Klishkovzi near the Romanian border, would start his space mission
on the launching pad at Cape Canaveral, Florida.
</P>
<P>
Kadenuk, who is able to fly about 20 types of Russian fighter
aircraft, was chosen as a substitute astronaut in the Soviet
era. He received training at the Star City outside Moscow and at
the launching site of Baikonur, Kazakhstan. But he never had the
luck to be rocketed into space.
</P>
<P>
Kadenuk was sent to the United States for training under the
"Shuttle-97" program signed by Ukraine and the U.S. last May. The
Ukrainian Space Administration paid 150,000 U.S. dollars for the
training of two astronauts including Kadenuk.
</P>
<P>
Working at the Johnson Space Center, Houston, Kadenuk was the
first choice to go on a space flight, the agency quoted American
experts as saying.
</P>
<P>
Kadenuk would lift off on October 9, 1997, and spend 16 days in
space. His main job would be to test the growth and reproduction
of plants in the outer space.

year.
</P>
<P>
Director-general of the State Administration for Industry and

and commerce adminstration in Beijing today, urged industrial and
commercial authorities to take the standardization of markets and
market order as their main task in 1997.
</P>

<P>
First, intensifying efforts in the fight against offering and
receiving illegal commissions on commercial deals and against
counterfeit goods, to establish a nationwide network to protect
brand-name products.
</P>
<P>
Second, fighting illegal activities, such as market
manipulation, deliberate price hikes, and manufacture or sale of
fake goods, and forming a network to supervise the protection of
consumer rights.
</P>
<P>
The struggle against fake and smuggled goods will focus on
food, medicines, beverages, building materials, safety devices,
motor vehicles, cigarettes, household appliances, and chemical
products.
</P>

The director-general emphasized reliance on an improved legal
system in maintaining market order.

<HEADLINE> China to Complete Labor Contract System This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 10 (Xinhua) -- China is expected to complete
its labor contract system this year, in accordance with the Labor
Law, Labor Minister Li Boyong said here today.
</P>
<P>
Li made this prediction in a report to some of the delegates to
the National People's Congress, China's legislature, on the
implementation of the Labor Law, which came into effect in July
1994.
</P>
<P>
"During the past two years the law has proved to be very
effective, and all basic labor-related systems required by the law
have now taken initial shape," Li told the legislators.
</P>
<P>
He said that by the end of October this year 101.3 million
contracted workers, or 92.1 percent of the country's total, had
signed labor contracts with their employers.
</P>
<P>
"The whole country will probably finish the work of setting up
a labor contract system within 1996," he noted.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, 29 provinces, autonomous regions and
municipalities across the country have issued minimum wage
guarantees, and nearly 3,000 labor supervision institutions with
more than 20,000 supervisors had been founded by August this year.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the Labor Law has also helped speed up
the reform of the social security system.
</P>
<P>
"To date, 87.4 million people, 22.74 million of whom are
retirees, have joined pension insurance schemes, while the
coverage of medicare, unemployment, work injury, and birth
insurance has been further expanded," he said.

<HEADLINE> France Presses for Europeanization of NATO Commands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 10 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Herve de
Charette demanded today that the two regional commands in Europe
of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) be filled by
Europeans.
</P>
<P>
He said in an interview with the International Herald Tribune
that the United States could keep its command of the Sixth Fleet,
but the South and Central Commands of NATO in Europe should be
headed by two European generals, on a rotation basis.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark at the dawn of a NATO foreign ministers'
meeting scheduled for today and Wednesday in Brussels. The
U.S. and France are expected to have more clashes over NATO
commands during the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"While the United States insists that the two strategic
commands remain American, it would be fair that the Europeans
assume an important responsibility at a following level," said the
foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that at the peak of the Cold War, the Central
Command of NATO based in the Netherlands, which was responsible
for a strategically sensitive zone at that time, was headed by a
German general.
</P>
<P>
"France is engaged in participating entirely with a renewed
(trans-Atlantic) alliance, within which Europeans will assume
their proper part of responsibilities, with an opening to the new
democracies in Eastern Europe, while designing a new relationship
with Russia," he said.
</P>
<P>
De Charette warned both sides of the Atlantic against "forces
of conservatism and nostalgia".
</P>
<P>
He referred to France's withdrawal from the NATO integrated
military structure in 1966 in protest against U.S. domination of
the alliance.
</P>
<P>
France, which is planning to return to the structure at the
NATO summit in 1997, raised its voice in favour of Europeanization
of the Naples-based South Command earlier this year, only to meet
opposition from the U.S..

<HEADLINE> NATO Ministers Set Tone for Summit Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 10 (Xinhua) -- North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) Foreign Ministers began a two-day meeting here
today to prepare for the organization's summit to be held next
July.
</P>
<P>
The summit will bring about significant changes in the
alliance's composition, mechanism and tasks.
</P>
<P>
Today's semi-annual meeting is expected to map out the agenda
for the coming summit, including NATO's enlargement into former
communist Europe, relations with Russia and an overhaul of its
command structures in the post-Cold War era.
</P>
<P>
"The summit will shape the new NATO, a NATO with new
structures, new missions, and ultimately, with new members," NATO
Secretary General Javier Solana said in an opening speech at the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Officials said the summit would probably be held on July 8-9
next year in a European capital. Spain had offered Madrid as a
possible venue.
</P>
<P>
"Next year's summit will mark the moment when the processes of
transformation and change converge and the new alliance takes
stock," Solana said.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the ministers will examine the results of
the alliance's "intensive dialogue" with 13 central and eastern
European countries applying for NATO membership. They will decide
which are to be invited to join first.
</P>
<P>
Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic were at present the
favorites to be included in the first wave, followed by Slovenia
and Romania, sources said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will also discuss what to offer eastern nations
unlikely to be embraced in the first wave, such as the Baltic
countries, and to soothe Russia which savagely opposes the
eastward expansion.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of the meeting, United States Secretary of
State Warren Christopher said: "In today's Europe, NATO has no
intention, no plan and no need to station nuclear weapons on the
territory of any new members."
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that "no NATO nuclear forces are presently on
alert."
</P>
<P>
Russia views the NATO admission of central and eastern European
nations, which means a possible nuclear deployment on its western
border, as a serious threat to its national security.
</P>
<P>
NATO was seeking a "strong and durable" framework for a
NATO-Russia relationship, with a "document or charter" on
bilateral cooperation, consultation and permanent liaison, Solana
said.
</P>
<P>
The 16 NATO ministers are scheduled to meet Russian Foreign
Minister Yevgeny Primakov on Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
The ministers will also examine alternatives proposed by the
NATO military authorities to rearrange the alliance's command
structures to make sure its forces are competent for new missions
in the post-Cold War period, such as peacekeeping operations in
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will endorse plans to replace the present
50,000-strong peacekeeping forces in Bosnia with a smaller
contingentm of 31,000 troops. The new mission's 18-month mandate
will start on December 20.

<HEADLINE> Militiamen Clash Over Tax Collection in S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, December 10 (Xinhua) -- At least three were killed
and seven others wounded when heavily armed militiamen supporting
South Mogadishu faction leader Hussein Mohamed Aidid clashed over
a tax collection point in Wardhigley district last night.
</P>
<P>
According to eyewitnesses at the point, the tax collection
group equipped with two "technical" battle wagons had confronted
against six other cars escorting four fuel tankers.
</P>
<P>
The escort armed wagons had ordered the tax collectors to
leave them alone without paying any taxes.
</P>
<P>
An eyewitness who was himself wounded as a result of the
fighting said, the six battle wagons took control of the junction
after pelting the whole area with bullets.
</P>
<P>
The wounded were rushed to local treatment centers for
treatment. One of them later died of wounds.
</P>
<P>
The deafening rounds of the anti-aircraft machine-gun used by
the tax defying group had shocked the inhabitants at Ged Jelka
area of Wardhigley district.
</P>
<P>
Many people immediately started fleeing their houses with
their children while the nearby areas started with setting up
defensive lines in case the shooting got close to them.
</P>
<P>
Angry civilians erected road blocks this morning in an attempt
to stop the tax collectors from coming near to their houses.
</P>
<P>
People attributed the catastrophe to tax collection in
"non-appropriate area".
</P>
<P>
This is the second armed clash within the forces of Hussein
Mohamed Aidid since he was crowned with the post of his late
father, General Mohamed Farah Aidid.
</P>
<P>
In similar clashes over the taxes on November 8, one man was
killed and four others seriously wounded when painted armed
wagons supporting Hussein Mohamed Aidid in South Mogadishu
stormed the Ifka Halan junction to release a number of heavy load
trucks which were detained in Ifka Halan camp for not paying the
taxes.
</P>
<P>
The tax collection introduced by Hussein Aidid is facing many
hardships owing to no services being rendered for the people in
return for what they're paying to the South Mogadishu government.

<HEADLINE> Zhu De a Great Star of the Chinese Revolution: President (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The late Chinese leader Zhu De
is a huge star in the history of the Chinese revolution in the
20th century, and his lofty thought and ethics are a valuable
spiritual heritage for the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President and General Secretary of the Communist Party
of China (CPC) Central Committee Jiang Zemin made the remarks
today at a meeting in commemoration of the 110th anniversary of
the birth of the former Party and state leader.
</P>
<P>
"Comrade Zhu De left us exactly 20 years ago but the Party and
the people always remember him with deep feelings," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
In his speech Jiang called Zhu a great Marxist, great
proletarian revolutionary, great statesman and military
strategist, one of the founders of the Chinese People's Liberation
Army and a founder of the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
Zhu won deep love and respect from the Party, the army and the
people due to his selfless contribution and immortal merits during
different periods of the Chinese revolution, Jiang recalled.
</P>
<P>
Zhu, who began to cherish lofty ideals at a young age, joined
the revolutionary activities of Sun Yat-Sen in his early years,
and in 1922 he was admitted into the Communist Party of China (CPC)
in Berlin, according to Jiang.
</P>
<P>
Jiang further noted that Zhu was one of the leaders of the
Nanchang Uprising, which inaugurated the CPC-led armed revolution
on October 1, 1927. After that Zhu fought together with Mao
Zedong, Zhou Enlai and other CPC leaders in a series of fierce
battles against the Chiang Kai-Shek-led Kuomintang regime and
the Japanese invaders.

<HEADLINE> Great Successes Scored in China's Diplomatic Field: FM Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 10 (Xinhua) -- China has scored fruitful
outcomes in its diplomacy this year, Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokesman Shen Guofang said here today.
</P>
<P>
The remark came during a regular news conference. Shen said
that China has adhered to its independent foreign policy of peace,
and scored great successes in its diplomacy this year, although
the international situation has remained complex and changeable.
</P>
<P>
Starting this year, Chinese leaders visited more than 30
countries, and some 40 foreign state and government leaders
visited China, he noted.
</P>
<P>
China has also actively taken part in multilateral activities,
including the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meetings,
the Asia-Europe summit and the World Food Summit, the spokesman
noted.
</P>
<P>
These visits and contacts have boosted the friendly cooperation
between China and its neighboring countries, as well as a large
number of developing nations, Shen said.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, he added, the peaceful environment around China
has been reinforced.
</P>
<P>
Sino-Russian friendly and cooperative relations have seen
considerable progress, while Sino-US relations have begun to
improve steadily following a period of twists and turns in their
ties, he said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, there has also been some progress in
relations between China and other Western nations, he said.
</P>
<P>
"China has become an important factor in maintaining world
peace and stability," he said, noting that the country's role and
influence in this regard have become increasingly obvious.
</P>
<P>
China has won a series of victories in safeguarding its state
sovereignty, territorial integrity and national dignity, and in
its struggles against any interference in its internal affairs, he
said.
</P>
<P>
This is the concrete manifestation of the Chinese government's
unswerving determination in maintaining its national interests,
Shen pointed out.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, the country has made a host of effective
preparations for Hong Kong's return to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
China will continue to advance and increase its friendly and
cooperative relations with all countries in the world on the basis
of the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence, the spokesman
reiterated.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Local elections in Northern
Province of Sri Lanka have been postponed, according to official
sources today.
</P>
<P>
The decision to postpone the polls was made by President
Chandrika Kumaratunga last night after she met a delegation of
minority Tamil political parties supporting the government, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The government has decided to hold elections to all authorities
in Northern Province.
</P>
<P>
The Commission of Elections announced at the end of November
that nominations for the local elections would be accepted from
December 12 to 18.
</P>
<P>
However, Tamil political parties have taken a collective
decision to oppose the government's bid to hold the local polls in
the province.
</P>
<P>
They believed that normalcy has not been restored and the civil
war is still going on in the north with hundreds of thousands of
registered voters displaced and not living in their homes.
</P>
<P>
The president agreed to postpone the polls on Monday evening
when she met some representatives of Tamil political parties, the

<HEADLINE> Philippines Will Eventually Accept Nuclear Power </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Foreign Affairs
Secretary Domingo Siazon said here today that his country will
eventually accept and take on the nuclear power generation option
as a matter of necessity.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening of the Second Philippine Nuclear
Congress here, Siazon said the Filipinos will finally accept the
nuclear option as the country approaches a demographic transition
of urbanization in the next century.
</P>
<P>
Urbanization, he said, will bring with it a host of challenges
to the population, including increased demands for clean air,
water, living space and the most crucial of them, adequate power
supply.
</P>
<P>
He said the country can momentarily reduce its heavy dependence
on imported energy by developing it own fossil fuel resources,
hydro power, geothermal and other non-conventional energy sources,
but may take on the nuclear power generation option at last.
</P>
<P>
However, many Filipinos remain averse to nuclear power
generation for fear of accidents as what happened in Russia and
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Siazon said, the Filipinos "cannot indefinitely neglect the
nuclear power generation option which could give us a large-scale
source of safe, clean, cheap and renewable energy."
</P>
<P>
"The genie of nuclear energy is out of the bottle...and will
not go away. What we must do, therefore, is to thoroughly
domesticate this powerful force of nature for the welfare of our
people today, and for the prosperity of all future generations
tomorrow," he said.
</P>
<P>
The last Philippine Nuclear Congress was held 20 years ago.

<HEADLINE> Premier Li on Public Health Sector's Long-Term Goal (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 10 (Xinhua) -- China will perfect its health
work system by the year 2000 in a bid to fulfil the goal of
"Health Care for Everyone" and to further improve the general
health condition of its people, Premier Li Peng said.
</P>
<P>
And by the year 2010, this system is expected to help China
come up to the medium-level standard of the developed countries or
advanced standards of the developing countries, in terms of major
indications of people's health conditions, Li told the ongoing
National Conference on Public Health here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The system is composed of health care service sectors, medical
insurance system and departments responsible for enforcing laws
concerning public health.
</P>
<P>
"The next 15 years will be a crucial period for China's
modernization strategy, and the public health sector is an
important component part of the strategy," Li noted.
</P>
<P>
"People's health conditions should improve in tandem with the
economic development of the country," he added.
</P>
<P>
In order to fulfil the goal, medical care units should improve
their services to safeguard people's health, and governments at
all levels should attach greater importance to health work, he
recommended.
</P>
<P>
New China has made remarkable progress in its public health
endeavors since it was founded 47 years ago. A complete health
service system now covers both urban and rural areas, and a large
contingent of medical workers and experts has been formed.
</P>
<P>
Infant mortality has dropped to 31 per thousand, from 200 per
thousand in 1949, and the average life expectancy of the Chinese
people has been raised from 35 to 70 in the same period.
</P>
<P>
"These figures indicate that the Chinese people's health
condition has been greatly improved in the past few decades," Li
stressed.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Geology Museum's Second Rare Bird Fossil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The China Geology Museum,
Asia's largest, has been given a fossil of Sinosauropteryx, an
ancient animal believed by some scientists to be the ancestor of
the bird.
</P>
<P>
A ceremony was held today marking the 80th anniversary of the
museum, where the city government of Beipiao, in Liaoning
Province, donated the fossil to the museum.
</P>
<P>
The newly-discovered fossil, which is about 106 cm long and 60
cm high, was discovered near Beipiao in September by a farmer, who
later donated it to the city government. This is the second
Sinosauropteryx fossil to be discovered in Liaoning Province, both
found in the same geological strata, and from a similar geological
period.
</P>
<P>
The first fossil, about 56 cm long, was discovered by another
farmer in August, who donated it to the museum. Dr. Ji Qiang, the
museum's curator, said that he "felt shocked" when he got a look
at the first fossil, because it was clearly from a feathered
animal, and could very well be an ancestor of the bird.
</P>
<P>
There were those, however, who questioned whether the covering
had been feathers or hair. But now, with the new discovery, there
is further evidence of feathers, helping to quell those misgivings
about whether the first fossilized Sinosauropteryx had been
covered with hair.
</P>
<P>
Ji explained that the second fossil has bolstered his belief
that Sinosauropteryx is the true ancestor of the bird, instead of
the archaeopteryx, discovered in mid-19th century in Germany.
</P>
<P>
Sinosauropteryx, which lived from 155 million to 150 million
years ago, is about 10 million years older than archaeopteryx, Ji
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Some scientists still disagree with Ji though, and insist that,
based on an analysis of the bone structure, Sinosauropteryx is not
the ancestor of the bird, but merely a "warm-blooded dinosaur with
feathers."
</P>
<P>
Ji still maintains, however, that the fundamental difference
between a bird and a dinosaur is the feathers. He noted that
dinosaurs were cold-blooded, and that a warm-blooded dinosaur
belongs to no established class.
</P>
<P>
Ji Qiang showed the second fossil to Vice-premier Zou Jiahua
and Minister of Geology and Mineral Resources Song Ruixiang, as
well as other prominent figures who were attending today's
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
He said that the two fossils are of an incalculable value,
adding, "No matter how much anyone may offer, the museum won't
sell."

<HEADLINE> Manila Expects More Sugar Exports to U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is
optimistic that the United States will allow the advanced delivery
of some 106,000 tons of Manila's remaining sugar quota to the
country, a senior government official said today.
</P>
<P>
The government also expects Washington to allow an additional
200,000 tons of sugar exports to address the sugar glut in the
country, William Gamboa, chief of the Sugar Regulatory
Administration, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Gamboa said the government had formally asked U.S. Agriculture
Secretary Dan Glickman to consider its requests for the advanced
shipment and the increase of 200,000 tons in its existing sugar
quota.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines' total sugar quota to the U.S. market is
219,000 tons, of which half have been shipped. The shipment of the
remaining half is supposed to start in April.
</P>
<P>
"The outlook is very positive," Gamboa said, adding that he had
personally discussed the problem with Glickman during the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meetings held in the Philippines
late last month.
</P>
<P>
According to Gamboa, the country's sugar industry is now in a
crisis because of huge sugar stocks that have sent prices dropping
to 500 pesos (19 U.S. dollars) per 50-kilo sack.
</P>
<P>
Gamboa said the country's current sugar stocks total 700,000
tons including 350,000 tons of "sugar security or buffer stocks."
The remaining 350,000 tons of sugar is much more than the demand
of the domestic market, he noted.
</P>
<P>
After the country ships 306,000 tons of sugar to the United
States, there will be an immediate price increase of 100 pesos
(3.8 dollars) per sack, Gamboa said.
</P>
<P>
If the United States turns down the two requests, the
Philippine government will have to ask a consortium of banks to
finance sugar producers so they can wait for better prices in the
future, he added.

<HEADLINE> SAR Preparatory Committee's Legal Panel Holds Sixth Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The sixth session of the Legal
Panel of the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) was held today in Shenzhen, a coastal
city neighboring Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The members held that, according to Article 23 of the Basic
Law, the power of formulating related laws prescribed in that
article belongs to the Hong Kong SAR's own legislative body and
should be done by the SAR itself.
</P>
<P>
Before the Hong Kong SAR promulgates a law the Crimes Ordinance
now in place there can be accepted as the law of the SAR, the
members said. However, they said, application and explanation of
the law must be in line with Hong Kong's status after China
resumes exercise of sovereignty over the territory and relevant
stipulations of the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
The fact that the British side has unilaterally announced that
it will revise the Crimes Ordinance, the members pointed out,
severely infringes upon the Hong Kong SAR's legislative power as
well as the stipulations in the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
They suggested that the Preparatory Committee make a decision
that if the British Hong Kong government forces the revision of
the ordinance the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress should make an announcement at the proper time that the
revision will be invalid from July 1, 1997, according to Article
160 of the Basic Law.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Calls for Better Public Health in Rural Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng says that
priority should be given to China's rural areas, especially the
poorer ones, to achieve the state's goal of providing elementary
health care for every person by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Speaking Monday at a national conference on public health, Li
said, "If there is not a good health care service and medical
security system in rural areas, which hold 900 million people, we
cannot say that China's public health problem has been solved."
</P>
<P>
China has a state-run health care network in its rural areas,
with medical institutions at the county, township, and village
levels. It also has a cooperative medical system and a contingent
of rural doctors, giving farmers better access to health care.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that the methods are effective and should be
continued, and that "managing public health in rural areas well is
an important duty of government at all levels."
</P>
<P>
The cooperative system is supported by individual payments,
public funds, and financial help from the government. It is an
effective way that has Chinese characteristics, and that sees to
it that farmers have basic health care. Some of the problems in
the system should be solved through more reforms, he said.
</P>
<P>
In particular, government at various levels should pay greater
attention to public health in poor areas, setting aside funds to
improve rural public health facilities so that farmers can have
clean drinking water and can be protected against endemic or
infectious diseases, Li said.

BEIJING, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Ministry
Spokesman Shen Guofang said here today that tomorrow's election of
the candidate for the first chief executive of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR) will be a major event of
historical importance.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Hong Kong's governors have been all appointed by
the British Queen, adding that it is unprecedented for Hong Kong
people to select the candidate for chief executive.
</P>
<P>
"Only when Hong Kong is about to return to the motherland can
the people there obtain the democratic rights unimaginable to them
in the past," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, the central government has a very
clear-cut approach toward the issue of selecting the candidate for the
SAR's first chief executive -- that it should be in line with the
Basic Law and relevant resolutions of the National People's Congress
as well as the election method stipulated by the Preparatory
Committee of the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
Shen said he believed that the 400 members of the Selection
Committee, all permanent Hong Kong residents, will proceed from
the overall interests of Hong Kong and cast their ballots in a
high spirit of responsibility for the Hong Kong people, the
country and Hong Kong's future.
</P>
<P>
"It will be a smooth process," Shen assured.

MANILA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank
(ADB) is expected to provide some 350 million to 400 million U.S.
dollars' worth of lending and technical assistance for the
Philippines in 1997, the Philippine News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted the ADB's programs manager Werner Schelzig as
saying the projected assistance would be used to finance seven
development projects proposed by the Philippine government.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines received 318 million dollars' worth of capital
assistance in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Schelzig said a memorandum of understanding about the
assistance would be signed Friday between the Manila-based bank
and Philippine government officials.
</P>
<P>
The projects cover areas from agro-industry, energy
development, infrastructure construction to transportation and
communications.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Schelzig expressed his satisfaction over how
the Philippine government implements ADB-funded projects in the
past year.
</P>
<P>
However, he added that there are one or two "headache projects"
as their implementation has been stalled by natural calamity and
peace and order problems in the country.
</P>
<P>
"We have no control on these but the Philippine government and
the bank are doing everything on how best to address these
problems," he said.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Airlines Downsizes Refleeting Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Airlines (PAL)
announced here today that it will downsize by 50 percent its 4
billion U.S. dollar refleeting program as it cannot cover the
additional cost to be incurred due to higher salary demands by its
pilots.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, PAL Chairman Lucio Tan said PAL
will cancel some of the aircraft it has ordered and it has already
drafted a notice informing the aircraft manufacturer of the
cancellation.
</P>
<P>
He said PAL's Board of Directors has approved the move at a
special meeting last week.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to cancel," Tan said. "We have agreed to downsize
by 50 percent (the refleeting program)."
</P>
<P>
However, Tan did not mention how many aircraft orders would be
canceled from Airbus or Boeing.
</P>
<P>
According to the refleeting program it had announced earlier,
PAL would buy eight new Boeing 747-400s, four Airbus 340-400s,
eight Airbus 330-300s and 12 Airbus 320s.
</P>
<P>
Tan said the expensive salary package and the staffing of its
long-haul flights being sought by its pilots union are the main
reason for the decision to downsize the refleeting program.
</P>
<P>
PAL's pilots union is demanding a 10-percent pay hike over a
five-year period plus perks such as an executive car. It is also
demanding the staffing of two first officers on long-haul flights.

HONG KONG, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The Selection Committee for
the First Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (HKSAR) will meet for its third plenary session here
Wednesday to elect the candidate for the first Chief Executive of
the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
Upon appointment by the Central People's Government, the
candidate becomes the Chief Executive designate to assume office
on July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
As the most important link in the establishment of the HKSAR,
the election process is drawing increasing attention in Hong Kong
as well as in the world.
</P>
<P>
The candidate for the Chief Executive will be elected by the
400-memeber Selection Committee from among three candidates, Peter
K.C. Woo, Tung Chee Hwa and Ti Liang Yang (listed in order
according to the number of strokes in their surname).
</P>
<P>
The three were selected from eight applicants through secret
ballot at the first plenary session of the Selection Committee in
Hong Kong on November 15.
</P>
<P>
The method of choosing the first Chief Executive was adopted by
the Preparatory Committee for the HKSAR at its fifth plenary
meeting on October 5, according to the Basic Law and the related
stipulations of China's National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
In the following days, the Secretariat of the Preparatory
Committee received 31 application forms for the nomination of
candidates. Early in November, the chairman and vice-chairmen of
the Preparatory Committee examined the qualifications of the
applicants strictly according to the stipulations in the method
for choosing the Chief Executive, and confirmed a namelist of
eight qualified applicants.
</P>
<P>
On November 27, the Selection Committee held its second plenary
session in Hong Kong to listen to the policy platforms of the
three candidates. Four sessions were arranged from November 27 to
29 for the three candidates to answer questions raised by members
of the Selection Committee in different sectors.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the three candidates visited local communities and
had meetings with people of various sectors to exchange views and
listen to their opinions and suggestions on Hong Kong's
development.
</P>
<P>
The process of choosing the candidate for the first Chief
Executive of HKSAR has won the trust of Hong Kong people and the
selection procedures are generally regarded as being done in a
democratic, fair and open manner.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that the election of the candidate for the first
Chief Executive Wednesday will be conducted through secret ballot
and the entire process including the counting of the votes will be
televised live on the local circuit.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Four former winners highlight
the entry list for next year's African Champions' Cup while Al
Ahli, six-time winner in 14 years, surprisingly quit the
tournament.
</P>
<P>
Al Ahli qualified for the draw after winning the Egyptian
championship in May but have turned down the chance to play,
African soccer officials said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Some officials said the team were probably still "sore" after

<P>
Al Ahli were banned for a year after their defeat by Cairo
rivals Zamalek in the African Super Cup in Johannesburg in
January 1994 triggered fighting.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Zamalek will take Al Ahli's place in the 1997 cup
and will be top favourites, along with other former winners
Mouloudia Alger of Algeria, Raja Casablanca of Morocco and Club
Africain of Tunisia.
</P>
<P>
Mouloudia Alger will be chasing their first Champions' Cup
title in 20 years while Raja Casablanca won in 1989 and Club
Africain two years later.
</P>
<P>
Zamalek plays Shooting Stars of Nigeria in Cairo on Friday in
the second leg of this year's final.
</P>
<P>
Some 41 countries played in this year's competition.

<P>
"We hope to expand substantial cooperation, and enhance
information exchange with the Macao Bureau of the Interpol and
other relevant police departments in Macao," said Zhu Entao,

local reporters upon his arrival here.
</P>
<P>
Interpol is the acronym for the International Criminal Police

He said that police on the Chinese mainland are determined to
crack down on organized crimes and will in no case allow any
criminals to hide on the mainland.

<HEADLINE> Labor Standards A Non-issue at WTO Meeting: G-15 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The Group-15 countries have
agreed that labor standards is a non-issue at the on-going first
Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organization (WTO),
Malaysian Minister of International Trade and Industry Paduka
Rafidah Aziz said today.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian minister called and chaired a G-15 meeting here
this morning to exchange views on the controversial issues such as
labor standards.
</P>
<P>
"We agreed that this issue is a non-issue at the WTO meeting,"
she told reporters at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
"In the main, our views about the issues are similar except
that we have different degrees of divergence on how to approach
the issues," she added.
</P>
<P>
Some of the G-15 countries did not want the issue to appear in
the joint declaration, she said, adding that others said the issue
could be included in the declaration in a way they pursue, that is
"labor standards, ILO (the International Labor Organization)."
</P>
<P>
She said that ministers from the G-15 countries explained the
reasons for the stands taken by each of their countries and they
did have a meeting of minds on these issues.
</P>
<P>
"In some areas, we have even consensus on how to approach," she
said, adding that Malaysia rejects any inclusion of labor
standards in the WTO program.
</P>
<P>
Labor standards are within the jurisdiction of the ILO and the
Singapore conference is a reviewing meeting where no "extra
liberalization" should be discussed, she said.
</P>
<P>
The five-day conference is meant to review the implementation
of the Uruguay Round agreements and the difficulties encountered
in the implementation, she added.
</P>
<P>
The G-15 retains its original name although it now comprises 16
countries, namely Algeria, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Egypt, India,
Indonesia, Jamaica, Malaysia, Mexico, Nigeria, Senegal, Peru,
Venezuela, Yugoslavia and Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> No-Confidence Motion to Be Tabled at Nepali Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, December 10 (Xinhua) -- A no-confidence motion
against the Nepali three-party coalition government is to be
tabled at Parliament Wednesday by the main opposition and a
coalition partner.
</P>
<P>
General Secretary of the Communist Party of Nepal (United
Marxist Leninist, CPN-UML) Madhav Kumar Nepal told a press
conference here today that his party and the National Democratic
Party (RPP) will jointly register the no-trust motion at the
parliamentary secretariat at noon Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
RPP parliamentary party leader Lokendra Bahadur Chand Sunday
declared his party's withdrawal from the ruling coalition and
asked King Birendra to call a special session of the Lower House
to discuss a proposed no- confidence motion against the
government.
</P>
<P>
The king has decided to summon the special house session next
Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to the CPN-UML leader, a total of 102 MPs of the 205
seat House so far have pledged their support for the RPP-UML
sponsored no-confidence motion and some MPs of another small party
in the house promised their support for the motion at the last
minute.
</P>
<P>
Under the constitution of Nepal, a no-confidence motion could
be passed only with a majority of 103 in the 205-seat house.
</P>
<P>
A new RPP-UML coalition government with RPP leader Chand as
prime minister will be formed if the present government led by
Sher Bahadur Deuba of the Nepali Congress (NC) is overthrown
through the no-confidence motion, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also ruled out the possibility that a minority UML
government would be formed if the RPP-UML alliance could not
garner a majority parliamentary support.

<HEADLINE> 1997 Tightening Hong Kong, Inland Economic Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong will benefit from
the accelerated integration with the inland economy and continue
to maintain its competitive edges after 1997, said a business
leader here today.
</P>
<P>
Herbert Liang, president of the Chinese Manufacturers'
Association (CMA) of Hong Kong, said that Hong Kong can step up
the coordination of economic planning and infrastructure projects
with the interior areas after the handover on June 30, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the CMA's 1996 annual general meeting, Liang said
the interior areas had become an impetus for economic advancement
in Hong Kong. Under China's opening policy, Hong Kong
manufacturers have been moving their operations across the border
to southern China in order to minimize production cost over the
past decade.
</P>
<P>
He expected Hong Kong and the Pearl River delta in southern
China's Guangdong province to further integrate in such areas as
processing, export, re-export, shipping and trade up to 1997 and
beyond.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Hong Kong manufacturers can play a greater role in
the central and western parts of China since the central
government has decided to quicken the opening-up of the inland
regions, according to the president.
</P>
<P>
The CMA organized a 60-member delegation to Inner Mongolia in
August this year to explore investment opportunities there.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Liang stressed that Hong Kong can make full
use of the technical and research talents from the interior areas
to enhance its competitiveness in high-tech industry.
</P>
<P>
Now the interior area remains Hong Kong's largest export
market. Statistics show that Hong Kong's re-exports to the
interior area increased nearly three times over the past five
years, from 80 billion HK dollars (10.3 billion US dollars) in
1991 to 210 billion HK dollars (27 billion US dollars) in
1995.

Kenya.
</P>
<P>
According to Form-Net Africa Marketing Manager Yazmin Nanji,
the project began in September last year, compiling of
information taking one year and designing and implementation

</P>
<P>
Chacha Nyaigotti Chacha, secretary of Kenyan Higher Education
Loans Board, was quoted as saying here recently that the Internet
will sell Kenya to the world through the KenyaWeb.
</P>
<P>

about Kenya's land and people while university students can also
gain much information about Kenya's politics, economy and
culture, etc., she added.
</P>
<P>
The KenyaWeb has not only linked Kenyans to the information
super-highway so as to know more about the outside world, but
also will enable them to get access to the vast information
available about their own country, the Kenyan official noted.

SINGAPORE, December 10 (Xinhua) -- A senior Malaysian official
said today that Malaysia refuses any discussions on the
U.S.-proposed Information Technology Agreement (ITA) at the
Singapore Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organization
(WTO) which opened on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We didn't come here to discuss ITA, we didn't come to
negotiate ITA. This is not a negotiating forum, any negotiations
(on the issue) should be in Geneva and it can not be done here,"
Malaysian Minister of International Trade and Industry Paduka
Rafidah Aziz said at a press conference here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on a possible ITA between the United States
and other countries at the on-going WTO meeting, she said, "If
they can reach this agreement with three or four countries, it is
good for them and it doesn't matter to Malaysia."
</P>
<P>
"In Singapore, there will be no extra liberalization and no
extra liberalization should be discussed here," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The five-day conference is meant to review the implementation
of the Uruguay Round agreements and the difficulties encountered
in the implementation, she added.
</P>
<P>
She said that what Malaysia stated in the declaration of APEC's
(Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation) leaders' informal meeting
still stands.
</P>
<P>
"We are against ITA," she said, adding that her country will
show flexibility when the issue is brought out for negotiation in
Geneva.
</P>
<P>
The United States has been pushing hard for a conclusion of ITA
negotiations at the Singapore Conference.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. trade official said on Monday that if no agreement was
reached on information technology products at the current meeting,
it would never have a better opportunity to be concluded.
</P>
<P>
The U. S. exports of information technology products stand at
100 billion U.S. dollars every year, accounting for about 60
percent of the world's total trade in this area.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- A clash has occurred between
two major rebel groups in the southern Philippines recently,
military and police authorities confirmed here today.
</P>
<P>
The authorities said forces of the Moro National Liberation
Front (MNLF) and its breakaway group, the Moro Islamic Liberation
Front (MILF) exchanged fire over land disputes in Carmen, Cotabato
Province, on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Three of the 30 MILF rebels involved were wounded in the
five-minute shooting, but no casualties were reported on the MNLF
side.
</P>
<P>
The fighting, the first between the two groups recently, has
also sent many local residents fleeing to safer grounds to avoid
being caught in the crossfire.
</P>
<P>
Chairman Nur Misuari of the MNLF, which signed a peace
agreement with the government last September, has said he would
persuade the MILF to drop its efforts for independence.
</P>
<P>
However, the MILF, which vows to establish a Muslim state in
Mindanao, rejects the government-MNLF accord and demands separate
peace talks with the government.
</P>
<P>
In the past months, the two sides have been making preparations
for the talks, but little progress has been achieved. The
government said last week that it may start the peace talks with
the MILF early next year.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia, UK Sign Double Taxation Avoidance Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia and the United
Kingdom signed here today an agreement on the avoidance of double
taxation with respect to income taxes.
</P>
<P>
The agreement will replace the original one signed by the two
countries in 1973 to accommodate the rapid economic development,
according to officials.
</P>
<P>
The revised agreement, which ensures that income is taxed only
once, covers all types of income ranging from business profits and
property rents to annuities, capital gains and royalties.
</P>
<P>
Signing the document were Finance Ministry Secretary General
Clifford Herbert and British High Commissioner David Moss on
behalf of their respective governments.
</P>
<P>
With the signing of the agreement today, Malaysia has so far
concluded similar tax accords with 46 countries.
</P>
<P>
Herbert hoped that the volume of trade, the flow of investment,
goods and services and cooperation between both countries in other
areas would continue to increase with the signing of the new
agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian Ministry of International Trade and Industry
approved a total of 336 projects from Britain with an investment
of 1.8 billion U.S. dollars between 1981 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the UK was Malaysia's eighth largest trading partner
with total trade valued at 4.98 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng Stresses Importance of "Doing a Good Job" in Public Health </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng, addressing a
national conference on public health yesterday, emphasized that
doing a good job in public health is a unavoidable major
responsibility of Party committees and governments at all levels
in all parts of China.
</P>
<P>
"All Party and government officials must put public health at
the top of their agenda, and regard it as a major factor in Party,
official, and public relations," he told the meeting.
</P>
<P>
He said that public health is closely linked to people's lives,
and reflects the Party's and government's concern for people. He
urged the government to increase spending on the public health
system, which, he pointed out, is the largest in the world.
</P>
<P>
"No matter what the difficulties, local government should try
to see to it that increases in public health funds are no less
than those for local expenditures," he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out, it is also necessary that society and
individuals both contribute to health care, and that a special
fund should be established.
</P>
<P>
"It is important that people's health awareness be increased,
and that they be persuaded to spend more money on their own
health," he said, adding that governments at all levels must
implement public health laws, and crack down on illegal activities
in the field of medicine.
</P>
<P>
"We must increase controls on food, medicines, health care, and
medical instruments, because they are closely connected to
people's health, and strictly examine the qualifications of
doctors and hospitals," he explained, noting that the central
government will take charge of enacting laws and general policies,
but that it is the responsibility of local government to help
public health departments overcome many other difficulties.
</P>
<P>
"Improving public health should become a major criterion by
which an official's effectiveness during his time in office is
judged," he concluded.

<HEADLINE> Italian Industry Looking at Chinese Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 10 (Xinhua) -- China's fast economic growth
will increase aluminum consumption from today's two million tons
to over three million tons a year by the year 2000, according to
Anthony Tropeano, general manager of Italy's Fata Engineering.
</P>
<P>
Tropeano was addressing a symposium in Beijing today, where he
said that production capacity in China falls short of demand, so
the country can either increase imports of aluminum products or
import more machinery to improve its own production.
</P>
<P>
The symposium was sponsored by the China Nonferrous Metals
Industry Corp. (CNMC) and Fata, and attracted some 150
participants from 70 Chinese aluminum smelters, fabricating
plants, and banks.
</P>
<P>
CNMC Vice-president Wo Tingshu assured the members of the
symposium that the Chinese market will remain open to foreign
suppliers, saying, "Chinese aluminum fabricators lag behind their
western counterparts in terms of productivity, material
utilization ratio, energy efficiency, and product quality," and,
"we will continue importing advanced technology."
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, China has imported 71 aluminum rolling
mills, accounting for 74 percent of the number in China, according
to China Nonferrous Metals Industry in a 340-page report to be
published by CNMC and Xinhua soon. Fata alone has provided 18 of
them.
</P>
<P>
To improve its market share in China, Fata introduced, at
today's symposium, a new approach to financial assistance for
Chinese plants using its technology.

<HEADLINE> Turkish PM to Attend Ceremony for Reopening Iraqi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Islamist Prime
Minister Necmettin Erbakan is expected to attend the ceremony
scheduled to be held in southern Turkey next Monday for the
celebration of the reopening of the Iraqi-Turkish petroleum
pipeline, according to the semi-official Anatolia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that Turkish Deputy Prime Minister and
Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller and other high-ranking officials
will also attend the ceremony in the Yumurtalk Port on December 16
when the first tanker is loaded with Iraqi crude oil for
export.
</P>
<P>
The pipeline was closed following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait
in August 1990.
</P>
<P>
The 986-kilometer-long Iraqi-Turkish twin oil pipeline connects
 the Kirkuk fields in Iraq with the Turkish Mediterranean
terminal of Ceylan.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted Metin Eral, deputy undersecretary of the
Energy and Natural Resources Ministry, as saying that everything
is ready for the reopening of the pipeline with an expectation of
pumping the crude oil in Yumurtalik Port.
</P>
<P>
Eral also said that Turkey and Iraq had held talks in Baghdad
on the purchase of the Iraqi petroleum.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Ambassador to Turkey Rafi Al Tikriti said that the
United Nations has permitted Iraq to sell 650,000 barrels of
oil per day, but its capacity is about 2 million barrels.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi production capacity will reach 3 million barrels
next year, the ambassador said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier on Public Health Reform (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng told a
national conference yesterday that people must be active in
restructuring and promoting public health.
</P>
<P>
Li made the remarks at a four-day national conference on public
health, where he explained that the basic concepts of public
health reform are: gearing it to the socialist market economy;
following public health principles; improving people's health;
making full use of various sectors; setting up a multi-faceted
medical insurance system; in order to form a highly-efficient,
low-cost, and energetic management system and operation mechanism
to provide convenient, reasonably-priced, high-quality medical
service for the broad masses of people.
</P>
<P>
Li said that China should set up an employee medical insurance
system that is in line with the country's circumstances. The
shortcomings of the present one at public expense have been
emerging and they are even very serious, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he commented, it is generally agreed that this
insurance system should be reformed.
</P>
<P>
Li said that, in recent years, Zhenjiang in Jiangsu Province,
and Jiujiang, in Jiangxi Province, two pilot cities for a reformed
public health system, have set up an employee medical insurance
system that combines a social welfare fund with personal
responsibility, with the cost being shared by the state, the
employer, and the employee.
</P>
<P>
This system, Li went on to say, has made some initial
achievements and will be tried in other provinces and autonomous
regions next year to get further experience.
</P>
<P>
He said that by the year 2000, all the country's cities and
towns will basically have a medical insurance system, and that
more kinds of supplementary medical insurance, including mutual
assistance and commercial forms should be studied.

<TEXT>
<P>
Li urged the public health sector to improve management and to
better allocate medical resources, gradually setting up a new
mechanism in order to improve efficiency and service, and increase
the industry's vigor.
</P>
<P>
He noted that there are now immense medical resources in some
large and medium-sized cities, but in rural areas, remote areas in
particular, there is a shortage of resources.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, regional medical regulations must be worked
out to increase government ability to macro-control medical
resources, resolve the supply-demand imbalance in rural and urban
areas, meet the basic medical care requirements of people
everywhere, and properly decide on location and scope of medical
services.
</P>
<P>
In future, he went on to say, new medical resources should be
approved before they are used and present resources must be
examined and readjusted in a proper and positive way.
</P>
<P>
"This is an important reform strategy, and should be
implemented in a moderate way and spread gradually, following the
pilot model and a study of of experience," Li said, while calling
for tighter management at medical institutions and stricter
management of individually run medical services.
</P>
<P>
Li said that there must be a positive attitude toward
developing community medical services and that more convenient
medical service must be provided to better serve the people.
</P>
<P>
He also emphasized scientific and technological progress and
education as the basis of public health development, and urged
better management in the restructuring process.
</P>
<P>
He said that public health experts who are studying overseas
are welcomed back to serve the motherland.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Meets Head of Japan's NEC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng met with the
president of the Nippon Electric Corporation (NEC), Tadahiro
Sekimoto, in Beijing today, and expressed appreciation for the
company's active involvement in China's electronics industry.
</P>
<P>
NEC has 24 years of cooperation with China in
telecommunications, computers, and semi-conductors, and has 12
joint ventures in China, with a total investment of 557 million US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
"This is in line with the industrial policy of the Chinese
Government, as well as the principles of equality and mutual
benefit, common development, and long-term cooperation," Li
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
NEC and China have had great success in their cooperation, he
said, and that he hopes it will expand in the future. China has a
huge market for micro-electronics, and cooperation with NEC has
bright prospects, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he added, NEC faces intense competition in
seeking a bigger share of the Chinese market, and to win, the
Japanese company should increase its technological input.
</P>
<P>
Sekimoto said that NEC and its Chinese partners have a solid
foundation for further cooperation because of fruitful exchanges
in the past, and NEC has full confidence in strengthening
cooperative ties.
</P>
<P>
NEC will try to increase its investment in China a great deal
by the end of the century, he said, expressing agreement with Li
on increasing cooperation in new technology.
</P>
<P>
Sekimoto is here to pay an official visit to China at the
invitation of the Chinese Ministry of Electronics Industry.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Predicts Uneven Economic Performance in Europe (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Economic
Commission for Europe predicts modest economic recovery in western
Europe and the Baltic states, slowing growth in eastern Europe,
and a continuing decline in output in the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS) next year.
</P>
<P>
The economic outlook in western Europe has started to improve
after a cyclical setback in the second half of 1995, the
commission says in an issue of the Economic Bulletin for Europe,
to be published next month.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the pick-up in economic activity was led by the United
States and Japan, with the economies of western Europe showing
more moderate and hesitant growth.
</P>
<P>
But quarterly growth rates have been erratic in most of western
Europe, with only the United Kingdom showing fairly steady
expansion at an annual rate of over 2 percent, the bulletin points
out.
</P>
<P>
The performance among the smaller western European economies
has been variable, with above average growth in countries such as
Ireland and the Netherlands but a deepening recession in
Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Inflation has remained subdued during the present recovery. In
western Europe, the average rate of consumer price inflation
continued to fall in 1996 and was under 2.5 percent in the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
Labor markets in western Europe remained generally weak in 1996
and employment growth is unlikely to have averaged more than 0.5
percent in 1996 in western Europe and in Germany. But
unemployment, which on average has remained at over 10 percent
since 1993, is expected to continue, since the cyclical recovery
in output is unlikely to be strong enough.
</P>
<P>
The outlook for 1997 will be influenced heavily by the current
stance of fiscal policy in various European countries, the report
says.
</P>
<P>
In general, government budget deficits in the European Union
are still significantly above the Maastricht target for monetary
union of 3 percent of GDP and most governments have indicated they
intend to intensify their efforts to reach that target in 1997.
</P>
<P>
That implies a reduction in deficits equivalent to about 1.5
percentage points of GDP, which is possibly the largest fiscal
adjustment ever attempted in the region, the report says.
</P>
<P>
The short-term outlook for western Europe is for a continuation
of low growth, low inflation and high unemployment.
</P>
<P>
In eastern Europe, GDP growth is likely to have averaged some
3.5 percent this year, distinctly below last year's 5.5 percent
growth and earlier forecasts of 5 to 6 percent for 1996, the
bulletin predicts.
</P>
<P>
In Russia, in the first nine months of 1996, GDP was 6 percent
lower than a year earlier and for the whole year it might be some
5 percent lower than in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Growth has been relatively strong in Albania, Croatia, the
Czech Republic, Poland and Slovakia in 1996, that experienced
growth rates of between 5 and 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Hungary's GDP did not grow in the first half of 1996 and its
overall growth rate for the year is likely to be zero. In Bulgaria
GDP has fallen sharply and is likely to be some 8 to 10 percent
below 1995's level and a dramatic reversal of forecasts made at
the beginning of the year.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Poll: Majority Favors Beilin-Abbas Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 10 (Xinhua) -- An opinion poll has found
support for the understanding reached between Israeli former
cabinet minister Yossi Beilin and Palestinian Authority official
Mahmoud Abbas, which could serve as the basis for a permanent
settlement to the Israeli-Palestinians issues.
</P>
<P>
The main clause of the Beilin-Abbas plan calls for Israel to
annex the large blocs of Jewish settlements in return for giving
the Palestinians an area close to the Egyptian border and a
demilitarized Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
The survey found some support for the plan even among those
who voted for Binyamin Netanyahu, Israeli prime minister, in the
May elections, and just over 50 percent said they were either
very much in favor or fairly in favor.
</P>
<P>
Hebrew University professor Efi Ya'ar initiated and
implemented the survey through last month, and he said he is
interested in carrying out a similar survey among Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The survey was carried out among 1,046 Hebrew-speaking adults
and did not include Arabs, kibbutz members, or settlers. A
slightly majority of those polled had voted for Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Of the total sample, 11.5 percent was very much in favor;
42.5 percent fairly in favor; 17.2 percent fairly against; 12.4
percent very against; and the rest had no opinion. Of those who
said they were fairly in favor, 34.1 percent had voted for
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Beilin and Abbas, architects of the Oslo peace accords,
reached the understanding during their private talks following the
signing of the Interim agreement between Israel and the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
According to the understanding, Jewish settlers in non-annexed
areas would retain Israeli citizenship, but live under
Palestinian sovereignty with appropriate security protection.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army would stay on the Jordanian border, and
there would be additional security arrangements, such as warning
stations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Palestinian refugees would not be allowed to return
to Israel, but could only return to the Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem would remain united as the Israeli capital, while
the Palestinian capital would be Al-Kuds, based on Abu Dis,
which is outside Jerusalem's boundaries.
</P>
<P>
The mosques on the Temple Mount would not be under I=sraeli
sovereignty and would be run by the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Predicts Uneven Economic Performance in Europe (2-last) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An important development has been the continuing decline in the
rates of inflation in most of the "transition" economies, where
the rise in consumer prices has been brought down to about 10
percent in many countries.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment in eastern Europe remains high, but rates dropped
below 12 percent in September 1996 from an average of almost 13
percent a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
At least 14 million people in all the transition economies were
unemployed, including 6 million in eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
The bulletin warns that the numbers are likely to rise,
especially in the CIS, and there is little prospect for a rapid
reduction given the prospective rates of output growth in the near
future and the scale of enterprise restructuring that still lies
ahead in most of the "transition" economies.
</P>
<P>
The bulletin says expectations in eastern Europe are that
growth could pick up again to an average rate of some 4 to 5
percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The high growth countries of 1996, Albania, the Czech Republic,
Poland and Slovakia, are likely to remain within the range of 5 to
6 percent annual growth next year. Somewhat lower rates of
expansion are expected in Hungary and Slovenia in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
Growth in transition economies is likely to depend on domestic
demand in 1997 as the outlook for rapid recovery in export growth
is not strong, given the sluggish growth rates expected in western
Europe.
</P>
<P>
The outlook for the Russian economy still remains much more
uncertain than that for other transition economies, it says.
</P>
<P>
Official Russian forecasts are now suggesting a possible end to
the transition slump and an upturn in output in 1997. However,
there are considerable structural and institutional problems in
the economy, particularly in the financial and banking sectors.
</P>
<P>
The bulletin warns that these problems will have to be overcome
before the country will see a recovery in the collapse of fixed
asset investment seen over the last five years.
</P>
<P>
However, recovery in Russia will also have positive multiplier
effects on most of the other CIS members who have strong trade and
financial links with Russia, the bulletin says.
</P>
<P>
Russia's net imports from the CIS increased rapidly in 1996 and
this positive trend is likely to continue in 1997, particularly if
output in Russia recovers.

<HEADLINE> Saving the China River Dolphin: Everybody's Responsibility </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, December 10 (Xinhua) -- At the Wuchang Elementary School
in China's Hubei Province on November 29, some 2,300 pupils could
be seen queuing up for 30 collection boxes to donate their pocket
change for a worthwhile cause - saving the China river dolphin.
</P>
<P>
The China river dolphin, a rare and valuable aquatic mammal,
has existed in the Yangtze River, the only place it is found, for
more than 20 million years. It is, in fact, regarded as a sort of
"aquatic Giant Panda".
</P>
<P>
It is regarded as a living fossil for the study of the
development of living things and the environment. Like the giant
panda, it is not easy to breed artificially. There are fewer than
100 in existence and it is near extinction.
</P>
<P>
Hubei set up reserves for the dolphin in 1987, but no dolphin
has been survived, and now the major difficulty in dolphin
protection lies in the shortage of funds.
</P>
<P>
Expenditures for catching the dolphins are too great for a
nature reserve of a developing country to bear, let alone
improving facilities, and without the support of the whole world,
protection is just an empty word, an expert said.
</P>
<P>
So, the pupils decided that they would donate money every year,
and the money will be turned over to the U.N. to set up a global
youth foundation to save this friend of human beings -- the China
river dolphin".

<HEADLINE> Foreign Debt Remains Major Constraint for Zambian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Foreign debt continues to be a
major constraint for Zambia's economy, the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) representative to the country has said.
</P>
<P>
Financial Mail today quoted IMF official Elwaheed Taha as
urging Zambia to maintain good relations with its bilateral
donors to secure the necessary financing for its economic
reforms.
</P>
<P>
Taha said significant changes in economic policy and far
reaching structural reforms notably in freeing markets and
eliminating government intervention have taken place in Zambia in
recent years, according to the local weekly newspaper.
</P>
<P>
He said, "in view of Zambia's low domestic savings (estimated
at 5 to 6 percent of GDP) and high foreign debt service burden
(40 percent of GDP), it is imperative for Zambia to maintain good
relations with its bilateral donors."
</P>
<P>
Zambia's relations with some donors have been strained in the
past half a year over a constitutional amendment, which has
barred former president Kenneth Kaunda from contesting the
presidency in the elections held last month.
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal of aid by donors has deprived Zambia of balance
of payment support, which is likely to affect the country's economy.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Asks Mubarak for Help to End Hebron </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu Monday night asked Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak to use his influence on the Palestinians to break the
current logjam in the Hebron talks, Israel Radio reported this
morning.
</P>
<P>
The radio said that Netanyahu's appeal for the Egyptian help to
conclude the negotiations on Israeli army's redeployment in the
West Bank town came in a phone call initiated by Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
During the phone call, Netanyahu praised Egypt for making a
"favorable contribution" to the peace process, a comment which
contrasts with the acrimony exchanged between the two sides on the
bilateral relationship in recent months.
</P>
<P>
The appeal marked one of the few times Israel has asked
Egypt to step up its intervention in the peace process,
since the Netanyahu government has been suspicious that Egypt
would urge the Palestinians to take tougher positions.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio said that the appeal came as Palestinian
negotiator Saeb Erekat is seeking to prevail upon Palestinian
National Authority President Yasser Arafat to scuttle a joint
U.S.-Egyptian compromise document, which would have led to a
Netanyahu-Arafat summit that would culminate in the accord.
</P>
<P>
The document, drafted by Mubarak's national security adviser
Osama Baz and U.S. special Middle East peace coordinator Dennis
Ross during the last few days in Washington, is reportedly a
distillation of Palestinian ideas on Hebron.
</P>
<P>
The report added that Erekat has told Arafat that if he is
permitted to continue the talks, he could get a "better deal"
than the proposed compromise plan, even if it takes longer.
</P>
<P>
While Arafat is weighing this, everything has been put on
hold, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israel and the Palestinians have agreed, as they
have done every month for the last six, to ask Norway to extend
the deployment of its officials in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
There are an estimated 30 Norwegians in the city, known
as the Temporary International Presence in Hebron (TIPH), whose
sole function is to monitor and report on events.
</P>
<P>
According to the Interim Agreement between Israel and the
Palestinians, the TIPH is due to be broadened to include
other countries once a Hebron pullback deal is struck.

<HEADLINE> Malaysians Urged to Master Info-Tech Tools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Deputy Prime
Minister Anwar Ibrahim today urged Malaysians to master basic
tools of information technology so that they will not be left
behind in this rapidly developing field.
</P>
<P>
The government hopes to develop multimedia facilities in the
country and has the responsibility to provide access to
information technology tools, Anwar said when launching the
Income-Tax infoLINE for the Inland Revenue Board here.
</P>
<P>
The Income-Tax infoLINE service, entering operation today,
provides information on income tax rates, registration files,
personal income tax statements, profit tax, income tax payments
and corporate information. Taxpayers can use the service around
the clock by dialing a given number.
</P>
<P>
Anwar noted that the installation of information service lines
in every government agency and ministry would provide access and
training to the public in handling such tools.
</P>
<P>
"If the public are not given wide exposure to the multimedia
and information technology as a culture, we will be left behind
... and the billions of ringgit (Malaysia's currency) we have
spent will be a waste as it only benefited only a small number of
people," he said.
</P>
<P>
Anwar urged telecommunications companies in the country to keep
abreast of the rapid progress of the telecommunications and
information fields to ensure that Malaysia would continue to
benefit from the latest development.

<P>
HEFEI, December 10 (Xinhua) -- A 300-year-old tortoise weighing
18 kilograms was recently caught in a pond near a downtown hotel
in this capital city of east China's Anhui Province.
</P>
<P>
The tortoise, which is as big as a wash basin, was spotted by
several hotel employees one evening when it appeared on the
surface of the water.
</P>
<P>
Sources claim that the tortoise will soon be returned to a more
natural environment, out of respect for the barely-legible
characters carved on its shell which say, "Please return me to
nature."
</P>
<P>
Authorities suspect the tortoise was caught many years ago and
later returned to its own habitat.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that such an old tortoise is very rarely captured
in an inland river or lake, and it is a wonder that the creature
appeared in the downtown area.
</P>
<P>
In January this year, a pair of 1,000-year-old soft-shelled
turtles, both weighing around 23 kilograms, were caught in Yudu in

<P>
MAPUTO, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The number of the disabled is
increasing significantly in Mozambique because of the mines which
was buried in its 16-year civil war, the Mozambique Information
Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by Secretary General of the National
Association of the Disabled Farida Gulamo in an interview with
local reporters here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said the disabled in the country of 17 million are
estimated to have reached more than one million.
</P>
<P>
The long-standing civil war was mainly blamed for the great
number of the disabled in Mozambique, noted Gulamo.
</P>
<P>
Although the civil war had ended four years ago, the mines
planted during the war, still threaten the lives of people,
leaving dozens of persons dead or disabled every month, he said.
</P>
<P>
Among two million mines laid reportedly throughout the country
during the war, less than 50,000 have been removed so far.

<HEADLINE> Two Plead Guilty in Church, Migrant Camp Burning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Two former Ku Klux Klansmen
pleaded guilty on Monday to federal charges that they conspired to
set fires and burn down a rural black church and a migrant labor
camp last year.
</P>
<P>
The fires, both in Bloomville, destroyed the Macedonia Baptist
Church and a migrant labor camp about 128 kilometers north of
Charleston, South Carolina, The Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
Hubert "Herbert" Rowell, 50, and Arthur A. Haley, 51, pleaded
guilty to four conspiracy counts stemming from the fires. In
return, prosecutors agreed to drop 16 other charges against them.
</P>
<P>
Neither man was charged with setting either of the fires.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said Rowell and Haley provided the flammable
liquids that two other men used to burn down the century-old
church in June 1995 and also conspired in the fire that destroyed
the camp in February 1995.
</P>
<P>
Each man faces up to 60 years in prison and a 1-million-dollar
fine.
</P>
<P>
The indictment says the defendants instructed Gary Christopher
Cox and Timothy Adron Welch, both former Ku Klux Klan members, in
how to use the flammable liquids to burn down the Macedonia church.
</P>
<P>
Cox and Welch also pleaded guilty in August to setting the
Macedonia church on fire, as well as a June 1995 fire that
destroyed the Mount Zion AME Church in Greeleyville. They are
awaiting sentencing.

<HEADLINE> Breakthroughs in Silt Control in Yellow River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENZHOU, December 10 (Xinhua) -- In recent years, Chinese
researchers have made thousands of scientific achievements and a
number of major breakthroughs in controlling silt in the world's
muddiest river.
</P>
<P>
To date, the riverbed of the Yellow River at its middle and
lower reaches stands at between three to five meters -- sometimes
up to 10 meters -- higher than the ground outside the riverbank,
imposing a great threat to residents living on both sides of the
river.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Ye'an, an expert in the field of silt research, said that
systematic research of silt in the river began just dozens of
years ago, although people were fully aware of the seriousness of
the problem thousands of years ago.
</P>
<P>
He said that the central government attaches great importance
to the research of silt in the river, and has provided
considerable research funding since the founding of the people's
republic in 1949.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in recent years, more than 10,000 papers
have been written about the silt problem, and a dozen have won
national awards for their impact in the field.

<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Construction is set to begin soon
on the third Yangtze River bridge in Hubei province's capital of
Wuhan, which is a leading commercial city in central China.
</P>
<P>
Departments connected with the project have approved it for
this winter, to continue through next spring, when the river is at
its lowest level. The third bridge will be located about ten km
from the other bridges along the upper reaches of the river. It is
expected to open to traffic around the year 2000, and will cost
about 1.6 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Wuhan is made up of three towns -- Hankou, Wuchang, and
Hanyang. The bridge will link Shenlong Automobile City at Hanyang
with the suburbs of Wuchang.
</P>
<P>
An effort will also be made to build a fourth Yangtze river
bridge seven km from the other bridges along the river's lower
reaches. The third and fourth bridges will connect the city's
mid-ring road.
</P>
<P>
Wuhan is also working on two cross-river tunnels in its
outskirts, as part of an outer-ring road.
</P>
<P>
The city's two Yangtze river bridges and the Hanjiang highway
bridge make up the inner-ring road.
</P>
<P>
The first rail and highway bridge, which went into operation in
1957, now handles 67,000 vehicles per day, far beyond its designed
capacity of 37,000.
</P>
<P>
The second highway bridge, which opened last year, also reports
handling 45,000 vehicles each day, and it will soon exceed its
designed capacity of 50,000.

<HEADLINE> King Hussein: Jordan Much Concerned over Israel's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Hussein said here
today that the kingdom is very much concerned over the tough
policies of the current hardline Israeli government led by Prime
Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, which are endangering the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
"We certainly are concerned that progress is not as rapid as
it should have been for whatever reason and something must be
done to ensure that we continue building what we have made (to
avoid) great losses to all of us," said the king in a television
interview.
</P>
<P>
Despite the growing tension in the region, Jordan is committed
to respecting its 1994 peace treaty with Israel, he said.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Jordan kept criticizing Israel for its hardline
policy and Hussein's television interview was just one of the
many moves which Jordan made to show its unsatisfaction with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
On December 5, Jordanian Crown Princess Hassan blamed Israel
for the stalemated peace process while attending an international
conference in the Hague.
</P>
<P>
Natanyahu, however, paid tribute to the "fine ideas" Jordan
presented to the peace and security in the Middle East while
addressing the Hague conference via a satellite link-up.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his government's commitment to pursuing a
settlement with the Arabs, but he also said that the Israeli
policy was focused on maintaining security for Israelis and
promoting foreign investment in Israel.

<P>
HARARE, December 10 (Xinhua) -- All suggested changes to the
constitution of Zimbabwe, including a return to a two-chamber
legislature, can be considered and adopted if there is support,
President Robert Mugabe has said.
</P>
<P>
But these suggestions have to be submitted to the ruling party
for debate first, since ZANU (PF) makes the policy which its MPs
implement in parliament, he stressed, quoted by the Daily Herald
paper today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in an exclusive interview with the Herald on recent
suggestions by MPs for the return of the senate, the abolition of
appointed MPs and term limits for the presidency, the president
said parliament was the wrong place to initiate the debate.
</P>
<P>
"They are there in parliament, they think things can just be
suggested in parliament and the policy made by parliament. That
is nonsensical. Policy has to be made by the party, by the
Central Committee which in the absence of conferences and
congresses is the custodian of our policies," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added the party was not opposed to change. It had
introduced an executive presidency and two vice-presidents as a
result of need. Now old ideas are being recycled as new ideas and
new ideas as old ones, he said.
</P>
<P>
"I suppose we must reckon with the people. Well fine, let us
discuss whatever the people have," the president suggested.

ZHENGZHOU, December 10 (Xinhua) -- When quarrels flare up
between residents in the Baoanli neighborhood in Zhengzhou, the

mediator rather than a local cop.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-year-old Li Fengzhi has been a civil mediator for 910
families in her neighborhood since her retirement, calling herself
a "fire extinguisher".
</P>

The city now has more than 30,000 mediators like Li, working

"They have settled over 4,700 disputes among neighbors during
the first half of this year, including marital arguments, quarrels
between neighbors, questionable obligations of both parties and
compensation issues," the official said.
</P>
<P>
Civil mediation is highly regarded by the city government and
has greatly contributed to the stability of the local society, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Li, who is also the director of the neighborhood mediation
group, has spent her life dissolving the feuds among residents,
according to the official.

<HEADLINE> Insurance Policies Benefit Tibetan Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The booming insurance business
in the Tibet Autonomous Region has greatly benefited local farmers
and herdsmen.
</P>
<P>
Last year, one Tibetan farmer spent just five yuan to purchase
an agricultural disaster insurance policy. To his surprise, he
received 1,183 yuan this year for crop losses that resulted from
harsh weather conditions.
</P>
<P>
Among the types of insurance available to the Tibetan farmers,
policies covering agricultural disaster, housing and pensions have
been most popular, according to a local official with the Bureau
of Civil Affairs.
</P>
<P>
"Farmers can buy a sense of security at a low cost," the
official said.
</P>
<P>
Most farmers in Bome County, known for its severe weather, have
bought social pensions.
</P>
<P>
Local authorities have also granted preferential policies in
some special cases. An elderly woman in Tibet received a 20-year
pension following the death of her son.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi, Indian PMs to Discuss Water Sharing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister
Shiekh Hasina left here this morning for New Delhi for a meeting
with her Indian counterpart H.D. Deve Gowda on the outstanding
problem of sharing the Ganges water between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Formal talks between the two prime ministers, scheduled to take
place Wednesday, will also cover the entire gamut of the bilateral
relations, official sources said.
</P>
<P>
The two governments had held talks at various levels during the
past six months on the question of water sharing and both sides
expressed optimism about solving the long-standing issue, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
During Hasina's three-day visit, her first to India since she
assumed the office in June, the two sides are expected to sign an
agreement on the sharing of the Ganges flow in the dry season.
</P>
<P>
The Ganges, or the Padma in Bangladesh, a river flowing past
Nepal, India and Bangladesh, has almost dried up in its section in
Bangladesh in the dry season since India constructed the Farakar
Dam in the upper stream in the mid 1970s.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladeshi government said that the non-availability of
the Ganges water has affected one-third of the country and reduced
its grain production by 7.5 million tons in the last 20 years.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will
set up 50 agrarian reform communities across the country to hasten
the "emancipation" of tenant farmers under the Comprehensive
Agrarian Reform Program, the Philippine News Agency (PNA) reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The PNA quoted Trade Undersecretary Melito Salazar as saying
that the agrarian reform communities will coordinate activities in
16 regions and reach out to some 500,000 tenant farmers to help
them live a peaceful and productive life.
</P>
<P>
Each agrarian reform community will cover between l0,000 to
290,000 hectares, Salazar said at an agrarian reform meeting in
Cebu city last weekend.
</P>
<P>
Salazar said that the communities are common service facilities
where tenant farmers will go through a period of orientation in
social development with the assistance of the Department of
Agrarian Reform.
</P>
<P>
The central theme of this farmer emancipation process is to
impart to the farmers the value of team work, Salazar said.

<HEADLINE> 400 Rwandan Refugees in Tanzania Trek Home Daily </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR Es SALAAM, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Some 400 Rwandan
refugees are leaving Ngara district in north-western Tanzania for
home daily, in response to the appeal of the UNHCR and Tanzania
that they should go home by December 31.
</P>
<P>
Ngara District Commissioner Evans Balama was quoted by local
press as telling reporters on Monday that an average of 60
refugees were trekking back home daily before the joint appeal
last week.
</P>
<P>
He said after Assistant U.N. High Commissioner of Refugees
(UNHCR) Sereio Viera Demello delivered the message demanding the
return home of refugees, all relief agencies in Ngara geared
themselves up to facilitate the repatriation of refugees.
</P>
<P>
However, according to a report reaching here today, Peter
Kessler, a spokesman for the UNHCR, said in Ngara on Monday that
about 15,000 Rwandan refugees had absconded from two camps there,
apparently in defiance of a "Tanzanian government campaign to
repatriate them".
</P>
<P>
He said the vast majority of the refugees wandered off into
the Tanzanian bush on Sunday heading north and northeast, away
from the Rwandan border.
</P>
<P>
The exodus bodes ill for the repatriation plan for the 542,000
Rwandan refugees in Tanzania and it could end in bands of
Rwandan refugees wandering around the country, as has happened
in Zaire on the other side of Rwanda, according to the UNHCR
official.

KAMPALA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Uganda Revenue Authority
(URA) has decided to turn back to Kenya expired margarine and oil
fats it seized here in Kampala, reported "The Crusader" paper
today.
</P>
<P>
These items which were illegally imported include 7,919
cartons of Blue Band margarine, as well as 1,649 cartons of Kimbo
cooking fat.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, the consignment was impounded in
October this year shortly after it was imported.
</P>
<P>
The products were being sold in Kampala at abnormally low
prices, the paper said, adding that investigations revealed that
they were imported by a European-owned firm Unilever (U) Ltd.
</P>
<P>
Originally, the paper said, the URA wanted the company to pay
up the taxes due, but on closer scrutiny it was found that the
products were expired. Tests done by the Uganda National Bureau
of Standards and the government chemist confirmed that they were
unfit for human consumption.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The go-slow by Kenyan air
traffic controllers has taken a new dimension as other workers
from the aviation sector joined them in the strike, local papers
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The workers joining in the go-slow were from the aeronautical,
nautical communication, information service and engineering
sections of the Directorate of Civil Aviation.
</P>
<P>
The striking air traffic controllers have threatened to
continue with their go-slow action, which started last Sunday,
until their demands are met.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan civil aviation authorities yesterday sent instructors
and administrators of the sector to replace the striking air
traffic controllers at main international airports.
</P>
<P>
A meeting scheduled on Monday between the striking controllers
and leaders of the civil aviation authorities failed to take
place.
</P>
<P>
A Kenyan Airways official confirmed that they were severely
affected by the go-slow action since most of their flights
commenced or ended their journeys at the Jomo Kenyatta, Moi and
Kisumu airports.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that various foreign airlines planes were being
held up for at least one hour before being allowed to fly into
Kenya's air space and some international airlines had diverted
their flights to other airports in neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Last April, a strike by the air traffic controllers was
suspended after leaders of aviation authorities and government
departments concerned intervened.
</P>
<P>
Then, an evaluation committee was formed to compile a job
evaluation report within three months expiring on July 4.
</P>
<P>
The striking controllers demanded the immediate release of the
report, formation of an aviation body and salary and allowance
increases.

km, 220 power stations with a combined generating capacity of
25,000 kw, and the mushrooming of rural factories in the areas
inhabited by ethnic minority groups.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, December 10 (Xinhua) -- China's central and western

<HEADLINE> France, Germany Coordinate Stands Over EU Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 9 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl met today in Nuremberg, Germany,
to coordinate their stands over the single European currency and
reforms of the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
At their regular six-monthly summit, the two leaders decided to
submit a 12-page joint initiative to the EU summit slated to open
Friday in Dublin, Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The initiative calls for all the 15 EU member states to closely
cooperate in the fields of judicature, internal affairs and
foreign policies.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders, however, failed to iron out their differences
over how to set up a "stability pact" to defend the single
currency, the Euro.
</P>
<P>
Germany said that EU member states must sign a "strict pact" to
maintain strict budgetary discipline and accept iron-clad
automatic fines if they overspend in accordance with the standards
of the Maastricht Treaty.
</P>
<P>
France, on the other hand, opposed Germany's demand for a
"strict pact", fearing that it will transfer state sovereignty to
the European Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, at a joint national defense meeting in Nuremberg,
the two countries reached an understanding over an ambitious
project they had agreed earlier of a European spy satellite, "the
Helios II satellite", which was to make Europe independent of
U.S. intelligence.
</P>
<P>
Germany would have to put off joining the project until 1998
due to "budget problems" while France could start soon, officials
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 10 (Xinhua) -- A penalty stroke from Juan
Escarre helped Spain for an exciting 2-2 draw against Pakistan in
the Champions Trophy hockey tournament in Madras on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan appeared set to defeat the surprise Atlanta Olympic
finalists when they scored on either side of the interval to build
up a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
But Spain's desperate efforts to salvage a valuable point bore
fruit in the last seven minutes when Jorge Arnau scored off a
penalty corner in the 63rd and Escarre pushed in the stroke in
the 68th.
</P>
<P>
The thrilling finish, however, may not reward either team with
a place in Sunday's final of the prestigious six-nation event.
</P>
<P>
Spain have just two points from three matches and two tough
games in hand against defending champions Germany and Olympic
gold medallists the Netherland.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan have four points from three matches and need to win
both their remaining matches against arch-rivals India and
Germany to stay in contention.
</P>
<P>
Anis Muhammad put Pakistan ahead in the 26th minute and Kamran
Ashraf increased the margin in the 44th to give the World Cup
holders a comfortable lead.
</P>
<P>
Spain, who beat Pakistan 3-0 at Atlanta, dominated the second
half played in heavy rain and forced eight penalty corners.

<HEADLINE> Qinghai Strengthens Ecological Protection of Qaidam Basin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Residents in the Qaidam Basin,
one of China's four largest inland basins in northwest China's
Qinghai Province, are asked not to cut trees for firewood from the
beginning of this month.
</P>
<P>
According to regualations on desert plant protection adopted at
the provincial people's congress, the measure is taken as part of
the efforts for ecological protection and controlling desertation
of the basin.
</P>
<P>
The regulations stipulate that those who cut a tree in
afforestated areas will have to plant 10 new trees and be fined.
</P>
<P>
The local government will open coal supply shops and install
solar facilities to solve the cooking fuel problems, and encourage
farmers to open up uncultivated land.
</P>
<P>
The regualations also ask units engaging in exploration and
mining in the basin to put equal emphasis on the development of
resources and ecological protection.
</P>
<P>
With an area of 250,000 kilometers, the Qaidam Basin takes 80
percent of the landspace of Haixi Prefecture and 35 percent of
this is desert area.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1950s, natural plants have been damaged on a large
scale with the development of the basin, and the building of the
Qinghai-Tibet highway and railway. Desertation has been extending
by 660,000 hectares annually in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
For the sustained development of Qaidam, the local government
pledged to grow 660,000 hectares of desert plants by the end of
this century.

<HEADLINE> Efforts Stepped Up at WTO Meeting to Solve Disputed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Efforts have been beefed up
at the first Ministerial Conference of the World Trade
Organization (WTO) to bridge the differences over the disputed
issues such as labor standards.
</P>
<P>
As the plenary session continues, heads of the delegations
have entered the closed-door meetings in a bid to solve the
so-called "new issues", over which the developed and developing
nations have remained widely divided, a high-ranking official, who
asked not to be identified, told Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
"It seems that North and South still differ widely over the
issues of labor standards and the Information Technology Agreement
(ITA)," the official said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Singapore Minister for Trade and Industry
Yeo Cheow Tong Monday afternoon canceled all the scheduled
meetings with his counterparts of many nations participating in
the Singapore conference to host the closed-door meetings.
</P>
<P>
Some Western nations including the United States want to link
the labor standards with trade at the WTO Ministerial Conference
which opened here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
This has met strong opposition from the developing nations
including India, Malaysia, Pakistan and Thailand, which argue that
the issue of labor standards is not relevant to trade and the
Singapore conference is not the right place to discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
The developing countries also fear that the West uses the issue
as a disguised protectionist barrier and that the West move would
weaken the comparably competitive advantage of their exports.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that if the gap between North and South
remains wide as it is, it is not that easy for parties concerned
to reach consensus on the issue unless compromises are made.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, U.S. Defense Ministers Hold Talks (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Defense Minister Chi
Haotian held talks with U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry
today, exchanging views on relations between their two countries
and two armed forces and international and Asia-Pacific regional
issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
Chi, who is also vice-chairman of the Central Military
Commission of China and state councillor, said that as China and
the United States are two countries with significant influence in
the world, they share responsibilities in maintaining peace and
stability in the Asia-Pacific region and other parts of the world,
and in promoting prosperity in the world and the region.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Sino-U.S. relations have made positive
progress recently thanks to joint efforts by the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese general described the meeting between Chinese
President Jiang Zemin and U.S. President Bill Clinton in Manila
last month as significant in serving as a link between the past
and the future, giving a strong impetus to the improvement and
development of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Chi said that the principles set by the three Sino-U.S. Joint
Communiques, particularly the mutual respect of sovereignty and
territorial integrity and non-interference in each other's
internal affairs, are the basis of the relations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese government is willing to work together
with the U.S. government on the basis of increasing trust,
reducing troubles, developing cooperation and avoiding
confrontation so as to bring a stable and healthy
Sino-U.S. relationship into the 21st century, which conforms to
the fundamental interests of the two peoples and the people in the
world.
</P>
<P>
Chi stressed that the core of the Sino-U.S. relations is the
issue of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the issue is a major matter of principle because
it is related to China's sovereignty, territorial integrity and
the unification of China, and involves the national feeling of the
Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that China hopes that the U.S. side would
keep its commitment, not carry out exchanges and contacts with
official nature with Taiwan, and stop selling Taiwan advanced
weapons and military equipment, so as to eliminate obstacles that
prevent the improvement and development of the Sino-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
Chi added that the Sino-U.S. dialogue on global security and
prevention of proliferation includes the issue of U.S. arms sale
to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Perry said the U.S. government attaches great importance to the
U.S.-Chinese relations and Chi's visit to the United States, and
it also believes that the two countries share many important
interests.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government pursues a policy of engagement with China
because the policy is in the interests of the United States and
also in the interests of the countries in the Asia-Pacific region,
the U.S. defense secretary said.
</P>
<P>
Perry said the U.S. government abides by the principles set by
three Joint Communiques between the two countries, and pursues a
"one-China" policy.
</P>
<P>
He said that recalling the process of the U.S.-Chinese
relations, the United States is more aware of the importance of
enhancing mutual understanding.
</P>
<P>
He said that in order to promote the development of relations
between the two countries, both sides should seek the current
opportunity, increase consultation, broaden common understanding
and strive to expand cooperation in various fields.
</P>
<P>
With regard to relations between the two armed forces, Chi said
the Chinese side is willing to have contact and dialogue with the
U.S. armed forces on the basis of equality, mutual benefit and
mutual respect.
</P>
<P>
Chi said that military relations are an important part of
relations between the two countries, and the development of such
relations should be in conformity with the development of
bilateral relations as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The exchange between the two armed forces should be carried out
step by step in a planned way, he added.
</P>
<P>
Perry said the U.S. side eagerly hopes to develop exchanges and
contacts between the two armed forces, because it is beneficial to
the promotion of development of the entire bilateral
relations. The U.S. side hopes to deepen the discussion on this
issue with the Chinese side.

BANGKOK, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Thailand paid out a record
125.59 billion bhat (5.02 billion US dollars) for imports in the

for energy, according to the Petroleum Authority of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The bill represented a 44 percent jump, or 38.27 billion baht
(1.52 billion US dollars), over the same period of last year with
the volume of total oil imports up by 24.5 percent to 784,520
barrels per day.
</P>
<P>

<P>
The significant increase in the value of crude and refined oil
product imports came in the wake of opening two new oil refineries

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government is
actively contemplating establishment of "grameen (village) court"
to ensure social justice in the rural community, according to
official sources today.
</P>
<P>
The sources quoted State Minister for Law Abdul Matin Khasru as
saying that the proposed "grameen court" would be a new concept
unlike the traditional village settlement committee on village
court and such courts based in Thana (local authorities below
district) headquarters would have legal sanction and visit
villages regularly to bring in judiciary at the doorsteps of the
rural masses.
</P>
<P>
It was proposed that the grameen court would preferably be
headed by a retired magistrate with school teachers and other
elderly members of rural community as its members.
</P>
<P>
The state minister confirmed the government plan, explaining
that most of the cases involving the rural community do not have
merit to be sent to the existing Thana courts and cases involving
small thefts or dowry cases or other family disputes when sent to
the Thana courts do not bring any good to the disputed parties.

WARSAW, December 9 (Xinhua) -- More than 40 percent of Polish
families would like to have one child, according to a report by
the Polish Statistics Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The report confirms findings by a Polish magazine "Wprost"
which said recently that the number of Polish people who want to
have one child has increased fourfold over the last 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The magazine said that the "two plus one" model has become the
most popular family form in Poland.
</P>
<P>
The "one-child atmosphere" has emerged because young couples
fear more children would involve losing their freedom and lower
living standards or even lead to poverty.
</P>
<P>
Polish demographers predict that if the number of couples
without children or with one child continues to increase, Poland
will see negative population growth.

<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Similar local customs, dialects
and geographical environments and different development stages
have made Hainan and Taiwan provinces a complementary and
mutually-beneficial economic partner to each other.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation between the two sides started in the mid-80s and
entered into fast growth in 1988, the year Hainan was promoted to
the administrative status of a province.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has much to offer, both technologically and financially,
and is facing a severe shortage of labor. Meanwhile, Hainan is
rich in resources and labor but lacking funds and technology.
</P>
<P>
In the early years, most Taiwan-based investors poured their
funds into Hainan's booming real estate and recreational
businesses, but in recent years, agriculture has become the main
attraction for investment from Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The 600,000 ha. of uncultivated land in Hainan have drawn a
large number of investors from Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan businessmen involved in farming in Hainan have soon
found it very profitable.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan-funded farm projects have been engaged in developing
seeds and seedlings, planting of flowers, fruits and vegetables,
raising of fowls and aquatic products, as well as farm-products
processing, and farm technical training.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, by the end of October this year,
Taiwan investors have set up over 1,100 enterprises in Hainan,
with a total contractual investment exceeding 1.2 billion US
dollars.

BUENOS AIRES, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Argentine exports will
total 24 billion U.S. dollars by the end of 1996, Industry, Trade

</P>
<P>
Exports in the August-October quarter rose 25 percent over the

He said that Argentine exports have been growing at a world
record-breaking rate of 150 percent over the past 10 years,
comparable to the most successful countries in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Imports are expected to increase tremendously in 1997 due to
more rigorous economic performance and an influx of direct
investments in industry, mining, energy and services which will
reach five billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
More imports may bring about a greater trade deficit next year,

HONG KONG, December 10 (Xinhua) -- A donor agreement with

Under the scheme between the Hospital Authority of Hong Kong

other with organs when they do not have a matching patient
locally, the English daily said.
</P>
<P>
The organs can be flown from Singapore within 10 hours. Cathay
Pacific will transport them on the first possible flight as the
organs cannot be stored for more than 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
The service, which started in October, has not been used but
could help save lives in both places where the number of donors is
small, the paper added.

Figures from the authority showed that about 100 people are
awaiting liver transplants, but there were only nine donations up

<P>
BUDAPEST, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Hungarian Defense Minister
Gyorgy Keleti said today that he supported the plan of Central
European countries for jointly purchasing fighter planes.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Keleti said he personally backed
the idea of jointly purchasing fighter jets by Hungary, Poland and
The Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
The plan could include Austria and Slovenia, though the two
countries need a smaller number of fighters, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Keleti, the Central European countries will buy
about 200 to 220 fighter planes.
</P>
<P>
He added that the proposed plan could reduce cost and help
promote cooperation in areas such as pilot training and technical
maintenance among those countries.
</P>
<P>
Major western fighter planes, including Swedish-made Saab
Gripens, French Mirages and American F-16s and F-18s, have been
exhibited in many Central European countries in recent years amid
intense competition for a market share in this region.
</P>
<P>
So far, the Hungarian Government has signed letters of intent
with Saab Gripen manufacturer on investment and U.S. F-18
manufacturer on production cooperation, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Keleti said Hungary will not make a final decision on the
fighter purchase program until the end of next year.

MANILA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Total investments in the
Philippines declined sharply to 97.11 billion pesos (3.7 billion
U.S. dollars) in the first nine months this year, down 37.5
percent from 155.4 billion pesos (5.9 billion dollars) in the
corresponding period last year.
</P>
<P>
Official data showed that the huge decline was due to the lack

which pumped up last year's investment record.

The Philippine Economic Zone Authority and the Subic Bay
Metropolitan Authority, on the other hand, showed an upswing trend
in investment generation. Their investments increased by 16
percent and 55 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Investments from the Clark Development Corp. dropped by six
percent in the January-September period.
</P>
<P>
The four government agencies are targeting to corner up to 380

BEIJING, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The China National Light
Industry Council has outlined a five-year plan to greatly reduce
the pollutant discharge volume from the light industry, one of the
major pollution sources of the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, China's light industrial plants will not
be permitted to increase the pollutant discharge volume when
expanding production, and the whole industry should meet the state
pollutant discharge limit no later than 2000.
</P>
<P>
At present, such light industrial sectors as paper making,
food, ferment materials and leather processing are the biggest
producers of industrial waste.
</P>
<P>
The council will accelerate the promotion of anti-pollution
technologies, and control serious pollution sources.
</P>
<P>
During the next five years, the council will give priority to
pollution treating projects in the basins of the Huaihe, Haihe and
Liaohe river valleys, and around the Taihu, Chaohu and Tianchi
lakes.
</P>
<P>
The council will keep a close eye on paper pulp making, food
fermenting and leather tanning plants.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 9 (Xinhua) -- A special Belgian
parliamentary commission has decided to drop the main charge
against Deputy Prime Minister Elio di Rupo that he had sex with a
minor, a Belgian television reported this evening.
</P>
<P>
The TV report said that a confidential report submitted to
parliament by the country's supreme court concluded that the
request for Elio Rupo to be indicted on this charge should be
rejected for lack of solid evidence.
</P>
<P>
Elio Rupo was charged in mid-November that he had had sex with
Oliver Trusgnach, a 15-year-old boy. This sparked demands from
the opposition parties for his resignation.
</P>
<P>
On November 21, the Belgian parliament authorized the supreme
court to investigate the allegations and submit a report to the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
According to Belgian laws, indictments against cabinet
ministers must have the approval from parliament.
</P>
<P>
The special parliamentary commission said, however, that new
evidences concerning other allegations would be examined later,
but did not reveal the contents.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Won't Sign Pact Against Charter Change Drive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Presidential
Palace has stated that it was unnecessary for President Fidel
Ramos to sign any written covenant opposing the present drive to
amend the charter since he has repeated he would not seek a second
term, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The palace made this statement when an anti-charter change
group asked Ramos to sign a manifesto on Monday to prove that he
is not behind the new drive to seek re-election as his term ends
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
"We are convinced that by keeping silent on this issue, it will
be enough to discourage the proponents (of the amendment
campaign)," the palace said.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Representative Teresa Aquino-Oreta,
sister-in-law of former President Corazon Aquino, announced the
start of a drive against the constitutional amendment campaigns
which were conducted by two private groups in the country.
</P>
<P>
Aquino-Oreta said she and other lawmakers are starting a
parallel signature campaign at the grassroots level against the
charter change.
</P>
<P>
Local press also reported today that the plan of launching a
people's initiative to alter the charter was hatched by officials
of the ruling LAKAS-NUCD party in a series of meetings held in the
Presidential Palace from 1993 up to early 1995.
</P>
<P>
Quoting a source present at some of the meetings, the report
said the signature campaign was, in fact, part of an elaborate
plot to amend the charter and extend the Ramos presidency beyond
1998.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: Asian Economy to Remain Healthy in 1997  by Chen Hegao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Despite a sharp decline in
exports, the Asian economy maintained its steady growth in 1996
and economists predicted that the region's economic growth will
stay on its healthy course in 1997.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest forecast by economists of the Asian
Development Bank (ADB), the average growth rate for the developing
Asian region is expected to decline marginally in 1996. From 8.3
percent in 1994, the growth rate dropped to 7.9 percent in 1995
and is likely to fall further to 7.3 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the average growth rate is projected at 7.3 percent,
the same as in 1996.
</P>
<P>
However, with growth rates of more than 7 percent per annum for
1996 and 1997, Asia is still far ahead of the other regions in
terms of economic growth and remains the world's fastest growing
region.
</P>
<P>
The slowdown in Asia's economic growth in 1996 can be
attributed largely to the deceleration of exports growth
throughout the region, from an average 28 percent for the first
six months of 1995 to 7 percent for the same 1996 period.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, the inventory overhang has
caused a slump in global demand for electronics, semiconductors
and computer-related products. The slump, coupled with oversupply
in the sector, has brought about a sharp fall in the prices of
electronics and related products.
</P>
<P>
The slower growth in exports has affected the "four tigers" in
the region -- Singapore, South Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan, which
largely depend on exports of semiconductors and electronics. The
growth of these newly industrializing economies is expected to
decline to 6.2 percent in 1996 from 7.4 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Economic analysts also attributed part of the economic slowdown
in Asia to a growing dependency on intra-regional trade. During
the past few years, the same trend has been celebrated as a major
reason for Asia's success, as the region now relies far less on
the ups and downs of the slower-growing developed world.
</P>
<P>
But as many economies in Southeast Asia became so overheated in
the past few years, governments have tightened credit this year to
discourage imports. As a result, export expansion within Asia
plummeted from 42 percent in the first quarter of 1995 to just 7
percent a year later.
</P>
<P>
Because of the deceleration of export growth and the associated
weakening of trade, the current account trade deficit for Asia is
projected to deteriorate substantially this year.
</P>
<P>
The surplus of the newly industrializing economies will decline
from 12.8 billion U.S. dollars in 1995 to 4 billion dollars in
1996, primarily as a result of a considerable deterioration of the
deficit of South Korea and small declines in the surpluses of
Singapore and Taiwan, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
In Southeast Asia, the current account deficit is forecast to
increase from 32 billion dollars in 1995 to 36 billion dollars in
1996 and 1997 respectively, due largely to the ballooning trade
deficits of Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The South Asian economies will also experience an increase in
their current account and trade deficit.
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, judging by the recent stabilization of orders and
the rise in book-to-bill ratio, the dramatic inventory correction
in the semiconductors, electronics and computer-related industries
that began in early 1996 seems to be coming to an end, ADB
economists said.
</P>
<P>
A recovery for export growth is expected by the end of the
first quarter of 1997. For most of the countries whose slowdown in
exports is mainly a result of cyclical events rather than
structural problems, a resurgence of export growth will take place
next year.
</P>
<P>
However, that recovery will take more time in countries where
structural problems have contributed to slower growth, such as
South Korea and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Based on Asia's recent economic performance, economists
predicted the region can expect an average growth rate of 7.3
percent in 1996 and 1997. Combined with falling

<HEADLINE> World Bank Loan Helps Control Soil Erosion on Loess Plateau </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Using a loan totaling 37
million US dollars from the World Bank, seven counties in north
China's Shanxi Province have been working hard to curb soil
erosion on the Loess Plateau.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the bank were happy with the success of the
project, started in 1994, saying that it is one of the most
successful projects funded by the World Bank in the world.
</P>
<P>
The project, being very important with the harness of the
Yellow river, the most muddy in the world, has also been given 209
million yuan in domestic accompanying loans.
</P>
<P>
An official in charge of the project said that by the year 2001
when the project completes, the green coverage rate of those seven
counties, with a combined landspace of 5,052 sq km, will reach 33
percent, up 13 percent from the figure in 1994.
</P>
<P>
As a result, he said, the total volume of silt flowing into the
Yellow river is to drop by six million tons annually.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the official said, the average annual income of the
local peasants is expected to reach 800 yuan, up from 300 yuan at
present. This means they will then live above the poverty line.
</P>
<P>
He added that by the end of June this year, the province had
planted over 10,000 ha of cash trees and shelter-forests.

JAKARTA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia has urged the
Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) to actively promote
economic cooperation among its members as the organization is

</P>
<P>
South-South economic cooperation should be given special
attention, Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas told his Iranian

"Basically, the OIC is quite equipped to carry out economic and
technical cooperation, but economic and trade cooperation among
its member countries is in reality still low," he noted.
</P>
<P>
However, Indonesia's call for promoting economic cooperation
does not mean that it is giving a secondary priority to politics,
Alatas stressed.
</P>

The 24th OIC foreign ministers meeting was opened Monday by
Indonesian President Soeharto and is attended by delegates from

<HEADLINE> IOC Evaluation Team Praises Cape Town's Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 9 (Xinhua) -- An International Olympic
Committee evaluation team praised the South African government for
backing Cape Town's bid to be the first African city to host the
2004 Olympic Summer Games.
</P>
<P>
"The committee appreciates the support lent to the candidature
by the different levels of government," Thomas Bach, head of the
19-member delegation told a media briefing at the end of their
three-day visit to Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
President Nelson Mandela's government has given its full
support to the bid and during a meeting Saturday, Mandela
personally appealed to the delegation to give Africa a chance to
host the event, saying it would be "good for the spirit of the
Olympic movement."
</P>
<P>
Bach, speaking guardedly about the IOC's view of Cape Town's
ability to host the games, said Monday the IOC had taken note of
the city's "detailed analysis and planning" for transport during
the games.
</P>
<P>
The former German fencing gold-medalist, however, declined to
say whether these factors gave Cape Town the edge over the other
10 cities bidding for the games.
</P>
<P>
Cape Town was the last stop for the IOC team on their world
tour of the nine candidates, including Buenos Aires, Rio de
Janeiro and San Juan in Latin America and Seville, Lille,
Stockholm, Rome, Athens, and St Petersburg in Europe and Istanbul
in Asia.
</P>
<P>
In March a short list of four or five cities will be drawn up
by a selection college, and the final selection will be made in
Lausanne in September by the full International Olympic
Committee.

WASHINGTON, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The FBI on Monday offered a

In early September, Justice Department officials said
investigators had several suspects but did not identify them.

<HEADLINE> Night Tours Popular in Guangzhou </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, December 10 (Xinhua) -- A new tourist program --
night tours around this booming South China metropolis -- has been
becoming increasingly popular.
</P>
<P>
The new tours have quickly caught the fancy of local residents
as well as visitors from outside the city.
</P>
<P>
The service was initiated at the end of October by the Guangzhou
Ocean Travel Agency.
</P>
<P>
Yang Dezhen, the travel agency's manager, said the city's busy
and diversified night life gives night tours a freshness that day
tours lack. Besides, night tours give an air of mystery to the
city's scenic spots.
</P>
<P>
The tours offer visitors a trip around the city, a glimpse of
its night life, night scenes on the Pearl River that flows through
Guangzhou and lanes crisscrossing the city, as well as
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
Explaining his preference for the tours, one traveler said that
as big cities are prone to have congested traffic and unclean air
in the daytime, night tours, with cleaner air, and less traffic and
noise, offer a refreshing alternative.

<HEADLINE> Travel Service Leads Market Trend in Guangzhou </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The Guangzhou Travel Agency
(GTA) has become one of the most successful businesses in the
travel industry in this capital of south China's Guangdong
province.
</P>
<P>
The agency has been leading market trends since it was founded
16 years ago.
</P>
<P>
It was the first to launch tours to the Shenzhen and Zhuhai
special economic zones back in 1984. It started tours to Macao the
same year.
</P>
<P>
When overseas tours began to become popular in the country in
the late 1980s, it started to organize tours to Thailand in 1987.
Six years later, it launched non-stop flight tours to Thailand
when non-stop flight was initiated between Guangdong and Hong
Kong in 1994, and set the record of organizing nearly 1,000
domestic tourists to overseas destinations within one week.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, it opened new tourism routes to Australia and South
Korea. Earlier this year, it began to organize tours to the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
GTA's success should also be attributed to the importance it
attaches to service quality. In June 1994, it became the first
in the country to set up the service quality guarantee fund.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, it achieved another No. 1 in the tourism industry by
introducing the CI (corporate identity) system. Its image of
"sunshine, flowers and open fields " has become a popular symbol
among tourists.

<HEADLINE> Brazilian Textile Imports to Hit 2.3 Billion Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Brazil is expected to import
more than 2.3 billion U.S. dollars worth of textile products in
1996, the Sao Paulo Textile Union said today.
</P>
<P>
Brazil increased its purchase of clothing by 100 percent and
woven fabrics by 60 percent in the second half of 1996, compared
with the first six months of the year.
</P>
<P>
Union sources attributed the increase of textile imports to low
prices and the lack of financing for local production.
</P>
<P>
The union said nearly 70 percent of these imports come from
Asia.
</P>
<P>
Brazil's textile industry will close the year with a trade
deficit of one billion dollars, since its exports is expected to
bring home only about 1.3 billion dollars in 1996, according to
the union.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council has decided to start Tuesday afternoon straw polls for
the election of a candidate for the U.N. secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after a closed-door meeting today,
Council President Francesco Fulci said that since there were no
other nominations, the council will start from the four persons
that have been officially nominated for the post.
</P>
<P>
The four candidates are Kofi Annan of Ghana, U.N.
under-secretary-general in charge of peacekeeping operations;
Foreign Minister Amara Essy of the Ivory Coast; Ahmedou Ould
Abdallah of Mauritania, a former U.N. special envoy for Burundi;
and Hamid Algabid of Niger, secretary general of the Organization
of the Islamic Conference.
</P>
<P>
The sitting U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali
announced on December 4 that he suspends his candidacy for the
second term while he waits to see how much strength other Africans
can muster within the 15-nation council.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that he is not withdrawing his bid for the
post. And U.N. spokesman Sylvana Foa said Boutros-Ghali will join
others in competing for the post when the situation is clarified.
</P>
<P>
When the council took its first poll on November 19, 14 out of
the 15 members voted to give Boutros-Ghali a second five-year
term. But his selection was blocked by the United States, which
considers him insufficiently committed to reform of the world
body.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Left Condemns Violence in Opposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The leftist political party
Yugoslav United Left (JUL) condemned today the opposition
coalition Zajedno (Together) for organizing "street demonstrations
accompanied with violence and terrorism that undermine the
security of the citizens of Belgrade."
</P>
<P>
"The protests have caused damage, are tarnishing the reputation
of the country and are obstructing production," the JUL's Belgrade
City Council said in a satement.
</P>
<P>
The JUL comprised the left coalition with the ruling Socialist
Party of Serbia (SPS) and New Democracy (ND). The left coalition
won the majority at the recent parliamentary elections for the
federal parliament and in most municipalities for local
authorities in the Yugoslav Republic of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
But Zajedno claimed victory in the second round of elections
for local authorities on November 17 and protested against the
decision to annul the result due to irregularities in the voting.
Zajedno has been staging demonstrations over the past three weeks,
calling on the supreme court to reconsider its ruling and
recognize the elections results.
</P>
<P>
The JUL's Belgrade board firmly condemned the manipulation by
Zajedno of children and young people, "that has become evident
during the protests and is demanding energetically from state
organs to undertake measures in order to protect the children,"
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The JUL said, "The attempted devaluation and destruction of the
entire legal system and courts in the country is part of the
destabilization of the country." "That is why the JUL is calling
on all patriotic forces in the country and in Belgrade to resist
energetically such intentions," it said.
</P>
<P>
It said the basic interest of all citizens in Belgrade was
production, work and income, that will guarantee the social
stability of the employed and others living from their incomes.
</P>
<P>
"The will of the citizens reflects the general social interest,
and it is reflected in the program of the left -- peace, security,
rule of law and economic prosperity," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrations continued today, with tens of thousands of
Belgraders, including university students, marched through
downtown Belgrade peacefully.

LONDON, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Leading stock markets in Europe

British shares clawed back 48.6 points on the FTSE 100 index to

Dealers said that Wall Street's resilience and firmer bond
markets helped the stock market to recover considerably from last
week's tumble.

dollar which will benefit German exports. The DAX-30 share index
ended 65.28 points higher at 2,857.24, recouping more than half of
Friday's losses.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Juppe to Sell Thomson in Two Phases: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 9 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Alain Juppe
said today that he will sell the debt-burdened state enterprise
Thomson SA in two phases: first to the Lagardere group, and then
to an undecided French or European group.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the British newspaper Financial Times,
Juppe said that the defense section of Thomson, Thomson CSF, will
most likely be sold to the Lagardere group, which will merge it
with its Matra Defense Espace corporation to build one of the
largest defense industrial enterprises in the world.
</P>
<P>
The civilian part of the electronic giant, Thomson Multimedia
(TMM), will be sold in a second phase later, he said.
</P>
<P>
The French government has canceled a decision to sell the whole
body of Thomson SA to Lagardere, due to opposition from domestic
public opinions to Lagardere's decision to sell the TMM to South
Korea's Daewoo Electronics.
</P>
<P>
"The industrial logic of bringing together the Thomson CSF and
the Lagardere group is not disputed by anyone (in France)," said
Juppe in the interview with the British newspaper, seen here
today.
</P>
<P>
President Jacques Chirac, who will address the nation Thursday
evening on television, will talk about the problem of
privatization of Thomson SA, said local media reports.
</P>
<P>
The decision to suspend the privatization of Thomson by the
French government has been strongly criticized by South Korea, as
well as the news media of Britain and the United States, who
described it as a blow to the image of France in the eyes of
international investors.

<HEADLINE> Deadline for Resolving Brcko Status Postponed to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The arbitration commission for
Brcko has postponed the deadline for deciding on the town's status
to February 15, 1997, U.S. mediator Roberts Owen said today in
Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
Under the Dayton peace agreement, this deadline had been set
for December 14, 1996, one year after the peace deal was signed in
Paris. But Owen explained the deadline cannot be met due to
opposed stances of the parties to the dispute -- Republika Srpska
and the Muslim-Croat Federation.
</P>
<P>
The Tanjug news agency reported that after Republika Srpska
representative Vitohir Popovic withdrew from the tripartite
commission earlier this month, the commission decided to postpone
the deadline by two months. The commission is made up of
representatives of the two entities in Bosnia and of the
international community.
</P>
<P>
So far, negotiators have made no significant progress on Brcko,
which is located in the narrowest part of the corridor in
northeastern Bosnia which links the eastern and northwestern parts
of the Serb republic.
</P>
<P>
As the status of Brcko was not defined by the Dayton agreement,
Republika Srpska demands that the town remain part of its
territory.
</P>
<P>
The Serbs cannot agree to Brcko being taken away, not can it
accept international administration for the town, Serb member of
Bosnia's collective presidency Momcilo Krajisnik stressed last
Saturday.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Year 1996 Sees Record Air Crash Death Toll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, December 9 (Xinhua) -- A total of 1,187 passengers
have been killed on commercial jet flights worldwide this year,
which represents a record crash death toll compared with any other
year, the New York Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The figure excludes the deaths from terrorist acts and from
crashes of long-troubled Soviet-built planes, the newspaper said
quoting Airclaims, a London-based company that collects accident
data.
</P>
<P>
This year's high death toll is attributable in part to the
continuing rapid increase in the number of flights worldwide. But
aviation experts are also focusing on the archaic safety system
and often inadequate trained pilots, mechanics and air traffic
controllers of less-developed regions of the world. Experts say
that regions with the biggest rise in air traffic have the most
problematic air traffic control equipment and personnel.
</P>
<P>
Apart from these, experts note, language gap plays role in
hundreds of air deaths. By treaty, controllers and pilots in
international aviation, are all supposed to speak English, but
hundreds of passengers and crew members have died in crashes that
were caused by language problems.
</P>
<P>
If the current accident rate remains steady and air travel
continues to grow rapidly, the experts warn, a passenger plane may
crash as often as once a week.
</P>
<P>
However, the experts are of the opinion that even with the high
death toll this year, flying remains the safety mode of travel.

<HEADLINE> FBI Offers 500,000 Dlr Reward for Atlanta Bomber </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 9 (Xinhua) -- More than four months after
the Olympic Centennial Park bombing in Atlanta, the U.S. Federal
Bureau of Investigation (FBI) today offered 500,000 U.S. dollars
reward for information leading to the arrest of the bomber or
bombers.
</P>
<P>
The FBI displayed a replica of the knapsack that contained the
bomb, and asked for photographs, videotapes or information that
helps catch the person who planted the July 27 bomb that killed
two people and injured more than 100 others.
</P>
<P>
The FBI also made public the tape recording of a telephone
warning police of the bomb just before it went off, and asked the
public for help in identifying the voice of the man.
</P>
<P>
"We've made a lot of progress in this investigation, but we
still continue to seek the public's assistance," FBI Deputy
Director Weldon Kennedy told a news conference in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
"We firmly believe somewhere, someone has a photograph" of
the bomb being carried into the park, Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
Kennedy said the bomb was heavy, more than 40 pounds, and was
carried in a green, Army-style knapsack, which was left beneath a
bench next to a sound tower in the park.
</P>
<P>
Kennedy said it was possible for one person to have planted the
bomb and made the 911 phone call.
</P>
<P>
The only named suspect, security guard Richard Jewell who first
reported the knapsack to officers, was cleared on October 26 after
nearly three months of investigation.

<HEADLINE> US Says Oil Deal Does Not Signal End of Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The United States said today
that U.N. authorization of the oil-for-food deal does not mean to
end a tough sanctions regime against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"This does not signal an end or the first step toward the end
of the sanctions regime against Iraq, against Saddam Hussein's
regime," State Department deputy spokesman Glyn Davies told
reporters at a briefing.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has allowed Iraq to sell 2 billion U.S.
dollars in oil for a six-month period, and the proceeds will be
deposited in a U.N. escrow account in New York for use by the
world body to buy food and medicine for Iraqi civilians to
alleviate the burden of U.N. imposed economic sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The oil-for-food deal was approved in May but held up by
disputes over implementations.
</P>
<P>
Davies said that the oil-for-food deal was a "positive
development." But "it is and has been all along a humanitarian
exception to what is... a necessary and vigorous sanctions
regime," he added.

<HEADLINE> Jerry Rawlings Ahead in Ghana Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Ghananian President Jerry
Rawlings and his National Democratic Congress (NDC) still keep
ahead of his rivals in the west African country's presidential
and parliamentary elections on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A TV report monitered here today said that of the one-third of
the 200 constituencies where the results have been released,
Jerry Rawlings got 54 percent of the votes, while his main rival
John Kufuor of the New Patriotic Party got 42 percent.
</P>
<P>
Edward Mahama, the third candiate was a distant third.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts pointed out that Rawling's lead may not turn
out to be as big as expected, implying the possibility of a
second round of election, if neither of the candidates gets more
than 50 percent of the overall votes.
</P>
<P>
Rawling's NDC also took the lead in the parliamentary election
by taking 22 seats, compared with the NPP 's 15 seats. Mahama's
People's National Convention had none, according to a report
reaching here earlier today. enditem

<HEADLINE> Roundup: GCC States Determined to Broaden </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DOHA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The 17th Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC) summit concluded here this afternoon, with leaders
of the member states affirming their will to push forward the
cooperation drive toward broader horizons to meet the ambitions
and aspirations of the GCC peoples.
</P>
<P>
The final communique issued after the three-day summit said
the GCC leaders reviewed the accomplishments of the GCC march in
the political, military, economic and cultural domains.
</P>
<P>
It reiterated the GCC states' coordinated stances toward the
Middle East peace process, slashing out at Israel's hardline
policy and giving full support to the Palestinian, Syrian and
Lebanese people's efforts to restore the lands occupied by the
Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
The GCC leaders also reaffirmed their stances toward Iraq
that invaded Kuwait in August 1990 and was driven out of it in
February 1991. They again expressed deep sorrow for Iran's
refraining from solving properly its conflict with the United
Arab Emirates (UAE) over three islands, the Greater and Lesser
Tunbs and Abu Musa, which they said "belong to the UAE."
</P>
<P>
The GCC leaders gave spotlight to economic cooperation,
calling for closer ties in this field and liberalizing their
economies.
</P>
<P>
Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad Ben Khalifa al Thani, who chaired
the summit, said in his opening speech Saturday that the GCC
member states must liberalize their trading environments and
undo policies that protect their national products, because the
modern world is moving fast to put an end to all restrictions
and barriers to effect complete merger.
</P>
<P>
The GCC leaders decided to gradually unify customs tariffs
among the member states and adopted a number of decisions to
this effect.
</P>
<P>
The communique said the GCC leaders approved a recommendation
concerning military cooperation and raising the standard of the
defensive capability of the GCC states.
</P>
<P>
They also approved a proposed formula for the common
agricultural policy among the member states.
</P>
<P>
In addition, they decided to strengthen cooperation in the
mass media domain so as to help unify the Gulf ranks.
</P>
<P>
The final communique also reiterated the GCC's denunciation
and rejection of extremism, violence and terrorism in the world,
calling for coordinated international efforts to fight all acts
and forms of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The GCC leaders devoted a paragraph in the final communique
to express appreciation for the European efforts concerning the
Middle East peace process, especially the efforts exerted by
French President Jacques Chirac.
</P>
<P>
Western European countries, Britain and France in particular,
have strong traditional ties with Gulf countries. Chirac toured
the Gulf area this year, and recently Britain clinched a 820
million U.S. dollars worth of weapons supply deal with Qatar.
</P>
<P>
The GCC groups Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and
the UAE.
</P>
<P>
Although the GCC states still have divergent views on this or
that matter, they have managed to seek common grounds on major
issues while maintaining differences on minor ones.
</P>
<P>
Only five countries attended the summit. Bahrain refused to
participate because of a long-standing dispute with host Qatar
over the Hawar Islands and sandbanks in the area.
</P>
<P>
The GCC states also differed on whether allowing Yemen to join
the organization.
</P>
<P>
They disagreed on the extent and speed by which they will
unify their customs tariffs. They also have differences on the
expansion of their joint defense troops, the "Peninsula Sheild"
forces.
</P>
<P>
In spite of all these differences, they have coordinated
their stances in face of the challenging world situation.
