<HEADLINE> Nigerians Conclude Strike Against Petrol Price Hike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian trade union leaders Tuesday
called off a crippling general strike after they reached an
agreement with the government over the petrol price, which was
increased earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
A statement by the Nigerian Labor Congress (NLC) in Lagos said
the increases for petrol and other fuels would be restricted to
about 10 percent, and it called on workers to resume work
immediately.
</P>
<P>
The government had originally imposed a 50-percent increase,
causing the five-day strike, which nearly paralyzed the Africa's
largest oil producing country.
</P>
<P>
The new agreement pegs the prices of petrol (per liter) from 30
naira to 22 naira (100 naira is equal to one U.S. dollar), diesel
from 29 naira to 21 naira and kerosene from 27 naira to 17 naira.
</P>
<P>
The deal comes a day after Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo
 apologized for not consulting widely enough on the increase in
fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on behalf of the president, Information Minister Jerry
Gana Monday in Abuja told leaders of the Nigeria Labor Congress
that the government had made mistakes over the fuel price issue.
</P>
<P>
"The president wishes to apologize to the NLC for not
consulting enough before the price increase," Gana said.

<HEADLINE> Lull in Fighting Between Ethiopia, Eritrea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- There was no fighting between
Ethiopia and Eritrea along the 1,000-kilometer border Tuesday, the
Ethiopian government spokesperson's office said.
</P>
<P>
This is the first whole day of pause in fighting since the two
Horn of Africa countries started a new round of battle on May 12
in the two-year border conflict.
</P>
<P>
The office said that Eritrean troops have become "extremely
weakened and debilitated" under Ethiopian offensives.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea accepted an agreement on cessation of hostilities
proposed by the Organization of African Unity at the indirect
talks between the two countries in Algiers last week. Ethiopia is
also expected to make an official response to the agreement later
this week.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Rallies for Dramatic 3-3 Tie with Slovenia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Downing at 0-3 and 10 men in the
second half, Yugoslavia fought back strongly to produced one of
the all-time great comebacks to tie with Slovenia 3-0 in group C
at the 2000 European Championship in Charleroi of Bulgium.
</P>
<P>
Slovenia made their first appearance in European championship
led 3-0 surprisingly after an hour as star striker Zlatko Zahovic
scored two and made another.
</P>
<P>
But after Sinisa Mihajlovic was sent off the Yugoslavs poured
forward with substitute Savo Milosevic scoring two, either side of
a goal by Ljubinko Drulovic.
</P>
<P>
Zahovic, already a national hero after his 10 goals in
qualifying took Slovenia to their first ever finals, stooped to
head home a curling Amir Karic cross in the 23rd minute.
</P>
<P>
But the Yugoslavs took their turn in a six-minute magic spell
and one that will go down in their history for all the right
reasons.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic scrambled one back in the 67th minute and then
Predrag Mijatovic, previously anonymous, cut in on the left and
laid the ball into the path of Drulovic to drive home a second.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslavs were suddenly full of running and Drulovic
reached the byline on the right before rolling the ball across for
Milosevic to tap home his second from point-blank range.
</P>
<P>
They looked the more likely side to grab a winner but the match
ended with honors even.
</P>
<P>
"Losing the victory after leading 3-0 show that we need some
more experience in such situations," said Slovenia coach srecko
Katanec after the 3-3 draw. "Against stars like that you shouldn't
ease your pace not even for a moment even if they have only 10 men.
"
</P>
<P>
"But we still satisfied, hats off to my boys. They had an
extremely good 70 minutes of the match." he added.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian King, Bahraini Emir Meets on Ties, Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Bilateral ties dominated talks
between Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein and visiting Bahraini
Emir Sheikh Hamad Bin Isa Al-Khalifa in Jordan's southern port of
Aqaba on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, King Abdullah expressed his satisfaction over
his personal relations with the visiting emir and the status quo of
ties between the two countries, Jordan's official news agency Petra
reported.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also reviewed developments of the Arab-Israeli
peace process and stressed the need for a just, durable and
comprehensive peace in the region, Petra said without elaborating.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Hamad arrived in Aqaba earlier in the day for a two-day
visit, marking improved ties between Jordan and Gulf states which
were badly affected by the 1990 Gulf crisis.
</P>
<P>
Jordan had been isolated by Arab countries for its sympathy with
Iraq after Iraqi troops invaded Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Jordan, which follows a peace policy with all
countries, has restored its ties with all the six Gulf states,
including Iraq's arch foes of Kuwait and Saudi Arabia while trying
to keep its traditionally friendly ties with Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Peru, Chile Inspection Accord Goes in Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The agreement reached by Chile and
Peru for phytosanitary and migratory inspection in the Tacna-Arica
railroad went in force Wednesday to prevent the dissemination of
the fruit fly.
</P>
<P>
Chilean Foreign Vice Minister Heraldo Munoz told Radio Lima
that the National Agriculture Service (SENASA) and the Agriculture
and Livestock Service (SAG) authorities will be in charge of the
respective technical inspections.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral agreement, which does not void the 1929 accord,
or its complementary protocols, will be in force for 30 days and
can be extended for another 30 days.
</P>
<P>
Peru obtained through the 1929 accord a free zone in Arica, an
old Peruvian city that went under Chilean sovereignty after the
war of the Pacific in 1879, and guaranteed free transit between
the two towns.
</P>
<P>
The signing of this phytosanitary treaty came about after the
Peruvian authorities asked last Friday the unilateral suspension
of the transit between the cities of Tacna and Arica by the
decision of the Chilean government, aimed at preventing in this
way the entrance of the fruit fly.
</P>
<P>
Munoz said that inspectors of the two countries can board the
train and make in transit the corresponding examinations to
prevent the extension of the plague into Peruvian territory and
also into Chile.

<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Spain and Russia agreed Wednesday
to establish a mechanism of yearly contact for the promotion of
relations between the two countries and the coordination of
international policies.
</P>
<P>
The commitment was assumed by Spain's Prime Minister Jose Maria
Aznar and Russian Federation President Valdimir Putin, who arrived
here Tuesday for a state visit.
</P>
<P>
Both leaders told the press at the end of a meeting that the
two countries opened a new stage of permanent talks to promote
commercial relations.
</P>
<P>
The two parts signed, as a proof of the new climate of the
relations between the two countries, agreements against double
taxation, of cooperation on tourism matters, of archives, customs,
training of public servants, and cases of emergency, said Aznar.
</P>
<P>
Aznar said that the joint commission will propose concrete
projects for the new situation.
</P>
<P>
He also referred to the upcoming meeting of interior ministers
for the strengthening of cooperation against terrorism, drug
trafficking, and organized crime, and also in the matter of
defense.
</P>
<P>
Aznar said that he exchanged information with Putin about
several international topics, such as the peace process in the
Mideast and the United States anti-missile national defense system.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Envoy Wants Changes in U.N. Peacekeeping, N.Y. Times Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Ambassador to the
United Nations Richard Holbrooke has said that the U.N. needs to
transform its civilian-run peacekeeping department into a larger
and more effective military-style operation so it can avoid
repeating mistakes as it undertakes new mission in the Middle East
and Africa.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times newspaper, citing an interview with
Holbrooke, quoted the U.S. ambassador as saying that the United
Nations must also be allowed to resume "borrowing" experts from
national militaries, a practice the third-world majority of
nations curtailed several years ago in the interest of creating
more jobs for their candidates.
</P>
<P>
While developing nations, with a majority in the U.N. General
Assembly, can block any substantial reform of a department they
cannot control, Holbrooke has an unofficial ally in U.N. Secretary-
General Kofi Annan, the Times said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has offered logistical support, though not ground
troops, to the beleaguered U.N. peacekeeping force in Sierra Leone,
which so far has only about 9,300 members and 11,100 authorized
for it by the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
At the moment, the Security Council is considering new
peacekeeping missions in southern Lebanon, the Democratic Republic
of Congo, and perhaps Ethiopia and Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
However, Washington is frequently under fire at the United
Nations for its failure to pay the U.N. dues, including U.N.
peacekeeping assessments, on time, in full and without any
condition.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan President Visits Tanzania on Regional Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni arrived here Wednesday evening on an unannounced two-day
official visit mostly focused on security in the Great Lakes
region.
</P>
<P>
Museveni and his 10-man delegation were received by Tanzanian
President Benjamin Mkapa at the Dar es Salaam International
Airport.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa's Assistant Press Secretary Maura Mwingira told local
media that the two presidents were expected to hold interpersonal
discussion at the Sheraton Hotel.
</P>
<P>
Director of Information and Research in the Tanzanian Ministry
of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation Patrick Chokala
said the discussion would focus on various issues including the
situation in the Great Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
"Other issues like the East African cooperation and the
existing bilateral relations also are on the agenda,"he added.
</P>
<P>
Museveni's entourage includes his Deputy Prime Minister Eliah
Kategaya who arrived here earlier in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Museveni was in Tanzania's western town of Mwanza last month
for a mini-summit with Rwandan President Paul Kagame and Tanzanian
President Mkapa.
</P>
<P>
They discussed the clashes between troops of Uganda and Rwanda
in Kisangani in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of
Congo.
</P>
<P>
Mediated by Mkapa, Museveni and Kagame reached an agreement to
disengage and withdraw their forces which went into fighting later
again.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Tanzania issued a statement expressing its great
concern over the resumed clashes and calling for an immediate
cease-fire.

<P>
WASHINGTON, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government Wednesday
gave a cautious welcome to the agreement signed by leaders of the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and South Korea
during a ground-breaking summit.
</P>
<P>
The five-point communique, signed Wednesday by DPRK leader Kim
Jong Il and South Korean President Kim Dae Jong in Pyongyang,
includes, among others, pledges on reunions for families divided
for the past five decades and measures to boost economic ties.
</P>
<P>
"It's very important that they have signed this agreement,"
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said, "but I think it's also
very important that a process comes out of this summit that allows
them to implement the important work they have agreed to in the
last two days."
</P>
<P>
He described the agreement as "encouraging," but said "we need
to look at what the process will be coming out of this meeting,
out of this communique, to see how they will build on it."
</P>
<P>
"It's important that they keep this process going, and that
they have some mechanism for continuing to build on the success of
the last two days," he added.

<HEADLINE> New Chechen Leader Urges Rebels to Surrender </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The newly appointed head of the
administration of Russia's breakaway republic of Chechnya
Wednesday urged the rebels to lay down their arms.
</P>
<P>
Akhmed Kadyrov, the Chechen mufti (Muslim leader), made the
appeal following a meeting in a village near Grozny with Gennady
Troshev, the commander of the federal troops in the North Caucasus,
the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Vladimir Putin appointed Kadyrov as the
leader of the Chechen administration Monday.
</P>
<P>
Kadyrov called on the militants "to stop the resistance, lay
down arms and return to peaceful life."
</P>
<P>
"It is time to stop spilling blood for ideas alien to the
Chechen people and which will never be accepted by them," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kadyrov told reporters that he would not rule out the
possibility of negotiations with separatist leaders such as former
Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov.
</P>
<P>
"However, there will be no negotiations with those who have
robbed and killed people," Kadyrov said.
</P>
<P>
The mufti said he regards Maskhadov as the elected president of
Chechnya "who has lost legitimacy because of his inertia, and the
people no longer trust him."
</P>
<P>
Kadyrov promised to guarantee Maskhadov's safety and he "says
he is sorry and steps down."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Federal Reserve Reports Some Slowing in Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. economy continued to
post solid economic growth in April and May but also saw "signs of
some slowing," the U.S. Federal Reserve reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Reports from the Federal Reserve Districts indicate that solid
economic growth continued in April and May, but that signs of some
slowing from the rapid pace earlier in the year are also present,"
the Fed said in its Beige Report.
</P>
<P>
The survey, compiled from reports from its 12 regional banks,
will be used when Fed policy-makers meet June 27-28 to review
their stance on interest rates. It was based on information
collected before June 6.
</P>
<P>
The Fed said that half of all 12 Fed districts report a recent
slowdown in the rate of growth in consumer spending.
</P>
<P>
It also said that employers are continuing to report shortages
of workers and having difficulty in hiring and recruiting people,
but added that such labor market tightness hasn't intensified
since the last report.
</P>
<P>
Half the districts "indicate labor shortage are constraining
output growth," the report said.
</P>
<P>
Even with signs of cooling in the economy, the Fed said "
indications of worsening price inflation, while not widespread,
are reported by several districts."

<HEADLINE> Israeli PM's Party Resumes Coalition Talks With Rebellious Shas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak's One Israel bloc Wednesday afternoon resumed talks with the
ultra-orthodox Shas party, trying to drag the rebellious partner
back to the ruling coalition.
</P>
<P>
Justice Minister Yossi Beilin, representative of One Israel, met
with his Shas counterpart and Health Minister Shlomo Benizri to
discuss ways of settling the two sides' difference over the
coalition crisis, according to Israel Radio reports.
</P>
<P>
Shas, with 17 seats in the 120-member Knesset (parliament), is
the biggest partner of Barak's One Israel in the coalition
government.
</P>
<P>
It announced its pullout from the government Tuesday afternoon.
The party also voted against the government in last weeks' Knesset
preliminary reading for a bill calling for early elections.
</P>
<P>
Shas officials stated that ministers and deputy ministers from
the party will submit their resignation letters to the coalition in
Sunday's cabinet meeting and the decision will take effect in 48
hours thereafter.
</P>
<P>
The quitting will make Barak's control in the Knesset shrink
from a majority of 68 seats to a minority of 51 seats.
</P>
<P>
To show his determination, Shas leader Eli Yishai boycotted
Wednesday morning's security cabinet meeting, saying that he did
not feel as a minister in the cabinet any longer.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts said the resignation, like a hold-up-or-I-will-
jump adventure, obviously left at least several days for the
government and the rebellious party to maneuver and resume their
partnership.
</P>
<P>
Shas' Council of Torah Sages, which made the quitting decision,
said in a statement Tuesday: "The Shas movement has not been a full
partner in the coalition, both in terms of cooperation in the peace
process and in terms of finding an appropriate solution for Israeli
children."
</P>
<P>
However, most Israelis believe that the real drive behind the
party's threats is its unmet additional financial demands for its
corruption-ridden and almost bankrupt religious educational
network.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, reports said the gap between the sum of money the
government is willing to provide and the sum Shas demands has been
reduced to several million shekels and a deal is about to be
reached.
</P>
<P>
However, the insatiable Shas seemed to have added new items onto
its demand list, reportedly asking for a say in the peace talks
with Arab countries and legalizing its private radio stations.
</P>
<P>
During Wednesday afternoon's talks, Shas demanded that a bill
legalizing its radio channels be brought before the Knesset, and
only after that will the party drop its support for early-election
bills.
</P>
<P>
There is no immediate announcement about the talks' outcome.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Barak invited Interior Minister Natan
Sharansky, leader of another rebellious party Yisrael Ba'aliya, to
his office for consultation Wednesday afternoon, trying to keep the
party in the coalition.
</P>
<P>
Yisrael Ba'aliya and National Religious Party (NRP), two right-
wing fellows of Shas in the coalition, are on the verge of quitting
the government following Shas' pullout.
</P>
<P>
Several Yisrael Ba'aliya and NRP Knesset members warned before
Shas' move that if Shas pulls out, they will also leave the
coalition, which will declare the de facto breakup of Barak's
government, as its seats in the Knesset will be reduced further to
42.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Welcomes Saudi-Yemeni Border Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Egypt on Wednesday expressed welcome
to the signing of a border agreement between Saudi Arabia and
Yemen, hailing it as "a great achievement" of the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said that Egypt "highly
appreciates such a great achievement that will help clear the air
between both Arab countries."
</P>
<P>
"What has been achieved (by Riyadh and Sanaa) is a development
(in their ties) and a very good example that should be followed in
dealing with the inter-Arab relations," Moussa was quoted by
Egypt's Middle East News Agency as telling reporters.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that the agreement will encourage other Arab
countries that have territorial disputes to "follow suit because
the Arab world needs no disputes".
</P>
<P>
The Arab world "needs to solve its problems peacefully, via
reconciliatory and satisfactory solutions that will open the way
for cooperation, integration and communication," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia and Yemen signed the border demarcation agreement
in the western Saudi city of Jeddah on Monday during a two-day
visit to Saudi Arabia by Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh.
</P>
<P>
Yemeni officials accompanying Saleh said the agreement laid down
arrangements for the demarcation of 1,500 kilometers inland and
maritime borders.
</P>
<P>
Riyadh and Sanaa have been locked in border deputes since the
1930s and witnessed occasional border clashes of their security
forces. They have to re-locate about 300 border signs which had
disappeared due to denudation and aging factors.
</P>
<P>
The two Arab neighbors also need to negotiate a solution to
their maritime border dispute in the Red Sea, where their border
guards exchanged fires in July, 1998.

<HEADLINE> Israel Welcomes Historical Inter-Korea Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli government on
Wednesday expressed its welcome to the historical inter-Korea
summit held in Pyongyang, saying it is conducive to realizing peace
in the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The government of Israel considered the summit between the
leaders of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and
South Korea a key opportunity for peace, reconciliation and
cooperation between the two parts of the peninsula, which has been
divided for about 50 years, a statement issued by the Foreign
Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The government of Israel also hopes that the important
achievements of the historical meeting will lead to speedy,
complete and comprehensive unification of the peninsula, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
DPRK leader Kim Jong Il and South Korean President Kim Dae-jung
began their historical summit in Pyongyang on Tuesday, and signed a
historical agreement on Wednesday to strengthen the exchange and
improve the relations between the two sides and to realize national
reunification at an early date.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK and South Korea have agreed to cooperate independently
in seeking ways of national reunification, realize mutual visits by
delegations of relatives of the separated families, realize
balanced development of the national economy through cooperation,
and conduct inter-governmental dialogues on the implementation of
the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Also in the agreement, Kim Dae-jung extended an invitation to
Kim Jong Il to visit South Korea and Kim Jong Il agreed to make the
trip at an appropriate time.

CAIRO, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Egypt hopes that the United States
will make further efforts to push the Palestinian-Israeli peace
talks forward, Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that U.S. President Bill Clinton will interfere in the
Palestinian-Israeli negotiations and use his power to budge the
current stalemate into a just settlement," Moussa told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He was commenting on the coming meeting between Clinton and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Thursday at the White House.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians and Israel resumed negotiations on Tuesday in
Washington for a peace agreement on final solutions to the
thorniest issues including border, Jerusalem, settlements and
refugees.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have made little progress in the so-called final-
status talks and concerns have risen that they may fail to meet a
September 13 deadline.
</P>
<P>
"The Americans exerted endeavors in the past years and it is now
the prime time that such endeavors reach a just final Palestinian-
Israeli agreement," Moussa said.

<HEADLINE> Political Parties of Divided Cyprus Meet Over Upcoming Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Two political parties from the two
divided communities of Cyprus issued here Wednesday a joint
communique, expressing the hope that the new round of Cyprus peace
talks will be upgraded to direct talks.
</P>
<P>
According to the Cyprus News Agency, representatives from the
Democratic Rally party (DISY) of the Greek Cypriot side and the
Republican Turkish Party (RTP) of the Turkish Cypriot side met here
Wednesday for nearly two hours.
</P>
<P>
A joint communique issued after the meeting reaffirmed their
support for a peaceful settlement in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
"The two parties will continue to work for a peaceful solution
of the Cyprus problem on the basis of a bizonal, bicommunal
federation in accordance with U.N. resolutions," the communique
said.
</P>
<P>
The two parties asserted the belief that accession of Cyprus to
the European Union (EU) will benefit both communities of the
island.
</P>
<P>
They expressed the hope that the Turkish Cypriots will also be
represented in the EU membership negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash has so far declined
President Glafcos Clerides' offer regarding nominating Turkish
Cypriot representatives to join Cyprus' negotiating team.
</P>
<P>
DICY leader Nicos Anastasiades hailed the meeting as "very
useful and constructive."
</P>
<P>
RTP leader Mehmet Ali Talat gave his full backing to such
contacts, saying "common understanding is very important not only
for the parties but also for other groups and individuals."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek and Turkish Cypriot
communities since 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the
northern third of the island after a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has been trying for decades to reunite the
island with a bicommunal, bizonal federation formula but no
tangible achievements have been made so far.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the two communities have held two rounds of U.N.-
sponsored indirect talks with the aim to pave the way for
substantive negotiations over a comprehensive settlement. A third
round of talks is due to begin on July 5 in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus, along with Slovenia, Hungary, Poland, Estonia and the
Czech Republic, started substantive accession negotiations with the
EU in November 1998.

<HEADLINE> Italy Proposes Global Network For Small Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Italian Industry and Foreign Trade
Minister Enrico Letta proposed the setting up of an international
network aimed at helping small and medium-sized businesses
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Italian news agency Ansa reported that in a speech at an
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)
meeting on smaller firms and globalization, held in the central
Italian city of Bologna, Letta said that Italy wanted a sort of
international compass, which will help these businesses to find
their way in a globalized economy.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the new entity be called the International
Network for Small-Medium Sized Enterprises, and added that the
help and advice the organizations were currently offering to small
businesses were "inadequate given the challenges facing us."
</P>
<P>
He said that they were "limited to certain geographical areas
and only specialized in particular sectors or economic activities.
"
</P>
<P>
He said that the INSME would seek to link up all the existing
services and systems and that the Bologna conference should mark
the concrete launching of the project.
</P>
<P>
On a more general note, Letta stressed that many small
businesses were being strangled by too much bureaucracy, and urged
governments to take a more "decisive role" by introducing red tape
cutting measures.
</P>
<P>
He called on financial institutes to do their part by "
developing financial tools and services which are suitable for
smaller firms."
</P>
<P>
Letta also addressed the issue of the role of multinationals in
the process of globalization.
</P>
<P>
Underscoring his point that the aim of globalization should be
to "boost development and social guarantees," the minister said
that the OECD should modify its approach to multinationals,
forcing them to respect labor and environmental standards in the
name of "sustainable development."

<HEADLINE> S. African Banks Defend Stance on Loans to Small Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 14 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's banks
Wednesday defended their alleged lack of involvement in the
development of small business, saying the government itself should
play a greater role in financing micro-sized companies.
</P>
<P>
Addressing Parliament's trade and industry portfolio committee,
Banking Council chief executive officer Bob Tucker said the
government should define the "elusive knife-edge" between a sound
financial sector and an affirmative approach to financing small
business.
</P>
<P>
Briefing members on banks' involvement in the promotion of
small, medium and micro enterprises, he said it is not only the
banking sector's responsibility to finance small business.
</P>
<P>
Policies and strategies should be developed at national level
to ensure international confidence in the country's financial
sector is not eroded.
</P>
<P>
"In our view, it is also very clear that no single sector is
going to be able to do this on its own," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The public, private and non-governmental organization sectors
must work very closely together, each one doing what it is good at
and assisting the other sectors in the most appropriate way,"
Tucker stressed.
</P>
<P>
South African Trade and Industry Minister Alec Erwin has
accused banks of not doing enough to finance small enterprises and
being excessively cautious and "risk averse" when considering
extending loans.

<HEADLINE> ONS Figures Show UK's Unemployment At New Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The number of people out of work
and claiming benefit in Britain was down by 8,600 to 1,109,000 in
May, an unemployment rate of 3.9 percent, a 20-year low.
</P>
<P>
The broader measure of unemployment, ILO unemployment, also
fell by 60,000 in the three months to April to 1.681 million,
giving an unemployment rate of 5.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Employment Minister Tessa Jowell said that the figures showed
that half a million fewer people were claiming unemployment
benefit than at the time of the last general election in May 1997.
</P>
<P>
"This is a reflection of two things: the strong, stable
economic framework which gives businesses the confidence to invest
and the success of government programs to tackle long-term
unemployment," she said.
</P>
<P>
The rate of increase of wages in Britain also came down sharply,
easing fears that it is stoking up inflation, according to figures
released by the Office of National Statistics (ONS).
</P>
<P>
Average earnings rose by 5.1 percent in the three months to
April, down from 5.7 percent in the previous period, and below
analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
The ONS said the earnings fall could be explained by millennium-
related payments and bonuses from the turn of the year dropping
out of the three-month comparison.
</P>
<P>
There had been fears here that with unemployment so low, wages
would continue to rise, putting pressure on the Bank of England to
raise interest rates further.
</P>
<P>
The Bank has previously said that wage growth of around 4.5
percent or less was needed to keep inflation in check.

<HEADLINE> BoE Governor: City Not Hurt By Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Eddie George, governor of the Bank
of England, said the City of London has not been hurt by the UK's
delay in joining the euro.
</P>
<P>
George argued the City is thriving outside the euro zone and
will probably continue to prosper, whether or not Britain joins
the single currency soon.
</P>
<P>
The governor told the London Chamber of Commerce recently those
who had predicted that the financial sector would suffer if
Britain failed to sign up to the euro when it was launched in 1999
had been proved wrong.
</P>
<P>
"That clearly has not so far happened, quite the reverse," he
said. "There was no obvious reason why the City should not
continue to do well outside the euro."
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe George's remarks will disappoint pro-
euro ministers, who are pressing Prime Minister Tony Blair to make
a more aggressive case for membership.
</P>
<P>
His comments on euro are significant because the government's
five economic tests for assessing whether to join the euro after
the next election include an assessment of the impact on the UK's
financial services industry, they added.

public school students were canceled after the municipal lighting
department was unable to restore power to most of the district's
263 buildings.

<HEADLINE> Italian PM Says Low Wages Not Key to Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Italian Premier Giuliano Amato
Wednesday said that low labor costs were not the magic wand for
development.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the topics of globalization and small and medium-
sized business at the meeting of the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD) held in central Italian city of
Bologna, Amato said, "The economies which are growing the most are
not those which have the lowest labor costs but those with a
collective working mentality."
</P>
<P>
Looking at the developing nations, which have sent
representatives to the OECD summit, Amato said that "social
dumping" achieved through low wages does not go far because "in
the long run the cost of labor is not the key to development."
</P>
<P>
Amato also made references to the street demonstrations being
staged in Bologna to protest against the OECD meeting and said
that "the demonstrators have the same worries that we do; that new
technologies should be sued to eliminate the barriers between rich
and poor rather than increase the gap between them."

<HEADLINE> Tougher Cigarette Warnings to Be Voted in EP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The European Parliament Wednesday
was to vote on draft European Union laws on new tougher cigarette
warnings.
</P>
<P>
Cigarette makers will have to increase the size of health
warnings on packets and stop using words such as mild, light and
low tar on packets to water down the health hazard of cigarette
smoking.
</P>
<P>
The parliamentary voting, though having a strong influence upon
the new draft rules, is not binding. The final say will rest with
the governments of member states of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
The members of the European Parliament added more than 100
amendments to the proposal by EU Health Commissioner David Byrne
before voting to pass the proposal into draft EU laws.
</P>
<P>
One amendment called for graphic images of blackened lungs to
cover almost half of the cigarette packets to warn smokers of the
smoking hazard.
</P>
<P>
Some parliamentarians argued that the European consumers had
been sold the idea that light, mild and low tar cigarettes are
healthier. But low tar cigarettes inflict the same damage as
conventional cigarettes in that smokers just draw harder to get
the usual feeling of smoking, they said.
</P>
<P>
Tobacco industrialists, mostly concerned over the proposal to
extend tar and nicotine limits to exports, went to lobby the
European Parliament before it votes.

<HEADLINE> EU Appeals Cease-Fire Between Ethiopia, Eritrea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The European Union Wednesday
appealed to Ethiopia and Eritrea for an immediate stop of all acts
of war.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation European bloc said in a written statement that it
also appealed to all parties concerned to continue negotiations
for a lasting peace on the basis of the framework agreement and
the modalities for its implementation.
</P>
<P>
The two African countries agreed last Saturday to a cease-fire
by the end of this week after two weeks of negotiations in Alger,
Algeria, that is now holding the presidency of the Organization of
African Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
But reports reaching here said that fights broke out again
along the borders between Ethiopia and Eritrea Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The European Union said that it would support the
implementation of the OAU peace settlement by coordinating with
the United Nations and other international institutions and by
deploying peacekeeping missions to the region.
</P>
<P>
The European Union has been providing food aid to Ethiopia and
Eritrea but the current fight between the two countries were
claimed to have hindered the transportation and distribution of
food aid to the victims of war as well as drought.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia has been hit by a drought and upwards of 800,000 tons
of food are predicted by satellite surveillance to be needed to
feed the population of the country.

<HEADLINE> Greenhouse Gas Emissions Slightly Down in EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Total greenhouse gas emissions in
the European Union have fallen slightly in the period from 1990 to
1998, a report compiled by the European Topic Center on Air
Emissions said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report, known as the European Community Greenhouse Gas
Inventory 1990-1998, said that the decrease of greenhouse gas
emissions is by no means enough to achieve the targets the EU is
committed to under the Kyoto Protocol.
</P>
<P>
The reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in the period from
1990 to 1998 was only 2 percent while the 15-nation bloc has
committed to reduce by 8 percent its total greenhouse gas
emissions from 2008 to 2012.
</P>
<P>
The reduction in the 1990-1998 period was mainly due to a
decline in Germany and Britain, the two major member states of the
European Union.
</P>
<P>
Carbon dioxide makes the largest contribution to EU greenhouse
gas emissions, accounting for 81 percent while methane and nitrous
oxide combine to account for 18 percent. Industrial fluorocarbon
gases contribute 1 percent to the total greenhouse gas emissions.
</P>
<P>
The energy sector is the main contributor to EU emissions,
accounting for 32 percent, followed by transport at 24 percent and
industry at 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
Substantial decreases of greenhouse gas emissions occurred only
in Germany where increased energy efficiency and economic
restructuring in the eastern part of the country have contributed
to the decrease.
</P>
<P>
A switch from coal to natural gas has contributed to the
greenhouse gas emissions reduction in Britain.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUXEMBOURG, June 14 (Xinhua) -- European Union foreign
ministers entertained Wednesday the NATO chief for a special
discussion about a report on European defense that is to be handed
to and adopted at the coming EU summit.
</P>
<P>
NATO Secretary General George Robertson attended the EU foreign
ministers council as part of a routine dialogue between the two
institutions on the new Common European Security and Defense
Policy (CESDP).
</P>
<P>
The EU foreign ministers viewed the report to be handed and
adopted by the coming European Union summit of heads of state and
government. The report covered the new permanent political and
military bodies to be set up within the 15-nation bloc.
</P>
<P>
The summit, to be held on June 19 and 20 at Feira of Portugal,
is also expected to review the consultation and participation
arrangements for non-EU countries in EU-led crisis management
operations and the consultation and cooperation with NATO.
</P>
<P>
It is also expected to reflect on whether the EU treaty needs
revision to accommodate the CESDP.
</P>
<P>
The Feira summit will also be asked to adopt a study of
concrete objectives for joint non-military civil responses to
humanitarian and peacekeeping operations and to endorse the
creation of a new committee for civil aspects of crisis management.
</P>
<P>
The report will recommend to the heads of state and government
from EU member states enhancing civil police and civil protection
capacities and restoring the function of judicial and penal
systems.

ATHENS, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Doctors from the neurosurgery
clinic of the Aristotle University in the northern Greek city of

spinal conditions.
</P>
<P>
The device, called PARM, was placed between two vertebrae and
was the result of long years of research on animals, the
Macedonian Press Agency (MPA) reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The device's advantage was that it remained in place without

<HEADLINE> Algerian President Urges France to Call Algerian War by Name </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Algerian President Abdelaziz
Bouteflika Wednesday called on France to call the 1954-1962
Algerian War of Independence by its name and give a correct
picture of the war to young people in school textbooks.
</P>
<P>
The mainstream French history books still regard the war as a
rebellion by Algerian nationalists against the authorities in "
French Algeria."
</P>
<P>
In a 40-minute speech at the National Assembly hours after his
arrival here, Bouteflika said that France should "go out of the
oubliette of what is unspoken about the Algerian war by calling it
by its name."
</P>
<P>
"Or your schools also work to correct in the textbooks the
image sometimes twisted about certain periods of colonial era,
which would make up an encouraging step in search of truth and for
a better knowledge of history and equality between peoples," he
told the deputies of the lower house of the French parliament.
</P>
<P>
Bouteflika also said that he hopes for a "decisive impulsion"
to bilateral cooperation between France and Algeria.
</P>
<P>
"Algeria needs investment, technical capacities and management,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
He also hoped that France would make an initiative to a
rescheduling of the payment of Algeria's foreign debts by
international donor countries.
</P>
<P>
Bouteflika arrived here Wednesday afternoon for a four-day
state visit, the first by an Algerian head of state since 1983.

<HEADLINE> Annan Concerned at Haiti's Continuing Irregularities in Calculating Votes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 14 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Wednesday expressed his concerned over the continuing
irregularities in the methodology used to calculate the vote
percentages for Senate candidates in Haiti.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by his spokesman's office said the
Secretary-General reiterated his expectation that in calculating
the final results, the Haitian electoral authorities would
strictly adhere to the procedures stipulated in the electoral law
of July 1999.
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General has been following developments on
Haiti. He is pleased to note that voting for parliamentary and
local officials took place on May 21 and that delayed election was
held in the Grand Anse on June 11," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General is encouraged that, despite serious
security concerns in the lead-up to election day, some 50 percent
of the country's newly registered electors chose to vote, thereby
endorsing a peaceful democratic process regulated by the
Constitution and secondary law," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General is however disquieted by the series of
arrests in the days following the elections," it noted.
</P>
<P>
"It is cause for additional concern that many of those
detained were candidates or activists affiliated with parties of
the opposition," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Haitian voters went to polls Sunday in the Grand Anse
department, the only one of Haiti's nine states that failed to
vote in May 21 national elections. Grand Anse did not vote in May
because political bickering hindered voter registration.
</P>
<P>
The election, Haiti's first national vote in more than three
years, was considered a critical step to restore a parliament
dissolved by President Rene Preval in January 1999.
</P>
<P>
The vote in May was marred by allegations that voting
percentages for the first-round winners were miscalculated.
</P>
<P>
Deliberate effort of trying to empty ballot boxes was reported
in the vote in Grand Anse.

<HEADLINE> EU Backs Tougher Tobacco Warnings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The European Parliament Wednesday
endorsed proposals to enlarge warnings against tobacco hazards on
cigarette packets.
</P>
<P>
The 626-member legislative assembly voted for health warnings
to cover 35 percent of the front and 45 percent of the back of
cigarette packets in more than one language.
</P>
<P>
The current requirement for health warnings on packets is to
cover 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The legislation, to take effect on January 1 of 2003, next goes
to the council of health ministers of the European Union member
states for final approval on June 29.
</P>
<P>
The European Parliament's voting surpassed the requirement by
the proposal from the European Commission, the executive body of
the 15-nation bloc. The commission proposed to limit the health
warnings to 30 percent on the packets while the tobacco industry
had been lobbying for a maximum of 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
The European Parliament, meeting in Strasbourg, also cut the
maximum amount of tar per cigarette to 10 milligrams from 12
milligrams and the maximum amount of nicotine to 1 milligram and
the amount of carbon monoxide to 10 milligrams.
</P>
<P>
It also required cigarette makers not to distinguish their
products with such descriptions as "low tar," "mild" or "light."
</P>
<P>
But the European Parliament rejected a call for cigarette
packets to show photos of smoke-stained teeth, scarred lungs or
young children imitating smoking adults.
</P>
<P>
EU Health Commissioner David Byrne said after the vote that he
was pleased with the parliamentary vote and encouraged by the
strong support for the commission's proposal for a directive on
tobacco products.
</P>
<P>
The European Union estimates that some 500,000 EU nationals die
prematurely every year from tobacco-related diseases.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Approves Peacekeeping Mission to Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The South African cabinet
approved Wednesday the decision to let the South African National
Defense Force (SANDF) take part in peacekeeping operations in the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
According to the South African Press Association, the earliest
possible date for the SANDF's deployment is June 26, said
government spokesman Joel Netshitenzhe in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
However, he said an assessment by South Africa and the United
Nations of the situation in the DRC will determine the final date.
</P>
<P>
The mission will comprise six teams of specialized military
elements, which will be stationed at the U.N. peacekeeping mission
in Kinshasa, Netshitenzhe said.
</P>
<P>
The teams will comprise a total of 160 members, including a
flight operations element with a staff of 15, an airfield crash
rescue and fire-fighting element consisting of four vehicles and
16 people, air cargo handling teams comprising 64 members that
will take along equipment such as forklifts and cargo vehicles,
logistic load teams comprising 12 forklift operators, emergency
medical teams of five doctors and 14 nurses, a water processing
unit of 16 people and contingency headquarters that will be
staffed by 23 members who will take 12 vehicles along.
</P>
<P>
The SANDF said in a statement that predeployment activities in
South Africa are scheduled to start on June 21 and will last about
10 days.
</P>
<P>
"During this time, the contingent will receive mission specific
training," the statement said. "After the predeployment training,
the members will return to their home units awaiting deployment."
</P>
<P>
It was envisaged that the six teams will not be deployed
simultaneously but in stages according to the requirements of the
U.N. headquarters in Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
While the contingent will be under operational control of a U.N.
force commander, staff will still remain under SANDF command with
regard to matters concerning discipline.
</P>
<P>
South Africa will carry the initial cost of the deployment but
will be reimbursed later by the U.N., the SANDF added.

GENEVA, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Women in several Swiss cities took
to the street Wednesday to highlight abuses of women's rights as
part of the World Women's March, according to a Swiss Radio
International report.
</P>
<P>
In the Swiss capital of Berne, one aspect which the
demonstrators are keen to highlight is the struggle for better
working conditions for women.
</P>
<P>
Ruth Vermot-Mangold, a female member of the federal House of
Representatives, said that she had planned to ask the parliament
to vote on plans to give greater protection to victims of domestic
violence.
</P>
<P>
If her suggestions are approved, the victims of violence, who
are by and large women and children, would remain in the household
and the offender would be forced to move out. The offender would
have to stay away from his home for at least 10 days. So far, it
is the victims who have been told to leave their homes.
</P>
<P>
Figures show an alarmingly high level of cases of domestic
violence in Switzerland. Vermot-Mangold said, "At least 20 percent
of women in Switzerland are the victims of domestic violence."
</P>
<P>
However, she is far from confident that parliament will approve
her initiative. "There are quite a few right-wing men who will
oppose it. Parliament has always been reluctant to deal with the
painful reality of domestic violence," she added.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 14 (Xinhua) -- South Africa recorded the
lowest ever mining fatality rate in 1999, the Mine Health and
Safety Inspectorate said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Safety adviser for the chamber of mines, Mike Gouws, said in a
statement here that 1997 and 1998 were also record breaking years
for the national mining industry.
</P>
<P>
"The long-term efforts of the industry to reduce accidents,
fatalities and injuries are paying-off," he said.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of the Mine Health and Safety Act, which came
into effect in 1997, had also contributed significantly to mine
safety, according to Gouws.
</P>
<P>
Gouws said the industry's goal of achieving world-class safety
performance figures looked far more attainable now than it had
five years ago.
</P>
<P>
"Mining fatalities in 1999 had declined by about 30 percent
when compared to mining deaths in the early 1980s. Fewer injuries
were also reported during that period (1999)," he said.
</P>
<P>
Gouws said that from 1984 to 1998 there had been an average of
8.5 major mining accidents each year, while in 1999 there was one
major accident.

<HEADLINE> African Refugees Rise to 4 Million: UNHCR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The number of African
refugees fleeing conflict in their own countries had risen to four
million while another 20 million people were displaced, the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Our problems are expanding rather shrinking," UNHCR
representative in South Africa Mengesha Kebede said in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
Namibia and Botswana were reporting an increasing inflow of
people leaving war-torn Angola, and refugees from Sierra Leone
continued to seek asylum in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
The number of people driven to Sudan by the recent outbreak of
war in the Horn of Africa stood at 75,000 by Tuesday, Kebede said.
</P>
<P>
He was briefing reporters to highlight Africa Refugee Day next
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In South Africa, 60,000 asylum seekers had been registered by
April this year. Of these, 15,000 had so far been recognized as
refugees.
</P>
<P>
"Asylum applications continue to lodged as civil strife and
armed conflict continue to bedevil many countries in Africa and
beyond," Kebede said.
</P>
<P>
The current backlog in asylum applications in South Africa
stood at about 27,000, and the UNHCR was working with the
Department of Home Affairs to speed up the process.
</P>
<P>
Kebede reiterated the UNHCR's call on South Africa to render
some assistance to genuine and needy asylum seekers as they were
not allowed to work while awaiting the outcome of their
applications.
</P>
<P>
Kebede said South Africa was the only country on the continent
that did not provide refugees with material assistance.
</P>
<P>
Kebede said genuine refugees were often unfairly treated the
same way as aliens who were in the country illegally.
</P>
<P>
In recent police roundups of illegal immigrants in urban
centers, some asylum seekers were also arrested.
</P>
<P>
"We have discussed this with the government and have intervened
to secure the release of genuine asylum seekers," Kebede said.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the turmoil in Zimbabwe, he said UNHCR offices in
Botswana, Mozambique and South Africa had been preparing for an
inflow of refugees.

<HEADLINE> Philippine President Rejects Ceasefire Proposal with MILF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA June 14 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
rejected Wednesday the Catholic bishops' proposals to declare a
ceasefire with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) while
peace negotiations are being held.
</P>
<P>
Short of outrightly telling the bishops, the president said
that the MILF should first abandon all secessionist or
independence moves, stop all criminal and lawless acts and lay
down their arms -- three demands that the MILF has repeatedly
resisted.
</P>
<P>
Estrada maintained that armed groups talking peace with the
government must first show sincerity lest it uses ceasefire
accords to regroup and harass civilians all over again.
</P>
<P>
The president met with Cebu Archbishop Ricardo Cardinal Vidal,
Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines President
Archbishop Orlando Quevedo, and Bishops Businessmen's Conference
Co-chairmen Bishop Ramon Villena and Jose Concepcion.
</P>
<P>
Also present at the meeting in the Presidential Palace were the
heads of the Association of Major Religious Sueriors.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the president stressed that if the
government declares a ceasefire it would only find itself in a
more difficult situation.
</P>
<P>
"If we had not done what we did, the MILF would have attained
enough strength, gathered enough arms that would have given them
the confidence to abandon us at the negotiating table, ignore our
offer of genuine autonomy and demand that a referendum on
independence be held within the territory they tried to control,"
Estrada emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Estrada reassured Catholic Church leaders and
businessmen of his administration's continuing trust to achieve
lasting peace in Mindanao, adding that he is ready to listen to
any suggestion from the people.
</P>
<P>
The 15,000-strong MILF has been fighting for an independent
Muslim state for more than two decades, a request which was
rejected repeatedly by the Philippine government.
</P>
<P>
Government troops and MILF rebels were locked into fierce
battles recently in Mindanao, resulting heavy losses on both sides.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumer Prices Rise 0.1 Percent in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. consumer prices rose
modestly in May as lower energy and transportation prices offset
sharply higher prices for food, the Labor Department reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The department's Consumer Price Index, the nation's broadest
gauge of inflation, increased a slim 0.1 percent after being flat
in April.
</P>
<P>
Excluding volatile food and energy components, the "core" rate
of inflation rose 0.2 percent, matching April's advance and
economists' expectations.
</P>
<P>
In the first five months of the year, the core rate of
inflation has been rising at an annual rate of 2.7 percent,
compared with a 1.9 percent rate for all of last year.
</P>
<P>
In a separate report Wednesday, the Commerce Department said
that businesses boosted their inventories by 0.4 percent in April,
but saw their sales decline by 0.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
In May, energy prices fell for the second straight month by 1.9
percent. Reflecting cheaper energy bills in May, transportation
costs fell 0.5 percent. But airfares rose 0.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Food prices, meanwhile, shot up 0.5 percent in May, following a
0.1 percent increase the month before. Rising prices for
vegetables, beef and poultry swamped falling prices for fruits and
dairy products.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, consumer prices have been rising at an annual
rate of 3.6 percent, compared with 2.7 percent for all of 1999.
The pickup in this year's prices came from rising energy costs.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve has boosted interest rates six times since
last June to slow the speeding economy and keep inflation under
control.
</P>
<P>
Some recent economic reports, including retail sales, home
sales, factory orders and unemployment, suggest the economy is
slowing a bit. Against this backdrop, economists have offered
mixed opinions on whether the Fed will push up interest rates for
a seventh time when it meets June 27 and 28.

PARIS, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Algerian President Abdelaziz
Bouteflika arrived here Wednesday afternoon for a four-day state
visit, the first by an Algerian head of state after years of
estrangement between Algeria and France.
</P>
<P>
Bouteflika was received by President Jacques Chirac at Orly
international airport. The two heads of state went by car to the
Inalides military museum in the heart of Paris, where a grand
military ceremony was held to welcome the Algerian leader.
</P>
<P>
The two heads of state then began their talks at the Elysee
presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
France and Algeria have been resuming cooperation in all fields
after Bouteflika assumed power last year. Bilateral relations
have been cool since 1983.
</P>
<P>
French and Algerian officials said the visit is aimed at "
concretizing the re-warming" of good relations the two countries
have experienced over the past several months.
</P>
<P>
The visit is also expected to give "a new breath" to bilateral
relations and will push them to a higher level, said French and
Algerian officials.
</P>
<P>
Bouteflika is due to make a speech at the National Assembly
Wednesday and will meet with Prime Minister Lionel Jospin and
other French leaders on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He will also meet with French enterprise leaders and
representatives of the Algerian community in France.
</P>
<P>
Before ending his visit, Bouteflika will also visit a military
cemetery at the World War I battlefield of Verdun, northwest of
France.

<HEADLINE> EU Can Ban Canadian Asbestos: WTO Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The European Union can ban Canadian
asbestos under the latest ruling by the World Trade Organization (
WTO), Canada's National Post newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The decision can be appealed before being made final this
summer, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The interim ruling came Tuesday after Canada challenged a
French ban on asbestos imports out of health concerns before a WTO
panel.
</P>
<P>
Some European states have bans on asbestos, while others such
as Britain are considering instituting them, the national
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Canada's asbestos industry generates a yearly 200 million
Canadian dollars (about 1.4 million U.S. dollars) with exports
accounting for 95 percent of the production.

<P>
Addressing the "21st Century Forum", statesmen and economists,
including Sandstorm who is executive vice-president of the World
Bank, agreed that China has successfully integrated itself into
the global economy due in no small part to over twenty years of
rapid economic growth.
</P>
<P>
They said the Chinese experience is a good example for many
other developing countries.
</P>
<P>
According to Singaporean Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew, China
has witnessed great changes since the late Chinese leader Deng
Xiaoping initiated economic reform and the open-up policy in late
1978.
</P>
<P>
He said China's foreign trade volume accounted for 36 percent
of its GDP now as against 36 percent in 1978.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show China's average annual economic growth in the
past two decades was 9.8 percent, the fastest growing economy in
the world. China is the second largest foreign investment country
after the United States.
</P>
<P>
Poverty was reduced from 250 million in 1978 to 42 million in
1998.
</P>
<P>
The social and economic development in China and other parts of
Asia has benefited from economic globalization.

<HEADLINE> Globalization A Double-edged Sword: CPPCC Vice Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Chen Jinhua, vice-chairman of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC)
National Committee, said today efforts should be made to seek
benefits from economic globalization and avoid its potentially bad
influences for developing countries such as China.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at the 21st Century Forum -- Conference
2000 sponsored by the CPPCC National Committee, China's top
advisory body.
</P>
<P>
Chen said globalization can bring opportunities and promote
development of countries involved as it helps to open their
markets, promote flow of capital, technology, goods and labor and
to optimize the distribution of resources.
</P>
<P>
 However, globalization may see some multinationals and
governments finding excuses to interfere in the internal affairs
of other countries.
</P>
<P>
 To deal with globalization, he noted, "special attention
should be given to the interests of developing countries. Support
should be given to the economically-backward countries by opening
markets to them and training skilled personnel for them."
</P>
<P>
 Over 500 participants, including statesmen and leaders from
20 countries are attending the three-day conference.

<HEADLINE> Over 800 Afghan Refugees Repatriated From Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 14 (Xinhua) -- As part of a voluntary repatriation
program for refugees, some 816 Afghan refugees residing in the
Soleymankhani refugee camp in Iran's capital Tehran returned to
their homeland on Wednesday, the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Mohammad Reza Rostami, deputy interior minister in charge of
foreign nationals and immigrants, said the voluntary return of
Afghan refugees began on April 13 with the help of the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
</P>
<P>
According to an agreement signed between the UNHCR and Iran, the
Afghan refugees are transferred to an Iran-Afghanistan border point
through facilities provided by the UNHCR and are handed over to the
UNHCR officials stationed in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Some 29,750 Afghan refugees have returned to their homeland
since the start of the program, Rostami said, urging foreign
countries to provide the U.N. with necessary aid in order to help
persuade the Afghan refugees to remain in their country.
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are some 2 million foreign nationals residing
in Iran with necessary documents, out of which some 1.4 million are
Afghans. In addition to that number, a large group of refugees from
Afghanistan and Iraq are living in Iran illegally, the official
said.

<HEADLINE> Manila Confident of 4 Percent GDP Growth by Yearend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Wednesday it remains confident that it will be able to attain its
target of four percent growth in the gross domestic product (GDP)
by the yearend.
</P>
<P>
Press Undersecretary Antonio Seva said in a statement that the
four percent GDP growth is based on the assumption that there will
be a quick normalization of the conditions in Mindanao where
Muslim rebels and government troops engaged in fierce battles
recently.
</P>
<P>
Seva said the normalization of situations in Mindanao "will in
turn help sustain the strong output of industry that began to show
in the first quarter."
</P>
<P>
GDP refers to the total value of goods and services produced
within the country for the whole year.
</P>
<P>
Seva was reacting to some reports that the Philippines will
continue to lag behind its neighbors in Southeast Asia in terms of
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
He said in the first quarter alone, industry grew by 4.8
percent, adding that services also should accelerate from its 3.8
percent growth in the first quarter, particularly if trade
improves further as agriculture production rebounds.
</P>
<P>
According to Seva, agriculture is expected to recover its
lackluster performance during the first quarter based on the
projections of the Department of Agriculture of much improved
palay and corn production in the next quarters.
</P>
<P>
"While agriculture may suffer losses due to operations in some
areas in Mindanao, other areas will increase their rice and corn
production that would offset the expected losses," Neva said.

<HEADLINE> Writethru: Sri Lanka's Rebels Step up Suicide Attack as Political Talks Underway By Lian Guohui </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Tamil Tiger rebels on Wednesday
launched a fresh suicide bomb attack near Sri Lanka's capital of
Colombo, the second of its kind in just eight days.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government has been intensifying its efforts to
forge political consensus to help end the ethnic civil war between
government troops and the rebels, which has plagued the island for
17 years.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday morning a Tamil Tiger suicide bomber tried to
target a Sri Lankan airforce bus but only killed himself and three
civilians.
</P>
<P>
The bomber was knocked down by a cyclist as he tried to jump in
front of the bus along the main highway at Wattala, some 10
kilometers north of Colombo, police said.
</P>
<P>
The impact detonated the explosives strapped to his body,
killing him, the cyclist and another two pedestrians.
</P>
<P>
Another 13 others were wounded in the bomb blast. They had been
rushed to the National Hospital in Colombo and the Ragama hospital
for treatment.
</P>
<P>
"The attacker had clearly targeted the bus which was carrying
40 to 50 air force personnel coming into the city," Inspector
Premalal Ranagala said.
</P>
<P>
Some of the passengers were wounded airmen being taken to
hospital for routine treatment.
</P>
<P>
The airforce bus goes daily from Katunayake airforce base near
the Colombo airport in northern suburban Colombo to the
headquarters in the city.
</P>
<P>
The blast came exactly a week after Sri Lanka's Minister of
Industrial Development C.V. Gunaratne was assassinated by a
suicide bomber while he was leading a parade in southern suburban
Colombo to collect donations for government soldiers battling the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels are fighting a 17-year war to carve out a
separate homeland for minority Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and
east.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lankan police have declared a red alert in Colombo, warning
about the presence of 25 more LTTE's human bombs ready to launch
attacks.
</P>
<P>
Soldiers are posted at checkpoints throughout the capital to
guard against terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
The fresh attack came as fighting continues in the northern
Jaffna peninsula, where the LTTE rebels launched a major offensive
two months ago.
</P>
<P>
Despite the ongoing fighting, the government of President
Kumaratunga has been meeting with the main opposition United
National Party (UNP) in a bid to arrive at a broad consensus on
her August 1995 peace plan aimed at politically resolving Tamil
demands for separation by instead granting a greater degree of
autonomy.
</P>
<P>
Indian External Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh concluded his
two-day visited to Sri Lanka on Monday and urged Sri Lankan
leaders to speed up the process of formulating a new constitution
granting equal rights to Tamils.
</P>
<P>
President Kumaratunga and UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe met
Tuesday and agreed to set up an interim administration in the
island's Tamil-dominated northern and eastern provinces.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also met last Friday to discuss devolution of
power to the regional councils, but no agreement was reached.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga had said she was keen to conclude talks with the
UNP by mid-June and press ahead with the constitutional reforms at
the earliest time possible.
</P>
<P>
Any agreement between the two main parties must be presented to
parliament and approved before it stands automatically dissolved
on August 24. Therefore, fresh elections must be held by mid-
November.

<HEADLINE> India Rejects Pakistani Offer on Strategic Restraint </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"There is nothing new in the Pakistani proposal which is
essentially propagandist," the PTI quoted an Indian foreign office
spokesman as saying here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the resumption of the non-proliferation dialogue
between Pakistan and the United States, an official statement in
Islamabad said that "Pakistan has proposed to India a strategic
restraint regime for avoidance of an arms race, nuclear and
conventional, and confidence-building in the region."
</P>
<P>
According to the PTI, the Indian spokesman said that India's
security concerns extended "well beyond South Asia" and that its
security policies were not country-specific.
</P>
<P>
"It is inappropriate to look at restraint and transparency in
security matters in the narrow framework of India and Pakistan,"
he said, adding that India's security policies have always been
based on restraint, rationality and responsibility in the nuclear
field.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also reiterated India's stand that Pakistan must
"create the right environment" by stopping what it called cross-
border terrorism and hostile propaganda against India before the
peace process between the two countries could restart.

<HEADLINE> Indian Public Sector Banks Asked to Recover Bad Debts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At a meeting with chief executives of 27 public sector banks,
the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) was asked to prepare guidelines
for all banks to work out a "uniform and non-discriminatory"
recovery policy, the PTI reported.
</P>
<P>
It quoted official sources as saying that as 80 percent of the
bad debts are in the 100 million rupees (2.3 million dollars) and
below category, a one time settlement would be considered.
</P>
<P>
The RBI, which is expected to come out with its guidelines by
July 15, would specify interest waiver period as part of the one
time settlement recovery process, said the PTI.
</P>
<P>
Indian Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha has fixed September 30
as the deadline for the bank chiefs to finalize the debt recovery
program for non-performing assets, which would include attachment
of property in order to recover dues from defaulters, it added.
</P>
<P>
As part of the decision to attach property, the government also
proposes to auction the attached property to recover the dues, the
official sources added.

<P>
BEIJING, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Foreign leaders, officials of
international organizations, and two vice-chairmen of the National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC) delivered speeches on topics including trade
globalization at the 21st Century Forum here today.
</P>
<P>
Lee Kuan Yew, senior minister of Singapore said that China has
shown the world the great efforts it has made to become a
potential WTO member, adding that the decision will have potential
economic and geo-political influence on China and the rest of the
world.
</P>
<P>
John Malcolm Fraser, former prime minister of Australia,
pointed out that economic globalization greatly influences the
actions and decisions on governments. He said that China has
provided a key example of how to keep economic stability when it
succeeded in fighting devaluation of Renminbi during the Asian
Financial Crisis.
</P>
<P>
Those who also delivered speeches included CPPCC vice-chairmen
Song Jian and Chen Jinhua, Dr. Sven Sandatrom, executive vice-
president of the World Bank, Dr. Klans Schwab, president of the

<HEADLINE> WEF President On Globalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a speech to the 21st Century Forum -- Conference 2000, the
president said developing countries should create opportunities
for education and training so that their economies can be
transform into knowledge-based ones.
</P>
<P>
He said a developing country cannot develop and prosper without
well-educated and trained professionals in a global, knowledge-
based economy.
</P>
<P>
Schwab also called for the establishment of an open and
competitive policy framework on telecommunications as the future
development of all economic sectors, including agriculture,
manufacturing and service industries are increasingly more
dependent on telecommunications. He believes E-commerce is vital
for the competitiveness of all countries in the future.
</P>
<P>
Schwab urged governments of developing countries to evaluate
the influence of globalization and formulate policies accordingly.
</P>
<P>
In may take one or two decades to determine which country will
become a knowledge-based economy, but it took the world a century
to determine which countries excelled and those which were left
behind in the wake of the Industrial Revolution, the president
said.
</P>
<P>
Schwab raised the issue that with the development of Internet,
it was inevitable that people's values around the globe would
become homogenized. He warned of "cultural hegemonism" on the
Internet and said that as China has a huge population with a rich
cultural diversity, the country would have a definite impact on
the Net in the future.
</P>
<P>
The three-day forum is sponsored by the National Committee of
the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC),
China's top advisory body.
</P>
<P>
Over 500 participants, including statesmen and leaders from
around 20 countries, attended the forum's opening ceremony.

<HEADLINE> Iran Seizes Over 1.7 Tons of Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Iran's anti-narcotics agents have
seized some 1,742 kilograms of various prohibited drugs and
arrested more than 170 drug-traffickers in past weeks in the
central province of Yazd.
</P>
<P>
The province's security forces announced here on Wednesday the
drugs were seized from smugglers in searches at border checkpoints,
the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Secretary of Iran's Anti-Drug Headquarters Mohammad
Fallah on Wednesday urged the Ministry of Culture and Islamic
Guidance and other cultural bodies to provide the public with
required information about narcotic drugs to expose the dangers of
drug addiction and smuggling.
</P>
<P>
Iran sits on a major smuggling route in the transit of
prohibited drugs from its eastern neighbors -- Afghanistan and
Pakistan -- to lucrative markets in the Persian Gulf and the West.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic republic initiated a strict anti-drug campaign in
1989 after the Majlis (parliament) passed an anti-drug law
authorizing capital punishment for drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1979 Islamic revolution, Iran has spent more than one
billion U.S. dollars in anti-drug campaigns and about 3,000 Iranian
anti-drug forces have been killed in clashes with drug traffickers.

<HEADLINE> WB to Give Bangladesh Grant for Nutrition Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh will receive 4.7 billion
taka (92.01 million U.S. dollars) for its nutrition sector from
the World Bank, according to an agreement signed here between the
World Bank and the Bangladeshi government Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The amount of the grant, the biggest ever fund provided by the
World Bank in the nutrition sector worldwide, would be spent on
Bangladesh's National Nutrition Project, official sources said.
</P>
<P>
The project, which will begin from next month for a four-year
period, will be carried out in 139 upazilas (counties), aiming at
enhancing the nutrition status of the poor, women, children and
adolescent girls in particular.
</P>
<P>
With the support of the World Bank, this project will be
helpful for the government's 15-year vision to extend community
nutrition services to the entire country. The goal of the national
program is to improve nutritional status to the extent that
malnutrition will no longer be a public health problem in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The sources said despite some recent positive changes, levels
of malnutrition in Bangladesh remain the highest in the world.
</P>
<P>
Fifty percent of children under five are underweight, 51
percent stunted, and 50 percent of women suffer from chronic
energy deficiency. Low birth weight rate is estimated at 45
percent and micro-nutrient deficiencies are rampant, resulting in
over 70 percent of pregnant women being anemic, according to
recent statistics.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Military Bombs MILF Camp in Mindanao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said its
warplanes bombed Wednesday Camp Rajah Muda, the Moro Islamic
Liberation Front's (MILF) biggest base in Cotabato province.
</P>
<P>
Noel Datoyato, spokesman of the Army's Sixth Infantry Division,
said two army battalions participated in the assault aimed at
easing pressure from government forces in Pikit over continuous
MILF harassment in the area for the past several weeks.
</P>
<P>
"The local populace requested the military to destroy Camp
Rajah Muda because it is the lair of kidnappers, cattle-rustlers
and armed groups in the province," Datoyato said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Rajah Muda is one of two remaining major MILF camps in Mindanao
region. Its perimeters include Liguasan Marsh, Central Mindanao's
biggest wetland, that traverses the borders of Cotabato,
Maguindanao and Sultan Kudarat provinces.
</P>
<P>
The bombing of Camp Rajah Muda came after the chief of the Army
's Sixth Infantry Division narrowly escaped early morning ambush
perpetrated by the MILF in Maguindanao province.
</P>
<P>
Reports said Major General Gregorio Camiling was inspecting his
troops in the field when his convoy was waylaid by about 30 MILF
guerrillas along a highway in Maguindanao province at around 5:45
a.m..
</P>
<P>
Camiling escaped the ambush unscathed but the two last vehicles
of his convoy sustained damages from rebel fires. An Army
personnel was also slightly wounded in the incident.
</P>
<P>
Camiling's ambush came amid a scheduled meeting Wednesday of
government and MILF technical committee members in Cotabato City
in preparation for their fifth round of formal talks on June 28.
</P>
<P>
The 15,000-strong MILF has been fighting for an independent
Muslim state for more than two decades, a request which was
rejected repeatedly by the Philippine government.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Wen Jiabao
has called the four provinces in the densely-populated Huaihe
Valley to ensure the region does not have any major flooding
during the current flood season.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier has also urged local government leaders to
improve the flood control and prevention work, make sure proper

</P>
<P>
Wen made the remarks during his four-day inspection tour of the
Huaihe Valley, which ended Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Huaihe River runs through Henan Province in central China
and Anhui, Jiangsu and Shandong provinces in east China. More than
100 million people live in these provinces which are major grain
producer centers of the country.
</P>
<P>
Flood control projects and the reinforcement of dykes along
dangerous sections of rivers and reservoirs should be implemented
as soon as possible, the vice-premier said.
</P>
<P>
He also said harnessing the Huaihe River is a top priority, and
urged improvement in the construction of flood and water-logging
control projects along the river and its tributaries.
</P>
<P>
On the drought situation in the valley and other part of the
country, the vice-premier said water-saving irrigation, and better
management of water resources should be encouraged to fight
droughts.

<HEADLINE> More Concern be Given to Developing Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The international community should
pay close attention to demands of developing countries and help to
participate in international trade, a foreign economic expert said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Jean Matteoli, honorary chairman of the International
Association of Economic and Social Councils and Similar Institutes,
made the remark while addressing the 21st Century Forum today.
</P>
<P>
He said shares of developing countries in the world trade
increased from 12 percent in 1970 to 20 percent in 1998 since
trade globalization.
</P>
<P>
Developing countries are faced with numerous difficulties
during the process of opening up which include developing and
promoting technological innovations, said Matteoli.
</P>
<P>
Globalization may threaten cultures, said Matteoli, adding that
a controled trade globalization is the most effective way to
ensure sustainable and stable growth of different countries.
</P>
<P>
He suggested some guidelines to follow which include making
single commitments while considering the special problems of the
less-developed countries and the transitional economies, the rich
countries should satisfy the desire of some countries which
request for an appropriate transitional period and necessary
technical assistance.
</P>
<P>
Matteoli suggested measures to raise funds for the poorest
countries which find themselves unable to adapt to trade
globalization.
</P>
<P>
He said that France announced in March that it will provide 6.5
million francs to help developing countries implement WTO
agreements in the coming three years.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Welcome Globalization: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Globalization is welcomed by the
majority of scientists across the world including Chinese
scientists and engineers, said Song Jian, vice-chairman of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference.
</P>
<P>
Song Jian, who is also president of Chinese Academy of
Engineering, made the remark when he delivered a speech to the
21st Century Forum -- Conference 2000 which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
With the rapid development of science and technology,
especially information technology and Internet and e-commerce, all
countries across are connected within a network system. Global
flow of knowledge, information, capital, products and services has
become an irreversible trend, he said.
</P>
<P>
Because of the existing gap between various countries in the
world, globalization may not be beneficial to all countries in the
short term, but in the long term, it will benefit the majority, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Song concluded his speech by saying that scientists need to
make their research more accessible to the general public.

<HEADLINE> Exhibition on Contemporary Chinese Paintings to Open in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 14 (Xinhua) -- An exhibition of oil paintings,
sketchings and traditional Chinese paintings will be held at the
Hong Kong Exhibition Center from June 15 to 20 to commemorate the
late Chinese painter Wu Zuoren.
</P>
<P>
The 120 pieces of art works to be on display were selected from
about 500 paintings produced by Wu in the different stages of his
over-60-year career. Wu died just two months before China resumed
the exercise of sovereignty of Hong Kong on July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition was organized by the Hong Kong-based China
Cultural City Limited. This was the second time Wu's works are put
on display in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Born in East China's Jiangsu Province in 1908, Wu began to
delve into literature and art in his youth, and later he paid
special attention to gathering first-hand experience in life and
studied both Chinese and Western painting.
</P>
<P>
"He deserves the honor of one of the greatest artists in
Chinese modern arts history," said Hou Yimin, former president of
the China's Central Academy of Fine Arts when introducing Wu to
Hong Kong people at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Wu excelled in oil painting and was accomplished in sketching.
He was a versatile artist, well acquainted with Western art of
different periods, Hou said.
</P>
<P>
Wu studied fine arts in France and Belgium in the 1930s, and
came back to China in 1935 as professor in the Central Academy of
Fine Arts. He served as dean and president of the academy for many
years.

<HEADLINE> HK to Launch New Anti-Crime Publicity Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Police and the Home
Affairs Department (HAD) will launch four publicity events to
enhance the Police-youth partnership in the fight against crime
and deliver anti-crime messages to the community through young
people.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Hui Ki-on, commissioner of police, when
he solicited support from chairmen of the 18 District Fight Crime
Committees (DFCC) to the "2000 Fight Crime Publicity Campaign" at
a luncheon meeting at the Police Headquarters Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The four publicity events will be launched in the second half
of this year with the first being the "Help People to Help
Themselves" fight crime competition scheduled in July and August.
</P>
<P>
The DFCC chairmen, Fung Kin-man, chief superintendent of Police
Public Relations Branch, said that the Police Community Relations
Officers will invite young people in their districts to become "
Fight Crime Ambassadors", in the "Help People to Help Themselves"
fight crime competition.
</P>
<P>
"The ambassadors will be expected to conduct seminars, home
visits and community services in their respective districts and it
is hoped that through these activities, fight crime message will
be able to reach members of the public," Fung said.
</P>
<P>
The second publicity event will be the Junior Police Call (JPC)
Fight Crime Summer Camp and Fight Crime Game Stall Competition to
be held in late August.
</P>
<P>
The games stalls will be specially designed for young JPC
members and through these games the young people can have a better
understanding of the conduct of the prevailing crimes, he noted.
</P>
<P>
To further promote the fight crime message, a fight crime song
authoring and singing competition will be launched in August, to
be followed by an 18-district Fight Crime Variety Show which will
be the finale of the "2000 Fight Crime Publicity Campaign," Fung
added.

<HEADLINE> HK Govt Continues to Tackle Computer Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) government has legal powers to tackle
most forms of reported computer crimes and will continue to tackle
the problem vigorously, said Regina Ip, secretary for security of
Hong Kong, Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the "The Asian Securitex 2000 Conference," Ip said
unauthorized access to a computer by telecommunication, or what is
commonly known as hacking, is a criminal offense under the
Telecommunication Ordinance that carries a maximum fine of 20,000
HK dollars (2,560 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Moreover, access to computer with criminal or dishonest intent
carries a maximum penalty of five years' imprisonment, she added.
</P>
<P>
She noted that it was against this background that an
interdepartmental working group on computer crime was set up in
March this year.
</P>
<P>
Chaired by the Security Bureau, the working group has been
examining existing legislative and administrative measures for
dealing with computer crime, identifying new challenges faced by
law enforcement agencies as well as considering the need for
additional administrative measures and legal powers to meet these
challenges.
</P>
<P>
"In the meantime, the government will continue to tackle
computer crime vigorously, not only through enforcement of the law
but also through crime prevention efforts," she stressed.
</P>
<P>
In view of the rapidly increasing application of information
technology, Ip foresaw that apart from conventional security work,
the future development of the industry was likely to move beyond
the traditional boundaries of physical security.
</P>
<P>
She believed the security industry had an important role in
combating computer crime, in particular, in raising public
awareness that security measures should be part and parcel of the
basic requirements for managing one's information system.
</P>
<P>
The industry could also provide the right defensive tools
against cyber security risks, she added.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Issue 5,000 More Work Permits for Palestinians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
announced Wednesday that his government is considering granting 5,
000 more work permits for Palestinian residents.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the security cabinet meeting Wednesday morning,
Barak said the 5,000 Palestinian workers are among over 40,000
Palestinians who work without legal status in Israeli territories
at present, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
According to the Israel Yearbook and Almanac 1999, the number of
Palestinians who hold permits to work in Israel is 57,000 by the
end of 1998. Counting those illegal workers, nearly 100,000
Palestinians are working in Israel, the highest number in several
years.
</P>
<P>
Some strategists hope that such economic cooperation and
coexistence will promote friendship and mutual understanding
between Israeli and Palestinian people, and thus enhance the
chances to reach a peace accord between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Barak also said on Wednesday that as a result of the good
cooperation with the Palestinians on security matters, his
government will also release three Palestinian prisoners as a good-
will gesture. It is not immediately clear when the release will be
carried out.
</P>
<P>
There are nearly 1,600 Palestinian security prisoners remaining
in Israeli prisons. The Palestinians had urged Israelis to release
them at once.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the work-permits issuing and the prisoner
release are among a series of gestures aimed to create a good
atmosphere for the Israeli-Palestinian talks, which resumed near
Washington on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The talks are aimed to reach a framework agreement for a
permanent peace accord by September on final-status issues, such as
the fate of Jerusalem, Palestinian refugees, Jewish settlements,
borders, security and water.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Pledges New Loan for Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has pledged another
one billion U.S. dollars for Indonesia's state budget for the
fiscal year 2000, according to World Bank country representative
Mark Baird.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters here Wednesday, Baird said the bank has
already disbursed 1.5 billion dollars for the 2000 state budget as
part of its commitment during the meeting of the Consultative
Group on Indonesia (CGI) last February.
</P>
<P>
"Part of that represents the ongoing implementation of projects
financed by the World Bank that would normally run about 400
million to 500 million dollars a year. On top of that, we agreed
to finance around one billion dollars of budget support partly
from adjustment operations already approved including the social
safety net operation and partly from lending opportunities," he
said.
</P>
<P>
At this stage, World Bank and the Indonesian government are
discussing the implementation of the social safety net operation.
</P>
<P>
"We are satisfied with the progress and hope it will continue
as we can disburse the remaining funds in this fiscal year," he
was quoted by the Antara News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Baird however said the new adjustment lending program still
depends on the progress of the reform agenda, particularly in the
field of good governance and poverty alleviation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, visiting World Bank Vice President Jemal-ud-din
Kassum told reporters here Wednesday that the substantial progress
in the key areas of reform programs especially governance,
decentralization and forest management in the next few months will
set the stage for a successful CGI meeting in Tokyo from October
17 to 18.
</P>
<P>
"The success of CGI meeting will depend on how much the
government could demonstrate its seriousness in conducting the
reforms in these key areas," said Kassum, who arrived here on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The CGI is a forum where the Indonesian government and the
country's major lenders meet to discuss and assess its economic
cooperation programs.
</P>
<P>
During his two-day visit, Kassum used the occasion of his trip
to chair an informal meeting of local CGI representatives and
senior government officials to discuss how far Indonesia has
carried out its reforms and what will be the focus of government
actions in the months ahead of the next CGI meeting.
</P>
<P>
"The international donors continued to support Indonesia.
Participants at the donors' informal meeting expressed concern
about progress in key areas of the reform programs, especially on
governance, decentralization and forest management," he added.

<HEADLINE> Tree Plantation Campaign Launched in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 14 (Xinhua) -- A three-month countrywide tree
plantation campaign started in Bangladesh Wednesday with a call
for massive afforestation for better life and living.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina formally launched the drive at a
function in the afternoon with awarding the winners in the "Prime
Minister's National Award for Tree Plantation 1999."
</P>
<P>
A 15-day Tree Fair is also inaugurated by the prime minister at
the National Parade Ground, where saplings of different varieties
of plants, including timber trees, flowers, fruit trees and
decorative plants are on display and available for public.
</P>
<P>
President Shahabuddin Ahmed in a message to mark the start of
the campaign urged all to plant trees instead of depending on
natural forest alone, saying there was no alternative to tree for
healthy living and sustainable environment.
</P>
<P>
In a similar message, Hasina said plantation of tree is a
national responsibility as its was an essential element for human
life and livelihood.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, afforestation drive made by government through
planting foreign tree saplings is threatening the ecology of the
country, experts warned.
</P>
<P>
Foreign trees, having different characteristics from native
ones are being planted in a haphazard way across the country,
resulting in elimination of local trees and threatening the
country's bio-diversity, according to a survey conducted by the
Zoology Department of Dhaka University.
</P>
<P>
President of Wildlife Society of Bangladesh Qazi Zaker Hossain
stressed the need for planting local trees for a better eco-system
in the country.
</P>
<P>
"Besides a huge number of birds and insects, the country is
going to lose a number of precious animals like elephants and deer
due to the plantation of foreign trees, replacing local ones," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Optimistic of Sustaining Strong Growth: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia remains optimistic
of sustaining its positive growth despite some expectations of a
hard landing in the U.S. economy, Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We have reasonable hope that we can sustain our growth," he
told reporters after a function here.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's 11.7 percent growth during the first quarter this
year has spurred a wave of upgrades by foreign investment houses
for the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
The economic growth in the second half of this year may not be
as high as that in the first and second quarters, Mahathir said,
adding that however, the second half year's GDP growth would still
be higher than the 1999 third quarter figure of 8.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Bank Negara (State Bank) Malaysia has forecast a GDP growth of
between 7.5 and 8.0 percent for this year.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian President Hails Deal With Strikers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun
Obasanjo, though backed up on the issue of petrol price hike, has
hailed his pact with the strikers as "victory for democracy."
</P>
<P>
Nigerian press Wednesday quoted Doyin Okupe, President
Obasanjo's Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, as saying on
Tuesday that "the issue is not really that of happiness but what
we are really happier about is that Nigeria is back on track."
</P>
<P>
"This is a triumph of democracy," said the presidential
spokesman, adding that unlike the military regime which does not
provide room for dialogue and negotiation, the people of Nigeria
and the Nigerian Labor Congress have spoken, and a responsive and
sensitive government of President Obasanjo "has bowed to the
wishes of the majority of the Nigerian people."
</P>
<P>
Defending the increase in fuel prices, Okupe said: "the
increase was not a frivolous act or an irrational concept but done
based on insider's knowledge of the fact that subsidy at one point
or the other had to be systematically removed in order to
strengthen the economy."
</P>
<P>
He said despite the shortage of funds, the government is
prepared to abide by the decisions reached.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian trade union leaders Tuesday called off a crippling
general strike after they reached an agreement with the government
over the petrol price hike, which was announced earlier this
month.
</P>
<P>
The deal comes a day after Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo
 apologized for not consulting widely enough on the increase in
fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
A statement by the Nigerian Labor Congress in Lagos said the
increases for petrol and other fuels would be restricted to about
10 percent, and it called on workers to resume work immediately.
</P>
<P>
The government had originally imposed a 50 percent increase,
causing the five-day strike, which nearly paralyzed the Africa' s
largest oil producing country.

Golmud has grown into the third largest city in the Qinghai-
Tibet Plateau, known as the "Roof of the World," after Xining,
capital of Qinghai, and the Tibetan capital of Lhasa.
</P>
<P>
"We have over 50 types of natural resources such as oil,
natural gas, gold and jade. What's more, over 75 percent of the
country's kalium, natrium, magnesium and lithium are deposited
here," said Golmud Mayor Zhang Xu.
</P>

lakes in the world; experts estimated that resources in the lake
are worth at least 12,000 billion yuan (1,445 billion U.S. dollars)
.
</P>
<P>
According to Mayor Zhang, the city is now on its fastest
development track since the central government launched the
western development strategy last year.
</P>
<P>
"The city has never attracted so much attention and so many
investments before," said Zhang, adding that several key projects,
each with over ten million U.S. dollars of investment, like those
for urban water supply, railway construction and airport expansion,
are going smoothly.

<P>
XINING, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Few people can give a reliable
picture of what Beijing was like before it became a city. But in
Golmud, nearly half of the residents can paint a clear image: no
trees, no houses, only endless desert.
</P>
<P>
As a city, Beijing has a history of over 3,000 years; Golmud,
at 20, is just a kid in an ancient land.
</P>
<P>
Here in Golmud, the shops, bars, parks, squares, neon signs,
advertisements and even new American-styled fast food restaurants
give the city a Beijing-like gloss, but the "hutongs," or old
narrow alleys, so common in the Chinese capital, are absent.
</P>
<P>
The oldest building in the city is a two-story house built some
40 years ago. Here, a general of the People's Liberation Army drew
up the blueprint for the famous Qinghai-Tibet Highway.
</P>
<P>
Today the general is regarded as the "father of the city" as
well as the creator of the highway over which more than 90 percent
of the goods to and from Tibet are transported.

"Golmud is at a traffic hub linking China's Gansu and Qinghai
provinces and the autonomous regions of Xinjiang and Tibet. It is
also the core area of the natural resources concentrated in the
Qaidam Basin. This explains why the city was born and why it has
grown so fast," said Jin Bei, a research fellow with the Chinese
Academy of Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
In 1954, a number of highway workers and resource prospectors
pitched tents along the Golmud River, and stayed on after their
projects were completed. Later, with more and more young people
coming from all over China, the government decided to formally set
up the city of Golmud. Inauguration day was June 14, 1980.

<HEADLINE> China to Formulate Law on Popularization of Sciences </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 14 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislative body has a
law in the works on the dissemination of sciences among the
general public, totaling 1.3 billion people, senior officials said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Yutai, vice-chairman of the China Association for
Science and Technology, said today he was among a group of
lawmakers, legal experts and scientists on a recent tour of
Nanjing, the capital of east China's Jiangsu Province, and
Shanghai to gain information which would help them to draft the
law.
</P>
<P>
The tour was organized by China's top legislative body, the
National People's Congress, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhang made the remarks in an opening speech to a three-day
national seminar on popular science programs, which was attended
by nearly 100 science fiction writers, popular science writers and
scientists renowned for their efforts in spreading knowledge of
science in their easy-to-understand articles and lectures.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe the law will promote the general public's
awareness of science and technology, which in turn will facilitate
the economic, social and cultural development in China.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people's lack of science awareness forms a sharp
contrast with the rapid development of science and technology in
other parts of the world and falls far short of the requirements
of China's strategic plan to invigorate the country through
science and technology, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
China has between 80 and 120 million people who are illiterate
or semi-literate, while superstitions and pseudoscientific
practices have been rampant in parts of the country in recent
years, he said.
</P>
<P>
This clearly proves China's need for exposing and fighting
superstition and pseudoscience through science and technology,
Zhang said.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Official Urges Developing Countries to Brave Challenges of Globalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The managing director of the World
Bank said today that the world "cannot turn the clock back on
globalization, because the technological advances that have fueled
it cannot be uninvented" and the pace and scope of development are
both increasing.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Sven Sandstrom was speaking at the 21st Century Forum,
which opened here today. The conference is sponsored by the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Dr. Sandstrom urged developing countries to take
advantage of the opportunities created by the globalization to
squarely face the challenges that will ultimately arise.
</P>
<P>
He said that the breathtaking speed of global integration has
progressed in distinct waves: first in trade, then in financial
markets, and now in information and knowledge.
</P>
<P>
Sandstrom addressed the uneven pace of globalization in
different countries, noting that "about half of the world's
population has never made a phone call. Roughly 90 percent of
Internet host computers are located in high-income countries that
account for only 16 percent of world population."
</P>
<P>
"Education is the key to creating, acquiring, adapting and
using knowledge, as well as to competing in the 'new economy',"
the official stressed.
</P>
<P>
He urged developing countries to strengthen financial reform
and establish a modern social security system in the process of
globalization.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Development of China's Legal Aid System (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 14 (Xinhua) -- With the reform, opening up and
development of China's socialist market economy, law has become
the major means of keeping order in society, and legal services
also have become one of the people's basic requirements for
protecting their legitimate rights and interests.
</P>
<P>
With the changes in the economic system and in people's
interests, a disparity is emerging between the rich and the poor,
resulting in situations in which a number of people are not able
to afford a lawyer. These people do not have the financial means
for maintaining their due rights.
</P>
<P>
To ensure that China's poor and disabled enjoy the same right
to legal services as wealthier citizens do, that justice and human
rights are safeguarded, and that the constitutional principle of "
equality for all before the law" is realized, the Ministry of
Justice in early 1994 established a legal aid system and
experimented with the practice in some large and medium-sized
cities.
</P>
<P>
In March and May 1996, the Criminal Procedure Law and the
Lawyers Law were respectively promulgated, which formally
established the legal aid system within the Chinese legal
framework.
</P>
<P>
The two laws jump-started the practice of legal aid across the
country.

<HEADLINE> China to Enhance Adverse Drug Reaction Monitoring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 14 (Xinhua) -- China plans to enhance the
surveillance of adverse drug reactions (ADR) by improving the
monitoring system nationwide and urging pharmaceutical enterprises,
drug stores and hospitals to report ADR cases.
</P>
<P>
A government regulation asking for strict procedures for ADR
monitoring has been in effect since late last year. "Further
implementation of the order and education for the general public
are needed at present," said Wang Xiaoling, a staff member at the
National Center for ADR Monitoring.
</P>
<P>
Although the national center opened in 1989, only 12 of the
total 31 Chinese provinces have established branch centers so far,
Wang said, adding that the other provinces will have to set up
centers eventually.
</P>
<P>
Pharmaceutical enterprises, Chinese agents of foreign medicines,
drug retailers, hospitals and other medical institutions are
responsible for collecting and reporting ADR cases, according to
the order.
</P>
<P>
Drug consumers can also report ADR cases to local monitoring
centers and drug administrations. Wang Xiaoling noted that the
reports from consumers would be an important source of ADR
discovery, as more and more over-the-counter drugs are available
in the country.
</P>
<P>
For any new medicine with a marketing period of not longer than
five years, any ADR cases, whether alleged or confirmed, will have
to be reported. Reporting of severe, rare or new ADR cases of old
drugs is also mandatory.
</P>
<P>
The State Drug Administration will publish the report on ADR
monitoring randomly to keep the public on the alert, Wang said.

In April 1997, the Joint Circular on Legal Aid for Criminal
Cases was jointly issued by the Supreme People's Court and the
Ministry of Justice. In May and November of the same year, the
Circular on Developing Legal Aid and Circular on Legal Aid in
Notary Services were respectively published by the Ministry of
Justice. In May 1999, the Joint Circular on Several Issues
Concerning Legal Aid in Civil Cases was released by the Supreme
People's Court and the Ministry of Justice. In April 2000, the
Joint Circular on Developing Legal Aid in Criminal Procedure
Activities was issued by the Supreme People's Procuratorate and
the Ministry of Justice.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, local rules and regulations on legal aid have been
issued at local levels, placing China's legal aid system on a
steady track.
</P>
<P>
In order to carry out the national legal aid system effectively,
government legal aid agencies have been set up in China at both
the national and local levels. The agencies consist of a legal aid
organizational structure of four tiers at the national, provincial,
prefecture and county levels.
</P>
<P>
The Legal Aid Center of the Ministry of Justice was established
on December 16, 1996, and presently has 23 staff members.
</P>
<P>
By May 31, 2000, legal aid centers were respectively formed in
29 provinces, 16 cities, 285 prefectures and 1,152 counties. Legal
aid centers are under construction in other areas as well.
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are over 4,000 professional staff working in
legal aid. In addition to legal services provided by the
professional staff, some lawyers, public notaries, legal
assistants at the grassroots communities and some legal aid
service volunteers of social organizations and law schools have
also become involved in legal aid services organized by the legal
aid agencies at all levels.

<HEADLINE> China Starts to Unearth Ancient Imperial Porcelain Kiln </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeologists recently
started to excavate an ancient imperial porcelain kiln which had
produced extremely delicate chinaware in the Northern Song Dynasty
(960-1127).
</P>
<P>
Among the five most famous kilns in the dynasty, the Ruguanyao
in Baofeng County of central Henan Province produced porcelain
pieces which were presented to the court for imperial use about 1,
000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The unique technique used by kiln workers was lost during
wartime. Experts estimated that the world now has only 60 existing
treasures of the kind, each of which is valued at 10 million U.S.
dollars, the Shanghai-based Wenhui Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
An expert with the Shanghai Museum accidentally found a piece
of delicate porcelain from a local resident and finally found the
original site of the Ruguanyao.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists have determined that the site covers an area of
250,000 square meters, the newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> Nobel Prize Winner Tells The Secret of Learning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 14 (Xinhua) -- "Raising questions" is an
important part of learning, Nobel Prize Winner, Chinese-American
scientist Prof. T. D. Lee said to some middle school students in
Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
After a visit to the China Science and Technology Museum, Prof.
Lee gave a brief speech to a group of middle school students who
came from the five major middle schools in the capital.
</P>
<P>
He said that to study something better, one should first learn
to ask questions. If a student can only remember answers to all
the questions teachers teach, it is not real learning. He also
encouraged young people to learn to find possible solutions to
their questions.
</P>
<P>
One of the major purposes of the China Science and Technology
Museum is to help young people learn to ask questions and find
answers for themselves, said Zhang Yutai, vice-president of the
Chinese Association of Science and Technology. He said that Prof.
Lee's words reflect a shift from test-oriented questions to
quality-oriented education in China.
</P>
<P>
The museum, founded in 1988, has just completed its new
exhibition hall which cost more than 100 million yuan (about 12
million US dollars). Some 200,000 visitors have visited the museum
since it opened in April.

<HEADLINE> Israel Expects Serious Shortage of Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Israel will face a serious water
shortage problem next year that may affect urban and even domestic
use, the Ha'aretz daily reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The problem may also endanger the quality of groundwater and the
water of the Kinnereth (or the Sea of Galilee), the paper quoted
the Nekorot Water Company and senior water officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the summer, the water level of the Kinnereth,
Israel's prime water source, will drop below the lowest red line --
minus 214 meters, according to the latest figures.
</P>
<P>
The level of the mountain aquifer will drop to a level that
could cause the salinization of the reservoir.
</P>
<P>
If Israel undergoes yet another drought next year, it is likely
to suffer a shortage of drinking water of 130 million cubic meters,
even if the allocation of potable water to farmers is completely
halted.
</P>
<P>
In such a situation, says the paper, it will not be possible to
use even the groundwater reservoirs, because they will provide only
saline water.
</P>
<P>
Water officials said that the recent decisions by the
government, including the establishment of a desalination plant,
and making wells usable, will not provide an immediate solution to
the crisis, because these decisions will be implemented only in a
few years' time.
</P>
<P>
If water consumption continues to rise and no significant new
sources of water are developed, the state of Israel's water system
will not improve, even if the country enjoys a few successive rainy
years.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the expected annual water deficit of 120 million
cubic meters will persist and the level of the Kinnereth will
continue to drop each year by about 70 centimeters, falling as low
as 215 meters or even lower below the sea level.
</P>
<P>
The mountain aquifer will continue to lose about 1.4 meters in
height each year and will drop far below the red line, said the
report.

<HEADLINE> Annan Due to Arrive in Beirut Monday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 14 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan
will visit Lebanon Monday as part of a Middle East tour, An Nahar
newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
The tour, including Saudi Arabia, Iran, Lebanon, Syria, Israel
and Egypt, starts Wednesday. Annan will be accompanied by a 25-man
team including his personal envoy Terje Roed Larsen, the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
Annan hopes the international team will complete the
verification of the Israeli withdrawal according to the 1923 border
line as soon as possible, to enable him to report to the U.N.
Security Council on the issue, a diplomatic source said.
</P>
<P>
The paper also quoted the United Nations Interim Force in
Lebanon (UNIFIL) sources as saying the complications encountered in
the border verification process were purely technical due to the
rugged nature of the terrain.
</P>
<P>
"The border line is clear on the map, but on the field there are
certain complications due to the rugged nature of the territory and
the U.N. experts have to cross a few kilometers sometimes to reach
a certain point on the line," the unidentified sources said.
</P>
<P>
They noted that if the U.N. experts complete the verification of
the withdrawal Wednesday, Annan will be able to convene the
Security Council in a closed session and submit his report to
confirm Israel's military withdrawal from south Lebanon and the
western Bekaa.
</P>
<P>
The report will include details of Larsen's mission in
identifying the border line, the sources said, saying the report
will also mention the Lebanese government's reservations over
certain points on the border which it considers as Lebanese land
still occupied by Israel.
</P>
<P>
Afterwards, Annan will announce a halt in Israel's military
activities, on the land, in the air and at sea and will ask
UNIFIL's commander to redeploy the international peacekeeping force
in a new zone of operation, the sourced added.

<HEADLINE> IDF Preparing for More Violence in Territories </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The Israel Defense Forces (IDF)
expects another round of violent clashes in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip with the Palestinians, including exchanges of gunfire like
last month's, reported a local daily Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The eruption could come almost immediately if the current round
of Israeli-Palestinian peace talks end without a commitment from
Israel to a final troop withdrawal from the territories, Jerusalem
Post quoted a senior military source as saying.
</P>
<P>
The chances of violence eruption grow as September 13
approaches, the date for the two sides to sign a final peace
agreement, said the source, adding that if the two sides fail to
reach a peace agreement by then, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
has said that he would declare an independent Palestinian state
with Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
The source said that any excuse could be used to incite the
Palestinians, from the release of Palestinian prisoners to Jewish
settlements and Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
IDF's withdrawal from south Lebanon, coupled with the death of
Syrian President Hafez al-Assad, would cause the Palestinians to
harden their positions in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Israeli-Palestinian negotiations on interim and final-status
issues resumed Tuesday in the Washington area. The United States is
hopeful that the teams will resolve disputes over the West Bank
redeployment and other interim issues and narrow the gaps on final-
status issues such as Jerusalem and Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
Israel completed its troop withdrawal from south Lebanon on May
24.
</P>
<P>
Anyway, the source said that the IDF has implemented a doctrine
on dealing with low intensity conflict in the territories. Israeli
reserve forces in the West Bank have been mostly replaced with
forces trained especially to deal with Palestinian unrest.
</P>
<P>
At least six Palestinians were killed and hundreds of others
wounded in violent clashes in May.
</P>
<P>
Under the Oslo accords the two sides signed in 1993, Israel has
to hand over all the remaining territories in the West Bank to the
Palestinians during the third, or the last Israeli troop
redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Israel has so far transferred about 40 percent of the West Bank
to Palestinian control.

Found in 1936, the Liangzhu site roughly covers an area of 33.8
square kilometers near Yuhang County.

HONG KONG, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The benchmark Hang Seng Index of
Hong Kong stocks went up by 164.13 points, or 1.05 percent, to

Buying in the afternoon trading triggered by a recovery in

analysts.

The Hong Kong stocks opened 68.49 points, or 0.44 percent,
higher at 15,761.43 points in the hope that further interest rate
rises to cool the U.S. economy would be limited with soft U.S.

The rise was later dampened by profit taking. The morning
session closed 21.93 points, or 0.14 percent, lower at 15,671.01

contributing 38 points to the rise of the HSI.
</P>
<P>
Market heavyweight China Telecom bucked the market trend to
drop 0.8 percent to 62 HK dollars. Analysts said the stock, along

<HEADLINE> HK Legislature Passes Amended Arbitration Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The Arbitration (Amendment) Bill
2000 was passed in the Legislative Council of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR) Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The bill seeks to make it possible that with the leave of the
court, arbitral awards made either in or outside Hong Kong are
summarily enforceable in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"The bill will facilitate the enforcement in Hong Kong of
awards made in countries or territories which are not parties to
the New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of
Foreign Arbitral Awards 1958," said a spokesman for the Department
of Justice of the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
"The bill which has the support of the members of the legal and
arbitration profession will further enhance the Hong Kong SAR's
reputation as an international arbitration center," the spokesman
added.
</P>
<P>
Within this session of the Legislative Council, two pieces of
legislation were passed to strengthen the mechanisms for enforcing
arbitral awards in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The other is the Arbitration (Amendment) Ordinance passed last
January, under which arbitral awards made on the mainland by
recognized arbitral authorities may be summarily enforced in Hong
Kong.

<HEADLINE> Murderer on Pope Extradited to Turkey from Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Mehmet Ali Agca, a Turkish national
who attempted to assassinate Pope John Paul II in 1981, was
extradited to Turkey early Wednesday morning, according to the
private NTV.
</P>
<P>
Agca, who had been sentenced to life imprisonment because of his
1981 assassination attempt, was pardoned Tuesday by Italian
President Carlo Azeglia Ciampi.
</P>
<P>
After 19 years behind bars in Italy, he seems to have suffered
mental illness. His release was justified by his "good conduct and
loss of memory," the report said.
</P>
<P>
Two years before he shot and wounded the Pope, the former member
of the far-right Turkish Grey Wolves movement murdered Abdi Ipekci,
chief editor of leading Turkish-language daily Milliyet, in 1979.
</P>
<P>
He was caught shortly, but escaped from a high-security military
prison in Turkey in November of that year.
</P>
<P>
Agca was sentenced to death in absentia later. According to an
amendment his sentence was reduced to 10 years in jail.
</P>
<P>
Justice Minister Hikmet Sami Turk said on Tuesday that Agca
would continue to stay in prison for 10 more years in Turkey.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Solomon Islands' resigned Prime
Minister Bartholomew Ulufa'alu on Wednesday cancelled the
scheduled parliamentary vote for a new prime minister, the
Australian Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
Ulufa'alu suggested that a cross-party 12 member committee be
formed to negotiate a permanent ceasefire between warring militias.
</P>
<P>
According to his suggestion, six government coalition members
and six opposition/independent members must be in the committee to
negotiate a permanent ceasefire and also arrange a surrender of
arms so that a free parliament can meet in 14 days to elect a new
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The parliament vote was scheduled on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ulufa'alu resigned Tuesday night and the resignation was
officially accepted by Governor-General John Inilapli Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters he had resigned under pressure from the
Malaita Eagle Force (MEF), "but also in the hope that it will pave
the way for a lasting solution."
</P>
<P>
"The people who did the coup said my resignation would clear
the way for peace (but) the lobbying going on now is almost at the
barrel of a gun," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
Cao Yong, CEO of the company, said that though China has
witnessed rapid e-commerce development, Chinese firms need e-
commerce software specially developed for them.
</P>
<P>
Most of the current e-commerce application platforms used by
Chinese firms come from overseas. But for Chinese firms with low
Internet application levels and limited Internet access, foreign
platforms are dissatisfactory.
</P>
<P>
China now has more than 1,000 e-commerce websites, and their
sales volume for this year is expected to reach 350 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
But experts agreed that China's e-commerce is in its
preliminary stage and its further development needs cooperation
from all corners of the society.
</P>
<P>
Gao Xinmin, vice-director of the State Information Association,
suggested that Chinese software producers develop more e-commerce
modes and better services for Chinese firms.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that they make studies of the true needs of
Chinese firms, follow overseas advanced technology, and pay
attention to after-sale services and the mobile e-commerce
development.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has extended his deadline
over whether to dismiss six rebel ministers by another two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Saying he prefers "brotherly love over senseless hatred," Barak
made television appearances Tuesday night, as he had done last
week, to explain that he wants to give the largest coalition rebel,
Shas, more time to exploit the fact that the "door is still open."
</P>
<P>
It remains unclear whether Barak will hold a special cabinet
meeting before his noon deadline Wednesday to take the formal
decision to activate the Transition Law clause, which empowers the
prime minister to fire the ministers who voted for the early-
elections bill.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israel will face a serious water shortage next year that may
affect urban and even domestic use, endangering the quality of
groundwater and the water of the Kinneret (Sea of Galilee).
</P>
<P>
From this year's figures, it is already clear that by the end of
the summer, the level of the Kinneret will drop below the lowest
red line discussed so far -- minus 214 meters. The level of the
mountain aquifer will drop to a level that could cause the
salinization of the reservoir.
</P>
<P>
If Israel suffers yet another drought next year, it is likely to
suffer a shortage of drinking water of 130 million cubic meters,
even if the allocation of potable water to farmers is completely
halted.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Delegations headed by Israeli Finance Minister Avraham
Shochat and Histadrut labor federation chair Amir Peretz met
Tuesday to discuss the government's tax reform proposals, but the
talks got off to a thorny start.
</P>
<P>
After fruitless wrangling over the procedural issues, the sides
agreed that Finance Ministry Director-General Avi Ben-Bassat and
Histadrut trade unions chief Shlomo shani would try to hammer out a
framework by Thursday to enable the talks to continue.
</P>
<P>
The Histadrut labor federation threatened a general strike last
week but cancelled the plan after Shochat decided to free the
legalization of the tax reform which the Histadrut claims will harm
the interests of the low wage earners.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) expects another round of
violent clashes with the Palestinians, including exchanges of
gunfire like last month's.
</P>
<P>
The eruption could come almost immediately if the current round
of peace talks with the Palestinians ends, for example, without a
commitment from Israel for a third withdrawal, a senior military
source said.
</P>
<P>
"The chances of violence erupting grows as we approach September
13," a date Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has said he would
declare a state, the senior military source said, adding that the
date was not necessarily sacred.

<HEADLINE> New Majlis Moves to Bar Police Entry into Universities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Mindful of last July's widespread
unrest sparked by a police raid on a university dormitory, members
of Iran's newly constituted Majlis (parliament) have filed a motion
barring any security or military personnel from entering
universities.
</P>
<P>
On the basis of this motion, armed personnel are not allowed to
enter "universities and other entities affiliated to the Ministry
of Science, Research and Technology," the official Islamic Republic
News Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Emergency cases would have to be decided on a university
chancellor's proposal, agreed upon by the minister of science,
research and technology or the health minister, an unnamed
parliament member said.
</P>
<P>
He said the motion has been submitted to the parliament for
approval. The new parliament, dominated by reformists, started work
on May 27.
</P>
<P>
A raid in July last year of a Tehran University dormitory by
police and plainclothes sparked in Tehran and other cities six days
of bloody riots, believed to be the worst of its kind since the
aftermath of the 1979 Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
The raid came as students protested news restrictions and the
closing down of the outspoken Persian-language daily Salam by the
conservative authorities. At least two people were reportedly
killed and many more injured in the clashes.
</P>
<P>
Iranian reformists have charged the attack was pre-arranged and
politically motivated with an aim to crack down on the freedom-
seeking movement in the country.
</P>
<P>
Tehran police chief Farhad Nazari, later sacked, was eventually
held responsible for the incident.
</P>
<P>
His trial along with co-defendants commenced in a Tehran
military court on February 18 and ended on May 27 after 15
sessions. A final verdict on the case is due soon.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Leaves for Washington Summit with Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
Wednesday left here for a Washington summit meeting with U.S.
President Bill Clinton, as Israeli and Palestinian negotiators
resumed their final-status talks on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
During Thursday's summit the White House, Arafat will urge
Clinton to exert more pressure on Israel to implement signed
agreements, said Arafat's advisor Nabil Abu Rudeina.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Palestinian side wanted the United States to
continue active efforts to push forward the peace process and help
remove obstacles standing in the way of peacemaking.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who last met Clinton in April, was accompanied by Abu
Rudeina and Secretary General of the Executive Committee of
Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) Mahmoud Abbas.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's visit to Washington was postponed by one day to
Thursday, due to his attending late Syrian President Hafez al-
Assad's funeral in Damascus on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
On June 1, Clinton met with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak in
Lisbon, Portugal, on the Middle East situation in the aftermath of
Israeli troop withdrawal from south Lebanon on May 24.

<HEADLINE> Singapore's Unemployment Up in First Quarter of 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Retrenchment and unemployment
rose in Singapore in the first quarter of this year despite a
strong 9.1 percent growth recorded in the period, according to an
official report on the labor market released by Singapore Ministry
of Manpower (MOM) Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Overall unemployment in March 2000 reached 58,100 persons,
rising to 3.4 percent from 2.9 percent in December 1999 when
unemployment dipped sharply because of a higher than usual
increase in temporary employment resulting from millennium
celebrations.
</P>
<P>
A total of 6,046 workers were retrenched in the quarter, after
the retrenchment had risen from a low of around 3,400 per quarter
in the initial three quarters to 4,475 in the last quarter of last
year. MOM said this was a reflection of on-going restructuring and
consolidation of companies in response to intense global
competition and rapid advances in technology.
</P>
<P>
Overall re-employment of retrenched workers fell in March 2000,
with 64 percent of locals retrenched in the fourth quarter of 1999
having been re-employed by march 2000, compared with the 68
percent experienced three months ago.
</P>
<P>
However, the first quarter of this year still saw the total
employment rising by 13,737, the fourth consecutive quarterly
employment expansion since the 1998 economic downturn, although
the number is lower than 26,286 in the last quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The number of job vacancies strengthened by 19 percent to reach
26,182 as at March 2000 from 21,965 three month ago.
</P>
<P>
MOM also said that employment outlook for the second quarter of
2000 is optimistic with employment creation this year expected to
return to pre-crisis level which ranged from 50,000 to 75,000
annually from 1995 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, MOM declared, retrenchment is likely to continue
given the rapid pace of changes and restructuring in the economy.

<HEADLINE> Philippines, U.S. Hold Naval Exercise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 14 (Xinhua) -- A two-week naval exercise between
the Philippines and the United States formally started on
Wednesday, the Philippine Presidential Palace said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The "Cooperation Afloat Readiness and Training 2000" is a Navy
to Navy joint training exercise and is among the Mutual Defense
Trade-related exercises approved by the Philippine and United
States governments last year, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It is the second war game held this year between the two
countries in the Philippines. The first, coded Balikatan (shoulder
to shoulder) and involving close to 5,000 troops from both
countries, was held in February in various parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,680 Filipinos and 2,008 U.S. sailors and marines
are taking part in these exercises which will be conducted in
Manila Bay and the provinces of Zambales, Nueva Ecija, and Cavite.
</P>
<P>
Five vessels from the Philippine Navy and another five from the
U.S. Navy will be participating in the exercises.
</P>
<P>
The training exercise, which is authorized under the Visiting
Forces Agreement, is designed to promote inter-operability between
U.S. and Philippine forces in the areas of operational planning
command and control, tactics and community relations projects.
</P>
<P>
The statement stressed that the presence of U.S. troops and
vessels has nothing to do with the present situation in Mindanao
where government troops and Muslim rebels were locked in fierce
battles recently.
</P>
<P>
It is the first phase in a series of combined exercises which
the United States will conduct in the Pacific. The Americans will
also hold naval exercises with Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia,
Singapore and Thailand later this year.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Herdsmen Jailed for Invading Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 14 (Xinhua) -- More than 60 herdsmen from Kenya's
Pokot and Samburu tribes have been sentenced to a one-month
imprisonment for invading a private farm in central Kenya,
according to a local court.
</P>
<P>
They were charged with two counts of damaging electric fence of
Collin Thomson's farm and invading his ranch on June 10, the Daily
Nation newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Nyahururu court in Kenya's Rift Valley Province was told
that the intruders included two administration policemen.
</P>
<P>
Due to the current protracted drought, a large amount of
livestock have died of thirst in arid and semi-arid areas of
Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi said that the entry of some
herdsmen into private farms has nothing similar to what happened
in Zimbabwe, where landless black veterans had demanded
redistribution of white-owned farms.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Parliament has
ratified the Treaty for the establishment of the East African
Community (EAC) among Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda, local news media
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The House in the central town of Dodoma also discussed the
issue of enrolling new EAC members when approved the treaty
submitted by Minister for Foreign Affairs and International
Co-operation Jakaya Kikwete on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers said that parliaments in the three east African
countries should be consulted before neighboring countries are
invited to join the regional group.
</P>
<P>
They argued that some of the countries in the region were
facing serious problems which should be resolved before they were
allowed to join the EAC.
</P>
<P>
They urged Tanzanians to be aggressive and invest heavily in
the EAC member states in order to benefit from the EAC treaty.
</P>
<P>
Minister Kikwete told the parliament that the EAC Secretariat
would hold a seminar in Zanzibar, an island state off Tanzanian
mainland, between June 22 and 23 on East African Private Sector
Development Strategy.
</P>
<P>
The EAC was founded on November 30, 1999 when Kenya, Tanzania
and Uganda signed a treaty to replace the then East African
Cooperation.

recruit and retain troops.
</P>
<P>
The bill, approved 95-3, pays for Defense Department programs
in the fiscal year that starts October 1. It now must be
reconciled with a House-passed version that is about 1 billion
dollars less expensive. The Senate bill is a 3-billion-dollar
increase over the request by President Bill Clinton and boosts
spending by nearly 20 billion dollars over last year. (U.S.-Budget)

<HEADLINE> New Businesses Return Glamour to "Porcelain Capital" (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Huayi Group, a major Chinese producer of freon-free compressors
and refrigerators, is one of the local enterprises to gain local
government support.
</P>
<P>
The group is to increase its annual output of freon-free
compressors to five million and has been exporting environment-
friendly products to Germany, Britain, Japan and other countries
and regions.
</P>
<P>
Huayi ranks first among all local big state-owned enterprises
with its more than 57 million yuan of pre-tax profits in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Totally, an additional 16 industrial sectors ranging from
machinery, electronics, chemicals to foodstuffs have blossomed in
Jingdezhen.
</P>
<P>
These fast-growing sectors have replaced porcelain-making as
local economic backbones and contributed as much as 93 percent of
the city's 1999 industrial output value, which stood at 11.3
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Though Jingdezhen has changed from a traditional-industry city
into a modern-industry city, it continues paying attention to
improving the porcelain sector, in a bid to re-establish its new
image of "porcelain capital," Mayor Chen said.
</P>
<P>
In 1997 the city's porcelain-making industry began large-scale
enterprise reorganization, paving the way for the emergence of
giant ceramics shareholding companies and private firms.
</P>
<P>
The Jingdezhen Ceramics Co. Ltd., the largest company of its
kind locally, had 80 million yuan in output value last year. It
has developed lead-free and cadmium-free porcelain and other
market-oriented products, including some that are shipped
exclusively to the U.S., and colored porcelain which goes to the
Republic of Korea.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of a leasing system has made it possible for
49 private enterprises and as many as 3,470 households to be
involved in the production of porcelain. Last year, private
businesses accounted for one-third of Jingdezhen's porcelain
output value.
</P>
<P>
These efforts have paid off: In 1999, Jingdezhen reaped 800
million yuan in porcelain sales, up 10 percent on 1998 figure.
</P>
<P>
From January to April this year, Jingdezhen generated 2.64
billion yuan in industrial output value, a 17 percent rise on a
yearly basis.
</P>
<P>
The output value of the city's porcelain-making sector saw a
year-on-year 12 percent rise during the four-month period.
</P>
<P>
"Jingdezhen gained popularity for its porcelain, but has
witnessed modern development due to the new varieties of business
which have cropped up here," Mayor Chen pointed out.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, June 12 (Xinhua) -- In the eyes of tourists,
Jingdezhen is still worthy of being called China's "porcelain
capital," as 20-meter-tall chimneys at ceramic plants continue to
smoke as they have for decades and porcelain shops scattered
throughout this city in east China's Jiangxi Province are busy
serving customers.
</P>
<P>
Jingdezhen has a porcelain-making history of more than 1,700
years and is renowned as an international porcelain center. The
city has become one of China's biggest producers and exporters of
daily-used porcelain products.
</P>
<P>
In spite of this, Jingdezhen's porcelain-making sector now
accounts for only seven percent of the local industrial output
value, a plunge from the 70 percent in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
From 1990 to 1999, the local gross domestic product (GDP) grew
at a rate of 13.4 percent annually, higher than the national
average. This big increase is attributed to the success of local
emerging industrial sectors such as machinery, electronics,
chemicals, pharmaceuticals and foodstuffs.
</P>
<P>
Mayor Chen Anzhong says that it would have been impossible for
Jingdezhen to maintain its position as China's "porcelain capital"
and even to witness the remarkable economic development if
porcelain-making had continued as the city's sole industrial
mainstay.
</P>
<P>
Before the 1980s, Jingdezhen had 139 porcelain-making
enterprises, which were once proud to be the largest contributors
to local economic growth.
</P>
<P>
But beginning in the early 1990s, Jingdezhen gradually lost its
glamour when it failed to meet the market demands for colored,
novelty, custom-designed and modern porcelain.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Jingdezhen has been hurt by the development of a
group of ceramics production bases nationwide, including Tangshan
and Handan in northern Hebei Province, and Zibo and Yixing in
eastern Shandong and Jiangsu provinces, respectively.
</P>
<P>
As a result, 30 of the local remaining 32 state-owned porcelain-
making enterprises stopped part or all of their production in 1996,
causing 400 million yuan in total economic losses.
</P>
<P>
Subsequently, nearly 30,000 workers in porcelain-related
industries lost their jobs.
</P>
<P>
Thus, Jingdezhen had no choice but to restructure its economy
and began to focus on the development of profitable and market-
oriented industries.

BEIJING, June 14 (Xinhua) -- China is actively developing
various new and renewable energy sources focusing on hydropower,
solar, wind, geothermal and tidal sources, in the hope to make up
for the shortage of conventional energy sources.
</P>
<P>
According to Hu Chengchun, deputy director of the energy
development committee under the China Energy Research Society (
CERS), China enjoys very rich new and renewable energy sources and
has huge potential for their further development and use.
</P>
<P>
He said that China's recoverable hydropower energy sources
total 378 million kw, but only 11 percent of them have been tapped.
</P>
<P>
The country has recoverable wind energy sources of 254 million
kw, geothermal sources equivalent to 462.6 billion tons of
standard coal, and tidal energy sources of more than 20 million kw.
</P>
<P>
To date, China's annual utilization of new and renewable energy
stands at a very low level of 300 million tons of standard coal,
as compared with the abundant new and renewable energy sources.

<HEADLINE> Asia-Pacific Should Care More About Regional Interests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fraser made the remarks at the 21st Century Forum -- Conference
2000, which opened here this morning. Its theme is "economic
globalization -- Asia and China."
</P>
<P>
Globalization poses two challenges, that is how to preserve
some form of equity and reasonable competition in a globalized
market place and how to establish stability within the financial
markets, according to Fraser.
</P>
<P>
"There is an urgent need to establish an international body to
establish rules for fair trading in a globalized environment," the
former Australian leader said.
</P>
<P>
Fraser noted that in some ways, the Asia-Pacific region is less
structured and less organized than other parts of the world. For
example, in North and South America there is NAFTA and the
Organization of American States. Europe has its European Union,
which grows larger.
</P>
<P>
In the Asia-Pacific region, APEC has been established to
promote and advanced freer trade. Its original intention was that
it would move faster than the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
However, with the involvement of the United States and
countries on the Pacific Rim, APEC has been mitigated against as a
pace-setter in the search for freer trade.
</P>
<P>
"The membership is so large and diverse that it is difficult to
advance the specific interests of East and South-East Asia
adequately or effectively," Fraser said.
</P>
<P>
"Our own region needs to give greater attention to regional
interests and regional concerns," Fraser said, adding that this
could be best promoted by a political conference of leaders of all
East and South-East Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
The three-day conference is sponsored by the National Committee
of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC),
China's top advisory body.
</P>
<P>
Over 500 participants, including statesmen and celebrities from
around 20 countries, attended the conference's opening ceremony,
which was presided over by CPPCC National Committee Chairman Li
Ruihuan.

<HEADLINE> 400,000 Chinese Benefit from Legal Aid System: Official (2) EDS-More Added </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Forty five percent of the legal aid beneficiaries in criminal
cases have won their lawsuits, and up to over 80 percent in civil
disputes won their cases," Duan said.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the quality of legal services for the poor, the
government legal aid centers attend court hearings, check lawyers'
case files and offer training to the lawyers appointed to provide
aid, he said.
</P>
<P>
Duan also admitted that the government is facing an uphill
battle to provide sufficient legal aid services to the needy
because of a shortage of government funds.
</P>
<P>
To solve the problem, the government has order registered
attorneys to handle one to three legal aid cases pro bono every
year.
</P>
<P>
Over the years, more and more Chinese citizens have taken
advantage of the legal aid option to solve their problems.
</P>
<P>
Since 1996, legal aid centers across the country have handled
328,000 cases, and in the first five months of this year alone,
the amount jumped to 62,000.
</P>
<P>
Analysts note that the Chinese government signed the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in 1998, and
upon its ratification by the legislature, the legal aid system in
China will be further strengthened as an international obligation
borne by the Chinese government.

<HEADLINE> (Recast) New Businesses Return Glamour to "Porcelain Capital" (1) EDS-Recast with correction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, June 14 (Xinhua) -- In the eyes of tourists,
Jingdezhen is still worthy of being called China's "porcelain
capital," as 20-meter-tall chimneys at ceramic plants continue to
smoke as they have for decades and porcelain shops scattered
throughout this city in east China's Jiangxi Province are busy
serving customers.
</P>
<P>
Jingdezhen has a porcelain-making history of more than 1,700
years and is renowned as an international porcelain center. The
city has become one of China's biggest producers and exporters of
daily-used porcelain products.
</P>
<P>
In spite of this, Jingdezhen's porcelain-making sector now
accounts for only seven percent of the local industrial output
value, a plunge from the 70 percent in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
From 1990 to 1999, the local gross domestic product (GDP) grew
at a rate of 13.4 percent annually, higher than the national
average. This big increase is attributed to the success of local
emerging industrial sectors such as machinery, electronics,
chemicals, pharmaceuticals and foodstuffs.
</P>
<P>
Mayor Chen Anzhong says that it would have been impossible for
Jingdezhen to maintain its position as China's "porcelain capital"
and even to witness the remarkable economic development if
porcelain-making had continued as the city's sole industrial
mainstay.
</P>
<P>
Before the 1980s, Jingdezhen had 139 porcelain-making
enterprises, which were once proud to be the largest contributors
to local economic growth.
</P>
<P>
But beginning in the early 1990s, Jingdezhen gradually lost its
glamour when it failed to meet the market demands for colored,
novelty, custom-designed and modern porcelain.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Jingdezhen has been hurt by the development of a
group of ceramics production bases nationwide, including Tangshan
and Handan in northern Hebei Province, and Zibo and Yixing in
eastern Shandong and Jiangsu provinces, respectively.
</P>
<P>
As a result, 30 of the local remaining 32 state-owned porcelain-
making enterprises stopped part or all of their production in 1996,
causing 400 million yuan in total economic losses.
</P>
<P>
Subsequently, nearly 30,000 workers in porcelain-related
industries lost their jobs.
</P>
<P>
Thus, Jingdezhen had no choice but to restructure its economy
and began to focus on the development of profitable and market-
oriented industries.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Waives Duty on Maize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has waived
the tariff on maize in a bid to ensure for the sufficient supply
to people affected by the prolonged drought.
</P>
<P>
In a signed press statement available Wednesday, Kenyan
President Daniel arap Moi said, "I am today instructing the
Minister for Finance to immediately wave all duty and tax on
imported maize."
</P>
<P>
As soon as normal conditions return and the Kenyan farmers have
maize to harvest, the waiver of tariff on maize will be removed,
Moi said Tuesday in the statement.
</P>
<P>
The importing duty on maize stood at 300 shillings (about four
U.S. dollars) a bag before the president's decree was issued.
</P>
<P>
President Moi also declared the drought a national disaster,
saying that it is causing serious shortage of food and water
throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
A week ago, Moi made an urgent call to international community
to assist the country with food aid, saying that if the drought
persists, about 22 million people, or 80 percent of the total
population in Kenya, will be threatened by the famine.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Education Minister Kalonzo
Musyoka has condemned the violent conduct by college students
early this week.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Nation newspaper Wednesday quoted Musyoka as saying
that college students should seek diplomatic ways of solving
problems rather than resorting to violence.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, students from the Jomo Kenyatta University of
Agriculture and Technology stormed a local newspaper's office
building, stoning passers-by, smashing car windows, burning and
looting in protest against a news story on alleged drug use on
campus.
</P>
<P>
"As a country that stands for peace, we cannot allow this
culture of violence to take root in our learning institutions,"
Musyoka said Tuesday when commenting on the riot.
</P>
<P>
"We take a firm view that the matter should have been solved
amicably through dialogue," the minister added.
</P>
<P>
Citing that University of Nairobi students had renounced
violence and hooliganism in his presence several months ago, the
minister said that militancy belongs to the last century and
cannot be condoned at higher institutions of learning.

<HEADLINE> China Tackles Rural Drinking Water Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Government is closing
to its goal of helping all its rural residents have drinking water,
according to a national conference on the water supply and
drinking water in rural areas which is being held here.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Government plans to spend three years to help the
country's last batch of 24 million people who have difficulty to
get drinking water.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that there were 240 million rural people who
have drinking water problems by the end of 1992.
</P>
<P>
Zhai Haohui, vice-minister of Water Resources, said by the end
of last year, the country had invested 30 billion yuan (3.61
billion U.S. dollars) in the building of over 3 million drinking
water projects across the country. 216 million or 90 percent of
the registered rural people who have drinking water problems have
easy access to drinking water.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the country invested 40 billion yuan (4.81
billion U.S. dollars) in the construction of more than 30,000
water supply projects in the rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese population threatened by shortages of drinking
water mainly live in remote, poverty-stricken mountainous regions,
who rely on collecting rain water for daily life.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Water Resources called on all localities to
invest more in water projects in the rural areas for the
realization of a daily water supply of 70 million tons by the year
2005.

<HEADLINE> China to Become Important Player in 21st Century: Lee Kuan Yew (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 14 (Xinhua) -- China has taken a major step to
plug its economy into the global grid, which will make it one of
the most important players in the global exchange of goods,
services, capital, talent and ideas in the 21st century,
Singaporean Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew said here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 21st Century Forum -- Conference 2000, which
opened here this morning. Lee said that since 1978 when China
initiated the reform and opening up drive, "the economy of China
has changed dramatically."
</P>
<P>
China's foreign trade, then about 12 percent, has trebled to 36
percent of China's gross domestic product (GDP), and is still
growing.
</P>
<P>
"When China decided to join the World Trade Organization (WTO)
and reached agreement with the United States in November 1999,
China signaled to the world that it was taking a major step to
plug its economy into the global grid -- although this system is
at present still dominated by America, Western Europe and Japan,"
Lee said.
</P>
<P>
The senior minister pointed out that the decision will have "
profound economic and geo-political implications for China and the
world".
</P>
<P>
Chinese enterprises will learn from, work with and compete
against the advanced nations. Global competition will increase the
efficiency and productivity of domestic enterprise.
</P>
<P>
Lee noted that human talent is at present the most valuable
resource for creating wealth in the knowledge economy. China has
the largest pool of talent, but its trained talent is a fraction
of its total potential.

<HEADLINE> 400,000 Chinese Benefit from Legal Aid System: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Since the end of 1996 when China

benefited from the government-paid programs, said Duan Zhengkun,
vice minister of justice, here today.
</P>
<P>

ensuring social justice, demonstrates the Chinese government's
efforts to safeguard the fundamental human rights of its citizens,
" said Duan at a press conference held by the Information Office
of the State Council.

Currently, a large number of China's top graduates leave China.
However, many of these graduates will return in the next 10-30
years, to bring back their profit-making skills in technology,
management and marketing.
</P>
<P>
They will eventually help the country catch up with the U.S.,
Japan and European Union, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
On the negative impacts of the globalization, the senior
minister said that globalization has made China more vulnerable to
volatile capital flows.
</P>
<P>
However, "this can be minimized by restructuring and
strengthening its financial system before opening up its capital
accounts," Lee said.
</P>
<P>
He also suggested that China take more active measures in
Internet, capital markets and education so that the country will
be fully prepared for the future competition.
</P>
<P>
The three-day conference, whose theme is "economic
globalization -- Asia and China," is sponsored by the National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC).

<HEADLINE> World Bank's Vice President Visits Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Visiting World Bank's new Vice
President for the East Asia and Pacific Region Jemal-ud-din Kassum
said he was encouraged by the economic recovery in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
"I am encouraged by the recovery I see in the economy which is
testimony to the achievements of the new government in the short
space of eight months. But I am equally struck by how much more
needs to be done to cement the recovery and achieve rapid
sustainable growth," he told reporters here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Kassum emphasized three priorities facing the Indonesian
government.
</P>
<P>
First, to maintain the momentum of reforms as laid out in the
letter of intent to the International Monetary Fund (IMF),
including measures to restore investor confidence; Second, to
develop a strong poverty alleviation strategy, making it a key
theme of the national five-year plan and ensuring its reflection
in all programs and projects of the government, including the
budget; And third, to make visible progress on key governance
issues, especially on anti-corruption, demonstrating the
government's determination to build transparent and accountable
institutions that are responsive to the needs of society,
especially the poor.
</P>
<P>
"I recognize this is an ambitious agenda that will take time to
implement. So it is important to be patient and to work with the
government and the people of Indonesia to accomplish these goals.
At the same time, however, there must also be clear focus on
immediate priorities and concrete results that indicate the
government's commitment and resolve in achieving this objective,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Kassum arrived here Tuesday for consultations with senior
officials. During his two-day visit, he met Vice President
Megawati Soekarnoputri, Coordinating Minister for the Economy,
Finance and Industry Kwik Kian Gie and other members of the
government's economic team and key members of the National
Economic Council.
</P>
<P>
He also met with local donor representatives.
</P>
<P>
The subject of Kassum's discussions here were the current
economic situation in Indonesia and preparations for the next
meeting of the Consultative Group on Indonesia (CGI), to be held
in Tokyo on October 17-18, according to a press statement issued
by the World Bank, East Asia and Pacific Region, here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank is a major contributor to a 46 billion U.S.
dollars rescue package put together by the IMF to bail Indonesia
out of the effects of the regional financial crisis which hit the
country in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Kassum took over from Jean Michel Severino on March 1, 2000.

<HEADLINE> Study Predicts Severe Nursing Shortage in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 13 (Xinhua) -- A nursing shortage is expected
to become widespread later in the decade just as the aging U.S.
population requires more care, a study released Tuesday said.
</P>
<P>
The study, conducted by Vanderbilt University's School of
Nursing in Nashville, Tennessee, predicts the number of full-time
registered nurses (RN) was projected to peak around the year 2007
and then decline steadily as more nurses retire along with the
nation's aging baby boomers.
</P>
<P>
"The impending decline in the supply of RNs will come at a time
when the first of 78 million baby boomers begin to retire and
enroll in the Medicare program in 2010," Dr. Peter Buerhaus from
Vanderbilt University and colleagues reported.
</P>
<P>
An earlier study, conducted by the American Association of
Retired Persons, found that 82 percent of the people aged 45 and
older want to stay in their existing homes for as long as possible
rather than move to a smaller home or retirement community.
</P>
<P>
Currently, many U.S. hospitals have a need to fill nursing
vacancies, but "the shortage is nowhere near what we're going to
see in the future," said Buerhaus, author of the study.
</P>
<P>
California, Colorado, Texas and Florida will witness most
critical nursing shortages, although the problem is likely to
spread as more firms compete to hire nurses and fewer enter in the
field, according to U.S. nursing experts.
</P>
<P>
"One of the things driving that shortage is the enhanced use of
RNs for other tasks," including work as consultants and to provide
in-house medical services for companies, said Geraldine Bednash of
the American Association of Colleges of Nursing in Washington.
</P>
<P>
In an editorial accompanying the study in the June 14 issue of
The Journal of the American Medical Association, Bednash wrote
that enrollments in entry-level nursing schools have declined for
five years in a row, even as the current crop of nurses age.
</P>
<P>
"Within the next 10 years, the average age of RNs is forecast
to be 45.4 years old, an increase of 3.5 years over the current
age, with more than 40 percent of the RN work force expected to be
older than 50," Buerhaus wrote in the journal.
</P>
<P>
"By the year 2020, the RN work force is forecast to be roughly
the same size as it is today...nearly 20 percent below projected
RN work force requirements," he wrote.
</P>
<P>
The researchers, who examined 25 years of U.S. Census data
through 1998, said 90 percent of RNs are women. As women have more
career paths open to them, the report suggested more men ought to
be recruited in the field.
</P>
<P>
The results of the study are based on an analysis of U.S.
Census data for the years between 1973-1998.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Shenzhen, one of China's special
economic zones, has become the country's biggest export-oriented
furniture producer.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that one-third of China's furniture exports for
the past five years was made by Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
The export has been increasing at an annual growth rate of 30
percent for the past five years to 750 million U.S. dollars last
year.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the municipal economic development department
said that the momentum growth of the furniture industry in
Shenzhen has begun to cheer up the country's furniture export.
</P>
<P>
The competitiveness of the furniture turned out in Shenzhen,
one of China's most prosperous export processing centers, lies in
the endeavor of keeping up with the world's slickest furniture
design, which demands not only high quality but also new design
concepts, according to the officials.
</P>
<P>
As a new growth pole, Shenzhen's furniture export is expected
to top one billion U.S. dollars this year.

<HEADLINE> "Pine Cancer" Threatening to Forest Reserve in China's World- Heritage Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, June 14 (Xinhua) -- "Pine cancer," a dangerous pine
disease caused by eelworms, is now posing a threat to trees in the
well-known tourist attraction of Zhangjiajie State Forest Park in
central China.
</P>
<P>
The devastating forest disease was spotted earlier this year in
Enshi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture in the western part of
Hunan Province, which is only 108 km away from the Wulingyuan
Mountains, which was incorporated into the UNESCO's world heritage
list in 1992 for its abundant virgin forest reserve.
</P>
<P>
Zhangjiajie is situated in the center of the Wulingyuan
Mountains. Pine growing on top of stone cliffs has been regarded
as one of the most famous scenery there.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Jian, director of the Provincial Forestry Bureau, said
that the local pine species are mutations of masson pine, which
tops the list of the pine cancer's targets.
</P>
<P>
He warned that if the forest is infected with the pine eelworm
disease, it will not only do harm to the region's ecological
environment but also to the booming tourism.
</P>
<P>
It only takes two to three months for trees contracted with
pipe eelworms to wither to death, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Hunan Province has the second largest pine tree coverage in
China. The province has stayed on alert of the disease.
Checkpoints were set up around the infectious area to try to block
the overspread.
</P>
<P>
The pine disease was first spotted in China in 1982. Some 73,
000 ha of pine forest in Guangdong and Zhejiang provinces has been
infected since then.
</P>
<P>
So far, no effective prevention method has been invented to
deal with the forest disease, which has left most severe plagues
in Japan, the United States and Canada.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Farmer Flies Self-made Aircraft Into Sky </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, June 14 (Xinhua) -- A young farmer from Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region, northwest China, successfully flied his self-
made plane into the sky recently.
</P>
<P>
His mother was the only passenger during the maiden flight.
</P>
<P>
Liu Yibing, 28, is from Beita Village in suburban Yinchuan, the
regional capital.
</P>
<P>
On June 3, Liu piloted his aircraft into the sky 14 times
between 9 a.m. and 12 a.m., and all of the flights were successful.
During the 14th flight, Liu's plane rose as high as 100 meters and
hovered over an airport in Yinchuan for 51 minutes.
</P>
<P>
The plane is 8.78 meters long, and all the spare parts, except
a 30-horsepower engine, were made by Liu himself.
</P>
<P>
Liu became a farmer at his hometown after graduation from a
junior middle school in 1989. By chance, Liu read a story about a
super-light plane on a magazine and decided to make one of his own.
</P>
<P>
The first plane was manufactured in 1991 after a year's hard
work. But the effort came to failure as the wings of the aircraft
were broken during the trial flight. His second plane, born in May
of 1993, dashed into a lake even before it took off. And in 1996,
Liu's right leg was broken when he was undertaking a gliding
technique training.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Liu made a third plane and flied successfully into the
sky for more than five minutes.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that he would continue his work, hoping he can make a
plane as early as possible for practical use, such as spraying
grass seeds and pesticide.

<HEADLINE> World Understanding, Peace Prerequisite for Economic Globalization: Masire (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 14 (Xinhua) -- World understanding and peace
represents the essential prerequisite for successful economic
globalization, former Botswana President Ketumile Masire said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 21st Century Forum -- Conference 2000 here,
Masire said he was strongly convinced that humanity has a common
destiny. "In this respect, the recognition and acceptance of the
fact that we cannot wish each other away, and that we have to work
together for our collective prosperity is an essential milestone
in our relationship."
</P>
<P>
He said throughout the world, the leaders are increasingly
recognizing that no country can exist in isolation, and that there
can be no sustainable development to the economies of the world
without international cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"The value of cross border collaboration in trade, politics,
diplomacy, arts and culture is now indisputable in regional
economic integration as a basis for economic globalization," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The mankind now lives in a world in which the new information
super highway has created a global village with interesting
implications for its residents, he said.
</P>
<P>
Life in a global village implies a shared future, peaceful co-
existence, interdependence, exploitation of resources for the
mutual beneficial, and increased production efficiency due to
factor mobility, and expanding markets, he said.
</P>
<P>
In a perfect world, he said, mankind should derive the greatest
benefits from this state of affairs. "Most unfortunately, ours is
still a world which is full of imperfections. It is still not, as
yet, a faultless world. Man is still not at peace with himself and
his neighbors," he said.

"We all have a responsibility to effectively contribute to
breaking down the barriers to international peace and
understanding," he former president said.
</P>
<P>
Undoubtedly, the absence of international peace is a hindrance
to national, regional and international prosperity that may result
from economic globalization, he said.
</P>
<P>
"This requires the concerted effort of the entire world
community to break down this barrier, and to create a good society,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
The former Botswana leader noted that his country is fully
committed to doing its best to contributing to international peace.
</P>
<P>
The international community should unite to dismantle all
barriers to peace, Masire said, adding that Africa has now reached
a historic moment for its people to enjoy peace which they have
not tasted for a long time.
</P>
<P>
In his address, the former Botswana president urged the
international community to be steadfast in promoting international
peace and security.
</P>
<P>
"Without peace, the majority of the people of the world will
not benefit from the fruits of economic globalization.
Consequently, mankind will leave perpetually on the brink of self-
extinction," he said.

<HEADLINE> HIV/AIDS May Become National Disaster in China, Scientist Warns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The spread of HIV/AIDS in China
will create a national disaster if the number of virus carriers
continues to swell while intervention measures remain weak, one of
the country's top AIDS experts has warned.
</P>
<P>
"Both the time and opportunities needed to control the deadly
disease have become limited. But we've arrived at the critical
point: we can control the spread of HIV/AIDS or let it overtake us,
" said Prof. Zeng Yi of the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, China's number of carriers of the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which leads to acquired immune
deficiency syndrome (AIDS), has increased yearly by 30 percent,
indicating that the country is experiencing a "fast growth period,
" Prof. Zeng said.
</P>
<P>
He estimated that the number of infection cases in the country
may surpass 600,000 this year.
</P>
<P>
"Based on the experiences of some other countries, the outbreak
will be inevitable if intervention measures are not taken
immediately," Prof. Zeng told Xinhua. "It would be a national
disaster if China became one of the top AIDS-stricken nations in
the world."
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the possibility of an AIDS epidemic and its
serious aftermath have been underestimated, which has resulted in
far too few HIV/AIDS-related health care policies, investment and
measures for education, scientific research, and intervention
campaigns among high-risk people such as drug users, the professor
said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government in 1998 published a medium- and long-
term national plan for HIV/AIDS prevention and control, aiming to
keep the population of HIV carriers to within 1.5 million people
by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
"The goal may not be achieved if these problems are not tackled,
" Prof. Zeng said, calling for comprehensive, long-term HIV/AIDS
public education programs as well as redoubled efforts to
guarantee the supply of untainted blood.
</P>
<P>
AIDS-control activists in China have long requested policies
that would support medical professionals and social workers at non-
governmental organizations to conduct self-protection programs
among prostitutes and drug users, encouraging the use of condoms
and clean needles.
</P>
<P>
Although the programs are still controversial in China, the
public should be aware that the benefits will inevitably flow to
the general population, a health education specialist said.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Airline to Hire Foreign Pilots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The Biman, Bangladesh's largest
state-owned airline, is hiring 18 expatriate pilots to meet a
shortage which puts pressures on its 129 pilots who are operating
140 to 150 flights a week now, The Daily Star newspaper reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The foreign pilots would be hired on a contract basis,
initially for a year. They are being hired to meet the interim
demand of the fleet and for flight expansion, Rafiqul Islam,
managing director of the Biman, told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
It also intends to relieve Biman pilots, whose duty often
borders on the limits of pilot's mandatory rest period before new
flights,violating the regulations of Civil Aviation Authority of
Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
The Biman, having 13 aircraft at present, is going to acquire
its sixth DC-10-30 and fourth Airbus 310. These two wide-body
aircraft will put more pressure on the pilots. Three retired
captains have been called back on a contract basis.
</P>
<P>
Islam said the Biman's pilot problem is mainly on international
routes where frequency of flights and the number of passengers
have sharply increased over the years, while there has been no
recruitment of pilots since 1994 when 41 were inducted.
</P>
<P>
The rate of promotion, however, is quite low, with only seven
pilots qualified. The Biman plans to recruit cadet pilots after
promoting 75 pilots, the managing director said. He added that the
airline is also going to computerize its pilot roster and flight
and aircraft schedules.

<HEADLINE> Inter-Korea Talks Focus on Exchanges, Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's Republic
of Korea (DPRK) and South Korean leaders focused on the issues of
economic exchanges and the reunion of separated Korean families in
the second day of their summit here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Kim Yong Nam, president of the Presidium of the DPRK Supreme
People's Assembly (SPA), and visiting South Korean President Kim
Dae-jung held an expanded summit meeting here Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
The two sides negotiated on elevating what has been private-
level economic cooperation to the government level and activating
government-to-government dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Kim Dae-jung said during the talks that the issue of the
separated families was something that "can not be dragged on any
longer" and he hoped that the issues could be solved through the
current talks.
</P>
<P>
He also officially invited DPRK top leader Kim Jong Il to visit
Seoul.
</P>
<P>
South Korean pool reports said that during their talks, the two
sides also discussed the possibility of setting up representative
offices in each other's capital in a bid to further improve their
bilateral relations. Although no final agreement has been reached
yet, the two sides were fairly close in their positions on the
proposal, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the two sides are expected to sign agreements on
prevention of double taxation and investment protection later
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Kim Yong Nam stressed that both the North and
South of the Korean Peninsula should give top priority to the
issue of national reunification.
</P>
<P>
He said, "it is the obligation of every politician to do his
utmost in the efforts trying to realize national reunification,
which should be given top priority."
</P>
<P>
Kim Yong Nam stressed self-determination as the most
fundamental precondition in seeking national reunification, as he
reaffirmed the three principles of national reunification, namely
independence, peace, and grand national unity, which were put
forward by late DPRK leader Kim Il Sung in 1972.
</P>
<P>
Some foreign countries are not happy to see a united and strong
state of Korea, he noted and voiced his confidence that the
Koreans are able to solve, independently, all their internal
problems. He also reiterated the DPRK position against foreign
interference in the affairs of the Korean Peninsula
</P>
<P>
Kim Yong Nam called on both sides to abandon confrontation and
pursue national reconciliation and unity, saying the differences
between the North and South sides in ideologies and systems should
not become a cause of mutual-hostility.

<HEADLINE> Outsourcing Spending to Increase Worldwide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Worldwide outsourcing spending
is expected to increase from 116 billion U.S. dollars last year to
177 billion dollars by 2004, as companies struggle to restructure
themselves around e-business and compete in the Internet economy.
</P>
<P>
The prediction was made by U.S. market researcher International
Data Corporation (IDC) in a report released Tuesday. Other factors
involved in outsourcing increase include globalization,
deregulation and technological innovation.
</P>
<P>
"These factors have increased competition in many industries
and regions across the world," the report said. "To remain
competitive, many companies outsource as a way to reduce costs,
increase efficiencies, refocus critical resources, and keep up
with rapidly advancing technologies."
</P>
<P>
Companies outsource because they do not have access to the
required resources -- human, capital or intellectual. The single
most important reason for outsourcing is to reduce or control
operating costs. Access to the outside provider's lower cost is
one of the most compelling short-term benefits of outsourcing,
which also reduces the need to invest capital funds in non-core
functions.
</P>
<P>
As the worldwide outsourcing market continues to grow, IDC
believes it will begin to transform. Because of the quick pace of
technological advancement and rapidly evolving business models,
companies will demand shorter contract length.
</P>
<P>
According to IDC's study, the United States represents the
biggest opportunity for outsourcers. U.S. outsourcing spending
will jump from 56 billion dollars in 1999 to 87 billion dollars in
2004. Banking spends more than any other U.S. industry on
outsourcing, but the federal government is increasing its spending
faster than any other industry.

<HEADLINE> Kim Yong Nam Highlights National Reunification at Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Kim Yong Nam, president of the
Presidium of Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK), said here Wednesday that both the North
and South of the Korean Peninsula should give top priority to the
issue of national reunification.
</P>
<P>
When meeting with visiting South Korean President Kim Dae-jung
in an expanded summit at the Mansudae Assembly Hall, Kim Yong Nam
said "it is the obligation of every politician to do his utmost in
the efforts trying to realize national reunification, which should
be given top priority."
</P>
<P>
Kim Yong Nam stressed self-determination as the most
fundamental precondition in seeking national reunification, as he
reaffirmed the three principles of national reunification, namely
independence, peace, and grand national unity, which were put
forward by late DPRK leader Kim Il Sung in 1972.
</P>
<P>
Some foreign countries are not happy to see a united and strong
state of Korea, he noted and voiced his confidence that the
Koreans are able to solve, independently, all their internal
problems. He also reiterated the DPRK position against foreign
interference in the affairs of the Korean Peninsula
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kim Yong Nam called on both sides to abandon
confrontation and pursue national reconciliation and unity.
</P>
<P>
Unification does not mean one side annex the other, but the
unity of the whole nation. The differences between the North and
South sides in ideologies and systems should not become a cause of
mutual-hostility, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the proposed federal system, Kim Yong Nam said the
establishment of such a mechanism, which will be in charge of all
the inter-Korean issues on cooperation and exchange, will bring
about a landmark change in the course of national reunification.

<P>
In the past five years, Myanmar has followed a positive policy
toward the private sector and has been implementing since January
1995 a plan of privatization for its state economic enterprises (
SEEs).
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the plan, for small SEEs, has been
reportedly completed and the second phase which deals with about 1,
760 medium-and large-scale SEEs is under way.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, there are more than 53,000
manufacturing enterprises in Myanmar, of which 51,000 or more are
private ones.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government has also been implementing some
related preferential policies for the private sector in trade such
as exemption of the commercial tax since November 1997.

<HEADLINE> Kim Yong Nam, Kim Dae-jung Hold Talks On Economic, Family Reunion Issues EDS-Updates with quotes of Kim Dae-jung </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Kim Yong Nam, president of the
Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), held talks Wednesday morning
with visiting South Korean President Kim Dae-jung at the Mansudae
Assembly Hall, focusing on the issues of economic exchanges and
the reunion of separated Korean families.
</P>
<P>
At a news briefing here, South Korean Vice Unification Minister
Yang Young-shik said that the two sides negotiated on elevating
what has been private-level economic cooperation to the government
level and activating government-to-government dialogue.
</P>
<P>
He also said that South Korea and the DPRK had had an expanded
summit meeting Wednesday morning in Pyongyang and discussed a
variety of inter-Korean issues.
</P>
<P>
According to South Korean pool reports here, Kim Dae-jung said
during the talks that the issue of the separated families was
something that "can not be dragged on any longer" and he hoped
that the issues could be solved through the current talks.
</P>
<P>
He also officially invited DPRK top leader Kim Jong Il to visit
Seoul, the pooled reports said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that during their talks in Pyongyang
Wednesday morning the two sides also discussed the possibility of
setting up representative offices in each other's capital in a bid
to further improve their bilateral relations. Although no final
agreement has been reached yet, the two sides were fairly close in
their positions on the proposal, the pool reports said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> U.S. Governor Declares Emergency Following Wildfires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Colorado Governor
Bill Owens declared a state-wide emergency Tuesday after a pair of
wildfires continued to burn out of control in the state's pine-
covered foothills.
</P>
<P>
"This could go on for a week, this is the No. 1 priority in the
nation right now, in terms of fires," Owens told reporters after
touring the bigger fire dubbed Hi Meadow, about 50 miles southwest
of Denver.
</P>
<P>
The declaration of emergency makes three counties eligible for
state money and puts the National Guard on alert. The Federal
Emergency Management Agency planned to provide additional money.
</P>
<P>
More than 5,500 acres have been burned amid dry and gusty
weather in the state.
</P>
<P>
In Park County, about 35 miles southwest of Denver, fire
officials said 3,500 acres had been burned, destroying at least
five homes or other structures near the community of Bailey.
Residents of 15 neighborhoods were told to evacuate Tuesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
In Larimer County, about 50 miles northwest of Denver, another
2,000 acres of land had been burned and at least two buildings
were burned down. As many as 200 homes were threatened by the fire,
near a subdivision in the mountains west of Loveland.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of firefighters were assigned to the two wind-driven
blazes, which fed on hot, dry conditions. Smoke from both blazes
hung over parts of the Denver metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
With much of the United States facing drought conditions and
the heart of the fire season ahead, the Colorado fires were the
most damaging of those burning across a number of Western states,
including Arizona, California, New Mexico and Utah.
</P>
<P>
The nation is seeing the worst start of a fire season since
1996, according to the National Interagency Fire Center in Idaho.
</P>
<P>
By Tuesday, some 44,300 fires covering more than 1.2 million
acres had been recorded nationwide -- and drought conditions
already well known in the Southeast and Southwest were growing
worse in the West.

<HEADLINE> Wildfire in Hungary Put Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, June 13 (Xinhua) -- A wildfire burning for two days
in Hungary's eastern state of Bacs-kiskun was put under control
Tuesday dawn.
</P>
<P>
The fire broke out Sunday morning and spread quickly with the
help of strong winds. So far it has burned out 316 hectares forest
and grassland, including 200 hectares of pines and fruit trees.
</P>
<P>
Hungary has sent out 16 fire engines, 7 helicopters, 60 firemen,
over 300 soldiers and many militiamen to put out the wildfire and
some of them still remained there to prevent the fire from
reviving.
</P>
<P>
As the areas were sparsely populated, no death and injuries
have been reported, but direct loss was estimated at no less than
100 million forint (about 360,000 U.S. dollars). The expert said
that most burned pines had grown for 15-20 years so that
replanting the trees would cost a large sum of money.
</P>
<P>
Negligence was reportedly the cause of the fire.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate Tuesday night
approved a 287.4-billion-dollar defense spending bill for fiscal
2001, which would raise military pay, improve health benefits and
bolster efforts to recruit and retain troops.
</P>
<P>
The bill, approved 95-3, pays for Defense Department programs
in the fiscal year that starts October 1. It now must be
reconciled with a House-passed version that is about 1 billion
dollars less expensive.
</P>
<P>
The Senate bill is a 3-billion-dollar increase over the request
by President Bill Clinton and boosts spending by nearly 20 billion
dollars over last year.
</P>
<P>
It provides 58 billion dollars for new weapons procurement, but
shifts development funds for one of the Pentagon's biggest weapons
programs ever -- the 200-billion-dollar Joint Strike Fighter --
into an ongoing demonstration program until the plane makes
sufficient technological process.
</P>
<P>
The differences between the House and Senate bills will be

<HEADLINE> China's Mother Care Lowers Mortality of Women During Child Birth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, June 14 (Xinhua) -- North China's Hebei Province
is to reduce its mortality rate of women during child birth from
over 5 per ten thousand in 1998 to 4.7 per ten thousand this year,
said local public health officials.
</P>
<P>
Liu Yingyu is a farmer in the Fuping County of the province.
Thanks to the medical care service for confinement women, Liu
Yingyu now has a lovely grandson. The baby was diagnosed
transverse in his mother's uterus. The township hospital helped
the baby out at the cost of 200 yuan (24 U.S. dollars), and
medical staff exert regular medical examinations both on mother
and baby after the operation.
</P>
<P>
Continuous medical care on confinement women and new-borns
nationwide, with special attention to rural areas, in the past 50
years reduced the mortality of women during child birth from 150
per ten thousand in 1949 to the average 5.62 per ten thousand in
1998, statistics from the country's public health departments show.
</P>
<P>
Women in China's rural areas once turned to midwives in the
villages for child birth. Most of the midwives were illiterate and
lacking in basic delivery knowledge. They used scissors without
disinfection to cut the umbilical cord, which often caused
infections and even deaths of babies and mothers.
</P>
<P>
Yet, figures from national public health department indicates
that the mortality rate is still higher in west China than in the
eastern part due to the slower economic development and the lower
educational level.
</P>
<P>
According to local public health officials, Hebei has up to now
extended the specific medical care to 95 percent of its area, and
70 percent of confinement women will go to hospital for child
birth. And remote and poor villages will be their focus this year.

<P>
BEIJING, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Despite growing electricity
consumption fueled by high temperatures, the State Power Corp. of
China has promised that electricity for residential use will not
be affected this summer.
</P>
<P>
The high temperatures since early May, in addition to the
growing power consumption of industrial businesses, have strained
electricity supply in some regions. However, power supply
nationwide is sufficient, today's "China Daily" quoted the
corporation sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Switch-offs will not be employed as a means to limit power
consumption this summer," said Zhao Yuzhu, an official with the
State Power Corp. "Instead, we may ask the colossal electricity
users -- factories for example -- to suspend production during
peak hours."
</P>
<P>
Tuesday was a hot day and the same is expected for today with
the temperature expected to reach a high of 38 degrees centigrade
and lowest temperature at night is expected to be around 23
degrees centigrade in north China.
</P>
<P>
Meteorologists from Central Meteorological Station predicted
that the consecutive days of hot weather, which started on Monday,
will end if a thunder shower visits North China this weekend.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Fifteen editors and journalists
from Xinhua News Agency were awarded the prestigious Shapiro Prize
by the Shapiro Journalism Education Foundation in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
The prize was established in honor of Michael Shapiro, a member
of the British Communist Party who started working at Xinhua in
1950 at the invitation of the Central Committee of the Communist
Party of China.
</P>
<P>
Shapiro spent a total of 36 years copy-editing English stories
and doing translation for the Department of Home News for Overseas
Service of Xinhua prior to his death in 1986. Late Chinese leader
Deng Xiaoping had referred to Shapiro as "a staunch international
soldier and sincere friend of the Chinese people."
</P>
<P>
The foundation was established by Shapiro's relatives and
friends in London to help improve English language reporting in
China. Today's award ceremony is the sixth since the initiation of
the prize.
</P>
<P>
At the ceremony, prizes were also given to 17 teachers and
students at the China School of Journalism.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Govt Debts to be Rescheduled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The steering committee at the
London Club of commercial banks has approved the Indonesian
government's proposal to reschedule around 340 million U.S.
dollars of debt falling due through March 31, 2002.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the rescheduling in a statement published by The
Jakarta Post Wednesday, Bank Indonesia Deputy Governor Dono
Iskandar Djojosubroto said that under the terms of the proposal,
the extended principal maturities would be repaid over a period of
12-and-a-half years from their originally scheduled payment dates.
</P>
<P>
"The extension of the maturities of Indonesia's external debt
builds on the success of our Paris Club rescheduling and will
provide critical support to Indonesia's far-reaching efforts to
restructure the country's external indebtedness while
strengthening Indonesia's balance of payments position," said Dono,
who represented the government in the negotiations with the club's
five-member steering committee.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government and the Paris Club of 19 sovereign
creditors agreed in April that some 5.8 billion dollars of debts
would be rescheduled to between 11 and 20 years. Some 2.1 billion
dollars of the rescheduled debts were supposed to fall due this
year and the remaining in 2001 and 2002.
</P>
<P>
The London Club is an informal body that brings together
commercial banks to discuss the rescheduling mechanism for
distressed debt. It normally meets once the Paris Club has reached
an agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Jakarta Post quoted Bank Indonesia sources as saying most
of the government's commercial debts were owed to Japanese
creditors.
</P>
<P>
The government was forced to seek debt rescheduling
alternatives after the country was plunged into its worst economic
crisis in three decades.
</P>
<P>
The debt rescheduling would greatly ease the pressure on the
state budget, which is already overburdened by the huge cost of
financing a bank recapitalization program and providing subsidies
for the poor, the sources said.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' International Reserves Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' gross
international reserves (GIR) improved by 418 million U.S. dollars
to 15.441 billion dollars as of the end of May this year, from 15.
023 billion dollars at the end of last December, Manila Bulletin
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted records of the Central Bank of the
Philippines as saying the 15.441 billion dollars is equivalent to
4.7 months worth of bills of imported goods and services.
</P>
<P>
However, the end May GIR was about 573 million dollars less
than the new all-time high of 16.014 billion dollars in the first
week of May, or about 1 billion dollars short of the target for
this year.
</P>
<P>
The GIR is the barometer used to determine the capacity of the
country to meet payments of imported goods and services.
</P>
<P>
The reduction in the GIR was due mainly to the debt servicing
of the maturing obligations of the government, government-owned
and controlled corporations and the central bank, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
The dip in the dollar reserves of the country was also
attributed to the intermittent intervention of the monetary
authorities in the peso-dollar market, particularly at the height
of a speculative attack on the local currency on May 25.
</P>
<P>
To rebuild its dollar reserves, the paper said, the central
bank is currently in the spot currency market, using some banks as
the conduit to buy a minimum of 15 million dollars to as much as
30 million dollars on a given trading day.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Unrest Linked to Former President: Defense Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Defense Minister Juwono
Sudarsono suspected that the ongoing violence across the country
has something to do with the prosecution of former President
Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
"This is a fact, that most riots are connected with the
investigation process concerning the Pak Harto (Soeharto) case or
some other cases," the minister was quoted by The Jakarta Post
Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Sudarsono said the riots were aimed at jeopardizing the general
session of the People's Consultative Assembly, the country's
highest decision-making body, scheduled for August.
</P>
<P>
"There are some groups in Jakarta which have sent their men to
incite riots everywhere ahead of the assembly's general session,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister would not identify the groups, but said they have
members in Jakarta and unlimited financial sources.
</P>
<P>
"If compared to these groups' funds, our 4.2 billion rupiah (
506,000 U.S. dollars) budget for a battalion comprising of 500
soldiers who are on duty for 270 days is nothing," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, it is difficult for the security authorities to prove
the allegation. "It is almost impossible for us to spot a deal
between people relating to the riots," the minister added.
</P>
<P>
Maluku and North Maluku have witnessed a year-long ethnic
bloodshed between Christians and Muslims and more than 1,300
civilians have been killed.
</P>
<P>
At least 141 persons have died and 99 others injured during a
communal bloodshed in Central Sulawesi during the past month.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, bombs and grenades exploded in Medan,
capital of North Sumatra, and Nganjuk of East Java, respectively,
killing two persons and injuring 49 others.
</P>
<P>
The 78-year-old Soeharto is accused of massive graft during his
32-year rule. He is under house arrest and Attorney General
Marzuki Darusman said he expects to bring a corruption case
against the former ruler by August.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto was forced out of power in May 1998 amid mass social
unrest and economic chaos.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai
and his delegation kicked off a two-day official visit to Cambodia
Wednesday morning, aiming to enhance bilateral ties and
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
During the tour, Chuan will sign two cooperative agreements on
the return of smuggled cars and stolen artifacts, according to a
report from the Thai Prime Minister's Office Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Thai cabinet last week endorsed the two accords, which were
finalized by Thai and Cambodian authorities in April,the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The first accord, which calls for cooperation in the return of
stolen or embezzled vehicles, is expected to help prevent and
crack down on car thefts from Thailand into Cambodia, it stated.
</P>
<P>
The other, designed to combat illicit trafficking and cross-
border smuggling of movable cultural property, is believed to help
solve the problem of cross-border illegal removals and smuggling
of ancient art objects, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report also noted that Chuan and his Cambodian counterpart,
Hun Sen, will sign a memorandum of understanding (MOU), which is
aimed at beginning the survey and demarcation of the Thai-
Cambodian land border based on the original Franco-Thai
demarcation of 1904 and 1907 and outlines their respective claims.
</P>
<P>
Under the MOU, which is approved at Tuesday's Thai cabinet
meeting, Thailand will lend assistance to Cambodia in the modern
mapping method and survey, it said.
</P>
<P>
Chuan is accompanied by Thai Deputy Prime Minister and Commerce
Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi, Supreme Commander of the Thai
Armed Forces Mongkon Ampornpisit and other senior Thai officials,
said it.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The governments of Indonesia and
Australia have agreed to resume their trade relations frozen since
East Timor voted for independence in August last year, local
leading newspapers Wednesday quoted an official as saying.
</P>
<P>
"For the purpose, the Indonesian government will establish a
special team to work together with a special team from Australia,"
General Director of the International Industrial and Trade
Cooperation Association Hatanto Reksodiputro said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
After the voting for independence in East Timor on August 30,
1999,Australian businessmen boycotted the import of Indonesian
products and even the flights of Indonesian national airline
Garuda to the country. Subsequently Indonesian businessmen took
the same retaliatory measures against Australia.
</P>
<P>
Observers here held that the agreement to resume trade
relations between Indonesia and Australia was the result of the
two governments' efforts to improve their bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
On June 9, Indonesian President Abdurrahman Wahid met with
Australian Prime Minister John Howard in Tokyo where they attended
the funeral of former Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi. The
two leaders agreed to improve the strained ties between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Wahid also hoped to visit Australia in the
near future.

strategy," he said.

<P>
VANCOUVER, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The National Basketball
Association's Toronto Raptors sacked Butch Carter as coach on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Carter led the team to its first NBA playoff berth but also
found himself in almost constant controversy and clashes with his
own players.
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that this change, while disappointing to me on a
personal and professional level, is necessary if we are to
continue to build towards an NBA championship," general manager
Glen Grunwald told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
Grunwald earlier praised Carter's role in turning the club
around.
</P>
<P>
"His accomplishments in Toronto should not be discounted,"
Grunwald said. "However, in the end that success was clouded by
off-court distractions that were disconcerting to our fans and our
organization."

"It has become too difficult for me," said the 44-year-old Borg.

<P>
"This is the third time I retire and this time it's for good,"

GUANGZHOU, June 14 (Xinhua) --Yuan Zheng, head of Guangdong
Provincial Environmental Protection Bureau, said the latest
monitoring data shows that the water from Dongjiang River meets
the quality requirements of the agreement signed between the
Guangdong Provincial Government and the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region.
</P>
<P>
Seventy percent of Hong Kong's fresh water comes from Dongjiang
River. Fresh water is supplied to Hong Kong via a 83-km river
course that traverses 12 towns in Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
The province has published seven rules and regulations on
protecting water in the Dongjiang River to prevent any further
pollution from the fast economic expansion and the influx of
transient laborers.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou has also shut down or relocated more than 130
businesses along the river that have polluted the river.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong has completed feasibility studies in the construction
of a water supply pipeline to replace the current open-air water
supply river course, said Yuan.
</P>
<P>
The pipeline project, estimated to cost five billion yuan (
about 602 million U.S. dollars), is expected to be completed by
2003.

BRUSSELS, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Norway upset favorites rival
Spain 1-0 at 2000 European champion with a second-half header from
Steffen Iversen in their first group C match played at Rotterdam
of the Netherlands on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Iversen took a superb jump in the 65th minute to reach the ball
before Spanish goalkeeper Francisco Molina and his header looped
into the net.
</P>
<P>
Spain, who have a long history of under-performing at major
tournaments, had the lion's share of possession but their
comparative lack of height, and a failure to make the final pass
count, meant they had few clear chances.

<P>
Raul should have scored shortly before halftime when free in

LONDON, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Three men have been arrested in
London in connection with alleged attempts to fix cricket matches.
Scotland Yard confirmed the arrests on Tuesday. It is thought none
of those arrested are players or cricket officials.
</P>
<P>
The Organized Crime Squad (OCS) arrested two men, aged 35 and
44, at their homes in north London and a third man, aged 42, was
arrested at his home in west London. All are being questioned at a
police station in west London.
</P>
<P>
A police spokesman said: "The investigation was launched after
an allegation of attempted corruption was reported by a player to
the England and Wales Cricket Board on August 3, 1999."
</P>
<P>
"The England and Wales Cricket Board passed this information on
to police. The men arrested have been taken to a west London
police station for questioning and inquiries are continuing," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Henman Stunned by Qualifier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Tim Henman's Wimbledon preparations
suffered a severe setback as he slumped to one of the worst
defeats of his career in the Stella Artois Championships on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The British number one went down in straight sets to little-
known American qualifier Bob Bryan in front of a stunned near-
capacity crowd at Queen's Club.
</P>
<P>
Henman, who had a first-round bye as eighth seed, lost the
first set 7-2 in a tie-break and the second 6-4 in what could be
his first and last competitive singles match on grass before
Wimbledon begins in 12 days' time.
</P>
<P>
In contrast Bryan, who is ranked some 188 places behind Henman,
had already battled through qualifying - beating his twin brother
Mike on the way - and defeated Armenian Sargis Sargsian in the
first round on Monday.
</P>
<P>
It had looked so different early on when Henman broke Bryan in
the opening game of the match, but his own service was equally
fragile and he squandered the advantage in the very next game.
</P>
<P>
Bryan then saved two more break points in the third game as his
confidence grew, both players holding serve more easily despite
the overcast and blustery conditions.
</P>
<P>
Three love service games from Henman appeared to signal the
world number 14 was gradually finding his feet as the set went
into a decisive tie-break.
</P>
<P>
But that proved a disaster for the Briton, who quickly went 4-0
down with Bryan then sealing the set 7-6 (7/2) with his third ace.
</P>
<P>
Henman missed an easy volley to gift his opponent a break point
in the seventh game of the second set but saved that and forced a
break point of his own in the next.
</P>
<P>
But Bryan was clearly pumped up by the prospect of ending the
hopes of the home favorite and twice Wimbledon semi-finalist and
held his nerve to level the scores at 4-4.
</P>
<P>
The crowd were then stunned into silence when Henman was broken
in the next game to love, missing a simple overhead to put Bryan 5-
4 ahead.
</P>
<P>
Henman battled hard but could not break back and slumped to a
shock 7-6 (7/2), 6-4 loss in 80 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Second seed Pete Sampras also made a slow start in his Center
Court battle with Arvind Parmar before winning 6-7, 6-4,6-3.
</P>
<P>
Seventh seed Marat Safin struggled past French journeyman
Julien Boutter in three sets in the second round.
</P>
<P>
The Russian took time to adjust his devastating clay and
hardcourt game to the slick grass but, despite looking a little
unsteady on his feet at first, prevailed 7-5 5-7 6-3 for his first
grasscourt triumph in four attempts.
</P>
<P>
Australia's Mark Philippoussis beat Davis Cup team mate Wayne
Arthurs 6-3 7-5 in the first round.
</P>
<P>
The 11th seed dominated his compatriot in the first clash
between the pair, even though Arthurs matched big-serving
Philippoussis's ace count. Each man served 12.
</P>
<P>
Philippoussis, champion here in 1997, was the steadier on big
points.
</P>
<P>
In the second round he will play another big-serving grasscourt
specialist Goran Ivanisevic whom he beat in the final here three
years ago.
</P>
<P>
American David Wheaton beat Sweden's Andreas Vinciguerra 6-3 6-
2 while France's Anthony Dupuis beat Swede Magnus Gustafsson 4-6,
6-3, 6-4 to set up a second-round match with top seed Andre Agassi.
</P>
<P>
The match is a replay of the French Open first round which
Agassi won.

LONDON, June 13 (Xinhua) -- England duo Tony Adams and Steve
McManaman are almost certainly out of Saturday's Euro 2000 clash
with Germany.
</P>
<P>
Both men suffered injuries in Monday night's 3-2 defeat by
Portugal in Eindhoven.
</P>
<P>
According to local reports on Tuesday, McManaman limped off
after suffering a knee injury while attempting to make a tackle in
midfield, while center-half Adams' notoriously fragile back
appeared to give way as England attempted to chase the game.
</P>
<P>
England coach Kevin Keegan said: "They have both gone for a
scan but the feeling is that Tony will not make the next two games
and Steve will not be fit for the match against Germany."
</P>
<P>
Asked to assess England's performance, Keegan added: "I can
certainly think of a fair few things we could have done better but
there were a lot of plusses in there that get overlooked."
</P>
<P>
"Our finishing was good and our character was good. I'm
disappointed but I still feel we've got it in our own hands. Yes,
it's more difficult now. We probably have to win both games," he
said.

LONDON, June 13 (Xinhua) -- England soccer team manager Kevin
Keegan said he was "ashamed" to hear "ferocious" abuse being
hurled at David Beckham by some England fans following the 3-2
defeat by Portugal in Eindhoven yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Beckham is alleged to have gestured towards fans who fired
abuse at him as he made his way down the tunnel after England's
opening match of Euro 2000, in which they surrendered a two-goal
lead.
</P>
<P>
Keegan said: "I heard the abuse and I was ashamed. If you had
have been in the tunnel and heard what I heard...I just couldn't
believe it."
</P>
<P>
"There were more (people) than David Beckham upset by the abuse
they were giving. It was ferocious. David Beckham covered very
blade of grass for us. That was his best ever performance in an
England shirt," he said.
</P>
<P>
"What happened down the tunnel was totally unacceptable. It
wasn't just David Beckham, other players were very annoyed by it.
It was very very personal," he told Sky Sports.
</P>
<P>
Earlier UEFA confirmed that the Manchester United midfielder
would not be punished for an apparent 'one-fingered salute' caught
on camera.
</P>
<P>
The incident has not been mentioned in the report of Swedish
referee Anders Frisk or in that of the official UEFA observer.
</P>
<P>
Several of the England players were said to have been shocked"
by the taunts of the supporters, who were believed to be drunk.

<HEADLINE> PNA Closes Crossing Points With Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) decided on Wednesday to close the trade crossing points with
Israel to protest against the damage to the Palestinian economy by
the strike of the Israeli civil service personnel at the Eriz
check-point.
</P>
<P>
The move came in response to the complaints of Palestinian
businessmen in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, said Nasser al-Siraj,
director general of the Palestinian Ministry of Economy and Trade.
</P>
<P>
The ministry instructed the Palestinian authorities at the
crossing points at the entrances to Palestinian-controlled towns to
deny access to all Israel-made commodities and not to deal with the
Israeli civil personnel, he said.
</P>
<P>
The PNA closed Karni check-point, in eastern Gaza, three days
ago for the same reason.
</P>
<P>
The closure of the crossing points is a protest against the
procrastination of the Israeli side in solving the Israeli civil
personnel strike, which hindered the issuance of licences and
permits to Palestinian imports and exports, al-Siraj added.
</P>
<P>
The value of the Palestinian commodities held at Israeli ports
has exceeded 100 million U.S. dollars. The commodities could be
damaged and cost the Palestinian importers extra storage and
demurrage fees, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian official stressed that the Palestinian side
would not deal with the Israelis until the situation returned to
normal.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Director of Palestinian Crossing Points Salim Abu-
Safiya said that up to 3,000 Palestinian exporters were unable to
enter Israel and many Palestinian workers could not get their work
permits as a result of the strike of the Israeli personnel.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman of the Israeli-PNA Coordination and Liaison Office
Shlomo Dorour said the strike issue was referred to the Israeli
Labor Court.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli civil personnel started their strike at the Eriz
check-point since early April to press for improvement of their
economic situation.
</P>
<P>
There are four trade crossing points between Gaza and Israel in
addition to the crossing points between Israel and the Palestinian-
controlled towns in the West Bank.

<HEADLINE> Thousands in Northern Greece to Participate in Church Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Greeks gathered in
the northern Greek city of Thessaloniki Wednesday evening to
participated in a Church rally in protest against a government
plan to abolish the reference to citizens' religious persuasion
from new identity cards.
</P>
<P>
The flag-bearing Greeks shouted slogans such as "Greece means
Orthodoxy" and "the youth does not want the new identity cards"
while Archbishop of Athens and All of Greece Christodoulos was
making a speech in which the head of Greece's Orthodox Church
accused the Greek government of going back on a promise to hold
dialogue before announcing its decision concerning the new
identity cards.
</P>
<P>
The rally was the first of two called by the Church to protest
the Greek government's decision on identity cards and a second
such rally is to take place in the capital city of Athens on June
21.
</P>
<P>
The Greek government Wednesday described the Thessaloniki
rally as being in contradiction to the Church's proper role.
</P>
<P>
Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said that the
holding of the rally and the content of Archbishop Christodoulos's
speech confirmed intentions and goals which contradicted the
spiritual and social role of the Church.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou also said
that the involvement by the Church in politics was a big mistake
which would deprive it of its spiritual role.

<P>
Fujimori said that he will start during his third presidential
mandate, from July 28, the strengthening of democratization in
Peru.
</P>
<P>
The president was reelected May 28 with 51.2 percent of the
votes in a controversial second election round, in which he was
the only candidate after his rival Alejandro Toledo withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Fujimori said that the eventual creation of a government
commission to promote democratic reforms and the reactivating of
the Court of Constitutional Guaranties (TGC) are part of an OAS
resolution.
</P>
<P>
Fujimori said that Peruvian political opposition, led by Toledo,
cannot destabilize the country, because that will directly damage
the Peruvian population and affects the stability of the nation.
</P>
<P>
The OAS mission, led by general secretary Cesar Gaviria and
Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy, will arrive in Peru,
invited by the Peruvian government.
</P>
<P>
The American foreign ministers approved during the OAS General

<HEADLINE> New Chechen Leader Urges Rebels to Surrender </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The newly appointed head of the
administration of Russia's republic of Chechnya on Wednesday urged
the rebels to lay down their arms.
</P>
<P>
Akhmed Kadyrov, the Chechen mufti (Muslim leader), made the
appeal following a meeting in a village near Grozny with Gennady
Troshev, the commander of the federal troops in the North Caucasus,
the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Vladimir Putin appointed Kadyrov as the
leader of the Chechen administration on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Kadyrov called on the militants "to stop the resistance, lay
down arms and return to peaceful life."
</P>
<P>
"It is time to stop spilling blood for ideas alien to the
Chechen people and which will never be accepted by them," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kadyrov told reporters that he would not rule out the
possibility of negotiations with separatist leaders such as former
Chechen president, Aslan Maskhadov.
</P>
<P>
"However, there will be no negotiations with those who have
robbed and killed people," Kadyrov said.
</P>
<P>
The mufti said he regards Maskhadov as the elected president of
Chechnya "who has lost legitimacy because of his inertia, and the
people no longer trust him."
</P>
<P>
Kadyrov promised to guarantee Maskhadov's safety if he "says he
is sorry and steps down."

<HEADLINE> Security Council Began Debate on DRC Conflicts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
on Wednesday afternoon began a closed-door session to discuss a
draft resolution on the current violence in the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
The draft resolution, designated to be adopted Friday, is
expected to threaten unspecified measures if fighting does not
stop, diplomatic sources said.
</P>
<P>
The Council's resolution would culminate two days of talks, on
Thursday and Friday, with a committee of senior representatives
from countries and rebel groups participating in the war.
</P>
<P>
The Wednesday meeting came after U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Tuesday asked the Security Council to demand a halt to
fighting between Ugandan and Rwandan troops in Kisangani, a
diamond trade center in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC),
and their prompt withdrawal from the central African country.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief also called on the 15-nation body to demand the
early withdrawal of all other foreign forces from the country, the
former Zaire, as foreseen in an accord signed in Lusaka, capital
of Zambia, which is intended to end the many-sided conflict in the
country.
</P>
<P>
In both cases, Annan said, the Council should act under the
mandatory provisions of Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter, which
provides for possible sanctions or other punitive measures in the
event of noncompliance.
</P>
<P>
Annan also urged the Council to invoke Chapter VII of the U.N.
Charter "to demand the subsequent early withdrawal of all other
foreign forces" in DRC, as foreseen in the Lusaka accord.
</P>
<P>
In this context, the U.N. chief suggested sanctions or other
punitive measure be considered if they refused to leave.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the Security Council Tuesday, Annan said, the
situation in DRC and prospects for further progress in the peace
process "have become particular uncertain."
</P>
<P>
Referring to fighting between Rwandan and Ugandan troops last
week in Kisangani, Annan said, "I invite the Security Council,
acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, to
demand that the governments of Rwanda and Uganda order their
respective armed forces to desist forthwith from further fighting
and withdraw from Kisangani immediately and from the territory of
the Democratic Republic of the Congo promptly thereafter."
</P>
<P>
The two forces "should be held accountable for the loss of
life and the property damage" they had inflicted on the civilian
population of Kisangani, he said. The report said an estimated 150
civilians had been killed and more than 1,000 wounded, despite
repeated efforts by Annan and others to secure a cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the continued fighting, Annan cited the
government's decision not to take part in preparatory meeting for
an inter-Congolese dialogue, its attempts to block participation
of the unarmed opposition, and "the chronic shortage and delays"
in providing resources for the facilitator of the national
dialogue appointed by the Organization of African Unity (OAU),
former Botswana President Ketumile Masire.
</P>
<P>
"These difficulties have been compounded by the government's
announcement, on June 9, of its withdrawal of confidence in Mr.
Masire," and its request to the OAU to nominate a new neutral
facilitator, Annan said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Organization mission in DRC (MONUC), in its current
phase, comprises only about 228 military observers and military
liaison officers in and around DRC, including 200 in that country
itself.
</P>
<P>
The fighting in DRC pits the government of President Laurent
Kabila, backed by Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia, against rebel
groups supported by Rwanda and Uganda.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators met in seclusion at two U.S. air bases here Wednesday
for a second day but little progress appeared to have been made
ahead of the expected arrival of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said at a regular
briefing that the negotiators have split into two groups, one to
discuss "final status" issues at Bolling Air Force Base, and the
other, at Andrews Air Force Base, to talk about disputes left over
from previous negotiations.
</P>
<P>
He said Special Middle East Coordinator Dennis Ross, who
returned from the funeral of Syrian President Hafez Assad
Wednesday morning, may be meeting with the negotiators at each
site separately and together at some point.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is expected to arrive in Washington Wednesday evening to
meet at the White House with President Bill Clinton on Thursday,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Though Boucher refused to go into details of the ongoing talks,
reports here indicated that Israeli and Palestinian negotiators
have so far made no apparent breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
A top Palestinian negotiator revealed that negotiations with
Israel were even once halted Wednesday in a dispute over the third
withdrawal by Israeli troops from the West Bank and Israel's
refusal to release more than a handful of Palestinian prisoners,
the Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
A source close to the Israeli delegation complained that "the
Palestinians are avoiding serious discussion of the more delicate
questions and are insisting on talking only about a third
redeployment and prisoners."
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the negotiators may remain through the
weekend to continue their discussions, which is still aiming to
work out a framework agreement for a "final status" pact before
the September 13 deadline.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Security
Council on Wednesday decided to renew the mandate of the United
Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus for a further period of six
months until December 15, 2000.
</P>
<P>
In its resolution unanimously adopted, the Security Council
reaffirmed all its resolutions on Cyprus and in particular
resolutions of 1251 of 1999 and 1283 of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The security Council requested the Secretary-General to submit
a report by December 1, 2000, on the implementation of these
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus has been in
island since 1964 which is aimed to help keep peace between the
Greek and Turkish Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
The island has been virtually partitioned since 1974 when
troops from Turkey occupied the north of the island in response to
a coup in Nicosia engineered by the junta then ruling Greece.

<HEADLINE> Canada, U.S. Open Second Session on Ozone Annex Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"These negotiations recognize that smog doesn't respect borders.
Canada and the U.S. are committed to reducing the trans-boundary
air pollution and its serious health effects," stated Canadian
Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Environment Minister David Anderson also declared that
"strong domestic action by Canada strengthens our hand in
negotiations with the U.S."
</P>
<P>
He said it is his hope that the two countries "can complete and
sign a binding agreement to reduce smog before the end of the year.
"
</P>
<P>
The two neighboring countries opened their first session on an
agreement known as Ozone Annex in February under the 1991 Canada-
United States Air Quality Agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian federal and provincial ministers of environment
met early in the month in the country's Quebec City to agree on an
accelerated schedule for the reduction of ground-level ozone.
</P>
<P>
"We agreed to meet a target of 65 parts per billion for all of
Canada by 2010 or earlier," at least five years earlier than
originally proposed by the country in 1999, according to Minister
Anderson.
</P>
<P>
But Canada has long insisted that between 30 and 90 percent of
the air pollution in various parts of Canada comes from the United
States, which in turn, counter-argues that Canada is also
responsible for some trans-boundary flows of pollutants.
</P>
<P>
The two countries believe the ground-level ozone is a
significant contributor to summer "smog" or "haze" in some of
their major cities.

<P>
MOSCOW, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Wednesday accused some
Western countries of trying to narrow the range of activities of
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to
Eastern European countries and especially to the territory of the
former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
"They are now trying to reorient the OSCE towards the East,"
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Yevgeny Gusarov said. "It worries
us."
</P>
<P>
Gusarov made the remarks at a roundtable discussion in Moscow
dedicated to the 25th anniversary of the Helsinki Final Act, the
Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The OSCE, originally known as the Conference on Security and
Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), was founded in 1972 as a forum to
reach agreement on security, economics, science, technology, and
human rights. The organization, which assumed the current name in
1994, now has over 50 member states.
</P>
<P>
Gusarov said that Moscow could not agree to the attempts by a
number of Western countries to abandon the principle of consensus
in the OSCE and to insist on removing general political problems
and issues relating to interstate relations from OSCE activities.
</P>
<P>
"In fact they want to leave the OSCE dealing only with issues
relating to human rights," Gusarov said.
</P>
<P>
He said if such tendencies become prevalent, the OSCE "will
actually be reduced to nothing."
</P>
<P>
Russia "will do everything to prevent this," Gusarov said.

CARTAGENA, Colombia, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The Group of Rio

Fernandez de Soto asked UN for an international campaign to
eradicate cybernetic illiteracy, which widens the gap between
developing countries and industrialized nations.

<HEADLINE> Central Asian Leaders Urge Efforts to Settle Afghan Conflict  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The presidents of four Central
Asian countries on Wednesday urged the international community to
take steps to settle the conflict in neighboring Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and
Uzbekistan made the appeal at a summit of the Central Asian
Economic Community in Dushanbe, the Tajik capital, the Interfax
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Uzbek President Islam Karimov told a press conference that the
appeal is addressed first of all to the U.N. Security Council, the
Organization of the Islamic Conference and the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
</P>
<P>
"The essence of the appeal is that we are not satisfied with
the amount of attention the U.N. and other international
structures are paying to the war in Afghanistan, which has already
been continuing for over 20 years," Karimov said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Afghan problem is not a local one and that it has
assumed a dangerous nature outside the Central Asian region, as
Afghanistan has become a training ground for bandit formations
where "international terrorists of all hues (are trained and
taught) and sent to different parts of the world."
</P>
<P>
The states bordering Afghanistan cannot look calmly at "the
creeping expansion of religious extremism and international
terrorism" coming from this country, Karimov said.
</P>
<P>
All five states of the region, including Turkmenistan, cannot
fight the continuous spread of drug trafficking routes defended by
armed formations without the help of international forces, the U.N.
and other great powers which themselves are becoming areas for
dumping drugs, Karimov said.
</P>
<P>
He criticized the United Nations for failing to achieve any
fruitful outcome in its initiatives on achieving peace in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore we have grounds today to address the U.N. and its
Security Council on behalf of the states that directly feel this
danger, so that they take more efficient measures to neutralize
the threat and bring about peace in Afghanistan," Karimov said.

Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) Carol Bellamy will arrive in
Ethiopia Thursday to start a five-nation tour to the Horn of
Africa where 13 million people are facing starvation due to
prolonged drought.
</P>
<P>
During the trip, which will also take her to Eritrea,
Djibouti, Somalia and Kenya, she will visit feeding centers and
displaced persons camps, according to a news release issued here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Bellamy's trip comes at a time when the drought crisis and its
enormous human impact has faded from the headlines.
</P>
<P>
It also follows on the heels of a United Nations appeal for
more than 378 million U.S. dollars to address the immediate
humanitarian needs in the region.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF estimates that 70 percent of all those hurt by the
drought are children and women. And children are most vulnerable
to the malnutrition and disease associated with drought.

<HEADLINE> Poverty Restraints Protection of Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Poverty is blamed for hindering
the protection of the children's rights, according to Kenya's
first country report on implementation of the U.N. Convention on
the Rights of the Child issued here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Poverty is a constraint in parental guidance, and inhibits the
 development of a child's capacities," the report said.
</P>
<P>
Decreasing budgetary allocations, inadequate educational and
vocational training facilities and poor co-ordination in the
delivery of services to children are major constraints that
inhibit the implementation of the U.N. Convention on the Rights of
the Child in Kenya, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Malnutrition still persists and the HIV/AIDS pandemic poses a
threat to the survival and development of children, according to
the report.
</P>
<P>
However, Kenya, a signatory to the Convention on the Rights of
the Child, has made progress in the enacting of laws to safeguard
the children's rights.
</P>
<P>
A Children Bill has been prepared and it will be debated in
Kenya's National Assembly soon, according to the report.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks End Mixed Amid CPI Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks ended mixed
Wednesday with blue chips rising but tech shares falling amid
report on a 0.1 percent rise in the Consumer Price Index in May.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 66.11 at 10,687.95.
But the technology heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 53.65 at 3,
797.41.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index rose 1.10 at 1,470.54.
</P>
<P>
The CPI report encouraged investors to buy blue chips, driving
the Dow index higher. The Labor Department said the CPI rose 0.1
percent in May, less than 0.2 percent the analysts had expected.
</P>
<P>
The report gave investors hope that the Federal Reserve would
not raise interest rates at the June 27-28 meeting. The Federal
Reserve has raised rates six times since last June in an effort to
cool off the U.S. economy and keep inflation under control.
</P>
<P>
While buying blue chips, investors moved money out of the tech
sectors. The big names of Qualcomm, Intel and Oracle fell,
dragging the Nasdaq index lower.
</P>
<P>
But Microsoft rose one day after the software maker appealed to
the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals against a federal judge's
decision to break the company in two. The company said the trial
judge made "an array of serious substantive and procedural errors
that infected virtually every aspect of the proceedings" in the
antitrust case.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index rose 3.10 at 656.73. But the American Stock
Exchange index fell 3.33 at 943.22 and the Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies fell 4.09 at 509.67.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-3 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,687 up, 1,253 down and 498
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume increased to 925.03 million shares from 910.82
million in the previous session.

<HEADLINE> Worldwide Softswitch Market to Explode </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The worldwide market for
softswitches, a market that is barely shipping products today,
will reach 5.7 billion U.S. dollars by 2004, an American market
research firm reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Softswitches will become the centerpiece of next-generation
networks, and in the course of time they will become a critical
element in any service provider's overall network," said the
International Data Corporation (IDC).
</P>
<P>
Softswitches are software on a high-availability computing
platform that controls the flow of voice and data traffic in a
converged telecommunications network and mediates signaling
between Internet protocol (IP) and public switched telephone
network (PSTN) subdomains. IDC believes softswitches have the
capacity to transform the PSTN.
</P>
<P>
The softswitch market is a new and immature market and has many
product and technology interdependencies. In fact, IDC said, most
of the growth in softswitch development will come from associated
sales of media and access gateways to service providers. As a
result, to succeed in the market, vendors will have to establish
effective partnerships.

<HEADLINE> Liberia Urges Probe into Alleged Role in S. Leone Diamond Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lagos, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The Liberian government is demanding
an international commission of inquiry into allegations that it is
involved in diamond and gunrunning in Sierra Leone, reports
reaching here from Monrovia said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We are disappointed as a government and a member of the
international community that there was not a thorough
investigation done to exonerate Liberia or establish its
involvement in Sierra Leone," said the country' s Information
Minister Joe Mulbah in the West African country' s capital.
</P>
<P>
His statement on Wednesday was apparently reacting to reports
that Britain Tuesday succeeded in blocking a 35-million-pound
European Union aid package to Liberia due to President Charles
Taylor's alleged support to rebels in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Britain had expressed concern that Taylor has failed to act to
prevent arms and other supplies from reaching the rebels of the
Revolutionary United Front from Liberian territory and allowing it
to smuggle illicit diamonds out of Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Liberia has repeatedly denied the allegations and has called on
its accusers to provide proof of their claims.
</P>
<P>
"We feel that the action is unjust. The first thing Britain
would have done along with the EU was to launch an investigation
into the matter and confront us with any evidence so that we can
defend ourselves," Mulbah said.
</P>
<P>
The minister added that what the government feared most was
that Britain's action could trigger a complete international
blockade that would not stop at the level of the EU, but may
spread to other international bodies.
</P>
<P>
"We have said over and over that our border with Sierra Leone
is porous. That is why we have repeatedly called for international
monitors to observe it, unfortunately that is yet to be done," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"We believe Britain and the EU should rethink their decision to
withhold aid from a country emerging from seven years of war and
is playing an influential role in the sub-region," Mulbah added.
</P>
<P>
The RUF started the war in Sierra Leone in 1991 from territory
then controlled by Taylor's defunct rebel National Patriotic Front.
</P>
<P>
Since then many have held the view that the Liberian president
holds sway over the RUF and its now detained leader, Foday Sankoh.
</P>
<P>
Taylor last month had used his influence to persuade Sierra
Leone' s rebels to release the bulk of the some 400 UN
peacekeepers held hostages by them.

<HEADLINE> More British Troops Leave N.Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Britain's troop levels in Northern
Ireland fell to their lowest for 30 years with the departure of
500 soldiers on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The British army has said the further reduction in troops
reflected the improved security situation in the province.
</P>
<P>
The remaining members of the East Tyrone Battalion, based at
Dungannon, County Tyrone, returned to base in Dover on Wednesday,
following a six month tour of duty in the province.
</P>
<P>
They were the last of 500 soldiers in the Third Battalion
Parachute Regiment to leave Northern Ireland. They are not being
replaced.
</P>
<P>
It means that troop levels in Northern Ireland stand at about
13,500 - the lowest since 1970.
</P>
<P>
All but one of the six battalions based in the province at the
time of the IRA ceasefire in 1997, are now back at their bases in
Britain.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland's police chief Sir Ronnie Flanagan recently
announced the further reductions in troop levels and said it"
reflected the improved security situation in the province".
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the army said that the troops would "continue
to be available for deployment in province should the security
situation require it".
</P>
<P>
The move was part of an overall demilitarization program and
followed the closure of a number of army observation posts in
Belfast and south Armagh to reflect the reduced threat of
paramilitary violence.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the withdrawal, Sir Ronnie said it was "appropriate",
even though there was still a security threat from dissident
republican groups.
</P>
<P>
The decision to start scaling down the British Army presence in
Northern Ireland was taken following the Irish Republican Army's
offer to put its arms "beyond use" on May 6.
</P>
<P>
The security forces believe the IRA statement, in which it set
a context for putting weapons and explosives completely beyond use,
signalled a reduction in the security threat.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein has welcomed the moves, but has said it expects the
British government to honor commitments on further
demilitarization.
</P>
<P>
However, some unionists have said they feel the moves are "
risky and premature".

BRASILIA, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The Brazilian government will use
its international reserves to pay around 1.5 billion U.S. dollars
in foreign debt, due at the end of this month, said Wednesday the
Central Bank (BC).
</P>
<P>
Central Bank sources said that Brazil will not go to the market
to get the dollars it needs to pay the IDU Brady bonds and debts
with the Paris Club.
</P>
<P>
The drop of the reserves, now at 28.843 billion dollars in the
concept of international liquidity, will be compensated by the
arrival in the country in June and July of some one billion
dollars in loans from the World Bank and the Inter-american
Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
The loans of the two financial institutions are part of a
package of international assistance led by the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) at the end of 1998 for 41.5 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Stresses Privileged Ties Between France and Algeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 14 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
stressed Wednesday evening the privileged ties between France and
Algeria and called for building a future-oriented relationship
based on mutual respect and solidarity.
</P>
<P>
During a banquet he hosted in honor of Algerian President
Abdelaziz Bouteflika, Chirac said that it is time for France and
Algeria to move forward and build their relations in serenity,
mutual respect,peacefulness and ambition.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Algeria and France, which is former colonial
power of Algeria, have remained highly irritable for both
countries while the multi-million strong Algerian community in
France is the biggest non-European ethnic group in Europe.
</P>
<P>
``We have faith in the future of Algeria. The French people are
following with much attention and hope the on-going changes in
your country,'' Chirac told Bouteflika.
</P>
<P>
He paid homage to the ``courage and dignity of the Algerian
people in their daily fight against terrorism, fanaticism, and
barbarity'' and said that France stands by Algeria in this fight
and in its effort to renew itself.
</P>
<P>
Chirac, who served in the French army in Algeria during its war
of independence, said that neither France nor Algeria should
forget ``the blood shed, the companions fallen and the sufferings
endured by all sides'' during the war from 1954 to 1962.
</P>
<P>
He also praised Bouteflika as ``a statesman who gives hope and
courage to a wounded Algeria'' and for giving his country the
right place in the international scenery and for winning back the
trust of France.
</P>
<P>
Chirac also said that both the Algerians who immigrated to
France and the Frenchmen who returned to France after Algeria won
independence are the people who have ``woven between the two
shores close and strong ties.''
</P>
<P>
``Many of them feel themselves to be as Algerian as French,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
Bouteflika arrived here Wednesday for a four-day state visit,
which is aimed at fully rebuilding the ties with France.

WASHINGTON, June 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said on Wednesday the agreement signed at the Korean summit was a
hopeful step toward reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very pleased by this (outcome) and I think the communique
is hopeful," Clinton said at the White House when asked by a
reporter about the summit.
</P>
<P>
"Now they've got a lot of work to do, and it's just the first

else in the world should be encouraged by this, this is a good

social, cultural and other fields.
</P>
<P>
Other U.S. officials, however, were more cautious in their
welcome of the summit.

it was encouraging that the two leaders had met but said it was
crucial that a formal process be established to follow up on the

Lagos, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Governor Rabiu Kwankwaso of Nigeria'
s northern Kano State Wednesday said his state would introduce the
controversial Islamic law Sharia on Wednesday next week.
</P>
<P>
He said in the state' s capital Kano that the decision had been

<P>
Two northern states, Zamfara and Sokoto, have already

despite the opposition from the Christian dominated south states
and the federal government.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people have been killed this year in the northern
state of Kaduna, where the population is almost evenly divided
between Muslims and Christians, in sectarian clashes linked to
proposals to introduce Sharia law into the state.
</P>
<P>
Sharia, mainly implemented in Islamic countries, is a code of
living for Muslims. Apart from its religious contents, the code is
known for its regulations that women must cover themselves, and
different sexes must be segregated.

<P>
WASHINGTON, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Argentine President De la Rua
on Wednesday criticized the United States for its subsidies on
agricultural produce and purged it to open produce market for
Argentine produce.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting at the end of his two-day visit to the
United States, de la Rua said U.S. practices on restrictions on
Argentine imports and subsidies on its own farm produce were "on
the edges of legality" as far as international trade accords were
concerned, and were contributing to "the grave depression in
prices" of agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
He told nearly 1,000 business people that U.S. subsidies were
the equivalent of Argentina's total exports, and pointed out that
the United States still restricted imports of Argentina's meat and
steel and prohibited imports of its fruit juice.

<HEADLINE> U.S. President Says Not Time for Mideast Summit Yet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said on Wednesday that some progress had been made in the ongoing
Israeli-Palestinian talks beginning here Tuesday but it was not
time yet for a three-way summit to hammer out details of an
Israeli-Palestinian peace deal.
</P>
<P>
"I think we need to get the parties a little closer before we
can go there," Clinton said at the White House, just hours before
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat was due to arrive in
Washington to discuss the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Mediated by the U.S. side, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators
were meeting at two U.S.air bases in the Washington area on
Wednesday for the second day of talks in bid to lay the groundwork
for a U.S.-Palestinian-Israeli summit, possibly this month.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know that I can tell you anything other than that I
think we are making steady progress," Clinton said. "We've seen
the narrowing of some of the gaps but I don't know that we're
ready to have the final meeting yet."
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian talks, the third of its kind since the
beginning of the year, have reportedly made no apparent
breakthrough so far. It was reported that the Palestinian side
even called for a suspension of the talks on Wednesday in a
dispute with Israel over promised troop withdrawal from the West
Bank.
