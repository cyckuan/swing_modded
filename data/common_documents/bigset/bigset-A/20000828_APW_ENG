Six Hurt in Spanish Bull Run
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   CUELLAR, Spain (AP) -- Bulls gored six people Sunday during a Pamplona-style
running of the bulls event billed as Spain's oldest. An estimated 1,000 people
made the dash with six fighting bulls through the streets of this central
Spanish town, from a corral to a bullring where the animals were to face
matadors and death. None of those injured by the bulls died. Cuellar, 70 miles
north of Madrid, says its run is now in its 501st year, making it Spain's
oldest. City hall cites a 1499 ordinance that officially established the run.

Lizard Fossil Sells Big at Auction
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A 200 million-year-old fossil of a winged lizard sold
for $167,000 Sunday in the same controversial auction that put a silver handle
from Apollo 11 in the hands of an unknown bidder for $34,500. Both items are
considered one of a kind, and their auction angered experts in both fields. NASA
is investigating whether the spacecraft's handle should have reached
Butterfields' auction block at all. And paleontologists concerned about the
commercialization of important finds were angry that the fossil was sold rather
than preserved in a museum's collection.

Record-Tying Dry Spell Hits Texas
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- The summer's dry spell in North Texas was on its way to
becoming one for the record books Sunday. It's been 50 years since the state
last went 58 consecutive days without measurable rainfall. With no noteworthy
rain on Sunday, the region would tie that record, and forecasts showed it likely
would break it Monday. A 58-day drought interval first occurred in Texas May 25
to July 21, 1934, during the Dust Bowl years of the Great Depression. It
happened again Nov. 4 to Dec. 31, 1950.

   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- A main bridge in southern Taiwan collapsed Sunday,
sending drivers and passengers fleeing their cars and racing to safety as chunks
of concrete dropped into the water below. No one was killed, but 22 people were
taken to hospitals after 330 feet of the Kaohsiung-Pingtung bridge collapsed.
The injured were in stable condition with sprains and cuts, firefighters and
paramedics said. No cars were found in the river after four hours of searching
with divers, boats and a helicopter, said Lee Ching-pin, a fire official from
Pingtung.

   SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) -- Rescuers confirmed Sunday that all 10 people on
board a small plane that slammed into a volcano in northern Costa Rica were
killed, airline officials said. Three Americans were among the dead. About 200
rescue workers who climbed the lava-and rock-littered side of Arenal volcano
found the wreckage of the 15-seat, single-engine Cessna Grand Caravan plane,
owned by National Aerial Services, or Sansa. The plane had gone down Saturday.

Survey: Violent Crime Rate Plunges
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The violent crime rate declined by 10.4 percent last year,
the largest one-year drop in the 26-year history of the government's largest
crime survey, the Justice Department reported Sunday. The property crime rate
fell 8.9 percent from 1998 to 1999, according to the Bureau of Justice
Statistics' national crime victimization survey. The survey estimated there were
28.8 million violent and property crimes in 1999, the lowest figure since the
survey was begun in 1973, when it found an estimated 44 million crimes.

<HEADLINE> Angels 10, Indians 9  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Tim Salmon hit a tiebreaking homer in the
fifth inning and the Anaheim Angels held on for a 10-9 victory over
the Cleveland Indians on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon's 30th homer made Anaheim the first AL team to have four
players with at least that many. Salmon also had a two-run double
in a five-run sixth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Finley (10-10), the winningest pitcher in Angels history,
had his worst outing of the season in his first start in Anaheim as
a visiting player. The left-hander allowed season-highs of 11 hits
and eight runs in 5 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   He was chased in the sixth after giving up an RBI single to
Darin Erstad that made it 6-4. Salmon doubled off Justin Speier,
and Mo Vaughn followed with a two-run single to make it 10-4.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland rallied for five runs in the seventh, but had the
tying run thrown out at the plate. It was the third Indians runner
thrown out trying to score.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Lofton started the scoring in the inning with a sacrifice
fly. After Mike Holtz walked Vizquel to load the bases, Mark
Petkovsek relieved and gave up Roberto Alomar's 15th homer of the
season and sixth career grand slam.
</P>
<P>
   Manny Ramirez then doubled and tried to score on David Segui's
single to center, but Garret Anderson's one-hop throw to catcher
Bengie Molina beat him by 10 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Segui was thrown out in the first and third innings.
</P>
<P>
   Al Levine (3-4) pitched 2 1-3 innings for the victory, and
Shigetoshi Hasegawa pitched got the last six outs for his eighth
save in 14 chances.
</P>
<P>
   Angels starter Kent Mercker lasted only 3 2-3 innings. He
allowed four runs on eight hits, while walking four and striking
out one.
</P>
<P>
   Omar Vizquel's two-run homer, his seventh, and Segui's RBI
single gave the Indians a 3-0 lead in the first.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels took the lead with four runs in the third, the first
two on Troy Glaus' 37th homer, a 440-foot shot into the left-field
bleachers. Molina added a two-run single later in the inning to
make it 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians tied it in the fourth when Vizquel walked with two
outs, stole second and scored on Alomar's double high off the
right-center field wall.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Vaughn struck out once, increasing his total to move within
17 of Reggie Jackson's 1982 franchise record of 156. Glaus moved
within 12 of Bobby Knoop's 1966 team record of 144 by a
right-handed batter. ... The Angels have neither won nor lost more
than two straight since opening August with five consecutive
losses. ... Ramirez has hit in 11 straight games, going 17-for-36
(.487) during the stretch. ... Salmon wound up hitting .515
(17-for-33) with four homers and 11 RBIs in nine games against
Cleveland. ... Vaughn (31) and Garret Anderson (31) are the other
Anaheim players with 30 homers, matching a feat accomplished in the
NL six times by three different teams.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   MORRILTON, Ark. (AP) - A 25-year-old woman from New Jersey was
found stabbed to death at an Interstate 40 rest stop near
Morrilton, Ark., Conway County Sheriff Mark Flowers said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, whose name was withheld by Flowers, was stabbed and
her nude body was left on the bank of a nearby pond, the sheriff
said.
</P>
<P>
   The woman was driving with her two dogs from her home state to
California. A trucker spotted the dogs running loose late Saturday
afternoon and called a phone number on one of the dogs' tags. The
trucker reached the woman's mother who told the trucker something
must be wrong, Flowers said.
</P>
<P>
   The trucker called authorities, who found the body while
searching the area.
</P>
<P>
   Flowers said he was awaiting autopsy results to learn the cause
of death.

<HEADLINE> World Religious Leaders Gather  </HEADLINE>
By JULIA LIEBLICH
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Swamis, rabbis, monks and ministers gather at
the United Nations for the Millennium World Peace Summit to discuss
how to resolve the conflicts that divide countries -- and threaten
their own meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Participants say they hope the summit, which runs Monday through
Thursday, will result in resolutions on peace, poverty and the
environment, as well as the formation of a permanent council of
religious leaders to advise the United Nations on preventing and
settling disputes.
</P>
<P>
   In the lobby of The Waldorf-Astoria hotel, where most summit
participants are staying, barefoot monks mingled with white-robed
swamis on Sunday. Inca Indians in wool tunics and tasseled hats
looked in wonder at the processions of veils, caps and turbans.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll continue to look for solutions until the peace comes,''
said Eritrean Bishop Zekarias Yohannes, who plans to meet with
Ethiopia leaders. The two Horn of Africa neighbors have a
cease-fire in a border war.
</P>
<P>
   ''Peace is very dear to us,'' said Kawmar Ohiah Kamaruzaman, a
Muslim professor from Malaysia. ''We can't get it in one sitting.
But if there is any chance we should grab it.''
</P>
<P>
   But the difficulty of achieving any consensus was highlighted
when participants learned earlier this month that conference
organizers had not invited the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan Buddhist
leader and a Nobel Peace Prize winner, to the first two days of the
conference for fear of offending China. The seven-member Chinese
delegation to the summit accused the Dalai Lama last week of
''creating turmoil in Tibet,'' from which he fled in 1959 after an
abortive uprising against China's occupation.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday evening, summit general secretary Bawa Jain said an
eight-person delegation of Tibetan Buddhist leaders had been sent
by the Dalai Lama, and that two of them would be speaking in the
General Assembly hall.
</P>
<P>
   ''But I don't want it to get into anything political,'' said
Jain, a member of the Jain faith from New Jersey by way of India.
''I've made that clear to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, pro-Tibetan groups said, planned demonstrations
protesting the Dalai Lama's exclusion were still on.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the tensions, many participants say that given the
number of conflicts with strong religious components -- from Sierra
Leone to the Balkans -- they wouldn't miss a chance to form
alliances for peace.
</P>
<P>
   An interfaith coalition organized the program and invited
high-ranking religious leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ''The delegations from China and Vietnam were the only ones
chosen by their governments,'' said Dena Merriam of the summit
executive council.
</P>
<P>
   Among the leaders on the program: Cardinal Francis Arinze,
president of the Vatican's Pontifical Council for Interreligious
Dialogue; Cambodian Buddhist leader Samdech Preah Maha Ghosananda;
the Grand Mufti of Bosnia, Mustafa Ceric; Israeli Chief Rabbi Meir
Lau; the Rev. Jesse Jackson; Evangelist Anne Graham Lotz, the Rev.
Billy Graham's daughter; and numerous indigenous leaders including
Chief Oren Lyons, faithkeeper of the Onondaga Nation in upstate New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders who declined include Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I,
who sent a videotaped message, and Jerusalem Mufti Ikrema Sabri,
who has refused to meet with Rabbi Lau.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations is not an official summit sponsor, which has
received funding from Ted Turner's U.N. Foundation, Better World
Fund and others. Turner, who once said that Christianity was ''for
losers,'' will give the keynote address.
</P>
<P>
   Still, organizers say the meeting was a response to a call from
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who is scheduled to speak
Tuesday. The first two days of the summit will be held in the U.N.
General Assembly chamber.
</P>
<P>
   Even a limited U.N. connection has placed the meeting in the
midst of international political strife.
</P>
<P>
   A U.N. official advised conference organizers that China would
be outraged by an invitation to the Dalai Lama.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers invited him only to the last two days of the
conference -- being held at a New York hotel, away from the United
Nations. He declined.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow Nobel peace laureate Desmond Tutu said the exclusion
''totally undermines the integrity of the United Nations and the
credibility of the summit.''
</P>
<P>
   Participants welcome the opportunity for interreligious dialogue
on a grand scale, but some observers question how much progress can
make in four days.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Divinity School professor David Little said he hopes
religious leaders will discuss subjects they often avoid, such as
their communities' treatment of minorities who have become the
leading victims of human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, he wants to see leaders make tough political
choices about who will serve on an advisory committee to the United
Nations and their ongoing responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ''The institutionalization of an advisory committee is
enormously important,'' he said, ''if the summit is not to be seen
as a once-in-a-lifetime thing.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Turns Attention To Peace  </HEADLINE>
By SONYA ROSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) -- After trying to convince Nigerians that
their impoverished nation can embrace the computer economy,
President Clinton turned his attention to something that has proved
almost as elusive: peace in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was flying on Monday to Tanzania, where former South
African President Nelson Mandela and other mediators have tried for
weeks to craft a cease-fire in Burundi's seven-year civil war.
Mandela had hoped Clinton could join 12 African leaders in
witnessing a peace agreement between Burundi's Tutsi-controlled
government and Hutu rebels.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the hoped-for agreement, rebels fired on
Bujumbura, Burundi's capital. The administration, noting that some
rebel groups have not come to the negotiating table, declined to
connect Clinton's visit to a signing ceremony and cast it instead
as a show of support for Mandela.
</P>
<P>
   ''We see the Burundi peace process as ... ongoing,'' said Susan
Rice, assistant secretary of state for African affairs. ''The best
we can hope for is an outcome that takes the process a large step
down the road. In any case, the United States will continue to
support the efforts of President Mandela.''
</P>
<P>
   After a few hours in Tanzania, Clinton planned to meet Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak in Cairo to discuss the status of the
Israeli-Palestinian peace peace process, then head home.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton closed his weekend visit to Nigeria on Sunday night with
an address to business leaders, in which he announced the United
States would make Nigerian exports eligible for duty-free
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   He called Nigeria ''America's important partner,'' and said the
entrepreneurs could begin turning around Nigeria's reputation for
corruption by investing in its people and diversifying the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to reverse the practice that went along with the
absence of democracy, ... but let's not get too carried away about
the impact of the past on the future,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can actually have dot-com companies in Nigeria. You can
make money off the Internet here. Now, if Nigeria does its part,
then Nigeria's trading partners and the wealthier countries of the
world, especially, must do their part as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton promised continued U.S. support for Nigeria's transition
to democracy but did not, as President Olusegun Obasanjo had hoped,
agree to cancel or cut the nearly $1 billion U.S. portion of
Nigeria's $32 billion foreign debt, a move that would require
congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
   Before meeting the business leaders, Clinton visited a women's
health center, where director John Ibekwe suggested he press
African leaders to be more aggressive about battling AIDS. ''With
you as an advocate on our side, governments in Africa will do more
than they have been doing,'' Ibekwe said.
</P>
<P>
   ''In every country, in any culture, it is difficult, painful, at
the very least embarrassing, to talk about the issues involved with
AIDS,'' Clinton said. ''But is it harder to talk about these things
than to watch a child die of AIDS? ... We have to break the silence
about how this disease spreads and how to prevent it.''
</P>
<P>
   AIDS killed 2.8 million people worldwide last year, and is now
the leading cause of death in Africa. The U.S. government will
spend $9.4 million this year for AIDS and HIV infection prevention
and care in Nigeria, $8.7 million for polio eradication and $2
million toward prevention of malaria.
</P>
<P>
   In sub-Saharan Africa, 13 million children have lost a parent to
AIDS, and the disease is reducing life expectancies and dimming
development hopes across the continent. About 2.6 million
Nigerians, 5.4 percent of the population, are afflicted with AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ''AIDS can rob a country of its future,'' Clinton said. ''I know
you are not going to let that happen to Nigeria.''

<HEADLINE> Wind Threatens Montana Fires  </HEADLINE>
By BOB ANEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   HELENA, Mont. (AP) -- Firefighters were on their guard Sunday as
30 mph wind gusts threatened to worsen wildfires that have turned
hundreds of thousands of acres of forest to ash.
</P>
<P>
   Wind already was blamed for whipping up a firestorm in South
Dakota's mountainous Black Hills. The fire had swept across more
than 62,000 acres by Sunday, and Forest Service officials said they
feared it could remain explosive.
</P>
<P>
   More than ten thousand people were still fighting 23 major fires
in Montana that had charred some 670,000 acres. Officials there and
in Wyoming said the fire lines were quiet Sunday, but they weren't
letting down their guard.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have a feeling that we'll discover that some of the fires
have increased dramatically,'' said E.Lynn Burkett of the National
Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho. ''There's so many elements
out there working against us -- steep canyons, winds that make fires
run.''
</P>
<P>
   Another blaze was sparked by a motorcycle accident late Sunday
near the Northeast corner of Yellowstone National Park and had
quickly spread to 3,000 acres within a few hours, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 homes between the fire's advancing edge and the
town of Red Lodge were evacuated, but the blaze was spreading
through the upper limbs of trees and moving too fast to bring in
firefighters, officials said. Instead, five air tankers were
attacking the flames from the sky.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just moving too fast for us to be doing any good on the
ground,'' said Jeff Gildhaus, fire information officer.
</P>
<P>
   In Idaho, where more than 709,000 acres of forest and range land
was burning, Gov. Dirk Kempthorne signed a proclamation Sunday
extending a 30-day state of emergency for another month to keep
government aid and resources flowing to the fire lines.
</P>
<P>
   ''The reports from the fire lines, as well as the weather
reports, tell us that we have at least several more weeks of work
before we can hope to get the upper hand on most of these fires,''
Kempthorne said.
</P>
<P>
   High winds pushed a brush fire in the heart of the Black Hills
National Forest, northwest of Custer, S.D., exploded from 30,000
acres on Saturday to an estimated 90,000 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters were forced off that fire's north side Saturday
because the wind created firestorm conditions. Three outbuildings
and a tractor were destroyed in the sparsely settled region and two
homes were damaged, officials reported.
</P>
<P>
   The few people in the region were urged to evacuate an area of
300 square miles, forest officials said. Fire lines along the
eastern side of the blaze were being strengthened because a cold
front moving into the region was expected to bring northwesterly
wind.
</P>
<P>
   Crews fighting a 77,000-acre brush fire near Prosser, Wash., had
its 80-mile perimeter contained late Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had the (staffing) power and the good strategies, and we
got this thing put to bed really fast,'' fire information officer
Cynthia Reichelt said. The fire was ignited Wednesday night by a
lightning strike in a remote area of the Yakama Indian Reservation
and had burned 16 structures, including one home.
</P>
<P>
   Montana Gov. Marc Racicot said Sunday that the federal
government shared some of the blame for many of the blazes that
have made this the worst fire season in decades.
</P>
<P>
   The fire danger, he said on ''Fox News Sunday,'' was something
''that the administration knew about, that all of us have known
about for a long period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   But Racicot denied that Western governors were using the issue
of the fires to hurt Al Gore's presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's patent nonsense,'' Racicot, a Republican, said.
''Anyone that would politicize this issue with the tragedy that's
confronting the people of the West, virtually all of them, would be
outrageous. It's totally inappropriate to cast it in those terms.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Using Family To Define Image  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE GLOVER
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBUQUE, Iowa (AP) -- When Al and Tipper Gore stepped off the
hotel elevator and found a string quartet playing for her 52nd
birthday, it was the latest of many family moments to be captured
on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   To a large extent, Gore's family has hit the road to help in the
vice president's pursuit of the White House and, to an
extraordinary degree, the vice president is focusing on his family
as he defines his image apart from the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   ''This campaign is all about America's families,'' said
spokesman Chris Lehane.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's family has long played an important role in his campaign
for the presidency, but the profile has gotten higher since the
Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles. Gore has missed no
occasion to dwell lovingly on the role family plays in his life.
</P>
<P>
   ''The woman I love, the mother of our four children, the
grandmother of our grandson, my wife of 30 years -- Tipper,'' is a
standard introduction. He misses no opportunity to publicly declare
her the love of his life, and aides say voters will see much more
focus on ''an adoring and caring family.''
</P>
<P>
   For any who miss the point, Gore underscored it with the
lingering kiss he planted on his wife after he bounded up the
convention stage to accept the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Daughter Karenna Gore Schiff said ''the kiss'' didn't surprise
her because her parents are affectionate in private. ''That's just
the way they are,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Putting his family ties on display also signals to voters that
there would be no sex scandals in a Gore White House, and the
campaign plans to miss no opportunities to make that point.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gore will be along for her husband's campaign swing this
week. Advisers also say the Gores, and running mate Joseph
Lieberman and his wife, Hadassah, will campaign as a group ''more
than you've seen in past elections.''
</P>
<P>
   The image will be a devoted family scene.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore's family serves as more than a simple prop to help
portray him as a trustworthy family man. Some members have crucial
behind-the-scenes roles, particularly Tipper Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ''She is without a doubt his top adviser and closest friend,''
said Lehane. ''The entire family plays a significant role in
campaign decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Gore met all day with top aides in Nashville,
Tenn., as he pondered the selection of a running mate, but broke
off deliberations to wait for his wife. Within a couple of hours of
her arrival, the decision was made.
</P>
<P>
   When the campaign went through a rough spell last year, she was
among those urging it be uprooted and moved to Tennessee, and that
Gore return to a ''town meeting'' campaign format that served him
well when he was in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   She isn't alone.
</P>
<P>
   Schiff, a Columbia Law School graduate and new mother, has taken
on the high-profile and full-time job of motivating younger voters.
She also had the task of humanizing Gore at the Democratic
convention, describing him in her speech as a doting father and
grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   Another daughter, Kristin, introduced her mother to the
gathering.
</P>
<P>
   For those who doubt their roles, aides note that Mrs. Gore
introduced her husband to the convention while Schiff nominated her
father -- both high-profile convention speaking slots.
</P>
<P>
   The two are also something of a campaign tag team. When Mrs.
Gore became ill and canceled a campaign appearance last week,
Schiff filled in.
</P>
<P>
   Brother-in-law Frank Hunger, a close family friend, is present
for virtually every important decision and is a constant traveling
companion.
</P>
<P>
   When questions arose about whether the country was ready for a
Jewish running mate, Hunger spoke up in his soft Southern drawl to
suggest that maybe the country ought to be ready.
</P>
<P>
   There is at least some limit to Gore's focus on the family,
however.
</P>
<P>
   While there have been some photographs of 1-year-old grandson
Wyatt, the family is leery about putting the toddler on display.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent campaign flight, Schiff ventured back to the media
section on Air Force Two to say she wanted to bring her son back to
play and mingle -- but only if the cameras were put away.

Survey: Need For Workers Strong
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- American companies continue to show strong demand for
workers going into the final quarter of the year, according to a closely-watched
quarterly survey released Monday. Thirty-two percent of the nearly 16,000
companies surveyed by Manpower Inc., a major staffing agency, said they planned
to add staff in the final three months of the year -- the strongest year-end
level seen in the 25 years Manpower has been taking its survey.Jeffrey Joerres,
president and CEO of Manpower, said the tight labor situation has cause
companies to devote more effort to retaining current staff and redeploying them
in new functions when possible.

rain on Sunday, the region would tie that record, and forecasts showed it likely
would break it Monday. A 58-day drought interval first occurred in Texas May 25

<HEADLINE> Philippine Rebels Release Hostage  </HEADLINE>
By BULLIT MARQUEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOLO, Philippines (AP) -- Muslim rebels freed a South African man
on Monday, leaving six foreigners and 12 Filipinos still in
guerrilla hands on a remote Philippine island.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm over the moon'' with happiness, said South African Callie
Strydom, who had been held captive since April. ''It's a different
world out here.''
</P>
<P>
   Strydom's wife, Monique, was freed Sunday by the Abu Sayyaf
rebels, along with three French women and a German man, after Libya
agreed to pay $1 million for each, negotiators said.
</P>
<P>
   South African Ambassador Lindiwe Mabuza immediately telephoned
her country's president with tears of happiness in her eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm ecstatic,'' she said. ''It's fantastic.''
</P>
<P>
   The hostages were to be flown later Monday to Tripoli to meet
with Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi. Libya has long-standing ties to
Muslim rebels in the mostly Catholic Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   Libyan Ambassador Saleem Adam dismissed allegations that his
country was trying to improve its international image by
bankrolling the ransom. ''This is a humanitarian mission, he said.
''It has no other motivation.''
</P>
<P>
   Strydom was released despite a rebel demand earlier Monday that
negotiators bring them two guerrillas arrested at a bank last week
carrying bags of cash before they release more hostages held on
remote Jolo island. Negotiators said they were unable to locate the
two arrested guerrillas, who were freed on bail Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The cash is believed to be part of the estimated $5.5 million in
ransom paid to the rebels for the previous release of nine
Malaysians and a German.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the foreign hostages were kidnapped April 23 from
Malaysia's Sipadan diving resort. The Abu Sayyaf also seized three
French television journalists last month who were covering the
hostage crisis, and a dozen Filipino Christian evangelists who
visited the rebels' camp to pray for the captives.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have insisted on freeing the hostages in batches to
avert any military attack.
</P>
<P>
   However, chief government negotiator Robert Aventajado said a
''global agreement'' has been reached for the release of all the
hostages within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Freedom was bittersweet for the hostages released Sunday, most
of whom wore simple rubber sandals and carried their meager
possessions in rice sacks when they met their ambassadors after
stepping off helicopters in the port city of Zamboanga, not far
from Jolo.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not happy because there are people left behind,'' said
French-Lebanese citizen Marie Moarbes. ''It's not finished yet for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   The others freed were Sonia Wendling of France, South African
Monique Strydom, German Werner Wallert, and Maryse Burgot, a French
journalist.
</P>
<P>
   ''My son is still there. You don't expect me to be happy,''
Wallert said.
</P>
<P>
   The mood was much more upbeat later on a Philippine air force
cargo plane that ferried the released hostages to the Philippine
city of Cebu, where they spent Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   They clinked cans of soda and wolfed down cheeseburgers and
pizza, their first meal since leaving the rebel camp some six hours
earlier. But mostly they talked on and on about their experiences
to diplomats and relatives on board the plane.
</P>
<P>
   The former hostages and their ambassadors ignored the plane's
uncomfortable seats and its occasional bumps and dips as they
celebrated. Moarbes clutched a teddy bear given to her by her
father as the two talked animatedly for the entire one-hour flight.
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf, the smaller of two Muslim rebel groups in the
southern Philippines, says it is fighting for an independent
Islamic state. The government insists the organization is a group
of bandits practicing kidnapping and piracy.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have been holding the hostages for months in a jungle
on Jolo, 580 miles south of Manila. Before the kidnapping they were
estimated to number about 500 in the province but have grown to
5,000 as many recruits have been attracted by the large ransom
payments, a military official said.
</P>
<P>
   Still in captivity are one French, one German and two Finns
kidnapped from the Malaysian resort, two French journalists, and
the 12 Filipino evangelists.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Libya has helped mediate between Muslim guerrillas
and the Philippine government and helped build schools and mosques
in the impoverished south.
</P>
<P>
   But Libya also has been accused of training rebels from the Moro
Islamic Liberation Front, another separatist group fighting for an
Islamic state in the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   In Tripoli, the government said it would have no comment until
all the hostages were freed, but people in the streets were
delighted at their country's role.
</P>
<P>
   ''The release is something wonderful and a victory for Libya and
the hostages, especially because one of them is of Arab origin,''
said 43-year-old taxi driver Khalifa el-Radhi. ''We welcome these
Libyan efforts that support human rights.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Focuses on Prescription Plan  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE GLOVER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore is opening a weeklong focus on health
care by telling older voters that his plan for prescription drug
coverage is a winner for them while Republican rival George W.
Bush's approach is antifamily.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was headed Monday for Tallahassee, Fla., and a roundtable
discussion with seniors in a key electoral state as part of the
Democratic presidential nominee's effort to reshape the campaign
debate.
</P>
<P>
   Polls have suggested that voters view Gore as the candidate more
likely to boost the nation's health care system, and his campaign
was moving on a number of fronts to put the issue front and center.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, a state with a large elderly population, Gore has
chosen to focus on helping pay for prescription drugs, a big worry
for many older voters.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an issue that's important to seniors, but it's also
important to families,'' said spokesman Chris Lehane. ''George W.
Bush's approach to health care is hostile to America's families
because it holds them hostage to the agenda of the prescription
drug companies and the HMOs.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bush was gathering teachers at the Texas governor's
mansion in Austin on Monday to discuss his education proposals, his
campaign's top legislative priority.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first event of a crucial week for the GOP nominee,
who is intent on at least pulling even in the polls by Labor Day,
the traditional beginning of campaign season. On Tuesday, he begins
a three-day campaign trip to Maine, New Hampshire and the
battleground states of Pennsylvania, Ohio and Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore was hitting the road, surrogates were making the case
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala held a
conference call Sunday with reporters to praise Gore's plan and
argue that Bush hasn't really offered much on prescription drugs.
The campaign's theme was that Bush spends all the surplus on a big
tax cut and leaves nothing for other key programs.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they do roll out a plan, where are they going to get the
money to pay for it?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   Of Gore's proposal, Shalala declared: ''It's affordable and
voluntary and we pay for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has voiced support for plans offered by congressional
Republicans that would offer a subsidy to insurance companies for
providing drug coverage for low-income seniors. Running mate Dick
Cheney said Sunday that more details on the GOP prescription
package would be forthcoming ''in the not-too-distant future.''
</P>
<P>
   By focusing on Gore's prescription plan, campaign strategists
say they are aiming at the 39 million seniors covered by Medicare,
a demographic group that votes in higher numbers than any others.
Senior policy aides said they want to focus on that piece of the
health care puzzle because Gore's plan is broader.
</P>
<P>
   Under Gore's proposal, Medicare would pick up all the costs of
prescription drugs for low-income seniors -- as much as a third of
that group. For the rest, Medicare would pay half the cost of
prescription drugs up to $5,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   No one would pay more than $4,000 a year for prescription drugs,
under Gore's proposal, estimated to cost $253 billion over 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP put forth Tennessee Sen. Bill Frist to argue that the
Republican plan offers more choices. ''Seniors won't have the wool
pulled over their eyes,'' Frist, the only physician in the Senate,
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Moving to blunt Gore's momentum on the issue, Bush has launched
television ads boosting his proposals, while the Republican
National Committee this wins begins running ads blasting Gore's
proposals.
</P>
<P>
   To counter that, Gore brought out former Food and Drug
Administration chief David Kessler to label Bush's commercials
''false and misleading'' and say they wouldn't meet FDA standards
for truth in advertising.

<HEADLINE> Lieberman Still Talking Religion  </HEADLINE>
By BRIGITTE GREENBERG
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- For all the billing his campaign aides give to
issues like health insurance, Medicare and prescription drug
coverage, Democratic vice presidential candidate Joseph Lieberman
keeps bringing up God.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman on Sunday raised new questions about the
constitutional separation of church and state under an Al
Gore-Lieberman administration, telling members of a black church in
Detroit that he hopes his candidacy as an Orthodox Jew will
reinstate ''a place for faith in America's public life.''
</P>
<P>
   ''As a people, we need to reaffirm our faith and renew the
dedication of our nation and ourselves to God and God's purposes,''
Lieberman, the first Jew to run for national office on a major
party ticket, told about 500 members of the Fellowship Chapel.
</P>
<P>
   The Connecticut senator, who supports a moment of silence in
public schools, though not necessarily a moment of prayer, also
gave a nod to non-believers. He said people of faith must
''reassure them that we share with them the core values of America,
that our faith is not inconsistent with their freedom and our
mission is not one of intolerance, but one of love.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's aides had said he would discuss health care Sunday,
but the issue barely came up. He focused almost exclusively on
morality and religion.
</P>
<P>
   While quietly calling Lieberman's religion a media-made
distraction, his aides nevertheless appear to be delighted with the
reception he has been getting from audiences of different faiths.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking from the pulpit Sunday, Lieberman sprinkled his speech
with biblical references from the Old Testament and received four
standing ovations.
</P>
<P>
   He was speaking Monday at an interfaith breakfast in Chicago and
at a rally later. His aides once again said he would discuss
Medicare and the Gore plan to make prescription drugs more
affordable.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Lieberman said the nation has lost its moral
foundation in part because the constitutional guarantee of freedom
of religion has been confused to mean ''freedom from religion.'' He
said he hopes his candidacy will change that.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope it will enable people, all people who are moved, to
talk about their faith and about their religion, and I hope that it
will reinforce a belief that I feel as strongly as anything else --
that there must be a place for faith in America's public life,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman said Americans should break down the ''flimsy lines''
separating those of different faiths ''to sing together His holy
name.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Lieberman has often spoken of his religion and in
his recent book, ''In Praise of Public Life,'' he wrote that he
sees religious faith as a way to rebuild ''what has come to feel
like a crumbling moral framework in the life of our nation.'' But
until Sunday, he had not made that message a part of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't mention the effects of President Clinton's affair with
Monica Lewinsky on the nation. Instead, he celebrated the strong
economy, more jobs and low crime rate as accomplishments of Clinton
and Vice President Gore over the last eight years. He likened them
to Moses.
</P>
<P>
   ''In some sense, you might say the Red Sea finally parted and
more Americans than ever before walked through behind President
Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore,'' Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   Before Lieberman took to the pulpit, the Rev. Wendell Anthony,
pastor of the Detroit church and president of the NAACP's largest
chapter, recalled for worshippers how Lieberman in the 1960s had
marched on Washington with Martin Luther King Jr. and went into
Mississippi to register black voters.
</P>
<P>
   He criticized Republican nominees George W. Bush and Dick Cheney
in the process.
</P>
<P>
   ''It does mean something,'' said Anthony, shouting in a lyrical
cadence, ''for I ain't read nothing about no Bushes in Mississippi.
... I ain't seen no Cheneys on no freedom buses.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Lieberman recalled how he had spoken at a civil rights
rally in Bridgeport, Conn., in the 1960s just before King and that
the civil rights leader had remarked, ''Very good, young man.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I had actually thought I heard the voice of Moses,'' Lieberman
said.

<HEADLINE> New Minnesota Zoo director plans to bring NYC wow appeal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   APPLE VALLEY, Minn. (AP) - The new director of the Minnesota Zoo
has a mission: to bring some New York dazzle to the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Ehmke comes to Minnesota on the heels of his success with a
$50 million Congo Gorilla Forest exhibit at the Bronx Zoo in New
York, one of the most highly acclaimed new zoo exhibits in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   The Minnesota Zoo was cutting-edge when it opened 22 years ago.
By today's standards, though, the place lacks sizzle.
</P>
<P>
   ''I couldn't agree more that we need exhibits with a bit more
wow appeal,'' Ehmke said. ''We need to be more interactive, to get
you closer to the animals, to make use of all of the technological
and design concepts available.''
</P>
<P>
   Ehmke, due to start work Monday, said the Minnesota Zoo has a
lot to build on but could use some work. The zoo's vast undeveloped
acreage, he said, makes it ''one of most beautiful palettes a zoo
designer could ever think of working with.''
</P>
<P>
   But the zoo as it exists today, he said, is outdated, difficult
to navigate and too modest about the work it does in protecting
habitat for wild animals worldwide, including its work on behalf of
tigers in Sumatra and rhinos in Java.
</P>
<P>
   Ehmke was responsible for the Bronx Zoo's year-old Congo
exhibit, hailed by Time magazine as ''magnificent'' and
''astonishing.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The theater that is Congo wows you right to your bone,'' said
the Bronx Zoo's director, Richard Lattis. ''I mean, below the skin
to the bones that support you. You feel the vibrations, and you
never forget them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ehmke, he added, led the effort and did it well enough that,
when Minnesota came knocking, Lattis offered to make him the Bronx
Zoo's assistant director.
</P>
<P>
   ''But he could not resist the challenge of going to Minnesota,''
Lattis said.
</P>
<P>
   At 42, Ehmke already has led two distinct lives, and zoo
officials consider both of them assets. First he was an
environmental lawyer, working for the Sierra Club.
</P>
<P>
   Then he trained as a landscape architect and became an expert in
how to construct zoo exhibits to make them more involving, even
theatrical, than merely plopping an animal down on a piece of land
and hoping for the best.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Congo exhibit is incredible,'' Minnesota Zoo Board
chairman Peter Myers said. ''It really gives you a sense of what
the best exhibit design can do. No. 1, you are really unaware of
any man-made structures. All materials seem very native to that
type of environment, as opposed to a big brick or concrete
building. You feel like you're in a whole different land, and
especially not in the middle of the Bronx. And it really gives a
vivid multisensory experience - steam, sound effects, waterfalls.
It's just very creative.
</P>
<P>
   ''What drives Lee is conservation, but he understands the
realities of marketing, finance and making something attractive and
appealing to people.''
</P>
<P>
   In Minnesota, Ehmke's biggest job will be to lead a team to
create a new master plan for the zoo, one that both updates what's
there and that considers what to do with the 100 acres or more that
could be developed in the decades to come.
</P>
<P>
   A hundred acres is a lot, considering what Ehmke did in New York
on just six.

<HEADLINE> Questions in Botched Israeli Raid  </HEADLINE>
By MARK LAVIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASSIRA ASHMALIA, West Bank (AP) -- The mission was to take a
dangerous Islamic militant out of circulation, and it was
accomplished -- although nothing went as planned.
</P>
<P>
   After a nighttime shootout in this hillside village, Mahmoud Abu
Hanoud escaped, wounded and bleeding, to a Palestinian checkpoint,
where he surrendered before dawn Sunday. If the Israeli operation
had gone as planned, Abu Hanoud would be dead or in Israeli hands.
</P>
<P>
   Either of those possibilities could have set off waves of
Palestinian demonstrations or violence, just before President
Clinton arrives in the area to try to push Israel and the
Palestinians over the last hurdle to peace.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Hanoud is at the top of Israel's most-wanted list. They say
he was responsible for suicide bomb attacks in downtown Jerusalem
in 1997 that killed 21 and wounded dozens, as well as more recent
attacks. They have been searching for him for years.
</P>
<P>
   They found him late Saturday. A special unit of the Israeli army
moved into the village. Abu Hanoud opened fire first, then ran,
escaping the Israeli cordon.
</P>
<P>
   By nighttime Sunday, he was in jail. Col. Jibril Rajoub, the
Palestinian security chief in the West Bank, was furious with
Israel for not coordinating with him, and said such operations were
better left to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Israelis made a mistake and paid the price,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Three Israeli soldiers were killed in the exchange and another
wounded. Calling it a ''serious operational blunder,'' a grim
Israeli army chief of staff Lt. Gen. Shaul Mofaz admitted that all
four might have been shot by fellow soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed Tibi, an Israel Arab legislator close to the Palestinian
leadership, said it was almost a blessing that the operation was
botched -- a dead Abu Hanoud might have prompted the kind of bloody
revenge attacks that have halted the peace process in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Israeli public should be thankful,'' Tibi told Israel
television. ''If he was killed there would have been a string of
attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Israeli forces shot and killed two Hamas militants in
the Hebron area, and in 1996, a top Hamas bombmaker died when a
booby-trapped mobile phone exploded in his hand. Both operations
set off rioting in the West Bank and Gaza, as Palestinians adopted
the militants as fallen heroes in the cause of freedom. The 1996
killing prompted a series of suicide bomb attacks on buses that
brought the peace process to a standstill.
</P>
<P>
   Villagers accepted the capture of Abu Hanoud by Palestinian
forces calmly, though the effect is likely to be critical -- the
last notable Hamas commander is out of circulation, dealing a blow
to an organization that opposes peace with Israel but has been
unable to mount a serious terror attack against Israel for more
than a year.
</P>
<P>
   The three soldiers were the first to die in the West Bank since
January 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials admit that a large-scale terror attack might
well end peace efforts, as Israel and the Palestinians tackle the
last and toughest issues before agreement. Clinton is due in Cairo
Tuesday to discuss Egyptian ideas about the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thank God he defeats the Jews,'' wailed Abu Hanoud's mother,
Fatma, 55, encircled by cheering villagers after she visited her
son in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are very proud of Mahmoud Abu Hanoud because he acts
against the Zionists, the occupiers, to get our rights,'' said
Bashar Yassin, 34, an economist with the Palestinian Authority,
standing next to a pile of rubble, all that remained from the house
near the olive grove where the armed clash took place.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli forces bulldozed the house, though villagers said Abu
Hanoud was never inside. Shrugging his shoulders, Hashem Sholi, 46,
a member of the village council, said, ''That is the way of the
occupation. They must get out,'' he added, ''and they must
apologize.''

<HEADLINE> Record-Tying Dry Spell Hits Texas  </HEADLINE>
By KELLIE B. GORMLY
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- This summer's dry spell in North Texas became one
for the record books Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   It's been 50 years since the state last went 58 consecutive days
without measurable rainfall. With no noteworthy rain on Sunday, the
region tied that record, and forecasts showed it likely would break
it on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The current dry spell began July 1, and more heat and sunshine
are forecast for the region, said Joe Harris, a meteorologist with
the National Weather Service.
</P>
<P>
   Statewide, agriculture and livestock producers estimate they've
already lost $595 million this year due to the parched conditions,
Texas Agriculture Commissioner Susan Combs said.
</P>
<P>
   The drought has taken a toll on private lawns and gardens as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Cora Lee Brannon said her prized impatiens and begonias and even
one of her oak trees have shriveled up and died this month on her
property in the Fort Worth suburb of Southlake.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mother nature is not kind in Texas,'' she said. ''Like
everybody, it's been a struggle to keep the spring things alive. It
just doesn't make any sense to try to keep them alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite two months without rain, the region is only about a half
inch below normal for the year thanks to heavy rains in June,
Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   North Texas has received 21.19 inches of rain since Jan. 1; the
average rainfall for that time period is 22.31 inches.
</P>
<P>
   The day count for the current drought will continue until rain
is measured at the agency's rain gauge at the Dallas-Fort Worth
International Airport, Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   But the state's recovery from the drought could take a year or
more as the reservoirs refill and soil slowly recharges with
moisture.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's kind of like sliding down a hill,'' Harris said.
''Eventually, you get to the end of it.''

<HEADLINE> Dutch Airliner Loses Parts in Air  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A Royal Dutch airliner carrying 449 people
dumped fuel over the ocean Sunday to make an emergency landing
after losing parts of the plane during the flight, authorities
said. No injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
   KLM Royal Dutch Airlines Flight 602 left Los Angeles
International Airport at 4:20 p.m. for Amsterdam, Netherlands, said
Jerry Johnston, regional operations officer with the Federal
Aviation Administration.
</P>
<P>
   ''The pilot did have to come back around because of engine
problems'' and dump fuel over the ocean to reduce the plane's
landing weight, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A safe landing was reported at about 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Three aircraft parts were found at nearby Dockweiler State
Beach, police Officer Don Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Parker, an investigator for the National Transportation
Safety Board, said one of the pieces, about the size of a
dishwasher, was an exhaust nozzle from one of the four engines.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the NTSB were investigating.
</P>
<P>
   Although passengers applauded once the plane landed, they were
still shaken by the experience.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was really scary,'' Kianoosh Kamali, who was being pushed
in a wheelchair and still visibly distraught, told a television
reporter.

<HEADLINE> Russia Sub Joins Other Arctic Debris  </HEADLINE>
By TOM COHEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Twisted and broken, hundreds of feet down in the
Barents Sea, the Russian submarine Kursk joins other nuclear debris
sunken or discarded in Arctic waters.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists who study radioactivity in the Arctic say a variety
of sources have been responsible for contamination throughout the
region in the past 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Except for isolated sites -- such as the former Soviet underwater
nuclear testing ground used in the late 1950s -- scientists say
contamination levels are low, posing little threat to people.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't see pervasive contamination at levels that would be
of significant radiological concern,'' said John Norton Smith, a
Canadian government research scientist at the Bedford Institute of
Oceanography in Nova Scotia.
</P>
<P>
   A 1998 report by the Arctic Monitoring Assessment Program lists
several sources of radioactive contamination in the Arctic,
including the accidental sinking of a Soviet submarine and a U.S.
B-52 bomber that crashed in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Three decades of Soviet dumping of nuclear waste, including more
than 15 reactors from decommissioned ships, and waste from nuclear
power and weapons plants in Russia and Europe add to radioactive
material in Arctic seas, according to Smith and the AMAP report.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this, whatever radioactive material that has escaped has
shown little sign of spreading far before its potency dissipates.
</P>
<P>
   The Kursk, which suffered two explosions and sank on Aug. 12,
killing 118 sailors aboard, has two nuclear reactors that Russian
officials say shut down when it became disabled. Russia is
negotiating with Norwegian and Dutch companies to raise the
submarine. Russian officials say there is no sign of unusual
radiation levels around the vessel.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who studies radioactivity in Arctic waters, said the
Kursk reactors would be safe in the short term if they remained
intact.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only problem would be if any of the containment structures
ruptured,'' he said. The threat of leakage increases with time,
though, because the reactors on the Kursk never were intended to
sit forever on the bottom of the ocean, Smith added.
</P>
<P>
   The AMAP report said the only other known case of a sunken
active nuclear submarine -- the April 7, 1989, fire aboard the
Komsomolets near Bear Island in the Norwegian Sea -- caused little
known contamination beyond the vessel. The submarine had a nuclear
reactor and two torpedoes with mixed uranium-plutonium warheads,
the report said, and small amounts of radioactive material leaked
out of the reactor where the vessel lies, more than a mile deep.
</P>
<P>
   ''The likelihood of a large-scale release from the Komsomolets
is small,'' the report said. ''Even if the containment material
corrodes with time, most of the activation products will have
decayed before they are released. Studies in the surrounding area
show only minor contamination from the submarine.''
</P>
<P>
   AMAP, which is run by the eight-nation Arctic Council comprising
Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden and the
United States, tracks the condition of the Arctic environment.
</P>
<P>
   Its 1998 report said the existing contamination appeared to pose
little health risk to people -- either through direct exposure or in
the food chain through fish and other marine life.

<HEADLINE> McEnroe Warms Up To Women's Tennis  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Has John McEnroe mellowed enough to become a fan
of women's tennis?
</P>
<P>
   With all the excitement surrounding Grand Slam-winning sisters
Venus and Serena Williams, ''the men may eventually have to sue for
equal pay,'' McEnroe told The New Yorker magazine for a story
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the former champ -- who has sometimes denigrated the
quality of the women's game -- said ''any good male college player
could beat the Williams sisters and so could any man on the senior
tour.''
</P>
<P>
   Venus Williams won this year's Wimbledon title. Her younger
sister, Serena, won last year's U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   Tennis commentator Mary Carillo, a McEnroe friend, says he's
recently become far more respectful of women's tennis. Once, she
recalled, he told her ''he had no interest in calling women's
tennis because he's not a woman.''
</P>
<P>
   McEnroe, who plays on the senior tour, says he still responds to
hecklers and slams his racket around during games, partly because
he believes fans enjoy his on-court antics.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel an obligation,'' he said. ''They want to see
personalities, which is OK so long as you don't go over the line,
as I used to do regularly, of course.''

<P>
   SHREVEPORT, La. (AP) -- The new Miss Teen USA drew thunderous
applause after she was asked to describe men with three words.
</P>
<P>
   Jillian Parry, of Newtown, Pa., said Saturday that men are
always ''causing trouble, being confusing while still being
irresistible.'' A little wordy, but the audience of 3,500 loved it.
</P>
<P>
   Parry also got an animated response for saying she would prefer
to eat rats rather than eels during part of the contest that rated
answers to questions based on CBS' ''Survivor.'' Parry said she
believes rats would taste more like chicken than eels.
</P>
<P>
   Parry, 18, won more than $150,000 in cash, jewelry, clothes and
cosmetics, along with a new Pontiac Firebird convertible. After her
one-year stint as Miss Teen USA, she wants to study law.
</P>
<P>
   Teens from all 50 states and the District of Columbia competed
in the contest.

<HEADLINE> Tar Pit Remains Help L.A. History  </HEADLINE>
By MATTHEW FORDAHL
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Norbert Labuguen squeezes a turkey baster to
suck up globs of asphalt while Gary Takeuchi uses dental picks and
brushes to remove flaky sand from an ancient bison bone that last
saw light 28,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It's grueling, uncomfortable work made more difficult by
90-degree temperatures and the clumpy, smelly oil that sticks to
clothes, skin and everything else that makes its way into one of
the city's fabled La Brea Tar Pits.
</P>
<P>
   Though researchers have been pulling ancient bones out of La
Brea sites for nearly a century, the latest excavation, which has
been slowly proceeding every summer since 1969, is the most precise
and complete excavation ever.
</P>
<P>
   ''Back when they originally found fossils here, they were just
digging bones out of the ground,'' said Takeuchi, a senior
excavator. ''They weren't carefully analyzing the bones. We're able
to reconstruct them and find out how bones are related.''
</P>
<P>
   The approximately 1,000 bones pulled each year from Pit 91 -- as
tourists watch from a platform above -- are helping paleontologists
rewrite the early history of the area that would become Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Though new species are rarely discovered among the bones of
wolves, camels, bison and land sloths, each new fragment helps fill
in the picture of Southern California life at the end of the last
Ice Age, said project manager Christopher Shaw, of the George C.
Page Museum of La Brea Discoveries.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're capturing information that wasn't captured before,
mostly from fossils that are tiny, things that were ignored or not
caught in the early days,'' he said. ''We can better interpret past
climates and habitats.''
</P>
<P>
   Old ideas have been cast out: The best picture of Southern
California at the end of the Pleistocene Epoch now resembles
today's Monterey Peninsula rather than the African Savannah
depicted in paintings based on older research.
</P>
<P>
   The cast of known species has grown to 650, with the biggest
jump seen among smaller creatures whose bones were missed or
ignored by early diggers using big shovels and chisels.
</P>
<P>
   Hapless animals did not sink into the tar like quicksand. In
most cases, they were trapped like flies on flypaper and died of
dehydration, starvation or shock. And forget about dinosaurs -- they
disappeared 65 million years before the first tar pit tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1907, millions of bones have been extracted from the
sticky ponds wedged between museums, office buildings and condo
towers not far from Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to some depictions, the ''pits'' are just shallow
puddles of water and seeping asphalt. The ''tar'' is actually
asphalt formed by decaying marine plankton that lived millions of
years ago. (Tar comes from ancient woody materials like coal or
peat.)
</P>
<P>
   The gooey substance -- the lowest grade of crude oil -- protects
the bones from the ravages of time better than the best plastic
surgeon.
</P>
<P>
   ''The asphalt itself is a preservative,'' Shaw said. ''It
saturates the bones and keeps water from petrifying or destroying
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The current dig is about 14 feet below the surface, with another
5 to 8 feet to go before the last deposits will be reached. This
year's work started in July and will continue into September.
</P>
<P>
   The 28-foot-by-28-foot excavation is divided into 3-foot-square
grids to help record the exact position of each fossil. Besides
brushes and dental picks, the researchers use small chisels and
trowels to extract their finds.
</P>
<P>
   Large fossils are placed in containers marked with the find's
exact location and sent to the nearby paleontology museum. Sediment
is screened for microfossils.
</P>
<P>
   In the lab, fossils are cleaned, repaired if necessary,
identified and labeled. Other researchers visit the lab to help
identify species.
</P>
<P>
   ''The real value of our collection is that we have so much and
the preservation is so good,'' said Shelley Cox, the laboratory's
supervisor. ''We're the reference and the source of comparison for
fossils in this time period for anywhere in the world.''

<HEADLINE> Abandoned Mines Home To Bats  </HEADLINE>
By ALISA BLACKWOOD
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Only pitch-black shafts with drops of up to 600
feet are left where roughly 100,000 copper, gold and silver mines
once operated throughout Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   To humans, these abandoned mines represent an injury waiting to
happen because of their collapsing tunnel walls and leftover toxic
gases. But to the 28 bat species living in Arizona, they're home.
</P>
<P>
   The Bureau of Land Management and the Arizona Department of Game
and Fish are working to eliminate the threat by building bat gates
that will still allow bats in while keeping humans out.
</P>
<P>
   ''For bats, (the mines) are a way to escape the heat,'' said
Elroy Masters, a wildlife biologist for BLM in Lake Havasu City.
''And the mines protect them over the winter if we get freezing
days so they can hibernate.''
</P>
<P>
   The gates are made of steel and iron and have small spaces that
are just large enough to let bats through.
</P>
<P>
   Masters is currently working to construct fencing and bat gates
at Lake Havasu's Cienega Mining District, where there are about 90
open shafts.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're trying to protect bats to keep them from becoming listed
on the Endangered Species Act,'' Masters said.
</P>
<P>
   Bats have a low reproductive rate of about one baby per year,
said Tim Snow, a non-game specialist for Arizona Game and Fish.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their relatively well-hidden existence, biologists say
bats serve several important functions, such as pollinating saguaro
and agave plants and controlling insects.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're prolific insect catchers,'' said Yar Petryszun, a bat
researcher with the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology
at the University of Arizona. One bat can consume about 200 insects
an hour -- up to half its weight in one night, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Petryszun works with the U.S. Forest Service monitoring bat
populations and studying how they adapt to using bat gates at an
abandoned copper mine at the Coronado National Memorial on the
Arizona-Mexico border.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're real interested in being able to keep people out of
these abandoned mines for safety reasons and to keep disturbance of
the bats down,'' said Petryszun.
</P>
<P>
   In western Maricopa County, about 40,000 bats live in the
Tonopah Bellmont Mine -- one of the most dangerous mines for humans,
said Alene Jones, supervisor of the abandoned mines program at the
State Mine Inspector's office. The bats often fly 30 to 40 miles
south to Tonopah and eat insects off crops there, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mine Inspector's office is working with several bat experts
at the Tonopah Bellmont Mine and plans to put up bat gates at two
of the openings, Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Mine openings that are deemed not to be significant bat or
wildlife habitat get filled. But with some 100,000 abandoned mines
in Arizona and limited funding, surveying the mines is a huge
project. Only a few of these mines, most of which were built in the
1930s or 1940s, get filled or gated each year.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Survey: Violent Crime Rate Plunges  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Continuing a trend that began in 1994, the
nation's violent-crime rate dropped by a record 10.4 percent last
year, the Justice Department reports.
</P>
<P>
   It was the biggest decline in the 26-year history of the
department's broadest measure of crime -- that reported by victims
in surveys, but not necessarily to police.
</P>
<P>
   The property crime rate fell 8.9 percent from 1998 to 1999, said
the Bureau of Justice Statistics' victimization study, released
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   It estimated there were 28.8 million violent and property crimes
in 1999, the lowest figure since the survey was begun in 1973, when
it found an estimated 44 million crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The violent-crime rate decline began in 1994. The decline in the
overall property crime rate extends back to 1974.
</P>
<P>
   As with earlier, similar reports, President Clinton called the
figures ''further proof that the Clinton-Gore administration's
anti-crime strategy of more police on our streets and fewer guns in
the wrong hands has helped to create the safest America in a
generation.''
</P>
<P>
   At Republican presidential nominee George W. Bush's
headquarters, spokesman Ray Sullivan said: ''It's typical for the
Clinton-Gore administration to take credit for good things in
America but ... much of the credit for the decline in crime has to
go to governors and local officials who have passed tougher laws,
longer prison sentences and lowered parole rates.''
</P>
<P>
   Academics have cited a wider set of causes, including the aging
of baby boomers past the crime-prone years, a subsiding of the
crack cocaine epidemic of the late 1980s, antigun campaigns by
local police and federal gun controls, crime prevention programs
aimed at young people, and a healthy economy.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 survey figures confirmed preliminary FBI figures for
last year released in May. The FBI data showed the total of seven
major violent and property crimes reported to police dropped for an
eighth consecutive year in 1999, down 7 percent from the year
before.
</P>
<P>
   The statistics bureau's survey is the government's broadest
measure of crime because it is based on regular interviews
throughout the nation with more than 77,000 people over age 11.
Thus it collects data not only on crimes reported to police but
also on the larger number that go unreported.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI data is based on reports made to 17,000 police agencies
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 44 percent of violent crimes and 34 percent of
property crimes were reported to police, the statistics bureau
found. The most frequently reported offense in the survey was motor
vehicle theft; the least reported was personal theft.
</P>
<P>
   Murder, by far the least frequent but best reported of major
crimes, shows up only in the FBI reports because the statistics
bureau counts only crimes reported firsthand by victims it
interviews.
</P>
<P>
   The survey estimated that last year there were 32.8 violent
crimes for every 1,000 Americans over age 11, down from 36.6 in
1998. The largest previous one-year drop was from 10.04 percent
from 1994 to 1995, when victimizations declined from 51.8 to 46.6
per 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Property crimes were estimated to have declined from 217.4 per
1,000 people in 1998 to 198.0 in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The survey found that overall, 54 percent of violent crime
victims knew their assailant in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 7 out of 10 rape or sexual assault victims could identify
the offender as an acquaintance, friend, relative or intimate.
However, just under half the victims of aggravated assault and only
one-third of the robbery victims knew their assailant.

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A former bassist for the Allman Brothers Band
was found dead in a New York City motel, police said.
</P>
<P>
   A chambermaid found Douglas Allen Woody's body Saturday morning.
There were no visible signs of trauma and the cause of death is
still unknown, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Woody joined the Allmans as a bassist in 1989, in one of the
'70s supergroup's later incarnations. He left with slide guitarist
Warren Haynes in 1997 and the two formed a trio called Gov't Mule,
with drummer Matt Abts. The band released several albums.
</P>
<P>
   Woody, who was 44 and lived in Nashville, Tenn., is survived by
his wife and their 3-year-old daughter.

<HEADLINE> Maximilian Schell Flown to Hospital  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIGA, Latvia (AP) -- Oscar-winning actor Maximilian Schell was
flown to a hospital in Germany after falling ill with acute
inflammation of the pancreas during a visit to Riga, doctors said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were ready to operate but he decided to go to Germany to
consult with his personal physician,'' said Dr. Diana Rozkauns,
head of the intensive care unit at Gailezers Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Schell, 69, left on a special medical plane at midnight Sunday
en route to Munich University Hospital, she added.
</P>
<P>
   Riga doctors had considered Schell's condition so urgent that
they talked with him about an immediate operation. His diabetes,
they said, had destroyed nearly half of his pancreas, a gland
behind the stomach that produces insulin.
</P>
<P>
   But while serious, the condition was not life-threatening,
Rozkauns said. She said she was not certain whether he would
undergo an operation in Munich.
</P>
<P>
   The Austrian-born Schell was in Riga for the annual Baltijas
Perle film festival, where he was to be honored with the best actor
of the millennium award. He abruptly left the opening ceremony
Friday, complaining of stomach pain.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is one of the greatest actors around. His versatility and
his films are outstanding,'' said Natalija Gudima, spokeswoman for
the festival. ''We are all still a little in shock because of what
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Schell, who won an Oscar for his portrayal of a defense attorney
in the 1961 drama ''Judgment at Nuremberg,'' told local media he
intends to return to Riga to pick up his award when his health
improves.

<HEADLINE> ABC Does Series on Johns Hopkins  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Amid the tension of the emergency room, Dr.
Edward Cornwell lectures a belligerent gang member who's been shot
in the back -- even as he tries to save the young man's life.
</P>
<P>
   Later, he takes a group of boys from a tough Baltimore
neighborhood to meet another shooting victim stuck in a hospital
bed, showing how the culture of guns and violence isn't glamorous
like in the movies.
</P>
<P>
   Cornwell moves with the self-assurance of an actor, even if he
lacks George Clooney's brilliant smile or Anthony Edwards' dramatic
timing.
</P>
<P>
   He's not acting, though. There's nothing fake about the
blood-soaked sheets. Or the bullet wounds. Or Cornwell himself, the
chief of trauma surgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. In
the summer of reality television, he's as real as it gets, and one
of the stars of a remarkable six-part documentary series on ABC
that debuts Wednesday at 10 p.m. EDT.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hopkins 24/7'' depicts the inner workings of the Baltimore
hospital in a narrative style with all the drama of ''ER.''
</P>
<P>
   The camera follows a 14-year-old girl as she learns she has
uterine cancer; a deaf child who wakes up from surgery and hears
for the first time; a first-year intern struggling through a
100-hour workweek; and doctors meeting to discuss why patients died
during surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Phyllis McGrady, senior vice president of ABC News, first
conceived the idea in 1993 and finally conquered the logistical
mountains to get it done.
</P>
<P>
   A family health emergency had forced her to spend a lot of time
in a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ''I realized there was an entirely different world than any
world that I had ever heard of,'' she said. It consumed the people
who worked or were treated there, almost to the point they were cut
off from the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   To be able to tell the story, ABC needed a hospital willing to
give the network unfettered -- and probably unprecedented -- access.
</P>
<P>
   ABC approached administrators at Hopkins and, after months of
internal discussion, the hospital decided to take the leap of
faith.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were very separate entities,'' McGrady said. ''We were not
partners in this project. I said to them, 'We need to see what
happens in the hospital, warts and all.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Peterson, president of Johns Hopkins Hospital and Health
Systems, said he considered it a valuable way to illustrate some of
the issues his institution faces: health care in an urban setting,
the rigors of training doctors and treating people while being
squeezed by insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're cognizant that there are some potential risks along the
way,'' he said. ''But we really think that we're doing a service,
not only to our institution, but to the academic medical industry
at large and to the people being served by the institution.''
</P>
<P>
   Peterson seemed visibly relieved -- as if he had waited weeks to
exhale -- after viewing portions of the premiere episode for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital's most difficult decision was allowing ABC to film
its weekly ''morbidity and mortality'' conference. That's where
doctors meet to discuss what went wrong during surgeries where
patients had died, to see if there was something that could have
been done differently.
</P>
<P>
   It's a stunning look at surgeons the way they're rarely seen on
television, nervously trying to defend their work against pointed
comments by colleagues. Peterson said the hospital was confident
that nothing discussed would leave Hopkins vulnerable to liability
lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   ABC obtained written permission from each of the patients
filmed, and hospital personnel who didn't want to take part could
opt out. Still, producers said they were impressed that relatively
few people refused.
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins had intended not to let filming take place on its
psychiatric ward, but the doctor in charge there didn't want to be
left out for fear it would further stigmatize the mentally ill. ABC
filmed conversations between therapists and patients with eating
disorders, choosing patients with that ailment in the belief that
they were better equipped than others to give consent.
</P>
<P>
   It was a huge undertaking for ABC News, which filmed for three
months round-the-clock. At some points, the network had eight
two-person crews working there at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't go in with a preconceived thesis of what it was we
were going to show a viewer,'' said producer Peter Bull. ''It was a
response to the people we met. It was very different from the way
we usually work.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC may find ''Hopkins 24/7'' timed perfectly to catch the wave
of interest in reality TV programming, although McGrady said that
would be coincidental. The timing -- late summer, with part of the
series airing opposite NBC's Olympic coverage -- also means there's
a danger of getting overlooked, much like Fox's admirable but
low-rated look at a real-life high school, ''American High.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Will it get lost?'' McGrady asked. ''It's hard to say. We
don't have a tribal council. We don't vote a doctor off every week.
This is truly as real as we could tell the story.''

<HEADLINE> Hopes Dim for 16 Missing in Aegean  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BODRUM, Turkey (AP) -- A survivor of a capsized boat swam ashore
as hopes dimmed for 16 other missing illegal immigrants two days
after the disaster in the Aegean Sea, a navy official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqi immigrant, Muhammed Said, reached the Turkish coast
Sunday night, becoming the second survivor to swim ashore following
Saturday's accident off the Greek island of Kos, said Navy Sgt.
Avni Cindik.
</P>
<P>
   Searchers rescued six other people and recovered eight bodies
from the Aegean within hours of the boat's sinking. The 24-foot
boat left from the Aegean resort town of Bodrum, across from Kos.
</P>
<P>
   Villagers found Said at Datca peninsula, 20 miles south of
Bodrum.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey's coast guard was searching for the other missing
immigrants Monday. Cindik said search efforts will be called off
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Besir Emiri, an immigrant rescued by fishermen, recounted his
ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were being rocked in waves. I immediately put on a
lifejacket and then we are suddenly buried in waters,'' Emiri told
Sabah newspaper. ''Everyone was screaming. When I saw others
begging for help in the sea, I thought that I am going to die.''
</P>
<P>
   Another survivor, Abdul Yazdan, said the immigrants were praying
to reach Greece just before the boat sank.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, police arrested three Turkish smugglers who allegedly
organized the trip. Police said they were searching for two other
suspects.
</P>
<P>
   The captain, who was among the rescued Saturday, told
authorities he was bringing 31 illegal immigrants -- 18 Iraqis,
eight Iranians and five Afghanis -- to Greece when the boat sank. He
said smugglers had offered him $1,000 for each person smuggled into
Greece.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of immigrants from the Middle East and Asia
cross illegally from Turkey to Greece each year on their way to
Europe.

<HEADLINE> Dow Gains 34 As Nasdaq Rises 5  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened higher Monday, a possible
indication that investors are more confident about the future
direction of stock prices after several days of indecision.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was up 34.59 at 11,227.22.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Nasdaq composite
index was up 5.34 at 4,048.02, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was
up 3.41 at 1,509.87, and the Russell 2000 index of smaller
companies was up 1.38 at 526.49.
</P>
<P>
   Markets fluctuated last week, while mostly moving higher, as
investors digested the new landscape now that interest rate hikes
seem out of the picture.
</P>
<P>
   But the move upward has lacked conviction. In part, because
energy prices remain high and labor markets tight -- both factors
that could contribute to a rise in inflation. In addition, several
sectors have warned that profits may be down in the second half of
2000.
</P>
<P>
   These dynamics could pose obstacles as the markets try to
reclaim their highs of early spring.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a slender margin on
the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 1.60 percent. In
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was up 0.28 percent,
Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 0.10 percent, and France's CAC-40 was
down 0.08 percent.

<HEADLINE> Israel, Palestinian Cops Arrest 9  </HEADLINE>
By MARK LAVIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASSIRA ASHMALIA, West Bank (AP) -- Israel and Palestinian police
have arrested nine Palestinians with possible ties to a top Islamic
militant who eluded Israeli troops in a botched weekend raid of his
hideout, officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The failed operation -- three soldiers were killed, possibly by
friendly fire -- prompted sharp criticism of army planning and the
secret Duvdevan (Hebrew for Cherry) undercover unit, one of
Israel's key weapons in the fight against militants.
</P>
<P>
   A series of blunders turned Saturday night's raid in the West
Bank village of Assira Ashmalia ''into something close to a
national disaster,'' military commentator Ron Ben-Ishai wrote in
the Yediot Ahronot daily Monday.
</P>
<P>
   However, a successful raid, leaving top fugitive Mahmoud Abu
Hanoud dead or in Israeli hands, might have set off a wave of
Palestinian demonstrations or violence, just before President
Clinton arrives in the Middle East to try to push Israel and the
Palestinians over the last hump before peace.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Abu Hanoud, who surrendered to Palestinian police, was
recovering from his bullet wounds at the Anglican Hospital in the
Palestinian-controlled West Bank town of Nablus. Several dozen
Palestinian policemen were deployed on rooftops Monday, and
officers searched all those entering the grounds.
</P>
<P>
   The surrender of Abu Hanoud, who topped Israel's most wanted
list for several years as a leader of the armed wing of the Islamic
militant group Hamas, has placed the Palestinian Authority in a
difficult situation.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, it is committed to preventing more terror
attacks that could derail peace negotiations at a critical stage.
</P>
<P>
   However, Abu Hanoud has turned into a folk hero because he
managed to evade Israeli troops, and severe punishment of the
detainee could generate fresh support for Hamas, Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat's staunchest political rival.
</P>
<P>
   ''He (Abu Hanoud) makes me feel victorious because he defeated a
special unit of a strong army like the Israeli army,'' said
28-year-old Nablus resident Firaz Hanani. ''This makes me think
there is another way to deal with the Israelis, not only through
negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooperation between the Israeli and Palestinian security
services was evident again Monday, despite earlier complaints by
Palestinian officials that Israel had not coordinated the raid in
the West Bank village of Assira Ashmalia with them.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian police arrested five Hamas activists in Nablus and
the nearby village of Talouza, according to Hamas sources, while
Israel detained four residents of Assira Ashmalia on suspicion they
have ties to Abu Hanoud.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Hanoud is to be tried by a special military tribunal,
apparently within the next few days. Late Sunday, Abu Hanoud was
transferred from the hospital to the Nablus prison, and a
Palestinian security official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said the trial was to have taken place Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   However, the prisoner, who lost a lot of blood during his
flight, was considered too weak to stand trial and was sent back to
the hospital, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The chief military prosecutor, Khaled Kidreh, said the
investigation has not yet been completed and that no trial date has
been set.
</P>
<P>
   Israel says Abu Hanoud was responsible for suicide bomb attacks
in downtown Jerusalem in 1997 that killed 21 and wounded dozens, as
well as more recent attacks. They have been searching for him for
years.
</P>
<P>
   However, it is unlikely Abu Hanoud will be tried in a
Palestinian court for his involvement in terror attacks. In similar
cases in the past, defendants have faced charges of damaging the
Palestinians' national interests.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Hanoud's surrender, coming three months after the capture of
Hamas bombmaker Mohammed Deif in the Gaza Strip, dealt a blow to
the group, which opposes peace with Israel but has been unable to
mount a serious anti-Israeli attack for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   The three soldiers were the first to die in the West Bank since
January 1999.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks advanced in early trading Monday, a
possible indication that investors are more confident about the
future direction of stock prices after several indecisive sessions.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was up 49.48 at 11,242.11.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was up 4.24 at 1,510.70, and the Nasdaq composite index
was up 7.07 at 4,049.75.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks fluctuated last week, while mostly moving higher, as
investors digested the new landscape now that interest rate hikes
seem to no longer be a factor in trading.
</P>
<P>
   But the move upward has lacked conviction, in part, because
energy prices remain high and labor markets tight -- both factors
that could contribute to a rise in inflation. In addition, several
sectors have warned that profits may be down in the second half of
2000.
</P>
<P>
   These dynamics could pose obstacles as the markets try to
reclaim their highs of early spring.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues narrowly outnumbered decliners on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 83.57 million shares, down
from Friday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index up 1.47 at 526.58.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 1.60 percent. In
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was up 0.28 percent,
Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 0.10 percent, and France's CAC-40 was
down 0.08 percent.

<HEADLINE> Ga. Reps Don't Fly State Flag  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY McMURRAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Often lost among the four flags standing
outside Rep. Cynthia McKinney's Washington office is the one that's
missing.
</P>
<P>
   In McKinney's doorway, you can find banners of the American
Stars and Stripes, the Olympic games, DeKalb County, Ga., and one
commemorating prisoners of war.
</P>
<P>
   But the official flag of Georgia -- the one that includes a large
Confederate X -- is nowhere to be found, even though state flags are
customary office decor for members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   McKinney and fellow Georgia Democrat John Lewis, a former civil
rights leader, choose not to display the flag because they find it
divisive. Yet it's a quiet protest -- one that was never really
announced.
</P>
<P>
   If asked, they'll share their opinions that the banner should be
redrawn, that the current version was adopted in 1956 as an act of
racist defiance against school desegregation rulings.
</P>
<P>
   ''It should be laid to rest,'' McKinney said.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes down to it, Lewis and McKinney know the matter
is out of their hands. They're reluctant to carry the cause much
further and are perfectly willing to leave it up to the Democratic
governor and Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ''As of now, I don't plan to get up there and fight,'' Lewis
said. ''I'll fight on an individual level for myself, and the day
may come when it may be needed for me to play a much more involved
role. But there's very little we can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some critics of the state flag contend that now is
the perfect time to take aim. After all, it's an election year, and
the Confederate banner over South Carolina's Capitol created quite
a stir when George W. Bush and John McCain went to that state in
pursuit of the Republican presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Yet only Georgia and Mississippi feature the Confederate emblem
on their official flags -- and it's much larger on Georgia's.
</P>
<P>
   The other 11 members of the state's Congressional delegation
display the flag, including Democratic Rep. Sanford Bishop, who
like McKinney and Lewis is black. Bishop declined to answer
questions.
</P>
<P>
   The flag was also one of the first pieces of decoration that
arrived at the Washington office of Democrat Zell Miller, appointed
last month to fill the Senate vacancy left by the death of
Republican Paul Coverdell.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, a former two-term governor, almost lost his re-election
bid after leading an unsuccessful crusade in 1993 to change the
flag. Now he faces another campaign in November against former Sen.
Mack Mattingly for the right to finish the four years left on
Coverdell's term.
</P>
<P>
   A poll by Georgia State University earlier this year indicates
the flag issue could be political poison. In that poll, 56 percent
wanted to keep it the way it was, and only 31 percent wanted to
change it.
</P>
<P>
   ''It might be the right thing to do. But if there's not a lot of
public support behind you, it's the sort of thing politicians would
like to avoid,'' Michael Binford, a Georgia State political
scientist, said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans figure Georgia's Democrats are trying to have
it both ways. They argue they're trying to use the flag as a tool
to attack GOP supporters yet avoid messing with it, fearing the
wrath of voters.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they're serious about it, they should come up with a
formula,'' said Rep. Jack Kingston, a Republican who says he would
like the Legislature to call meetings to discuss the matter. ''The
lack of leadership is astounding.''
</P>
<P>
   Kingston said he suspects Democrats might be forming a
''backroom plan'' to wait until after the November elections and
then call a statewide referendum for 2002, when Gov. Roy Barnes
leaves office and a successor is chosen.
</P>
<P>
   ''That would bring out the vote and help their side,'' Kingston
said.
</P>
<P>
   But if the South Carolina primary was any indication, the matter
could be hashed out before then -- especially if Georgia lives up to
its billing as a ''battleground state.''
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic nominee for president,
has already criticized Bush's position not to meddle in South
Carolina's affairs. Such a fight could be headed to Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   There have already been some previews.
</P>
<P>
   In March, students at Centennial High School in Fulton County
voted against flying the state flag at the building. And earlier
this month, the NCAA Executive Committee turned down calls by civil
rights group to move three upcoming Final Four basketball
tournaments out of Atlanta because of the flag.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the Georgia flag was at the center of a spat between
lawmakers in Georgia and New York. Gov. George Pataki approved its
removal from the New York Capitol, and two Georgia lawmakers
retaliated by taking down New York's flag from their Capitol
rotunda.
</P>
<P>
   One of the pranksters, Georgia Senate Minority Leader Eric
Johnson, said he expects the issue will emerge again soon -- and
once again, he'll oppose any change.
</P>
<P>
   ''Pickup trucks, deer hunting, barefoot girls and boiled peanuts
-- that's what the flag represents to the vast majority of
Georgians,'' Johnson said. ''Nobody looks at it as a symbol of
hate.''

<HEADLINE> Water Leaks Into Chernobyl Plant  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) -- A large amount of water has leaked into the
sarcophagus covering a reactor destroyed in the 1986 explosion at
Ukraine's Chernobyl nuclear power plant, but radiation levels in
the water flowing out of the structure are normal, officials said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Water has seeped into the giant sarcophagus since it was built,
but more than twice as much leaked inside last month following
heavy rains. As a result, water for the first time entered nine
rooms, officials monitoring the sarcophagus said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Radioactivity levels in the water coming out of the shelter were
still at permitted levels, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   The sarcophagus was hastily constructed to cover the reactor
that exploded and caught fire in 1986, spewing a giant radioactive
cloud over parts of Europe in the world's worst nuclear disaster.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of foreign funds, Ukraine is trying to make the
structure environmentally safe. It is believed to contain tons of
radioactive fuel and dust.
</P>
<P>
   Only one of Chernobyl's four reactors is still operational. Due
to international pressure, Ukraine has promised to shut down the
plant for good in December.

<HEADLINE> Compromise Sought in Burundi Talks  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS TOMLINSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) -- In a dramatic act of brinksmanship,
Burundi's president demanded last minute changes to a power-sharing
agreement for his war-torn country even as President Clinton and
eight African leaders gathered Monday to witness the signing of the
deal.
</P>
<P>
   While the African leaders waited on stage for two hours,
President Pierre Buyoya refused to emerge until chief mediator
Nelson Mandela agreed to amend the deal that the former South
African president has pushed him to sign.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators have been working down to the last minute on a
compromise deal to establish an ethnically balanced government
joining Hutus and Tutsis, even if it stops short of bringing peace
to the central African nation.
</P>
<P>
   The main sticking point was when a three-year transition process
to democracy would begin. Buyoya demanded that no transition to
multi-ethnic rule begin until a cease-fire is signed with Hutu
rebels who have boycotted the talks.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement now calls for the transition to begin immediately,
according to a member of the mediatiaton team, who spoke on
condition he not be named.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton arrived at the hall in Arusha, Tanzania, where the
signing was due to take place, it was not clear if the differences
had been resolved.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are hoping to sign an agreement on those issues where we
have agreed, and then begin a new process to solve the problems
that remain,'' a senior Burundian official said earlier on
condition he not be named.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiators are from seven political parties representing
the Hutu majority, 10 parties representing the Tutsi minority and
negotiators from the Tutsi-dominated government and army.
</P>
<P>
   Without a cease-fire, Buyoya will face stiff opposition back
home. He has repeatedly asked Mandela, the former South African
President, to delay an agreement until the Hutu rebels join the
talks.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela has refused, and invited Clinton and the African leaders
for the signing ceremony in a bid to force a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Many Tutsis in Burundi fear sharing power will put them at the
mercy of the Hutu majority and they will meet the same fate as
Tutsis in neighboring Rwanda. In 1994, more than 500,000 Rwandans,
mainly Tutsis, were the victims of a Hutu government-orchestrated
genocide.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200,000 people, mostly civilians, have died in
Burundi's civil war since Tutsi paratroopers assassinated the
country's first democratically elected president, a Hutu, in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The Arusha peace talks have been going on for two years, and
Mandela is reportedly growing impatient. Tutsi negotiators said he
threatened to quit Sunday night when they suggested a delay in
signing the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Although the two armed Hutu groups have boycotted the talks,
Mandela has met privately with them in South Africa. A Western
diplomat involved in the negotiations said Mandela wants to end the
unwieldy Arusha talks in order to begin a new process that would
concentrate solely on a cease-fire agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Extremist Tutsi groups in Burundi have threatened to stage a
coup against Buyoya if he signs any deal without a cease-fire in
place.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Buyoya signs an agreement without a cease-fire, the Buyoya
government will be very fragile,'' said the Burundian official.
''Some groups will sign without conviction just because Clinton is
here, but later, they will make implementing an agreement very
difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Gunfire and tracer bullets lit the sky over Burundi's capital
Sunday night as Hutu rebels attacked a Bujumbura suburb. No report
on casualties was immediately available.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Tutsi hard-liners called for a boycott of commercial
activities on Monday to protest the signing.
</P>
<P>
   Students at the University of Bujumbura, mostly Tutsis, warned
commuters that cars and buses would be stoned. The students have
been boycotting classes since last week to protest the government's
inability to curb rebel attacks and Buyoya's decision to enter an
agreement with Hutu leaders blamed for anti-Tutsi killings.
</P>
<P>
   The compromise agreement was expected to cover power sharing in
the National Assembly and the military, but the 19 parties had
reached little consensus on who would become the transitional
president. Buyoya reportedly has insisted on the job, but only
three groups support him.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was expected to arrive about six hours after the signing
at the Arusha International Conference Center. He planned to
address the delegates before flying to Cairo for talks with
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
   The exact populations of Hutus and Tutsi in Burundi is unclear,
because an ethnic census has not been carried out since the 1930s.
But there is little doubt that Hutus overwhelming dominate the
country's population of around 6 million. Most estimates, using old
data, put the split at approximately 85 percent Hutu, 14 percent
Tutsi and 1 percent Twa.

<HEADLINE> Gulf Air Plane To Be Reconstructed  </HEADLINE>
By ADNAN MALIK
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) -- Divers dragged a battered wheel and
fragments of landing gear and engines to barges in the Persian Gulf
Monday as investigators prepared to piece together the Gulf Air
carrier that crashed off the coast of Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators want to reconstruct the plane as well as possible
to help determine why the Airbus A320 nose-dived into the Gulf on
Wednesday, said Col. James Windsor, Bahrain's civil defense chief.
All 143 people aboard the Cairo-Manama flight were killed.
</P>
<P>
   ''The plan is to retrieve all the parts of the plane
immediately,'' Windsor said. ''Small numbers of parts which are
significant to the investigations will be retrieved first.''
</P>
<P>
   The task was complicated by the shallowness of the water at the
crash site, said Chief Petty Officer Michael Stackman, a U.S. Navy
diver overseeing the technical aspects of the salvage operation
being carried out by Bahraini divers. Larger boats and ships
equipped with cranes could not be used.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, divers were to place balloons under large pieces of the
plane when the bulk of the salvaging is done Tuesday. The balloons
were to be inflated, raising the pieces slightly off the seabed.
Barges would then tow the pieces to shore.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 Coast Guard divers carried up smaller pieces Monday;
some 30 more were to be brought in Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Bahraini authorities will carry out 99 percent of the
salvage effort, while the U.S. Navy will provide technical
assistance, Windsor said.
</P>
<P>
   The salvage operation will be the final step in evidence
gathering from the wreckage site of Gulf Air Flight 072.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some 200 churchgoers attended a memorial service
Monday at Bahrain's largest church, Sacred Heart, for the crash
victims.
</P>
<P>
   ''We pray for the families of the victims, that God give them
the courage to overcome the great loss of their loved ones,'' said
Father Filicio Denize.
</P>
<P>
   Remains of one Egyptian and a British citizen were flown home
Monday, the Gulf Air press center said.
</P>
<P>
   Bahrain, which has close ties with the United States and is home
base to the U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet, appointed investigator Frank
Hilldrup, of the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, as the
chief investigator.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have not yet received information from the black
boxes -- flight data and cockpit voice recorders -- which were
retrieved hours after the crash and could provide crucial
information in pinpointing why the airliner crashed.
</P>
<P>
   The recorders were sent to NTSB headquarters in Washington for
analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Ibrahim al-Hamer, chairman of the investigating committee, said
Sunday that the boxes appeared to be in good shape and that his
team had not ruled out any possible causes.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators hope to learn what happened between the time pilot
Ihsan Shakeeb aborted his landing at Bahrain International Airport
without explanation and 60 seconds later, when the plane hit the
sea.
</P>
<P>
   Gulf Air's chief pilot, Hameed Ali, has said the speed and
altitude of Shakeeb's aborted landing would be investigated. He
added that no error was spotted in Shakeeb's approach.

</P>
<P>
   Stocks fluctuated last week, while mostly moving higher, as
investors digested the new landscape now that interest rate hikes
seem to no longer be a factor in trading.
</P>
<P>
   ''Investors have been extremely lackadaisical in the past few
sessions,'' said Don Hays, president of Hays Advisory Group in
Nashville, Tenn. ''People seem comfortable that there won't be any
more interest rate hikes.''
</P>
<P>
   But the move upward has lacked conviction, in part, because
energy prices remain high and labor markets tight -- both factors
that could contribute to a rise in inflation. In addition, several

2000.
</P>
<P>
   These dynamics could pose obstacles as the markets try to

</P>
<P>
   Hays noted that trading volume on Friday was at its lowest level
of the year and remained low Monday. Moreover, he noted that stocks
were being propelled on Monday on the strength of a handful of
stocks in a small number of sectors, something known as a lack of
breadth in the market.
</P>
<P>
   The blue-chip index was led by widely held stocks such as IBM,
up $2.625 to $131.625, and J.P. Morgan, up $146.75.

   And Internet stocks, out of favor since the spring, have moved
back into the spotlight, helping to fuel the Nasdaq. Online
retailer Amazon.com rose 87.50 cents to $40.813.

<HEADLINE> Bob Dole Opens Institute in Bosnia  </HEADLINE>
By ALEXANDAR S. DRAGICEVIC
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) -- To speed up the
identification of Bosnia's massacre victims, former Sen. Bob Dole
on Monday opened an institute for missing persons.
</P>
<P>
   Over 27,000 persons have been registered as missing from
Bosnia's 1992-1995 war. Many of them are being exhumed in numerous
mass graves throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   But their identification remains a major problem because
conventional methods are slow and the bodies lay decomposed for
years before they were found.
</P>
<P>
   Alone in the northern city of Tuzla, which Dole visited Monday
in his capacity as head of the International Commission for Missing
Persons, about 4,000 bodies exhumed from mass graves around
Srebrenica are unidentified.
</P>
<P>
   Srebrenica is the site of the worst massacre of civilians in
Europe since World War II. Up to 8,000 mainly Muslim men are
believed to have been systematically killed and buried in mass
graves when Serbs overran the town in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The Missing Persons Institute with two DNA laboratories -- in
Sarajevo and Tuzla -- will collect blood samples from victims'
relatives and try to match them with DNA profiles obtained from
bones or teeth of the exhumed bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Using a traditional identification process, it would have taken
experts between 50 to 100 years to identify all the bodies exhumed
in Bosnia, Dole said at the opening ceremony is Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Clinton Criticized on Colombia Aid  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BRISCOE
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Three leading human rights groups criticized
the Clinton administration Monday for aiding the Colombian
military, saying the government of President Andres Pastrana has
failed to meet any of the human rights criteria set by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who is visiting Colombia on Wednesday after
he returns from Africa, waived several of the conditions and
released $1.3 billion in mostly anti-drug aid for Colombia earlier
this month. The conditions were aimed at overcoming military abuses
and bringing human rights violators to justice.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton asserted Colombia's compliance on one criteria and White
House officials said he set aside the others on national security
grounds, insisting that Pastrana is committed to protecting human
rights and needs a chance to let his anti-drug programs succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the Washington
Office on Latin America all disagreed with Clinton's decision,
saying Colombia has failed to meet any of the criteria for aid laid
down by Congress. Before Clinton's decision, the organizations met
with State Department officials in Washington and Bogota to air
their concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Under U.S. law, for Colombia to receive the aid approved by
Congress, Clinton was required to certify that Pastrana and his
government have taken action to bring military abusers to justice,
including suspension of suspected ''gross violators,'' use of
civilian courts to prosecute military officers, full military
cooperation in prosecutions, capture and detention of known
violators who remain free, and steps to end to paramilitary
activities.
</P>
<P>
   ''All three organizations concluded that there was overwhelming
evidence demonstrating that Colombia had not met these
conditions,'' the groups said in a point-by-point rebuttal of the
administration's decision released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The report includes names of dozens of accused military officers
and several specific incidents of alleged human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
   It says even the one criteria on which Clinton granted
certification -- a written directive ordering that armed forces
personnel who are ''credibly alleged to have committed gross
violations of human rights'' be brought to justice in civilian
courts -- was not fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
   ''As far as we have been able to determine, the military has
never transferred the case of an officer with the rank of colonel
or higher from a military tribunal to a civilian court,'' the
groups said.
</P>
<P>
   They said a directive on civilian jurisdiction cited by the
State Department was inadequate to meet the congressional
condition.
</P>
<P>
   ''That condition did not call for any directive, but one which
directly addressed one of the foundations of impunity in
Colombia,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials said two other criteria are
expected to be satisfied in the coming weeks. One would give legal
authority to military leaders to suspend personnel suspected of
abuses. The second would establish a judge advocate general corps.
</P>
<P>
   Aid to Colombia is intended primarily to help the Colombian
military take control of cocaine-producing regions held by leftist
guerrillas and some right-wing paramilitaries. Both forces protect
the drug trade that makes Colombia the world's leading cocaine
producer and a growing supplier of heroin.

<HEADLINE> Dow Gains 110; Nasdaq Adds 39  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks surged higher Monday, a possible
indication that investors are more confident about the future
direction of stock prices after several indecisive sessions.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was up 110.24 at 11,302.87.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was up 14.36 at 1,520.82, and the Nasdaq composite index
was up 39.05 at 4,081.73.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks fluctuated last week, while mostly moving higher, as
investors digested the new landscape now that interest rate hikes
seem to no longer be a factor in trading.
</P>
<P>
   ''Investors have been extremely lackadaisical in the past few
sessions,'' said Don Hays, president of Hays Advisory Group in
Nashville, Tenn. ''People seem comfortable that there won't be any
more interest rate hikes.''
</P>
<P>
   But the move upward has lacked conviction, in part, because
energy prices remain high and labor markets tight -- both factors
that could contribute to a rise in inflation. In addition, several
sectors have warned that profits may be down in the second half of
2000.
</P>
<P>
   These dynamics could pose obstacles as the markets try to
reclaim their highs of early spring.
</P>
<P>
   Hays noted that trading volume on Friday was at its lowest level
of the year and remained low Monday. Moreover, he noted that stocks
were being propelled on Monday on the strength of a handful of
stocks in a small number of sectors, something known as a lack of
breadth in the market.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow was led by widely held stocks such as IBM, up $3.625 to
$132.625, and J.P. Morgan, up $2 to $146.
</P>
<P>
   The same pattern held true on the Nasdaq, where well known
technology stocks led the way. Intel rose $2.562 to $75.50, Cisco
Systems gained $1.313 to $66.813, and Dell Computers was up $1.313
to $39.938.
</P>
<P>
   And Internet stocks, out of favor since the spring, have moved
back into the spotlight, helping to fuel the Nasdaq. Search engine
company Lycos rose $2.187 to $68.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo!, however, a star last week, was hit hard after analysts
warned that the Internet portal's revenues may fall as Internet
advertising slows later in the year. Yahoo!'s shares fell $9.312 to
$124.938.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 7-to-5 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 483.71 million
shares, up slightly from Friday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 1.80 at 526.91.

<HEADLINE> Muslim Leaders Meet Religious Leaders  </HEADLINE>
By MOHAMED MOUSTAID
<TEXT>
<P>
   AGADIR, Morocco (AP) -- Muslim and Christian religious leaders
joined a gathering of foreign ministers from Muslim nations for the
first time Monday, demanding sovereignty over Jerusalem, part of
marathon efforts by Yasser Arafat to rouse support for the
Palestinian cause.
</P>
<P>
   ''There can be no peace unless Palestinian Muslims and
Christians recover their holy city,'' said a leading Greek Orthodox
figure in Jerusalem, Attallah Hana, who led a Christian delegation
to the session of the Al-Quds (Jerusalem) Committee in this
Moroccan coastal town.
</P>
<P>
   A delegation of Muslim religious figures from Jerusalem also
joined the session, which gathered foreign ministers from 16 Muslim
nations.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat is under growing pressure to make concessions on
Jerusalem after the Camp David peace summit with Israel fell apart
last month over the fate of the city's eastern sector. Amid a
flurry of diplomatic activity since, President Clinton was to meet
Tuesday with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, whose officials have
been drawing up proposals over Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat refused to be squeezed, calling Jerusalem ''the key to
peace and war in the Middle East.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We refuse any sort of pressure that would lead to a
sovereignty other than the Palestinian, Arab, Islamic and Christian
sovereignty of the city,'' he told ministers at the opening
session, warning of the ''danger of the 'Judaization' and
occupation which hangs over al-Quds.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We have made sacrifices to build the peace of the brave,''
Arafat added. ''But that doesn't mean we will accept concessions on
any of our rights on our occupied territory and, above all, on
Jerusalem.''
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians were seeking a firm voice of support at the
meeting in Agadir, an Atlantic coastal resort town more than 200
miles from Rabat. The Jerusalem Committee, part of the Organization
of the Islamic Conference, is designed to protect the Arab and
Muslim character of Jerusalem. It has never before invited
religious figures to attend.
</P>
<P>
   In Paris, Israel's acting foreign minister told his French
counterpart, Hubert Vedrine, that Europe should ''tell Arafat tough
truths,'' the Israeli Foreign Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Arafat will have to make fateful decisions if he wishes to
achieve an agreement which will end the conflict,'' the Israeli
Foreign Ministry quoted Shlomo Ben-Ami as telling Vedrine.
</P>
<P>
   Israel offered Arafat limited Palestinian sovereignty over some
areas in east Jerusalem during the Camp David summit. But Arafat
refused, demanding full sovereignty, particularly over Muslim and
Christian holy sites in the Old City.
</P>
<P>
   Morocco's King Mohammed VI said Jerusalem was the ''cause of all
Muslims in the world.'' He said he was ''convinced that ... Clinton
is determined to use all his weight'' to help achieve peace.
</P>
<P>
   Morocco presides over the Jerusalem Committee, whose members are
Bangladesh, Egypt, Guinea, Iraq, Iran, Indonesia, Jordan, Lebanon,
Mauritania, Morocco, Niger, the Palestinian Authority, Pakistan,
Syria, Senegal and Saudi Arabia.

<HEADLINE> Colombia To Press Clinton on Trade  </HEADLINE>
By JAVIER BAENA
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARTAGENA, Colombia (AP) -- Colombia plans to press President
Clinton during a visit this week for trade benefits to complement a
$1.3 billion U.S. aid package to help fight drug trafficking, the
country's foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
   ''More than aid, which of course we need, we also need better
trade terms,'' Foreign Minister Guillermo Fernandez said in an
interview with The Associated Press, outlining his government's
plan to press for lower U.S. tariffs on imports of Colombian
clothing and textiles.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia argues that such trade benefits will indirectly help
curb drug production in the world's leading cocaine-exporting
nation by providing legal jobs for people currently involved in the
drug trade. A program allowing Colombia and its Andean neighbors to
export flowers duty-free to the United States has created tens of
thousands of jobs, while angering U.S. flower growers.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the talk during Clinton's visit Wednesday will be about
a planned Colombian military offensive into drug-producing regions
dominated by leftist rebels.
</P>
<P>
   A $1.3 billion U.S. aid package provides U.S. military training
for Colombian army troops who will try to gain control of the coca
fields and then eradicate crops and destroy drug laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is also expected to ask President Andres Pastrana to
take steps to reduce human rights abuses, including massacres
committed by right-wing paramilitary groups with alleged ties to
the military.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview Friday, Fernandez also stressed the importance
of U.S. aid for so-called ''alternative development'' projects to
help poor peasants switch from growing coca and opium poppies to
legal crops. Only about a tenth of the money in the U.S. aid plan
is destined for social programs.
</P>
<P>
   Neighboring countries, especially Ecuador and Peru, have
expressed concern that the planned military strike into southern
Colombia will send rebels and refugees fleeing across their
borders.
</P>
<P>
   However, Fernandez said the anti-narcotics push will be
accompanied by ''the largest social investments Colombia has ever
made in these areas to avoid that phenomenon.'' He said 70 percent
of the government's expenditures to fight drug trafficking and
restore economic growth will be spent on social investments.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign minister also downplayed any environmental damage to
the Amazon basin from herbicides used to eradicate illegal drug
crops.
</P>
<P>
   ''What is producing the real ecological damage is the alliance
between drug trafficking and the guerrillas,'' Fernandez said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Criticized on Colombia Aid  </HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Three leading human rights groups criticized
the Clinton administration Monday for aiding the Colombian
military, saying the government of President Andres Pastrana has
failed to meet any of the human rights criteria set by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who is visiting Colombia on Wednesday after
he returns from Africa, waived several of the conditions and
released $1.3 billion in mostly anti-drug aid for Colombia last
week. The conditions were aimed at overcoming military abuses and
bringing human rights violators to justice.

   Clinton asserted Colombia's compliance on one criterion and set
aside the others on national security grounds, insisting that
Pastrana is committed to protecting human rights and needs a chance
to let his anti-drug programs succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the Washington
Office on Latin America (WOLA) all assailed Clinton's decision.
Before Clinton's decision, the organizations met with State
Department officials in Washington and Bogota to air their
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't defeat your enemies when your allies commit human
rights abuses,'' said George Vickers of WOLA at a news conference
releasing the joint report. It details abuses and names Colombian
military officers and paramilitary officers it says should be
brought to justice for criminal acts.
</P>
<P>
   ''President Clinton must insist directly to President Pastrana
that everything be done to stop these abuses,'' said Andrew Miller
of Amnesty International.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Miguel Vivanco of Human Rights Watch said it was
unprecedented for the three groups to issue such a report.
</P>
<P>
   The only result of Clinton's action ''is reinforcing bad apples
in the military,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department's own report on human rights in Colombia
parallels the human rights' groups conclusions, saying government
forces and paramilitary groups continue to commit numerous serious
abuses, including extrajudicial killings.
</P>
<P>
   Under U.S. law, for Colombia to receive the aid approved by
Congress, Clinton was required to certify that Pastrana and his
government have taken action to bring military abusers to justice,
including suspension of suspected ''gross violators,'' use of
civilian courts to prosecute military officers, full military
cooperation in prosecutions, capture and detention of known
violators who remain free, and steps to end to paramilitary
activities.
</P>

   ''All three organizations concluded that there was overwhelming

<HEADLINE> Israel Parliament Opposes Peace Deal  </HEADLINE>
By MARK LAVIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- An absolute majority of Israel's parliament
told Prime Minister Ehud Barak Monday that he has no moral
authority to sign a peace deal with the Palestinians since he leads
a minority government.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has said he plans to complete a peace deal and let the
people approve it in a referendum or a quickly called election,
over the head of the parliament. Hard-line opponents admitted that
this tactic probably would succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Israel and the Palestinians are closer than ever to reaching a
peace agreement, though the remaining issues, including the status
of Jerusalem, are so emotion-ridden that they could scuttle it.
Breaking with past Israeli policy, Barak offered the Palestinians
some control over parts of Jerusalem, infuriating the hard-liners.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmaker Benny Elon of the hawkish National Union party on
Monday called the house into special session during its summer
recess to present a list of 62 of the 120 members of parliament who
favor a law banning a minority government from signing treaties.
</P>
<P>
   It was the latest blow to Barak's prestige. Last month, his
candidate for the largely symbolic presidency lost in a Knesset
vote to the opposition candidate, and the parliament passed a bill
calling for a debate on early elections.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the recess, Elon was prevented from proposing his
measure as a law. ''This is a demonstration,'' co-sponsor Reuven
Rivlin of the hardline Likud opposition party said.
</P>
<P>
   Hawkish parties pulled out of Barak's coalition government over
concessions to the Palestinians at last month's summit at the U.S.
presidential retreat, Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   Elon told the parliament that he fears Barak ''will pull a fast
one and sign an agreement with the Palestinians during the
recess,'' which lasts until the end of October.
</P>
<P>
   His bill would ban minority governments from signing pacts that
change Israel's borders or relinquish territory. ''They can sign
agreements about selling bananas,'' said Elon's spokesman, Pini
Ben-Or.
</P>
<P>
   Elon stated his real concern in the explanation attached to his
three-paragraph bill. If a government signed a peace treaty, he
wrote, ''it would be very difficult for a future government to
shake it off.'' Ben-Or said the people could be cajoled into
backing an agreement by the argument that turning it down would
''make Israel look bad in the eyes of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Barak's coalition now represents only a third of the
house, the opposition has been unable to bring his government down
in a vote of no confidence, which requires a majority of at least
61.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to Elon's proposal, Justice Minister Yossi Beilin
said Israel's election system is to blame. Israelis vote separately
for prime minister and parliament, setting up the present situation
in which a minority government can rule for months or years but
cannot pass legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ''The system is a curse,'' said Beilin.

<HEADLINE> Russian TV Tower Fire Is Put Out  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW KRAMER
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Firefighters extinguished a blaze that engulfed
Moscow's landmark television tower on Monday after battling smoke
and flames hundreds of feet above ground for 26 hours. At least two
people trapped in an elevator were killed.
</P>
<P>
   The fire left the 1,771-foot Ostankino tower a spectacular hulk,
much of its interior scorched and webs of wiring melted. Concerns
rose that the protracted fire's intense heat may have warped
structural elements that could cause parts of the tower to fall or
put them beyond repair.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters faced a backbreaking ordeal in fighting the blaze,
hauling heavy gear up dozens of flights of stairs. Interior
Minister Vladimir Rushailo said the fire was put out at about 5:40
p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of a high-ranking firefighter and an elevator
operator were found in an elevator shaft, said Viktor Beltsov, a
spokesman for the Moscow Emergency Situations Ministry. They had
been trapped in an elevator high up in the tower early on in the
fire, and Russian media reported that their elevator and five
others had plunged to the ground during the blaze. Media had
earlier reported at least one other person trapped in the same car,
but there was no confirmation of any more dead.
</P>
<P>
   The blaze knocked out most television service in the sprawling
Russian capital, leaving residents longing for news and
entertainment and dispirited over the latest in a string of
disasters that have underscored the country's deteriorating
infrastructure
</P>
<P>
   Grigory Sokolov, an unemployed recent college graduate watching
the firefighting Monday afternoon, said he was disturbed ''not
because the soap operas are off the air, but because of the news
programs.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There was no safety system -- as usual,'' said retired engineer
Vladimir Ilin, gazing up at the tower.
</P>
<P>
   Automatic firefighting systems within the tower appeared to have
failed or had run out of fire-suppressing foam, officials said. The
fire started in the tower's thin spire about 1,470 feet above
ground, and spread downward, burning the observation deck and
restaurant that made the tower a popular attraction for Muscovites
and tourists.
</P>
<P>
   A Moscow city surveyor on the scene, Vladimir Aleksin, said the
tower's upper spire had tilted slightly, and that the tip of the
structure was off-center by about six feet.
</P>
<P>
   Bundles of steel support cables running up the middle of the
tower had been damaged, fire department deputy director Vyacheslav
Mulishkin said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The cables are weakened, but have not broken,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A series of recent disasters, including gas explosions,
industrial accidents and breakdowns in the power grid, have
highlighted how poor funding and maintenance have weakened Russia's
infrastructure. The fire came on the heels of an Aug. 12 accident
that sunk the nuclear submarine Kursk, killing all 118 people on
board.
</P>
<P>
   ''This emergency highlights what condition vital facilities, as
well as the entire nation, are in,'' President Vladimir Putin said
at a government meeting. ''Only economic development will allow us
to avoid such calamities in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Television channels were still able to transmit nationally in
spite of the fire. Putin on Monday ordered that broadcasts of the
major channels in Moscow be resumed within a week, but it was
unclear whether that could be accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   More than 300 firefighters and other emergency workers were
called in to battle the conflagration, which was apparently sparked
Sunday by a short-circuit in wiring belonging to a paging company.
Visitors were quickly evacuated from the tower's restaurant and
observation deck.
</P>
<P>
   Rushailo, the interior minister, said authorities considered it
unlikely that the fire was set intentionally. But prosecutors
opened an investigation Monday into whether criminal negligence was
responsible for the fire, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, the Ostankino tower stood as a symbol of the Soviet
Union's powerful technological potential. It surpassed the Empire
State Building as the world's tallest freestanding structure when
it was built in 1967, and held the title until 1975 when it was
surpassed by the CN tower in Toronto.

<HEADLINE> Postal Clerks Are Getting a New Look  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Things will look a bit different at post
offices, where clerks are getting new uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   The blue-gray striped blouses and shirts become official wear on
Sept. 1, but some clerks are already sporting the new look.
</P>
<P>
   Workers will wear either navy blue or gray slacks or skirts, and
the uniforms include new neckwear too. For women the blue-gray
striped top will come with navy blue knotted loop neckwear with a
red USPS logo, or red-white-and-blue stripes.
</P>
<P>
   Men will have navy ties with a red USPS logo in a pin-dot style
or red-white-blue striped ties.
</P>
<P>
   Clerks receive an allowance to purchase their uniforms and can
buy extra garments if they wish.
</P>
<P>
   Postal officials said they were replacing the older white and
blue shirts to improve the professional image of the clerks.
</P>

   Additions to the new look are planned in the future, including:

<HEADLINE> TV veteran joins Spanish-language television station  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - J.J. Gonzalez, who spent nearly three decades at
WCBS-TV, has been named managing editor of ''Noticias 41,'' the
awarding-winning news program of Spanish-language Univision 41
television.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is a pioneer who paved the way for hundreds of Latino
journalists not only here in New York but in the entire nation,''
Univision 41 News Director Steve Malave said in a statement Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez officially starts at Univision on Sept. 4.
</P>
<P>
   While at WCBS-TV, from 1967 to 1995, Gonzalez held various
posts, including reporter, assignment editor, correspondent and
director of public service programming. During that time he won
five Emmy Awards, two Associated Press journalism awards, the NYPD
Finest Award for Crime Reporting, the Bobby Kennedy Award for Crime
Reporting and the UNESCO Humanitarian Award.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving WCBS, Gonzalez worked for two years as press
secretary to Bronx Borough President Fernando Ferrer. Since 1997,
he has worked with cable TV's Bronxnet Community Programming Corp.,
as a consultant and then as news director.
</P>
<P>
   He currently also is an adjunct professor in the multilingual
journalism department of Lehman College. He is the author of two
novels, ''A Gull Against the Wind'' and ''A Run of Dolphins.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Gains 94; Nasdaq Adds 38  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks surged higher Monday, a possible
indication that investors are more confident about the future
direction of stock prices after several indecisive sessions.
</P>
<P>
   In late afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was up 94.24 at 11,286.87.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was up 13.29 at 1,519.75, and the Nasdaq composite index
was up 38.02 at 4,080.70.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks fluctuated last week, while mostly moving higher, as
investors digested the new landscape now that interest rate hikes
seem to no longer be a factor in trading.
</P>
<P>
   ''Investors have been extremely lackadaisical in the past few
sessions,'' said Don Hays, president of Hays Advisory Group in
Nashville, Tenn. ''People seem comfortable that there won't be any
more interest rate hikes.''
</P>
<P>
   But the move upward has lacked conviction, in part, because
energy prices remain high and labor markets tight -- both factors
that could contribute to a rise in inflation. In addition, several
sectors have warned that profits may be down in the second half of
2000.
</P>
<P>
   These dynamics could pose obstacles as the markets try to
reclaim their highs of early spring.
</P>
<P>
   Hays noted that trading volume on Friday was at its lowest level
of the year and remained low Monday. Moreover, he noted that stocks
were being propelled on Monday on the strength of a handful of
stocks in a small number of sectors, something known as a lack of
breadth in the market.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow was led by widely held stocks such as IBM, up $3.25 to
$132.25, and J.P. Morgan, up $1.813 to $145.813.
</P>
<P>
   The same pattern held true on the Nasdaq, where well known
technology stocks led the way. Intel rose $1.562 to $74.50, Cisco
Systems gained $1.313 to $66.813, and Dell Computers was up $1.313
to $39.938.
</P>
<P>
   And Internet stocks, out of favor since the spring, have moved
back into the spotlight, helping to fuel the Nasdaq. Search engine
company Lycos rose $1.75 to $67.563.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo!, however, a star last week, was hit hard after analysts
warned that the Internet portal's revenues may fall as Internet
advertising slows later in the year. Yahoo!'s shares fell $13 to
$121.25.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-4 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 568.96 million
shares, up slightly from Friday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 1.64 at 526.75.

<HEADLINE> Moscow Lives Without Television  </HEADLINE>
By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- For residents of a city that has seen two coup
attempts in the last decade and a recent string of deadly bombings,
television screens suddenly going blank was an ominous sign.
</P>
<P>
   So when Muscovites found out the cause was a fire in the
capital's television tower, their first reaction was relief. But
soon, shock and despair set in as all television channels except
one remained dead from the blaze, which gutted the tower and killed
two people before being put out Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''My first thought was about another bombing or some kind of a
military coup, and when I heard it was a fire I felt better,'' said
Yuri Kozlov, who was watching television in his apartment when the
giant tower caught fire Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some time later, I had a weird feeling, as if we suddenly
became isolated from the rest of the world,'' the 31-year-old
businessman said.
</P>
<P>
   Only once in the past have Russian television channels had to
stop their broadcasts, when hard-liners trying to overthrow
President Boris Yeltsin's government attacked the Ostankino
television center in October 1993. Regular broadcasts resumed
within hours.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the government said it would take days to resume at
least some broadcasts -- and up to several months to restore the
airwaves fully.
</P>
<P>
   For many Russians, who have become increasingly dependent on
television for both information and leisure, the continuous
blackout will mean a sharp change.
</P>
<P>
   ''For me it was the only pleasure I could afford, and I don't
know how I will live without it for so long,'' said Tamara
Voronina, a 69-year-old pensioner coming out of a food store in
central Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Soap operas, mostly foreign-made, have become increasingly
popular in Russia, attracting at least 20 percent of the television
audience, according to pollsters.
</P>
<P>
   ''For these people, the television blackout will be a serious
psychological blow,'' said Yuri Levada, the head of VTsIOM,
Russia's premier independent polling agency. ''Many of them haven't
yet had time to realize how serious the problem is, and they are
going to feel the impact later.''
</P>
<P>
   For the younger generation, television has long become the main
source of information, and they will also be seriously hurt by the
blackout, Levada and other pollsters said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The country is deaf,'' said Grigory Sokolov, an unemployed
recent college graduate, watching firefighters fight the blaze
Monday. ''It's not about the soap operas. I'm worried about what's
happening in our country.''
</P>
<P>
   Roman Katrovsky, a 28-year old real estate agent, said his only
grievance so far was missing a movie which was to be broadcast
Sunday. ''If it lasts, I think it would become annoying,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Aida Shakarian, a deputy head of the independent ROMIR polling
agency said the irritation caused by the television blackout would
rapidly strengthen with time.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers warned of spillover that could affect life in the
city. ''The absence of television in the very heart of Russia is
not just weird, it may provoke any kind of reaction, especially
with the psychically unstable people,'' said Eduard Sagalayev, the
head of Russian Broadcasters' Association.
</P>
<P>
   When the Echo of Moscow radio station was polling its audience
about the television blackout on Monday, one woman burst into tears
when she answered the question.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities have been at odds over ways to restore the
broadcasts. The Russian capital has no reserve broadcasting
facility, and efforts to set up a temporary replacement would take
days.
</P>
<P>
   The only station unaffected by the fire was the TNT channel on
the UHF band. It is owned by the Media-Most company, whose head
Vladimir Gusinsky was arrested and jailed for several days in June
in what was widely seen as an attempt to stifle his company's
media, which have reported critically on President Vladimir Putin
and the war in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Media Minister Mikhail Lesin angrily lashed out at
Media-Most, accusing it of biased coverage of the fire and attempts
to ''exploit the tragedy.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton-bashing restaurateur softening  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SKANEATELES, N.Y. (AP) - Local restauranteur John Angyal makes
no apology for being a Clinton-basher but even he admitted he may
have crossed the line of good taste with his latest swipe at
Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Angyal captured national attention last year during the first
family's vacation in this Finger Lakes resort village when he began
selling a special bologna sandwich named after Clinton, who is
running for U.S. Senate from New York.
</P>
<P>
   With the bologna sandwich joke getting ''a little stale,''
Angyal put up a red-lettered sign in front of his ''Johnny Angel's
Heavenly Hamburgers'' in anticipation of the Clintons' return this
weekend: ''Hillary Chicken Dinner ... $4.95. Two small breasts, two
left wings and two large thighs.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Clintons, who arrive Friday, won't see the sign. Angyal
has taken it down.
</P>
<P>
   ''This very nice lady called,'' Angyal explained, ''and she
said, 'I think the chicken dinner sign's a little tacky' and asked
if I could take it down.''
</P>
<P>
   Angyal suspects the caller was a campaign staffer for Clinton
but neither her staff nor White House officials said they knew
anything about the call.
</P>
<P>
   The woman asked if Angyal had grandchildren, and when he said
yes, she promised to send some White House souvenirs. When she hung
up, Angyal tried to trace the call, but the connection was
unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   As for the chicken dinner sign, Angyal was already being prodded
to nix it by another influential person - his wife of 40 years,
Betty.
</P>
<P>
   ''She didn't like it either,'' he said. ''The reference to
women's body parts was probably not a nice thing to put up.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after he talked to the mystery caller, a package arrived
with a set of Millennium 2000 White House goblets, a hat that says
''Air Force One/Marine One,'' some White House food service shot
glasses, some presidential M&AMP;M candies, and play sets with
miniature airplanes, helicopters, black limousines and Jeeps
emblazoned with Secret Service, Air Force One and other
presidential logos.
</P>
<P>
   ''(The caller) was probably right for the most part,'' Angyal
said. ''But a lot of people loved that sign. I've never heard so
many guttural laughs from women.''
</P>
<P>
   A former town supervisor, Angyal often posts signs expressing
his irritation with local government officials. He says the signs
are all in jest.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want to hurt the Clintons' feelings,'' said Angyal,
who wears a cartoon-Hillary wristwatch that flips the logo on her
baseball cap every 10 seconds from NY to AR and DC.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't support them politically, but I admire their tenacity
and stick-to-itiveness.''

<HEADLINE> China Seizes Clinton Picture Book  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER BODEEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- Chinese customs agents have seized 16,000 copies
of a book of photographs of President Clinton because one picture
showed him holding hands with the Dalai Lama, a company involved in
the publishing said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The confiscation is an extreme example of China's obsession with
denying publicity to the exiled Tibetan leader, vilified for
decades by the Chinese government and the target of a 4-year-old
campaign to break his influence among Tibet's fervently Buddhist
people.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Philip Reeker said
Monday that if the report of the seizure is accurate, ''it is most
disturbing.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't believe books should be seized to impose some
political control,'' Reeker said.
</P>
<P>
   The book, ''The Clinton Years,'' contains more than 200
black-and-white photographs shot by Robert McNeely, Clinton's
official photographer from 1992 to 1998. Among the images, one
showed the Dalai Lama and Clinton at the White House on April 28,
1994.
</P>
<P>
   The book was printed in Hong Kong and sent across the border to
Shenzhen in southern China for binding, said a spokesman for Palace
Press International, which arranged for the printing for the New
York-based publisher, Callaway Editions.
</P>
<P>
   Although 8,000 copies of the book had already been bound and
shipped out of China, the second shipment of 16,000 was seized in
early August, said the spokesman, who declined to give his name
because of the sensitivities of the company's business in China.
</P>
<P>
   ''They said the problem was the photograph of the Dalai Lama,
then told us to wait for word on how the case will be handled,''
the spokesman said. ''We feel that it is logical that the picture
be there since it is a book about Bill Clinton and the people he
met with.''
</P>
<P>
   China has regarded the Dalai Lama as a potential enemy to its
hold on Tibet ever since he fled to India in 1959 amid a failed
uprising against Chinese rule. China's communist leaders routinely
pressure foreign governments to shun the Dalai Lama. In deference
to Beijing, he was not invited to the Millennium World Peace Summit
this week, a gathering of religious leaders in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Even Clinton's meeting with the Tibetan monk was held outside
the Oval Office, as a nod toward China's sensitivities, a fact the
spokesman said was noted in the caption.
</P>
<P>
   An official from the State Press and Publications
Administration, who did not give his name, confirmed that copies of
the book had been seized but said it was because the book had not
been submitted for approval in advance as required.
</P>
<P>
   Customs officials did not immediately return requests for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Books that contain religious content, maps or works of
journalism need approval in advance, the Palace Press spokesman
said. But the printers did not think a single photo of the Dalai
Lama buried in a 200-page book of pictures made vetting necessary,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Palace Press International plans to reprint the 16,000 copies in
Hong Kong and have them bound there, he said.
</P>
<P>
   While Hong Kong, a former British colony, returned to Chinese
rule three years ago, its laws are separate and meant to maintain
the territory's capitalist structure.

<HEADLINE> Pete Seeger ill with Lyme disease  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BEACON, N.Y. (AP) - Folk singer and activist Pete Seeger has
been diagnosed with Lyme disease, his wife said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Toshi Seeger, reached by telephone at the couple's home in
Beacon, said he had been feeling sick and recently learned of the
diagnosis. She said it isn't yet clear how severe a case he has
contracted.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have ticks in the area we live,'' she added. Beacon is
about 50 miles north of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Lyme disease is caused by a microbe that is spread to humans
through a tick bite. The disease can cause headache, fever, stiff
joints and fatigue. It can be treated effectively with antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   She said Seeger, 81, was resting at home Monday. He hopes to
keep all his performing commitments, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Seeger, who is known for championing environmental, labor and
other causes, started his career 62 years ago. He reached
commercial success in the 1950s with the Weavers.
</P>
<P>
   He is known for co-writing the folk classic ''Where Have All the
Flowers Gone?'' He also wrote or co-wrote ''If I Had a Hammer,''
''Turn, Turn, Turn,'' and ''Kisses Sweeter Than Wine.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Seeger made news when he lost a 55-year-old
banjo that fell off his car. A passer-by found and returned it two
weeks later.

<HEADLINE> BC-NJ--Mock Hijackings, Bjt,600  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CURRAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   POMONA, N.J. (AP) - A jumbo jet donated to the Federal Aviation
Administration was put to quick use Monday, playing host to a pair
of mock hijackings that gave a rare glimpse of anti-terrorism
agents at work.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrations, which took place on a runway at the FAA's
William J. Hughes Research Center, featured members of the
government's Federal Air Marshals program, which trains agents in
SWAT-style techniques and sends them anonymously onto passenger
airliners.
</P>
<P>
   Established in 1985, after the two-weeklong hijacking of a TWA
jet by Shiite Muslims in Beirut, Lebanon, the program provides
armed agents for deployment all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   It has headquarters here, where agents train on outdoor shooting
ranges, an aircraft simulator, a five-story air traffic control
center and two airplanes during their 14-week training courses.
</P>
<P>
   FAA officials won't say how many agents participate in the
program, citing security concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The jumbo jet, a wide-body Delta Air Lines L-1011, was signed
over Monday by Delta officials. FAA officials said the plane - the
first jumbo jet made available to the program - would provide a
realistic backdrop for training.
</P>
<P>
   Its engines will be removed, and it will take up permanent
residence on the tarmac.
</P>
<P>
   ''People have to train in circumstances as realistic as
possible,'' said Cathal Flynn, an FAA security administrator.
''It's going to be enormously valuable to us and the program to
have a wide-body aircraft on which to practice our tactics.''
</P>
<P>
   The ensuing demonstrations, on board the L-1011, showed how
federal agents respond to in-flight crises - both major and minor.
</P>
<P>
   In the first, FAA officials and members of the news media
boarded the jet and donned protective headgear before the hijacking
attempt began aboard ''Flight 777 to Istanbul.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a hijacking!'' one of the captors shouted, jumping out
of his seat in first class and pulling the pin on a hand grenade.
''It's our plane now! Stay down!'' he yelled at the passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Another captor strolled the aisles, threatening them. ''What are
you looking at? Get down! Eyes down!'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, federal agents leaped out of their seats and
fired shots at the grenade carrier, overtaking him. ''We are the
police,'' one called out to passengers afterward. ''Stay in your
seats. Do not move.''
</P>
<P>
   The second scenario involved a knife-wielding attacker
attempting a hijacking. He, too, was ''shot'' by agents, who fired
blanks so nobody on board was injured.
</P>
<P>
   The third showed a passenger being knocked to the ground and
handcuffed after assaulting a flight attendant. The fourth showed
agents subduing a drunken passenger who was escorted to the rear of
the aircraft by an agent because he was being disruptive.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the most typical incidences these days, according to
Doug, one of the agents, who could not be identified because of his
work.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're there to assist (stewards and attendants) if it gets
physical,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mac Armstrong, executive vice president for Delta, said the
airline was happy to donate the jet, which could have fetched up to
$3 million if sold for its parts.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know the security and safety of the world's skies is not
just a Delta issue or an FAA issue. It affects all of us, all the
governing agencies and the flying public,'' Armstrong said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Supports Burundi Talks  </HEADLINE>
By SONYA ROSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) -- Lending U.S. prestige to an effort to
prevent the collapse of Burundi peace talks, President Clinton and
Nelson Mandela lectured Hutu and Tutsi factions Monday on the
consequences of failing to end seven years of ethnic warfare that
has killed 200,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   ''When all is said and done, only you can bring an end to the
bloodshed and sorrow your country has suffered,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, rounding out the second Africa tour of his presidency,
flew to Tanzania after a two-day visit to Nigeria, Africa's most
populous nation, which is still shedding the vestiges of corruption
under autocratic rule. After his stop in Arusha, Clinton was
continuing on to Egypt for a meeting with Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak on the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators in Tanzania had hoped that Clinton would witness the
signing of a major Burundi peace accord. But the power-sharing
agreement signed Monday wasn't approved by Hutu rebels, who hadn't
participated in the talks, or by several small Tutsi parties.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela, the former South African president and chief mediator,
lashed out at the Tutsi parties that didn't sign, accusing them of
ignoring ''the slaughter of innocent people inside Burundi.''
</P>
<P>
   They ''are sabotaging this agreement,'' Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
   As Mandela spoke, several seats on the stage remained empty.
But, in a symbolic move, the Tutsi representatives filed back in to
the auditorium to take their seats as Clinton addressed the group.
</P>
<P>
   After the signing, Mandela lost his balance and fell forward.
Several African leaders caught him and set him back on his feet.
The 81-year-old Mandela it waved off, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton avoided pointing fingers, calling on both sides to end
the ethnic warfare.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do think it is absolutely certain that if you let this
moment slip away, it will dig the well of bitterness deeper and
pile the mountain of grievances higher,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton stood with Mandela and African leaders -- from President
Jerry Rawlings of Ghana to the son of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi
-- in hopes his American presence would serve as a catalyst for
peace.
</P>
<P>
   But he arrived to find the peace talks, which have gone on for
more than two years, in disarray. Clinton huddled with Mandela for
about 20 minutes, and had a 30-minute session with Burundian
President Pierre Buyoya before joining the other leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The White House insisted that Clinton was in Arusha simply to
show his support for Mandela regardless of whether a peace
agreement would be ready.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know this is a long-term process, one way or another,''
said White House national security spokesman P.J. Crowley.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as Air Force One touched down here, Clinton and
Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa met briefly in an airport
terminal in the shadow of Mount Kilimanjaro. They walked together
to a stage beside the tarmac to watch their respective
transportation secretaries sign an ''open skies'' agreement
allowing unrestricted international airport-to-airport access
between the United States and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   Alluding to the larger purpose for Clinton's visit, Mkapa
thanked Clinton for encouraging African leaders to work together on
problems such as the Burundi conflict.

   ''He has supported our efforts at finding ... African solutions
to African problems,'' Mkapa said. ''An African proverb says, 'Only
the owner can free his home from mice.' Indeed, that is as it
should be.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also recalled the U.S. embassy bombings in Tanzania and
Kenya two years ago that killed more than 200 people, including 12
Americans. He said the terrorists ''failed utterly to deter us''
from establishing peaceful relations.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton left Nigeria on Monday morning, President Olusegun
Obasanjo sent him off with a ceremony replete with tribal dancers
and a gun salute. He and Clinton held hands as they walked to
Clinton's limousine, and exchanged a tight embrace.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, traveling with daughter Chelsea, received an
enthusiastic welcome in Tanzania. Crowds estimated at more than
10,000 lined the 30-mile motorcade route from the airport into the
city. Many waved U.S. and Tanzanian flags.

<HEADLINE> Some Reluctant Tutsis Sign Deal  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS TOMLINSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) -- After being chastised by Nelson Mandela,
half of Burundi's Tutsi politicians reluctantly signed a
power-sharing agreement Monday, but hamstrung it with reservations
that ensured the deal could not be implemented without extensive
renegotiations.
</P>
<P>
   While President Clinton looked on before the official signing,
the former South African rebel leader and president gave an
impassioned speech, condemning any group that refused to
participate in the power-sharing agreement that his mediators had
drafted.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement called for a balance between Tutsis and Hutus in
the government, National Assembly and military as well as a
three-year transition to democratic elections.
</P>
<P>
   While all the parties representing the Hutu majority signed the
agreement, only four out of 10 Tutsi political parties signed, as
well as President Pierre Buyoya and a representative of the army.
While the most important Tutsi parties signed, the failure to reach
a consensus cast a shadow over the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ''Something disturbing has occurred,'' Mandela warned at the
beginning of a fiery speech that invoked his personal experiences
in the struggle against apartheid in South Africa. ''I don't think
there are many countries where leaders have undermined an agreement
which they had solemnly made.''
</P>
<P>
   Mandela had hoped to complete a comprehensive peace agreement
Monday, with Clinton and the leaders of eight African countries
looking on. But the refusal of two Hutu rebel groups to join the
talks meant that only a political agreement was possible.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200,000 people, mostly civilians, have died since
Tutsi paratroopers assassinated Burundi's first and only
democratically elected president, a Hutu, in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Buyoya, a retired paratrooper who took power in a 1996 coup, and
the group of 10 Tutsi parties had demanded an extension of Monday's
deadline for an agreement, but Mandela refused, saying that two
years of negotiations had been enough.
</P>
<P>
   The Burundi president has been under intense pressure not to
sign a deal without a cease-fire from the rebels. Some extremist
Tutsi groups had threatened a coup if he did so.
</P>
<P>
   Many Tutsis in Burundi fear sharing power will put them at the
mercy of the Hutu majority and they will meet the same fate as
Tutsis in neighboring Rwanda. In 1994, more than 500,000 Rwandans,
mainly Tutsis, were the victims of a Hutu government-orchestrated
genocide.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's limited signing took place only after last-minute
brinkmanship by Burundi's leaders. Mandela, the African leaders and
the Hutu parties took the stage for a signing ceremony before
Clinton's arrival. But none of the Tutsi parties, nor Buyoya, would
come out, leaving the ceremony waiting for two hours before Ugandan
President Yoweri Museveni announced a delay.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been in the labor room waiting for the baby to be born
and the labor is taking a little longer than expected,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Four hours later, when Mandela and Clinton took the stage, the
Tutsi parties were still not present, though Buyoya sat stone-faced
in the back row. Mandela then went into a scathing speech,
condemning those who would not sign, but not mentioning them by
name.
</P>
<P>
   ''Another group, representing mainly the Tutsi community, a
minority of 14 percent in Burundi, forgot about the agreement. They
wanted to leave open almost everything. They refused to sign,''
Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton was making his remarks, though, the leaders of the 10
Tutsi parties took their seats while the president compared the
Burundi peace process to others he has worked on around the world.
He warned the delegates against not implementing the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you come back in five or ten years, will the issues have
changed, I think not,'' Clinton said. ''The gulf between you won't
narrow, but the gulf between you and the rest of the world, I
assure you, will grow wider.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, a Tutsi spokesman announced to the ceremony that some
Tutsi parties would not sign, while others would sign with
reservations that could only be resolved with further negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Terrence Nsanze, leader of the African-Burundaise Alliance for
Salvation, said the Tutsi parties had reservations with the
document's title and every other substantive issue addressed in the
document.
</P>
<P>
   ''What this means is that with these signatures and these
reservations, there can be no implementation until these issues are
solved,'' Nsanze said.
</P>
<P>
   While the power-sharing agreement was touted by participants as
an important step forward, it also failed to address the key issue
of when a cease-fire would take place.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela has held private meetings with the Hutu rebel leaders in
South Africa, and came out in support of their position that no
cease fire was possible without a power-sharing agreement.

<HEADLINE> Iran Clash Leave Police Officer Dead  </HEADLINE>
By ALI AKBAR DAREINI
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Hard-line vigilantes clashed with reformist
students in western Iran, leaving a policeman dead, Iran's
state-run radio and a student leader said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The clashes, which began Thursday and reached a climax Sunday,
injured 25 to 30 students in the city of Khorramabad, about 300
miles southwest of Tehran, student leader Amir Hussein Balali told
The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   The confrontations put an end to a democracy seminar -- slated to
end Wednesday after a week -- when local authorities told student
organizers Sunday they could no longer guarantee security for the
sessions, Balali said.
</P>
<P>
   Rioting broke out Sunday night after the clashes between the
vigilantes and members of the Office for Fostering Unity, the
student group, Balali said after returning to Tehran. He did not
say how many students took part in the clashes and riots.
</P>
<P>
   ''Police officer Ardeshir Karami was killed Sunday evening
during clashes with opportunists and rioters who smashed windows of
shops causing damages to public and private properties,'' Tehran
Radio said.
</P>
<P>
   Balali, said: ''We heard that a police officer was killed in the
riots.''
</P>
<P>
   The democracy seminar opened on Wednesday with a message from
reformist President Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
   But Brig. Gen. Gholam-Reza Soleimani, a top officer of the elite
Revolutionary Guards in the region, warned in remarks published
Saturday of a ''crushing response'' if the seminar continued.
</P>
<P>
   After the seminar's close, the daily Hayat-e-Now quoted leading
reformist lawmaker, Ali Shakouri-Rad, as saying Monday: ''If the
establishment cannot provide security for a legal gathering, then
it has violated the philosophy of its existence.''
</P>
<P>
   Balali said armed Revolutionary Guards and police were present
during the clashes but did not intervene to stop the
confrontations.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time since July that hard-liners used violence
to silence reformists, who are calling for easing social and
political restrictions by hard-line Islamic authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Balali said that some 200 vigilantes and armed Revolutionary
Guards surrounded Khorramabad airport over the weekend and
prevented leading reformist thinkers Abdolkarim Soroush and Mohsen
Kadivar of Tehran University from leaving the station to address
the seminar. It said the two returned to Tehran.

<HEADLINE> Groups says it can do rebate program one better  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - A public policy group that has criticized
the Whitman administration's fiscal practices now says it has a
better way to offer New Jersey taxpayers a break.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey Policy Perspective wants to revamp the NJ Saver
program to dole out checks that average $926.
</P>
<P>
   But to pay for this property tax relief the group proposes
higher income taxes for people making more than $75,000 a year and
a new tax on financial assets.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey Policy Perspective president Jon Shure says New
Jersey's property tax system forces the middle class to pay a
disproportionate share of the state tax revenues. This proposal
would make the overall tax burden fairer, Shure said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We ask the middle class to shoulder a higher-percentage burden
than we ask the rich, and that needs to be changed,'' Shure said.
</P>
<P>
   In the 44-page report released Monday, analysts from the group
called the property tax a ''house tax''.
</P>
<P>
   By taxing property, the state in effect taxes the only asset
many people ever own, Shure said. That allows other financial
assets owned by wealthy residents to escape a state tax levy, he
claimed.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was a great system in the 18th century, when only the
rich had property,'' Shure said.
</P>
<P>
   Now in its second year, the NJ Saver program is expected to give
property owners a rebate of $240. The program bases the refund on a
portion of the amount of school taxes paid.
</P>
<P>
   The program is scheduled to be fully funded in three more years.
This year's rebate checks are scheduled to be mailed beginning
Sept. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Senate President Donald T. DiFrancesco announced a
plan to fully fund that rebate next year and to increase the
Homestead Rebate.
</P>
<P>
   DiFrancesco said the state can use expected increases in
revenues to fund his $400 million program.
</P>
<P>
   Even the most conservative estimate says the state will see an
additional $1.4 billion in new money, DiFrancesco said.
</P>
<P>
   Shure says his plan can be implemented without relying on the
promise of revenue windfalls in a growing economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's still a cross-your fingers plan. This is all paid for
right away from day one,'' Shure said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for DiFrancesco said Monday that his plan is
fiscally conservative.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Senate president's proposal is a realistic proposal that
puts more dollars than ever back into the pockets of taxpayers,''
Rae Hutton said.
</P>
<P>
   To fund Shure's proposal, his group suggests increasing the
income tax and a new tax on financial assets.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would increase the income tax from 6.37 percent to 8.87
percent on those earning $75,000 or more.
</P>
<P>
   Assets greater than $2 million would be taxed at one-quarter of
1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 1 percent of households in the state would be
affected by the new tax, Shure said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's called asking the rich to pay their fair share,'' Shure
said.
</P>
<P>
   His proposal is not likely to become law any time soon, Shure
said. His goal is to force discussion about what he says is ''a
fundamentally flawed system.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not going to happen tomorrow. The point here is, we
need to put things like this on the table. We need to start talking
about real reforms,'' Shure said.

<HEADLINE> Caesareans on the Rise Again  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Caesarean sections started dropping slowly in
the early 1990s after an outcry that American women undergo too
many -- but now they're on the rise again.
</P>
<P>
   Most puzzling: Why C-sections are increasing in first-time moms,
not just in women who previously had one. And where pregnant women
live determines how likely they are to wind up on the operating
table -- C-sections are more common in the South than out West.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with Caesareans inching back up to 22 percent of U.S.
births, the nation's leading obstetricians' group is issuing new
guidelines to reduce unnecessary C-sections and reserve the surgery
for mothers and babies who truly need it.
</P>
<P>
   There are many suspects in the C-section rise -- state-by-state
variation particularly suggests doctors' habits sometimes can
overshadow medical need.
</P>
<P>
   ''Maybe we've become too technical,'' says Dr. Jean Walker, an
attending obstetrician at Chicago's Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's
Medical Center, which is taking new steps to lower C-sections.
''We're going back to natural things like walking more often and
birthing balls and really encouraging natural descent of the
fetus.''
</P>
<P>
   To do that, Rush just began a nursing change -- back to more
continuous, hands-on care during early labor, especially for
first-time moms whose labor takes longer, a big reason for
C-sections. After all, studies show women who have continual care
from nurses or midwives get fewer C-sections than when busy nurses
just pop by every so often to check how early labor is progressing.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake: Caesareans can be life- or health-saving for
many mothers and babies. Fetal distress, disorders that make labor
risky for the mother, a baby simply too big or wrongly positioned
all are important reasons for C-sections -- and hospitals that
specialize in high-risk pregnancies will perform more.
</P>
<P>
   But avoiding unnecessary C-sections also is important. Women's
risk of death, although still small, is three to seven times higher
than during vaginal delivery, says the American College of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Not to mention increased pain,
longer hospital stays and a higher risk of post-delivery infection.
</P>
<P>
   C-sections have risen for three years, climbing another 4
percent in 1999 to account for 22 percent of live births, the
government reported this month.
</P>
<P>
   That's lower than the nation's high of 25 percent in 1988 -- but
nowhere near the federal goal of a 15 percent C-section rate this
year. And it reverses a steady decline in C-sections between 1989
and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Now look state-by-state: Fewer than 17.5 percent of births in
Utah, Wisconsin, Colorado, Alaska or Vermont are C-sections. But
more than one in four births are C-sections in Mississippi,
Louisiana, Arkansas and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, the most dramatic variations in hospitals' C-section
rates are among first-time moms with healthy babies in the right
birth position, says the ACOG.
</P>
<P>
   Those discrepancies suggest doctors' habits play a big role,
says Dr. Roger Freeman of the University of California, Irvine, who
chaired the new ACOG guidelines that outline practices and
conditions linked to higher C-sections -- and urge doctors to check
for ways to improve.
</P>
<P>
   Among the list:
</P>
<P>
   --A previous C-section is the biggest risk factor for having
another. If the surgical cut was in the lower abdomen -- not the
upper -- ACOG says most healthy women can try vaginally delivering
their next baby as long as a surgeon is standing by if emergency
surgery is needed. Most low-risk mothers who try can deliver
vaginally, says ACOG, encouraging women to carefully discuss this
option with their doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the rate of vaginal births after C-section fell to 23.4
percent last year, down 17 percent since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   --Slow labor is a big reason for C-sections in first-time moms.
ACOG cautioned against surgery too early, and Chicago's Walker also
stressed patience, saying here that nurses are key. ''With younger
nurses, I get more phone calls saying, 'Nothing's happening, she
needs a C-section,''' while older nurses are ''a little more
attentive, more patient'' with slow labor.
</P>
<P>
   --ACOG says demanding a painkilling epidural too early, before
the cervix is dilated 4-5 centimeters, increases your C-section
risk. But this is controversial -- Walker urges women to ask for a
less potent ''walking epidural'' that she says doesn't increase the
risk.
</P>
<P>
   --For breech, or feet-first, babies, doctors should consider
trying to turn the baby headfirst by ''external version,'' pushing
on the mother's abdomen before automatically operating, ACOG
advised.
</P>
<P>
   While ACOG targets doctors, consumer advocates advise pregnant
women to ask about C-section rates when choosing a physician and
hospital. Pick one with a lower rate, or who's open to a second
opinion for nonemergency surgery, and ''it's more likely you're
going to avoid an unnecessary C-section,'' says Public Citizen's
Dr. Sidney Wolfe.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Debate Syphilis Origins  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BARR
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Recent excavations at a medieval friary in
Northern England add weight to the theory that syphilis didn't come
to Europe from the New World.
</P>
<P>
   Skeletons excavated at Hull, dated to between 1300 and 1450, had
clear signs of syphilis, said Anthea Boylston, a paleopathologist
and leader of an archaeological team from University of Bradford in
north England that conducted the dig. Several other skeletons also
showed signs of the disease, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists long have argued about whether syphilis was brought
to the Americas by European explorers, transmitted the other way
around, or arose independently in each region. Skeletons studied
earlier in Europe have suggested that the disease was present
before Christopher Columbus returned from his first voyage.
</P>
<P>
   Europeans seemed to become aware of the disease after 1500, but
some researchers believe that syphilis may have been confused with
leprosy in earlier times.
</P>
<P>
   Syphilis starts out as sores, develops into a rash, fever and
fatigue, and years after initial infection, may develop into severe
complications of the heart and brain.
</P>
<P>
   ''This discovery changes our views about the history of
syphilis,'' Boylston said. ''There had been a couple of skeletons
around the country with signs of syphilis that could have predated
Columbus, but the interesting thing about this burial site is there
are cases of the disease in many individuals, not just one or
two,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''That makes us think that syphilis was present in medieval
England.''
</P>
<P>
   David Evans, who directed excavations at the Augustinian friary,
dated the skeletons somewhat later -- between 1450 and 1475 -- based
on stratification.
</P>
<P>
   Four skeletons showed signs of the disease, Evans said in an
article in the June edition of British Archaeology.
</P>
<P>
   ''The disease, which takes some 20 years before it begins to
leave its mark on the bone, was quite advanced at the time of
death,'' Evans wrote. ''These victims had contracted syphilis long
before the return of Columbus and his ships from the New World --
traditionally regarded as the time when 'the Great Pox' was
introduced into Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Donald J. Ortner, curator of physical anthropology at the
Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., said Monday that the
discoveries at Hull help to clarify some issues regarding the
biological origin of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think a very plausible case can be made for it being
syphilis,'' said Ortner, who said it also was possible it may have
been yaws or bejel, related diseases that are not spread by sexual
contact.
</P>
<P>
   Yaws, which is found in tropical and subtropical areas, usually
develops in children. Bejel occurs in the Middle East and North
Africa. All three diseases are spread by the Treponema
microorganism.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery at Hull ''makes the whole question about the
biological origin of syphilis much more interesting. If we are
talking about a single organism causing all three diseases, then we
certainly have a very similar kind of disease occurring in Europe
long before Columbus,'' Ortner said.
</P>
<P>
   The bigger question, he said, is when syphilis emerged as the
sexually transmitted form of the disease.

<HEADLINE> Jackie Gleason Statue Unveiled in NY  </HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Even Ralph Kramden would have been hard-pressed
to dream up a self-aggrandizing scheme to top this: an 8-foot
bronze statue of the bus driver in front of the Port Authority Bus
Terminal.
</P>
<P>
   The half-ton likeness of Jackie Gleason's character in ''The

<HEADLINE> New curriculum developed to teach about Connecticut Indians  </HEADLINE>
By DIANE SCARPONI
<TEXT>
<P>
   For many schoolchildren, the only formal lessons about American
Indians arrive at Thanksgiving time, when the story of the Pilgrims
and the Indians gets its annual airing.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut students are now able to probe deeper into the
history of eastern tribes with the development of a curriculum
guide for teachers from kindergarten to high school.
</P>
<P>
   The 66-page guide, created through an act of the Legislature
three years ago, tells Connecticut Indian history from the Indian
point-of-view.
</P>
<P>
   Similar teaching guides are being developed about the Irish
Potato Famine and the experiences of blacks and Puerto Ricans in
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   An advisory board including historians and educators from some
Connecticut tribes helped put together the lesson guide.
</P>
<P>
   The guide is the first step toward a greater understanding of
local Indian history, said Trudie Lamb Richmond, a Schaghticoke
Indian who is the program manager for education at the Mashantucket
Pequot Museum and Research Center.
</P>
<P>
   ''Generally, the focus has been on west of the Mississippi.
Although we talk a little bit about the Pilgrims, then history
seems to take a great quantum leap,'' said Richmond, who advised
the state Department of Education on the guide.
</P>
<P>
   Guide author Kathleen Hunter said teachers can use the program
to include the American Indian experience in their lessons on
different periods in history.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we've tried to do is show how there still are native
Americans in Connecticut, as we all now know, and things were going
on related to native American affairs throughout Connecticut's
history,'' said Hunter, the director of education for the Old State
House in Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   The guide gives basic information about Connecticut tribes, from
before European colonization to the present day, and suggests
lessons appropriate for different ages.
</P>
<P>
   The guide includes the traditional creation stories of the
tribes, as a counterpoint to the prevailing scientific theory that
people came to the Americas from Asia, over a land bridge.
</P>
<P>
   The guide also includes the Indian perspective on colonization,
wars with the English, missionaries who tried to convert Indians to
Christianity and political attempts to assimilate tribes into
European society.
</P>
<P>
   Stories from Connecticut Indian history are compared with
similar stories from other cultures. For example, one lesson
suggests comparing Shakespeare's ''Romeo and Juliet'' to the story
of two Cherokee boys who attended an Indian school in Cornwall and
married white girls, to the dismay of white people in Cornwall and
Cherokee families in the South.
</P>
<P>
   In helping put together the guide, Richmond recalled her own
education in the 1950s in western Connecticut and the reception she
got from her teacher when she proposed an essay on Indian history
as part of a multicultural presentation.
</P>
<P>
   ''She said, 'Oh, Trudie, Indians haven't made sufficient
contributions. You really have to pick another group.''' Richmond
recalled. ''I was just floored. ... That must have been my goal
from then on, that I was going to show what native people have
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Melissa Fawcett, the Mohegans' tribal historian, said she hoped
the guide will revive an interest in state and local history.
</P>
<P>
   ''Local history curriculum sometimes gets pushed aside because
everyone's preparing for standardized tests. This is one way we
hope can create an easy, flexible mix so teachers still find time
to teach local history,'' Fawcett said.

   The guide ''Native Americans of Connecticut - Holding On and
Moving Forward'' does not delve into contemporary issues such as
federal recognition of tribes and Indian-run casinos, although
these issues are raised as topics for discussion for older
students.
</P>
<P>
   ''The state Department of Education really does not want to get
into the position of being for or against casinos, so what it can
do is recommend issues to discuss,'' Hunter explained.	   The state law that
created these teaching guides do not mandate
that they be used in the classroom. The Indian history guide was
completed and distributed a few weeks ago, so it may take time for
the material to make it into classrooms.

<HEADLINE> Ruff Says He Didn't Discuss E-mail  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID HO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former White House counsel Charles Ruff said
Monday he never spoke with President Clinton or his senior aides
about an e-mail foul-up that kept his staff from properly reviewing
messages under subpoena.
</P>
<P>
   At a court hearing on the missing e-mails, Ruff said he couldn't
recall discussing the e-mail problem outside of his own staff and a
conversation with White House lawyer Mark Lindsay. Ruff presented
similar testimony before a congressional committee in May.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials earlier this year said thousands of
e-mails, including some from Vice President Al Gore's office, were
not properly archived. As a result, White House lawyers never
reviewed the messages to determine if they should be turned over to
investigators probing cases ranging from the Monica Lewinsky
scandal and Whitewater to campaign fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff, a former Watergate prosecutor and U.S. attorney for the
District of Columbia, said he wasn't sure how he first learned of
the e-mail problem in June 1998, but it was either from Lindsay or
from a copy of a memo sent to John Podesta, President Clinton's
chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   Reprising his testimony from May, Ruff said he didn't advise
senior aides of the problem because it didn't appear to be that
serious at first.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I had known the full scope of it, I certainly would have
discussed it with Mr. Podesta,'' Ruff said.
</P>
<P>
   The computer problems became public only last February, in a $90
million class-action suit filed by the conservative Judicial Watch,
which has filed several lawsuits against Clinton since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth has been holding hearings for
several weeks to determine how to retrieve the messages.
</P>
<P>
   Judicial Watch general counsel Larry Klayman said outside the
courthouse that he wasn't satisfied with Ruff's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ''He came in and he had no memory,'' Klayman said. ''He was not
candid to this court.''
</P>
<P>
   Judicial Watch also wants to question Podesta and attorney
Virginia Apuzzo, the former assistant to the president for
management and administration.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsay testified last Wednesday that e-mails lost in 1998 were
the victims of an ''antiquated and unstable'' computer system that
crashed repeatedly. He said the system was upgraded in 1999 to head
off expected Y2K problems.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsay said he told Ruff and Podesta, then the deputy chief of
staff, about the e-mail glitch in June 1998 but he also never spoke
to Clinton about the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Former White House employee Sheryl Hall, who first unearthed the
e-mail problem, alleged in a declaration that ''when the
contractors told the White House about the problem, they were
threatened, warned not to discuss it.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Ruff and Lindsay deny that they threatened anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Judicial Watch has accused White House officials of acting to
delay production of the e-mails until after November's election.
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail investigation is part of a larger lawsuit over FBI
background files gathered in the White House on hundreds of
appointees from the Reagan and Bush administrations.

<HEADLINE> House Readies Bill on Doctor Records  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID PACE
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Patients will be able to examine the
government's secret dossiers on their doctors, including
disciplinary actions and malpractice payments, if a House committee
chairman gets his way.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom Bliley, R-Va., chairman of the House Commerce
Committee, plans to introduce legislation next week to give the
public access to the federal data bank that tracks critical records
on health care providers.
</P>
<P>
   Bliley also plans to hold hearings on the legislation early next
month with the intention of pushing it through the House before
Congress adjourns for the year, committee spokesman Stephen Schmidt
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   While details of the measure are still being finalized, Schmidt
said it will be modeled after a Massachusetts law that provides
patients with profiles of all physicians licensed in the state,
including disciplinary actions and malpractice payments. The
profiles are available over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Bliley has not decided whether the legislation will require
public release of all malpractice payments made by or on behalf of
any physician, or just those by health care providers with multiple
payments, said Schmidt.
</P>
<P>
   An Associated Press review of the National Practitioner Data
Bank earlier this summer found that nearly 500 doctors and dentists
across the country have been slapped with at least 10 disciplinary
actions and malpractice payments over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   The data bank was created by a 1986 federal law that requires
insurance companies, hospitals and state and federal regulators to
report malpractice payments and disciplinary actions against all
health care providers.
</P>
<P>
   The government provides a public version of the database but
strips out doctors' and dentists' names and other identifying
information. Under current law, identifying information and most of
the details in the database can be shared only with insurance
companies, hospitals and federal and state health care regulators.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Daily News, The Hartford Courant and The Associated
Press used that public version of the database and court records
earlier this year to identify doctors with large numbers of
malpractice payments or disciplinary actions.
</P>
<P>
   The American Medical Association has long opposed public release
of the data bank information. The doctors' lobby contends the raw
data on malpractice payments does not reflect either physician
quality or competence, since only one of every five malpractice
settlements involves negligence.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt said Bliley's legislation will require that malpractice
payment information be provided in context, so a physician can be
compared with others in the same medical specialty and the same
state. He said it also will require references to disciplinary
actions or malpractice payments made by the same physician in other
states.

<HEADLINE> Pig Cells Transplanted to Mice  </HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH B. VERRENGIA
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scientists have successfully spliced pig cells into the injured
spines of paralyzed mice and restored some nerve impulses.
</P>
<P>
   In an additional twist, the pig cells were bioengineered with a
human protein that helped to prevent the immune systems of the mice
from rejecting the foreign tissue.
</P>
<P>
   The study, conducted at Yale, provides the latest evidence yet
that pigs may provide the most promising new source of cells and
organs for transplant into humans.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers said the experiment, published in the September
issue of Nature Biotechnology, is also another step toward
repairing spinal cord injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ''Though unthinkable only a decade or two ago, it now appears
that reparative treatment for spinal cord injury may be within
reach,'' said Lars Olson of the Karolinska Institute in Sweden, who
reviewed the Yale experiment.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers said the experiment shows how transplantation of
cells and organs across species lines, known as xenografting, may
prolong patients' lives and improve their health, at least until a
human transplant became available.
</P>
<P>
   Other researchers were surprised that the bioengineered pig
cells were so readily compatible with the nervous systems of the
mice.
</P>
<P>
   Restoring nerve function with cell transplants is just one
promising area, they said. As the immunological barriers are
lowered, pigs also may provide humans with hearts, lungs, kidneys
and livers.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, research groups in the United States, Japan
and Scotland announced they had successfully cloned pigs. But it
may take several generations of laboratory-bred pigs over many
years to weed out the genes that trigger immune-system rejection.
</P>
<P>
   In the experiment, Yale researchers severed the spinal cords of
mice. Then they implanted cells derived from the snouts of pigs.
The pig cells were engineered to express a protein that suppresses
the immune system's rejection for foreign tissue.
</P>
<P>
   The pig cells were two kinds of nerve fiber-ensheathing cells -
olfactory ensheathing cells, or OECs, and Schwann cells.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers reported the pig cells served as a bridge across
the mice's damaged spines, prompting new nerve connections and some
regrowth of the myelin sheath that insulates nerves.
</P>
<P>
   In seven of 10 mice, nerve fibers grew at a typical rate of 1
millimeter per day. The regenerated nerves conducted impulses
faster than normal mouse nerves.
</P>
<P>
   Other researchers said the mice did not regain motor function,
but said the nerve impulse results were notable.
</P>
<P>
   ''Did the mice feel their toes? They didn't ask that question,''
said Naomi Kleitman of the Miami Project to Cure Paralysis. ''They
showed the axons were functioning, not that there is a functional
connection all the way to the brain and a relay back.''
</P>
<P>
   Kleitman said the experiment also shows little performance
difference between Schwann cells and olfactory cells. That could be
important because Schwann cells are easier to obtain, she said.

<HEADLINE> Rutgers psychological clinic to offer services for Tourette patients </HEADLINE>
By HANAH CHO
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Wendy Zwoboda says few resources are
available to mothers who, like her, have two kids with Tourette
syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   So Zwoboda welcomes the addition of a treatment program for
Tourette patients and their families at Rutgers University's
psychological clinic.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm definitely planning to get on board,'' said Zwoboda, a
special education teacher from Riverdale. ''How could we not? I
envision it as a one-stop shopping, like a Wal-Mart for Tourette
patients.''
</P>
<P>
   The program - in conjunction with the Tourette Syndrome
Association of New Jersey - will offer individual and family
therapy, social-skill development sessions and educational
workshops at one location beginning in late September.
</P>
<P>
   Faith Rice, president of the Somerville-based organization, said
the clinic will serve as a ''central clearinghouse'' for families
looking for help and information.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tourette is not only for the individual,'' she said. ''It's
very much a family problem because it's with a child 24 hours a
day, and it's certainly with the family 24 hours a day.''
</P>
<P>
   Tourette Syndrome is an inherited neurological disorder
characterized by repeated involuntary facial, head, or body
movements and uncontrollable sounds called tics, such as grunting,
sniffing or barking. Some vocal tics can include inappropriate
words and phrases. Symptoms often begin in early childhood.
</P>
<P>
   When 10-year-old Adam was diagnosed with the disorder a few
years ago, Zwoboda said she didn't know where to turn for help.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a nightmarish diagnosis where they pat your head and
you have to do your own research,'' said Zwoboda, adding Adam's
twin sister, Rachael, also was diagnosed with the disorder last
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Although Zwoboda found help through the association, she said
the clinic will help families find treatment and information about
the disorder without going out of state.
</P>
<P>
   Four psychology doctoral students and a program supervisor will
run the clinic's Tourette Syndrome program. The clinic is located
at the university's Busch campus in Piscataway.
</P>
<P>
   Don Morgan, the clinic's director, said the students will work
with patients to develop individualized therapy to control tics and
less-obvious symptoms such as obsessive compulsive disorder,
attention deficit disorder and learning disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   A special emphasis will be placed on social-skills development
sessions for kids, Morgan said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have a hard time developing good social skills with
getting along with other kids and dealing with the stigmas,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The psychological clinic offers other outpatient services, and
fees are based on a sliding scale. For more information, call the
clinic at (732)445-6111 or the association at (732)972-4459.

<HEADLINE> RETRANSMITTING to ADD referral to main story  </HEADLINE>
By LUKAS I. ALPERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - The exclusion of the Dalai Lama from the United
Nations for the Millennium World Peace Summit gathering of
religious leaders brought angry, yet saddened protesters on Monday
to a plaza across from the organization's headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The group of about 150 Tibetan exiles, monks, and Free Tibet
activists gathered at the park to offer rebukes to the United
Nations, for what they believed to be the organization's caving
into Chinese pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Holding up signs reading ''Peace Summit Without Substance'' and
''UN: Assert Yourself,'' the crowd stood in quiet protest,
listening to monks offer prayer.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you hear the words peace and religion in the same
sentence the Dalai Lama must immediately come to mind,'' said
Yangdon Tsering, a Tibetan exile who lives in New Jersey. ''To not
invite him is totally incongruous with what they were trying to do
here.''
</P>
<P>
   The summit, which runs Monday through Thursday, is hoped to
result in resolutions on peace, poverty and the environment, as
well as the formation of a permanent council of religious leaders
to advise the United Nations on preventing and settling disputes.
</P>
<P>
   The first two days of the summit were scheduled to be held at
the United Nations with the last two at the Waldorf-Astoria.
</P>
<P>
   Working on the advice of a U.N. official, conference organizers
did not invite the Dalai Lama to the first two days of the
conference for fear of offending China.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers offered the Tibetan Buddhist leader and a Nobel Peace
Prize winner an invitation to the last two days of the conference,
but he declined.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday evening it was announced that an eight-person
delegation of Tibetan Buddhist leaders had been sent by the Dalai
Lama, two of whom would be speaking in the General Assembly hall
with the understanding that their speech will not be political.
</P>
<P>
   But that did little to placate the protesters who turned their
anger on the U.N.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems that the U.N. has decided to side with the stronger
power here. They should be looking at all sides of this and make it
the goal to try harder to listen and understand the weaker side. I
thought that this was their mandate. I must have been wrong,'' said
Geshe Kelsang Monlam, a Tibetan monk, who has lived in Philadelphia
for the past 18 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''The U.N. is afraid of the Chinese delegation,'' scoffed Tseten
Namdol, a Tibetan exile who moved to New York from India two years
ago. ''If they back down to them here, how can they say they
believe in human rights.''

<HEADLINE> Group says it can do rebate program one better  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - A public policy group that has criticized
the Whitman administration's fiscal practices now says it has a
better way to offer New Jersey taxpayers a break.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey Policy Perspective wants to revamp the NJ Saver
program to dole out checks that average $926.
</P>
<P>
   But to pay for this property tax relief the group proposes
higher income taxes for individuals making more than $75,000 a year
and a new tax on financial assets.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey Policy Perspective president Jon Shure says New
Jersey's property tax system forces the middle class to pay a
disproportionate share of the state tax revenues. This proposal
would make the overall tax burden fairer, said Shure, a former
communications director for Gov. Jim Florio, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ''We ask the middle class to shoulder a higher-percentage burden
than we ask the rich, and that needs to be changed,'' Shure said.
</P>
<P>
   In the 44-page report released Monday, analysts from the group
called the property tax a ''house tax''.
</P>
<P>
   By taxing property, the state in effect taxes the only asset
many people ever own, Shure said. That allows other financial
assets owned by wealthy residents to escape a state tax levy, he
claimed.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was a great system in the 18th century, when only the
rich had property,'' Shure said.
</P>
<P>
   Now in its second year, the NJ Saver program is expected to give
property owners a rebate of $240. The program bases the refund on a
portion of the amount of school taxes paid.
</P>
<P>
   The program is scheduled to be fully funded in three more years.
This year's rebate checks are scheduled to be mailed beginning
Sept. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Senate President Donald T. DiFrancesco announced a
plan to fully fund that rebate next year and to increase the
Homestead Rebate.
</P>
<P>
   DiFrancesco said the state can use expected increases in
revenues to fund his $400 million program.
</P>
<P>
   Even the most conservative estimate says the state will see an
additional $1.4 billion in new money, DiFrancesco said.
</P>
<P>
   Shure says his plan can be implemented without relying on the
promise of revenue windfalls in a growing economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's still a cross-your fingers plan. This is all paid for
right away from day one,'' Shure said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for DiFrancesco said Monday that his plan is
fiscally conservative.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Senate president's proposal is a realistic proposal that
puts more dollars than ever back into the pockets of taxpayers,''
spokeswoman Rae Hutton said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Jim Florio tried this in 1990 and we entered into the worst
recession in state history,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   To fund Shure's proposal, his group suggests increasing the
income tax and a new tax on financial assets.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would increase the income tax from 6.37 percent to 8.87
percent on those earning $75,000 or more.
</P>
<P>
   Assets greater than $2 million would be taxed at one-quarter of
1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 1 percent of households in the state would be
affected by the new tax, Shure said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's called asking the rich to pay their fair share,'' Shure
said.
</P>
<P>
   His proposal is not likely to become law any time soon, Shure
said. His goal is to force discussion about what he says is ''a
fundamentally flawed system.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not going to happen tomorrow. The point here is, we
need to put things like this on the table. We need to start talking
about real reforms,'' Shure said.

<HEADLINE> East Timor Fears More Violence  </HEADLINE>
By DANIEL COONEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   DILI, East Timor (AP) -- Schools and hospitals are open. Houses
are being built. Elections are scheduled. A year after its historic
independence vote, East Timor is literally rising from its ashes.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the ravaged territory marks the first anniversary
of the U.N.-supervised vote for independence from Indonesia that
triggered a bloody backlash by pro-Indonesia militiamen that ended
only after international forces arrived in September.
</P>
<P>
   In the capital, Dili, streets that echoed with gunfire one year
ago are now alive with the noise of hammers and saws.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are very happy that East Timor is free. We can start our
lives over,'' said Diamantino Chang, a college student who has
returned to classes 12 months after the local university was
wrecked.
</P>
<P>
   But there is fear behind the optimism. A new wave of violence
already threatens the dream of statehood.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-independence militia gangs, responsible for last year's
mayhem, are infiltrating from Indonesian West Timor. While U.N.
peacekeepers have stepped up patrols and occasionally exchange
fire, they can do little to plug the mountainous 75-mile border.
Two peacekeepers have been killed and four wounded in recent
clashes; several militiamen also have died.
</P>
<P>
   ''The militia are back and want to lay waste this immense effort
to rebuild,'' said Jose ''Xanana'' Gusmao, a charismatic former
guerrilla chief who spent years in an Indonesian prison and is
likely to be the first president of an independent East Timor,
possibly within two years.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are still burning houses and killing people. We have to
treat them as terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Gelbard, the U.S. ambassador to Indonesia, has warned of
a guerrilla war unless the militias are disbanded.
</P>
<P>
   Sergio Vieira de Mello, the chief U.N. administrator of the
territory, said Monday a U.N. force may have to remain in East
Timor after it becomes independent to fend off the militia
incursions.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the present threat from the western part of the island
continues, the U.N. may have to remain involved in safeguarding
security for the Timorese,'' he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Australian Maj. Gen. Mike Smith, the deputy peacekeeper
commander, says the militiamen cross the border at night and force
terrified villagers to hide them.
</P>
<P>
   ''The terrain around the border is ideal for small groups who
want to remain undetected,'' he said. ''But we can apply a lot of
force against them and will pursue them to their lair.''
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials and aid workers complain the anti-independence
gangs control refugee camps that sprang up on the Indonesian side
of the frontier after last year's violence.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of East Timorese who fled to the camps or were forced
there by militias have now returned home. But about 80,000 remain
in the makeshift settlements, and many accuse Indonesia's military
of arming and training gangs to destabilize the territory.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's new democratic government has sought to mend
relations with East Timor, but concedes some rogue segments of its
army may be behind the latest trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Overwhelmingly Muslim Indonesia invaded mainly Roman Catholic
East Timor in 1975 after Portugal suddenly ended four centuries of
colonial rule. Tens of thousands died of disease, famine and
military repression in the ensuing years that ended with last
August's independence vote.
</P>
<P>
   The international community is pressing Indonesia's government
to prosecute those responsible for the bloodshed and some suspects
are expected to be named within the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many fear politically powerful army generals, accused of
orchestrating the chaos, may escape through a constitutional
loophole just passed by Indonesia's parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Dili, shattered families mourn. In one tearful
commemoration, thousands marched by candlelight through the dusty
streets and prayed for those killed in the struggle.
</P>
<P>
   ''He died in my arms,'' said Domingas de Jesus, whose teen-age
son was shot by Indonesian forces a few weeks before international
peacekeepers restored order.
</P>
<P>
   While most ordinary people are thankful for an end to Indonesian
rule, many independence fighters have found it hard to adjust. Some
units have not disbanded in case they are needed to counter militia
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment is running at about 70 percent. Locals rely on U.N.
handouts and some resent the comparatively high living standards of
U.N. officials and aid workers.
</P>
<P>
   Restaurants and cafes have opened for free-spending foreigners
while most East Timorese struggle to survive. Some are subsistence
farmers. Others pack Dili's ramshackle market to sell anything from
counterfeit jeans to statues of the Virgin Mary.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations admits there are problems, but says it is
drafting an economic blueprint for East Timor based on coffee
exports and offshore oil and natural gas. Its pristine beaches,
soaring mountains and blend of Portuguese and indigenous cultures
also have tourism potential.
</P>
<P>
   Elections are slated for the end of 2001, and until then,
''there is much left to be accomplished,'' said U.N. chief Vieira
de Mello. ''But East Timor is irrevocably on the path to full
independence.''

<HEADLINE> Man gets 40 years in stabbing deaths of two teens  </HEADLINE>
By DAVE COLLINS
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Addressing the man who plunged an 8-inch
knife into her son's chest, Elizabeth Potkaj held a picture of the
slain teen and tried to convey in court the pain that devastated
her and her family.
</P>
<P>
   ''Look at his face,'' Potkaj said Monday, as tears ran down her
face. ''Look at the pain you have caused his mother. You put him in
the ground and I will never see him again. You did this to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Potkaj's comments, a Hartford Superior Court judge
sentenced 28-year-old Joseph Pranckus III to the maximum 40 years
in prison for stabbing to death 16-year-old Paul Potkaj and
18-year-old Bryan Judd, both of East Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   A jury convicted Pranckus last month of two counts of
first-degree manslaughter. The jury rejected a capital felony
charge, which carries a potential death penalty, and murder
charges, before convicting Pranckus of manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said Pranckus stabbed the youths during a Fourth of
July party at a Glastonbury home in 1998. Police said there was
beer and marijuana at the party.
</P>
<P>
   Pranckus maintained that he was forced to defend himself when
Potkaj, Judd and other youths confronted him as he was trying put
an end to the party. Pranckus suffered a broken eye socket and a
concussion during the fight.
</P>
<P>
   ''I certainly, certainly wasn't thinking about hurting
anybody,'' Pranckus told the judge. ''It was done out of fear. When
you're backed into a corner and you have four people who keep
coming after you ... I can't describe the fear that I felt. There
was no time to think. There was time to react.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I am deeply sorry,'' Pranckus said. ''I should have called the
cops. I should have had everybody arrested.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge William L. Wollenberg said he based the sentence on a
report by the Department of Adult Probation, which conducted an
investigation for sentencing purposes after Pranckus was convicted.
</P>
<P>
   ''Joseph Pranckus' aggressive behavior needlessly took the lives
of two young individuals,'' the report read. ''A lengthy period of
incarceration is appropriate and recommended.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior Assistant State's Attorney Dennis O'Connor used that
passage from the report in his remarks to the judge.
</P>
<P>
   ''All he had to do was to think before he picked up that
knife,'' O'Connor said. ''But instead he picked up that 8-inch
knife ... and he plunged it into literally the hearts of two
teen-agers.''
</P>
<P>
   The victims' families told the judge they were disappointed with
the jury's verdict, and described how the killings hurt them.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Judd Sr., Bryan Judd's grandfather, read a letter from
Bryan's sister, Shannon.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's not too many days that go by that I don't cry,''
Shannon wrote. ''I cry for the loss of my brother and how much I
miss him. I cry for all the things he never got to do and
experience. This pain never leaves. It's an emptiness. It's an ache
that never subsides.''
</P>
<P>
   John Potkaj, Paul Potkaj's father, described the pain of losing
a child.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no greater joy than the one of a child being born,''
John Potkaj said. ''Now all the joy and the happiness have been
taken away from us. This did not have to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Public Defender Kevin Barrs said Pranckus had a
difficult childhood in which he lived in several foster homes.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the party, Pranckus was the father of a newborn
and was thinking about joining the National Guard, he said. He also
planned on learning to drive tractor trailers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't want my daughter growing up questioning where I
was,'' Pranckus said, referring to his experience with his own
parents. ''I wanted to her grow up having great pride and respect
for who her father was.''

<HEADLINE> Pataki panel makes recommendations on college dorm fire safety  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - All college dormitories in New York state
should undergo fire inspections at least once a year, recommends a
panel appointed by Gov. George Pataki after three college students
in New Jersey died in a dorm fire.
</P>
<P>
   The Task Force on Campus Fire Safety said the state should
rescind the exemptions to fire inspections now given to colleges in
New York City, Buffalo, Yonkers, Rochester, Syracuse and Albany.
The inspections should all be carried out by the state's Office of
Fire Prevention and Control.
</P>
<P>
   The panel was formed following the Jan. 19 fire at Seton Hall
University in New Jersey and chaired by New York Secretary of State
Alexander Treadwell. The heads of the State University and City
University of New York systems were on the task force, as was the
president of the Commission on Independent Colleges and
Universities.
</P>
<P>
   The task force also recommended:
</P>
<P>
   -Developing guidelines for training campus personnel and
students about preventing fires and how to respond when there is a
fire. Colleges are encouraged to show campus fire safety training
videos to all new students.
</P>
<P>
   -Toughening penal statutes to make tampering with fire detection
equipment or fire alarms a crime.
</P>
<P>
   -Requiring that sprinklers be installed in any new dormitories
or those buildings being ''significantly rehabilitated.''
</P>
<P>
   That last point is the biggest source of controversy in the
dormitory safety debate. While few people argue that sprinkler
systems are not the best way to fight dormitory fires, college
administrators say they simply don't have enough money to meet an
immediate state mandate for existing dormitory buildings to be
retrofitted with the devices.
</P>
<P>
   State Assemblyman Edward Sullivan, a Manhattan Democrat who
chairs his chamber's higher education committee, said it would cost
in the ''hundreds of millions of dollars'' to put sprinklers in all
existing dormitories at the more than 200 public and private
colleges in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are talking about big bucks here,'' said Sullivan, who
introduced a bill in the Assembly earlier this year requiring the
retrofitting of sprinkler systems in all dorms. It did not include
an appropriation of state money and did not pass.
</P>
<P>
   Realistically - and out of fairness - Sullivan said the state
would probably have to provide some aid to private colleges if it
requires that sprinklers be installed at both private and public
schools in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan said he is writing state Assembly Speaker Sheldon
Silver to ask him to make dormitory sprinklers a priority for
receiving a significant state allocation in the 2001-02 state
budget.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Sullivan said it is important to identify the
dormitory buildings on all campuses which are candidates for
sprinkler retrofittings and make certain those buildings have the
best, and most tamper-resistant, fire alarms and fire detection
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you're 21, when I was 21, you do a lot of dumb things,''
Sullivan said. ''We have to have some method (of stopping alarm
tampering) and just increasing penalties is not going to do it.
There has to be some fire alarms that cannot be deactivated, or
which sound an alarm when they are deactivated.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Trent, a spokesman for the Department of State, said a
news release detailing the report's findings was distributed and
posted on the department's Web site Friday. The fire safety report
itself was posted on the Web site Monday.

<HEADLINE> Americans Warned on Lebanon Travel  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department cautioned Americans
Monday that travel to Lebanon was risky and that U.S. officials may
not be able to help them if they run into trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Special care was recommended for travel in the southern suburbs
of Beirut and the Bekaa Valley. The Lebanese government does not
control Palestinian camps and they should be avoided, the travel
warning said.
</P>
<P>
   Americans are rarely targeted in Lebanon, but groups that
attacked Americans in the past are still in the country and are
still powerful, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials restrict their own travel because of security
problems. That, combined with limited staffing, may prevent the
U.S. Embassy from helping Americans in trouble, the department
said.

<HEADLINE> Finnish Kosovo Troops Head to Sauna  </HEADLINE>
By MERITA DHIMGJOKA
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIPLJAN, Yugoslavia (AP) -- After a day of patrolling, clearing
mines, or even being shot at, the troops of the Finnish Battalion
in Kosovo's peacekeeping force like to unwind -- in the sauna.
</P>
<P>
   It's not as if Kosovo hasn't had enough scorching days this
summer. Temperatures have topped 100 degrees several times.
</P>
<P>
   But for many Finns, saunas are stress-busters, anytime.
</P>
<P>
   ''If sauna or alcohol cannot help you with your problem, then
you have got a serious problem,'' said Maj. Teuvo Tikkanen, as he
briefed visiting reporters on the value of a good sauna. The
briefing was held outside one of 20 that were built especially for
about 800 Finnish soldiers in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   When they first arrived last August as part of the NATO-led
peacekeeping force, the soldiers set their priorities. Before they
built barracks, they erected saunas, with pine from Finland.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a form of social communication,'' said Col. Matti
Ponteva, medical director of mental health for the Finnish troops.
</P>
<P>
   ''If something critical happens during the day and you want to
discuss it with your friends, a sauna is the place to do it,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the soldiers are proud of their ''saunamania.'' Finland
boasts about 2 million saunas for its 5.1 million people.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the heat, many soldiers go to the sauna twice a day.
After that comes the next stage of the ritual -- drinking beer or
water in the small pools outside the saunas.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is normal that I will meet someone naked before I see that
person in uniform,'' said Eeva Sovnarvi, a veterinary officer, as
she sipped water before re-entering the steam room.
</P>
<P>
   While Finns say the sauna has little to do with sex, they bowed
to Kosovo's more conservative attitudes and built separate
facilities for men and women.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's so hot in there that sexual fantasies are impossible,''
Ponteva said.
</P>
<P>
   An ethnic Albanian interpreter blushed and turned away when she
was asked what she thought of the idea of sharing a bench with
others in a sauna.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's Muslim culture here, and it's difficult,'' said Sgt.
Markku Mikkonen. ''But I am getting permission for a Serb
interpreter to go to the sauna, since she said she would like to
try it once.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the therapeutic value of the daily sauna, the Finns say,
it tells others in Kosovo something about who they are.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be nice if troops from different nations brought a
piece of their country to Kosovo, just like us,'' Tikkanen said,
joking. ''The Spanish troops could organize bull fights.''

<HEADLINE> Building projects in southwestern NJ on hold due to water threat  </HEADLINE>
By BRENDAN SCHURR
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOUNT LAUREL, N.J. (AP) - For decades, while the rest of New
Jersey was experiencing unprecedented growth, the farmland and
fields at the state's southwestern corner were largely forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Those days are over. Woods and peach orchards in Salem and
Gloucester counties are being converted into malls and housing
developments. But building plans apparently have outpaced what the
state projected, and officials aren't sure there will be enough
water to support the growth.
</P>
<P>
   The state Department of Environmental Protection has halted
issuing water permits for new homes in Gloucester and Salem
counties. Officials are waiting for the results of a study by the
U.S. Geological Survey on how new development will affect the
state's water supply. Those results are expected next month.
</P>
<P>
   Builders say the moratorium on permits is a rash solution to a
problem that never should have occurred. But the state and the U.S.
Geological Survey say they're trying to prevent a problem before
it's too late.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you look at the state as a whole, the state has adequate
water to meet future needs,'' Eric Evenson, district chief of the
Geologic Survey in New Jersey, said Monday, ''but there are
particular areas in the state where water is in short supply, given
future demand.''
</P>
<P>
   The Potomac Raritan Magothy aquifer supplies 75 percent of the
state's drinking water. It runs underground in a swath that crosses
New Jersey from Middlesex and Monmouth counties at the northeast
through Mercer, Burlington, Camden, Gloucester and Salem counties.
The aquifer continues into Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Evenson compares it to a seven-layer cake. Some of the layers
are made of sand and gravel, which let water flow through, and
others are made of clay, which confine the water.
</P>
<P>
   Pumping out too much of the water in the aquifer can draw salt
water up into shallower wells or cause streams to dry up. The
Department of Environmental Protection is trying to ensure that the
additional development would not cause such problems, Evenson said.
</P>
<P>
   In its study, the U.S. Geological Survey is using computer
models to project what effect increased demand for water would have
on the aquifer.
</P>
<P>
   ''The computer can look at the aquifer in three dimensions. It
divides it up into little boxes and there are calculations that
talk about how much water can be transferred from one box into the
next,'' Evenson said.
</P>
<P>
   They expect to give their results to the Department of
Environmental Protection next month, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the 22-square-mile farming community of Woolwich Township,
about 15 miles southwest of Philadelphia, plans approved in 1997
called for 4,500 homes, a school and a town center to be built in a
project called Weatherby. The development alone would house
thousands more than the entire township population of 2,700 today.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Environmental Protection in March rescinded
water permits for the first 500 homes. The state has since granted
some water permits, which are required before building permits can
be issued.
</P>
<P>
   Permits also have been withheld for housing developments in
Harrison and Logan townships in Gloucester County and an industrial
park in Pedricktown, Salem County.
</P>
<P>
   Woolwich Township Construction Code Official James Sabetta said
Monday that he can issue only about a dozen more building permits
before he reaches the limit of 256 imposed by the Department of
Environmental Protection.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Wittenberg, director of environmental affairs at the New
Jersey Builders Association, wonders why the moratorium was
necessary in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   The area in question is designated for growth in the proposed
state master plan, which is expected to be adopted later this year
by the State Planning Commission. The plan identifies places where
building should take place and others that should be left
undeveloped.
</P>
<P>
   ''Either the state plan is wrong and somebody should stand up
and say that, or DEP should get out of the way and let development
go where it says it should go,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Evenson, too, said that according to the state's water supply
master plan, which calculates anticipated water demand through
2040, the area in question was not expected to have a deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't believe the demand for water was projected at the
level that applications for permits (have reached),'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the Department of Environmental Protection
did not return several calls requesting comment Monday. Robert
Oberthaler, director of the department's Bureau of Water
Allocation, told The Philadelphia Inquirer last week that the
department was inundated with requests for water permits from rural
areas where they never expected population growth.
</P>
<P>
   He said the new users could threaten the lower portion of the
Potomac Raritan Magothy aquifer.
</P>
<P>
   Wittenberg said builders already have lost a lot of time and
money because of the moratorium.
</P>
<P>
   ''Builders carry this land, they pay taxes on this land, they
have financing on the land,'' she said. ''All these things come
into play.''

<HEADLINE> Tibetan nationals protest exclusion of Dalai Lama at U.N. Peace Summit </HEADLINE>
By LUKAS I. ALPERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - The exclusion of the Dalai Lama from the United
Nations for the Millennium World Peace Summit gathering of
religious leaders brought angry, yet saddened protesters on Monday
to a plaza across from the organization's headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The group of about 150 Tibetan exiles, monks, and Free Tibet
activists gathered at the park to offer rebukes to the United
Nations, for what they believed to be the organization's caving
into Chinese pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Holding up signs reading ''Peace Summit Without Substance'' and
''UN: Assert Yourself,'' the crowd stood in quiet protest,
listening to monks offer prayer.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you hear the words peace and religion in the same
sentence the Dalai Lama must immediately come to mind,'' said
Yangdon Tsering, a Tibetan exile who lives in New Jersey. ''To not
invite him is totally incongruous with what they were trying to do
here.''
</P>
<P>
   The summit, which runs Monday through Thursday, is hoped to
result in resolutions on peace, poverty and the environment, as
well as the formation of a permanent council of religious leaders
to advise the United Nations on preventing and settling disputes.
</P>
<P>
   The first two days of the summit were scheduled to be held at
the United Nations with the last two at the Waldorf-Astoria.
</P>
<P>
   Working on the advice of a U.N. official, conference organizers
did not invite the Dalai Lama to the first two days of the
conference for fear of offending China.
</P>
<P>
   The Dalai Lama is the spiritual leader of Tibet, a region that
was annexed by China in 1949. He fled China with thousands of
followers in 1959 and has run a government in exile in Dharamsala
ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers offered the Tibetan Buddhist leader and a Nobel Peace
Prize winner an invitation to the last two days of the conference,
but he declined.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday evening it was announced that an eight-person
delegation of Tibetan Buddhist leaders had been sent by the Dalai
Lama, two of whom would be speaking in the General Assembly hall
with the understanding that their speech will not be political.
</P>
<P>
   But that did little to placate the protesters who turned their
anger on the U.N.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems that the U.N. has decided to side with the stronger
power here. They should be looking at all sides of this and make it
the goal to try harder to listen and understand the weaker side. I
thought that this was their mandate. I must have been wrong,'' said
Geshe Kelsang Monlam, a Tibetan monk, who has lived in Philadelphia
for the past 18 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''The U.N. is afraid of the Chinese delegation,'' scoffed Tseten
Namdol, a Tibetan exile who moved to New York from India two years
ago. ''If they back down to them here, how can they say they
believe in human rights.''

<HEADLINE> Grounded US Aircraft Spurs Questions  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The decision to ground temporarily hundreds of
Marine Corps aircraft, including the aging workhorse CH-53E Super
Stallion helicopter fleet and the new MV-22 Osprey, raises tough
questions about the condition and direction of Marine Corps
aviation, defense analysts said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The groundings announced by the Marines on Sunday affected 413
aircraft, and are in addition to the 76 Harrier fighter jets that
have yet to return to operation following a July 11 grounding,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Late Monday, the Marines announced that all but 10 of 198 AH-1W
Cobra attack helicopters affected by the grounding had been
returned to flight. The ones that remain out of operation will have
their rotor blades replaced and then cleared for returned to
service, spokesman Maj. Pat Gibbons said.
</P>
<P>
   Gibbons said it was unclear when the rest of the aircraft will
be back in operation.
</P>
<P>
   It is highly unusual for the Marines to have such a wide variety
of aircraft taken out of operation, albeit for unrelated reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ''Is it coincidence?'' asked Andrew Krepinevich, executive
director of the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments.
''Or are these little red flags popping up that might indicate that
Marine Corps aviation is moving toward the ragged edge of
readiness?''
</P>
<P>
   Loren Thompson, a defense analyst at the private Lexington
Institute, said it is no coincidence that the Marines are
encountering mechanical problems with the Super Stallion, which
entered service in 1981 and the AH-1W Cobra attack helicopters,
which are of a similar vintage and are derived from 1960s
technology.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're just too old,'' Thompson said. He said those aircraft
are in ''an advanced state of decrepitude.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no debate that they've got to replace these aging
aircraft before they kill more Marines,'' Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   This setback for the Marines comes amid heated debate in the
presidential campaign over whether the military has been spread too
thin and starved of resources during the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen insists the military is more
capable today than at any time in American history, while Dick
Cheney, who served as defense secretary during the Bush
administration and is now the Republican vice presidential nominee,
asserted Sunday that ''the military is in trouble today'' -- not
just in keeping ready for combat but also in retaining troops and
finding sufficient numbers of recruits.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Trainor, a retired Marine Corps brigadier general, said
in an interview Monday that it is too early to assume that Marine
Corps aviation is in trouble. ''I'd be more inclined to say it's a
coincidence,'' that three types of aircraft were grounded on the
same day, Trainor said.
</P>
<P>
   The Marines are not alone in facing aviation challenges. The
Army disclosed in April that 40 percent of its helicopters could
not be counted on to perform their wartime missions, and it cited a
''dramatic decline'' in Army aviator experience and skill over the
past decade.
</P>
<P>
   The Marine Corps said the latest groundings are unlikely to have
a major impact on deployed forces, since only eight of the 198
Cobra helicopters and eight of the 165 Super Stallions are
currently deployed abroad. None of the 11 new Osprey aircraft are
part of the regular Marine aviation fleet, since they just
completed an evaluation period and a decision to enter full-rate
production has not yet been made.
</P>
<P>
   The most significant grounding, the Marines said in their
announcement Sunday, is the CH-53E Super Stallion, which is a
heavy-lift helicopter used mainly move supplies. It also has a role
as troop transport.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to ground all 165 Super Stallions was based on the
preliminary findings of an investigation into the cause of an Aug.
10 crash of a Navy MH-53E mine-sweeping helicopter, which is a
variant of the Marine's Super Stallion. The Navy crash, off the
coast of Corpus Christi, killed four of the six-man crew.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy said Monday that it is grounding all 40 of its MH-53E
helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   The Marines are pursuing a program of aviation modernization
that includes development of a ''Z'' variant of the Cobra attack
helicopter and a ''Y'' variant of the Huey utility helicopter. It
is developing the MV-22 Osprey to replace the aging fleet of CH-46
troop transport helicopters as well as Super Stallions.
</P>
<P>
   It also is banking on the Joint Strike Fighter, a new warplane
intended for use by the Air Force, the Navy and the Marines, to
replace the AV-8B Harrier, a short take-off and vertical landing
jet that is wearing out. The Joint Strike Fighter -- not yet in
production -- is projected to enter the force in 2010.

<HEADLINE> Koreas Eye Return of POWs, Abductees  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- The return of hundreds of South
Koreans believed to be living in North Korea against their will is
among topics to be discussed during high-level talks in Pyongyang
this week, officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A five-member government delegation led by Unification Minister
Park Jae-kyu was to leave for Pyongyang Tuesday for three days of
talks.
</P>
<P>
   Seoul officials say tens of thousands of South Korean prisoners
of war never returned home after the 1950-1953 Korean War. Citing
defectors, they say about 300 of them are still believed held in
the North.
</P>
<P>
   The Seoul government also says North Korea has abducted 3,756
South Koreans since the end of the war. All but 454 of them --
mostly fishermen -- were sent back to the South.
</P>
<P>
   Pyongyang denies the allegations, calling them part of a smear
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The Pyongyang talks are a continuation of the July 29-31
meetings in Seoul. They are to discuss implementation of agreements
made at a historic inter-Korean summit in June, when the leaders of
the two Koreas pledged to seek the eventual reunification of the
divided peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   The Koreas were divided into the communist North and the
pro-Western South at the end of World War II in 1945. The Korean
War ended with an armistice -- not a peace treaty -- and their border
remains the world's most heavily fortified.

<HEADLINE> Heart Drug Proves Disappointing  </HEADLINE>
By EMMA ROSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- A clot-blocking drug that doctors
thought would help stabilize people immediately after a near-heart
attack and reduce their chances of dying or having a heart attack
is a disappointment, new research shows.
</P>
<P>
   The drug, abciximab, which inhibits sticky blood cells from
clumping together, saves lives when heart patients undergo invasive
artery-widening treatments such as angioplasty by making such
operations safer and more effective.
</P>
<P>
   The results have been so impressive that scientists expected it
also would improve the outcome in patients who did not undergo
surgery. But it made no difference at all.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was a big shock,'' said Dr. Frans Van de Werf, chairman
of cardiology at Belgium's Catholic University, who was not
connected with the research. ''Nobody understands why.''
</P>
<P>
   The findings were presented Monday at a conference of the
European Society of Cardiology.
</P>
<P>
   In the international study of 7,800 heart patients who came to
hospitals with severe chest pain linked to a near-heart attack, all
the patients immediately got aspirin -- a mild clot preventer -- and
one of two version of the blood thinner heparin, which is a
standard treatment for that condition.
</P>
<P>
   Such patients have a high risk of having an actual heart attack
because, although their artery blockages have not completely shut
down blood flow, they hover on the verge of doing so, opening and
closing, then opening again.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the aspirin and blood thinner, half the patients
got an intravenous infusion of abciximab for 24 or 48 hours and
half got a fake drug.
</P>
<P>
   The study aimed to test whether adding abciximab reduced the
chances they would have a heart attack or die within the first
month.
</P>
<P>
   Eight percent of those who did not receive abciximab had a heart
attack or died within the month, compared with 8.2 percent of those
on the 24-hour infusion and 9.6 percent of those on the 48-hour
drip.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not an indication of benefit to these patients,'' said Dr.
Maarten Simoons, one of the study's leaders and a professor of
medicine at Erasmus University Hospital in Rotterdam, Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Also, about the same proportion in each group -- about 2 percent
-- needed to have their arteries unblocked during that time.
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists had hoped the drug could spare patients surgery
or angioplasty.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many of us were convinced that this would work. All the data
have pointed in the same direction,'' Simoons said.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible the study did not find a benefit of abciximab
because it was not large enough to show a difference or because
using the drug for a such a long time is not a good idea, Simoons
said. Abciximab is usually given for 12 hours before and during
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Farkouh, a professor at Mount Sinai School of
Medicine in New York, said the assumption it would help heart
patients who were not having an artery operation within hours was a
fair one. But he added that the results of the study were, in a
way, not altogether surprising.
</P>
<P>
   ''We knew all along that these drugs were best for patients
undergoing intervention,'' he said. ''That's where all the evidence
was.''

<HEADLINE> An analysis of Lazio ad stressing his legislative work  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   An analysis of the new Rick Lazio ad in which the
Republican
Senate candidate's campaign responds to claims made in ads by his
Democratic opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton:
<TEXT>
<P>
   TITLE: ''Positive.''
</P>
<P>
   LENGTH: 30 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCER: Murphy Pintak Gautier Hudome Agency.
</P>
<P>
   AIRING: Statewide starting Monday.
</P>
<P>
   SCRIPT: (Read by a male announcer) ''Compare: Congressman Rick
Lazio is running a positive campaign about his accomplishments for
New York. Hillary Clinton is running a negative campaign because
she's done nothing for New York.
</P>
<P>
   Her new ad contains five gross distortions in just 30 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Lazio has voted to support Medicare and for prescription
drugs. Look it up - it's all there in the Congressional Record.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton - you just can't trust her.''
</P>
<P>
   IMAGES: Lazio and Clinton appear at top of screen, with their
corresponding commercials running underneath them. Underneath the
Lazio commercial, a blue graphic says ''Positive,'' while Clinton's
appears in a red graphic ''Negative.''
</P>
<P>
   A graphic reading ''Five gross distortions in 30 seconds''
appears over the Clinton commercial, on the right of the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Then, a Lazio graphic appears, with the words, ''Support
Medicare'' (HR 3075 and H Con. Res. 84-6/5/97) and ''For
Prescription Drugs'' (HR 4680-6/28/00) written underneath, and a
graphic of a Congressional Record's letterhead.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial ends with white letters on a black screen:
Hillary Clinton. You Just Can't Trust Her.
</P>
<P>
   ANALYSIS: Lazio media guru Michael Murphy said the commercial is
intended to counter the Clinton campaign's advertising. ''It's time
to hit back and hit back hard,'' Murphy said in announcing ''a
large media buy.''
</P>
<P>
   The ad, like a number of commercials from both sides in the
campaign so far, relies on the viewer to dissect the votes Lazio
has taken during his eight years in Congress. In many cases, Lazio
has voted in favor of Republican versions of legislation, but the
Clinton campaign cites his votes against Democratic proposals.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON RESPONSE: ''The Lazio campaign has taken hypocrisy to a
new level - they are running a negative ad and calling it
''positive.'' Once again, Rick Lazio is trying to mislead New
Yorkers about his record - he says he's a moderate but was deputy
to (House Speaker Newt) Gingrich, voted to cut Medicare funding,
and said his tax plan cost $776 billion while the Daily News and
Newsday say it really costs well over $1 trillion. This ad should
come with a consumer warning: New Yorkers can't trust what Rick
Lazio says,'' said Clinton spokeswoman Cathie Levine.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Criticizes Cuba Migrant Policy  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright accused
Cuba on Monday of arbitrarily denying exit permits to Cubans with
U.S. visas, thereby separating families and forcing would-be
immigrants to attempt high-risk escapes by boat.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Albright said Cuba's actions violated agreements
with the United States, international standards and ''fundamental
human decency.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she ordered a formal protest lodged with Cuba's
diplomatic office in Washington. ''The government of Cuba is
increasingly obstructing the safe, legal and orderly migration of
individuals from Cuba,'' Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   Disclosure of the diplomatic note, containing U.S. charges of
inhumane behavior, follows a protracted and touchy U.S. dispute
with Cuban Americans over 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   The boy was spirited from Cuba by his mother, who died at sea,
and taken home by his father after a lengthy legal battle with
emigre relatives in Florida. The Cuban government cited the
incident in June when it indefinitely suspended immigration
negotiations with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Elian and his mother, the 117 Cubans cited in the U.S.
complaint had visas to go to the United States but were prevented
from leaving Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   In 16 cases, the denial separated families, while in 17 cases,
physicians and other professionals were blocked from leaving, said
Philip Reeker, a State Department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomatic note alleged that Cuba had not abided by a 1994
agreement seeking to establish ground rules for the orderly
migration of 20,000 Cubans plus family members to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Cuban government has consistently failed to take effective
action in response to our continuing and legitimate humanitarian
concerns,'' the note said.
</P>
<P>
   The note was handed to Fernando Remirez, chief of the Cuban
diplomatic mission in Washington, and also was delivered to the
Cuban foreign ministry in Havana. A copy was made available to The
Associated Press. The complaint's substance and some details were
later released by Reeker.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban mission offered no immediate reaction to the specific
accusation.
</P>
<P>
   However, spokesman Roberto Garcia criticized U.S. policy as
criminal, immoral and discriminatory, saying the United States was
responsible for deaths at sea because it encouraged Cubans to try
to reach U.S. shores, knowing they would be warmly received.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most people who come here know once they reach American soil
they will be granted benefits other immigrants don't get,'' Garcia
said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. note said 117 Cubans from 57 families had been denied
exit permits by the Cuban government in a recent 75-day period. The
United States had granted all of them visas.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think that they need to issue exit permits to all those
individuals who have valid U.S.-entry documents,'' Reeker said.
''And at various times we've offered specific instances to them, as
we have again today, where families were separated by their
policies.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior State Department official said Coast Guard personnel
recently have picked up an increasing number of fleeing Cubans who
have U.S. travel documents. Established procedures require that
Cubans intercepted by the Coast Guard be returned to the island.
</P>
<P>
   The note said the recent death of two fleeing Cuban brothers
''highlights the growing propensity of Cubans denied the means to
migrate in a safe, orderly and legal fashion to risk their lives in
desperate sea voyages.'' The brothers were victims of a shark
attack in the Florida Straits.
</P>
<P>
   According to the note, exit permits routinely are denied family
members of Cubans who defect to the United States. ''The Cuban
government is punishing entire families, including small children,
for the action of one family member,'' the note said.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, officials said, Cuba generally had been living
up to terms of the agreement but, as the diplomatic note suggests,
that assessment has changed radically.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba has long been a target of both Republicans and Democrats in
election years. For example, economic sanctions against Cuba were
tightened in the presidential election years of 1992 and 1996.

<HEADLINE> SUNY trustees approve New Covenant's revised charter  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The State University of New York Board of
Trustees Monday approved New Covenant Charter School's amended
charter, allowing it to open after Labor Day under a new management
company.
</P>
<P>
   The charter school in Albany was also immediately put on
probation and required to adhere to a remedial action plan to be
set by SUNY's Charter School Institute.
</P>
<P>
   The charter approval from SUNY trustees came about two weeks
after New Covenant submitted its revised charter, calling for the
switch from its former management company, Boston-based Advantage
Schools, Inc., to Edison Schools, Inc., headquartered in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bellafiore, executive director of the Charter School
Institute, said putting New Covenant on probation was the
''strongest sanction short of (charter) revocation.''
</P>
<P>
   The probation action was also necessary to ensure that the
school will open on Sept. 7 without final approval of the charter
amendment, Bellafiore said. The charter now goes to the state Board
of Regents, which can comment or make suggestions on the charter
but does not have veto power over the license.
</P>
<P>
   New Covenant, which opened as the largest of New York's first
three charter schools last fall, saw its first school year plagued
by academic, disciplinary and managerial problems. A promise in the
original charter to build a permanent facility by February this
year wasn't fulfilled and students are still housed in temporary
modular classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   These troubles were underscored in critical reports released by
the Charter School Institute and the state Board of Education this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many, if not most, charter schools have bumpy first years. New
Covenant's was bumpier, if not more than most,'' Bellafiore said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the remedial action plan, enrollment will be capped at 400
students, fewer than the original target of 424. The school will
not be allowed to fill any vacancies for as long as the school is
operating in its temporary classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   The plan also calls for mandatory training sessions for New
Covenant's Board of Trustees, submission of monthly financial
reports and mid-year and year-end formal reviews.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Charter School Institute will appoint a third
party to monitor the financing and construction of a new school
building. Edison has promised to build a $10 million facility to
house up to 800 students in grades kindergarten through eight. The
new building, which will include a community center, a swimming
pool and a gym, is expected to be completed by fall 2001, Edison
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Bellafiore said the remedial action plan will serve ''not as a
punishment, but as a tool for accountability,'' Bellafiore said.
Failure to comply with any part of the plan could mean immediate
revocation of New Covenant's charter, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The school is taking the steps it needs to straighten itself
out,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Cox, co-chairman of SUNY's Committee on Charter Schools,
said the appointment of Eleanor Bartlett, a former Regent, as New
Covenant's new director gave him ''great confidence in this school
going forward and making this a success.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett, who has previously served as assistant superintendent
in the Albany City School District, said she was ''excited and a
little afraid'' with the task ahead of her.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know we've had problems, but we're moving forward. If we go
with the children, we can't go wrong,'' Bartlett said. ''I know we
can turn this school around ... I'm staking my career on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Charter schools are taxpayer-funded but operate with an
independent charter that spells out the school's mission. They are
offered as alternatives to parents dissatisfied with traditional
public school education.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Drops Warrant vs. Preacher  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- A Turkish court on Monday withdrew an
arrest warrant for an Islamic preacher prosecutors say leads a
group trying to overthrow Turkey's secular regime.
</P>
<P>
   Fethullah Gulen, who is believed to live in the United States,
is now free to return to Turkey if he wishes to. However, his
lawyer, Orhan Erdemli, said he would not come back because he is in
poor health.
</P>
<P>
   Gulen, 62, reportedly left Turkey last year for the United
States to seek medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Erdemli said prosecutors will continue to investigate charges
that Gulen was leading a criminal group and inciting religious
hatred. Gulen faces a maximum 15-year prison sentence if found
guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Secularism is rigorously enforced in Turkey and Turkey's
government, backed by the powerful military, has launched a
crackdown against political Islam.
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled Monday that there were no grounds for the arrest
warrant while the investigation was ongoing.
</P>
<P>
   Gulen has a large following among Turks, who regard him as a
moderate Islamic figure who preaches tolerance.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Turkish television stations aired a videotape in
which Gulen appeared to be urging his followers to keep a low
profile before attempting an uprising. It was not clear how the
tape was released to television stations.
</P>
<P>
   Gulen runs scores of religious schools in Turkey and Central
Asia.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Up 60; Nasdaq Up 28  </HEADLINE>
By DUNSTAN PRIAL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks moved higher Monday, a possible sign that
investors are more confident about the future direction of stock
prices following several days of indecision.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 60.21 at 11,252.84,
after rising more than 120 points earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators also advanced.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index gained 27.91 to 4,070.59 and is now
up slightly for the year, marking the first time the technology
heavy index has been in positive territory since early spring. The
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index rose 7.64 to 1,514.09.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks had fluctuated last week, while mostly moving higher, as
investors began to recognize that interest rate hikes no longer
seem to be a factor in trading.
</P>
<P>
   ''Investors have been extremely lackadaisical in the past few
sessions,'' said Don Hays, president of Hays Advisory Group in
Nashville, Tenn. But, he said, ''people seem comfortable that there
won't be any more interest rate hikes.''
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks were up across the board Monday on the belief
that stable interest rates will encourage borrowing and improve the
lucrative business of underwriting stocks and bonds. J.P. Morgan
gained $1.125 to $145.125, and Citigroup rose $1.92 to $58.875.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the recent move upward has lacked conviction, in part,
because energy prices remain high and labor markets tight -- both
factors that could contribute to a rise in inflation. In addition,
companies in several industrial sectors have warned that profits
may be down in the second half of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   These dynamics could pose obstacles as the markets try to
reclaim their highs of early spring.
</P>
<P>
   Hays noted that trading volume on Friday was at its lowest level
of the year and remained low Monday. Moreover, he noted that stocks
were being propelled on Monday on the strength of a handful of
stocks in a small number of sectors, something known as a lack of
breadth in the market.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the market has been sector-driven for several weeks,
meaning that investors are essentially rotating money in and out of
industries that are rising or falling based on short-term trading
trends.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow was led on Monday by widely held stocks such as IBM, up
$1.563 to $130.563, and EMC Corp., up $4 to $95.50.
</P>
<P>
   The same pattern held true on the Nasdaq, where well known
technology stocks led the way. Intel rose 93.75 cents to $73.875,
Cisco Systems gained 56.25 cents to $66.06, and Dell Computer was
up 87.50 cents at $39.50.
</P>
<P>
   Internet stocks, which have been out of favor since the spring,
moved back into the spotlight, helping to lift the Nasdaq. Search
engine company Lycos rose $1.625 to $67.438.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo!, however, a star last week, was hit hard after analysts
warned that the Internet portal's revenues may fall as Internet
advertising slows later in the year. Yahoo!'s shares fell $12.188
to $122.063.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners 5-to-4 on the New York
Stock Exchange, where composite volume came to 908.12 million
shares, up from Friday's pace of 844.06 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 1.37 at 526.48.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 1.60 percent.
Germany's DAX index was up 0.44 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was up
0.10 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 0.30 percent.

<HEADLINE> Two killed when motorcycle, emergency vehicle, collide in Brooklyn  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - A father and son were killed when their
motorcycle collided with an emergency vehicle in Brooklyn, and
police were investigating whether the vehicle was properly licensed
to operate as an ambulance.
</P>
<P>
   Alberto Curtis, 37, and his 13-year-old son, Alberto Jr., both
of Brooklyn, were traveling south on Ocean Parkway around 9:20 p.m.
Sunday, when they passed through a green traffic light at Avenue L
and collided with a 1988 Ford Station Wagon that has ambulance
plates, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The station wagon, registered to the Hatzoloh Ambulance Corp., a
private company that serves Jewish residents, had its lights and
sirens on. The driver, Shamai Goldstein, 31, was responding to a
call of a 75-year-old woman with chest pains, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The motorcycle hit the left front portion of the station wagon,
ejecting both riders. Although both wore helmets, they sustained
multiple injuries and were pronounced dead a short time later.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis has a valid motorcycle driver's license registered in
Iowa, but not in New York, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis' 31-year-old nephew and 14-year-old niece - who were on
another motorcycle - witnessed the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Goldstein was treated for minor injuries at
Maimonides Hospital and released.
</P>
<P>
   Police were still investigating Monday. One aspect they are
looking into is whether the station wagon was properly licensed to
operate as an ambulance.

   Safir's trip to Hollywood drew criticism because at the time,
daily protests were being held in front of police headquarters that
called for justice for Amadou Diallo, fatally shot by four police
officers in February 1999 in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   The five-member board completed the report on Aug. 16, but could
not publicly release it without holding a full hearing on the
matter, or unless Safir agreed to the public disclosure. Joan
Salzman, the board's deputy executive director and chief of
enforcement, said Safir agreed to the disclosure Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But in a telephone interview from his Manhattan apartment, Safir
said he signed the disclosure on Aug. 18, his last day as
commissioner, then gave the papers to the Corporation Counsel.
Daniel Connolly, a Corporation Counsel lawyer, said he was unsure
when the board received Safir's disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   Safir denied doing anything wrong, although he is only the
second public official to be rebuked by the board. A Board of
Education spokesman was publicly rebuked in 1996 for working as a
consultant to a private education group that held city contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm vindicated. If I wasn't vindicated, they would have
charged me with something,'' Safir said. ''I don't accept their
rebuke.''
</P>
<P>
   Safir said he has reimbursed Revlon President and Chief
Executive Officer George Fellows for the trip he took from March
20-22, 1999. Salzman confirmed that Safir had repaid Fellows with a
check drawn on his personal account for $7,079.21, dated Jan. 22,
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Safir and his wife, Carol, flew to Los Angeles on a private jet
leased by Revlon, stayed in the Peninsula Beverly Hills Hotel, and
were given tickets to the Oscars - all free of charge. Safir
returned to New York City on March 22 by commercial airline at his
own expense, while his wife returned on the private jet.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Safir's spokeswoman, Marilyn Mode, had said he might not
attend a City Council committee hearing on the Street Crime Unit on
March 22 because of an undisclosed ''scheduling conflict.'' But
under pressure, Safir returned in time for the meeting. The
officers who shot Diallo had been assigned to the Street Crime
Unit.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has defended Safir's trip. Safir has said
repeatedly he did not think he broke any rules because Revlon does
not do business with the city and he was invited on the trip
because Fellows is a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Under city rules, a public servant cannot accept a gift worth
$50 or more from any person or business that the public servant
knows is or intends to become engaged in business with the city.
</P>
<P>
   In its ruling, the board, which is appointed by the mayor and
confirmed by the City Council, said Safir should have found out
first whether Revlon was doing any business with the police
department. Through a corporate affiliate, Revlon uses the NYPD's
''paid detail program,'' paying the department $6,000 over the last
two years for uniformed officers for private security.
</P>
<P>
   Salzman said this was the first time the board had to define the
context of the city's gift rules. She added that even if Safir had
tried to find out if Revlon was doing business with Revlon, it
would have been difficult for him to find such records because all
business dealings were kept manually and stored in the NYPD's paid
detail office.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a sense that it was unfair to charge him, since the
board has never addressed what duty of inquiry a public official
has when offered a high-level gift,'' Salzman said. ''Where the
board faulted him is where he failed to inquire at all - he just
accepted the gift, on the erroneous theory that the donor was a
close, personal friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Rachel Leon, executive director of Common Cause/New York, said
the board's ruling should put other public officials on notice
about accepting gifts. The group has been lobbying for the state
Legislature to prohibit public officials from accepting any gifts.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cops can't take a cup of coffee from anyone, and the law
should be simple and clear like that, meaning no gifts,'' Leon
said.

<HEADLINE> Prosecutor gets two more months to evaluate evidence  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Prosecutors now have two more months to
investigate claims by new eyewitnesses and to assess how that
evidence affects their criminal case against two state troopers who
fired on a van after a traffic stop.
</P>
<P>
   The judge overseeing the case agreed to the state's request for
a delay and postponed his scheduled decision on defense motions to
dismiss the charges.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need more time to continue our investigation and also to
really evaluate what our response is going to be,'' Special Deputy
Attorney General James J. Gerrow said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor's court-ordered deadline was Thursday, a date set
after Gerrow's public disclosure Aug. 1 that two new eyewitnesses
had come forward. In his letter to the judge, Gerrow said the
state's ''efforts to resolve these issues'' continue and remain
''as yet, unresolved''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Gerrow declined to detail what the state would do
between now and the newest deadline of Oct. 26. He also would not
detail how the new evidence changes the state's case against
troopers John Hogan and James Kenna.
</P>
<P>
   ''As all criminal cases are built on building blocks of
evidence, as some change, that change affects the other building
blocks. We really need time to evaluate that,'' Gerrow said.
</P>
<P>
   Hogan and Kenna fired 11 shots into the van, wounding three
passengers in April 1998. They stopped the van with four minority
men inside because they believed the driver had been speeding. Both
troopers have repeatedly claimed they fired in self-defense, saying
they feared the driver of the van was attempting to run them over.
</P>
<P>
   Public outcry after the shooting led to widespread allegations
of racial profiling by state troopers and a severely critical
report by the New Jersey attorney general's office detailing the
practice.
</P>
<P>
   An indictment came after nearly two years of investigation by
the state, including a complete re-enactment of the shooting that
closed part of the turnpike for a time.
</P>
<P>
   A pending motion asks state Superior Court Judge Andrew J.
Smithson to dismiss the indictment due to defense claims that
biased prosecutors led a grand jury to indict the troopers.
</P>
<P>
   Smithson now says that decision will come during a hearing
scheduled for Oct. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers still do not know exactly what the two new
witnesses told the state.
</P>
<P>
   ''It appears to be significant enough,'' defense attorney Jack
Arsenault said.
</P>
<P>
   Arsenault, who represents Kenna, said he initially rejected
Gerrow's attempt to delay the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ''These two new witnesses really seem to corroborate more of
what the troopers said than what they (prosecutors) initially
thought. It's given them much more of a perspective on the case,''
Arsenault said.
</P>
<P>
   Arsenault said it is still unclear if the witnesses version of
the events clear one or both of the troopers. Prosecutors must now
re-examine all the evidence, everything from statements taken that
night to reports from forensic experts, Arsenault said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's enough here that they really have to evaluate their
entire case,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Whitman signs first in a five-bill, $61 million package to preserve land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Gov. Christie Whitman Monday signed the
first of five bills slated to become law this week to pump $61
million into land preservation for parks and wildlife refuges.
</P>
<P>
   ''With the bills I sign this week, we will move tens of
thousands of acres closer to that amount, and that much closer to
our ultimate goal of 1 million this decade,'' Whitman said. ''We
will also build momentum for the kinds of partnerships between
public, private and nonprofit leaders that will help us reach our
goal.''
</P>
<P>
   The package of bills expected to be approved this week follow
two bills she signed Aug. 9 to preserve farmland.
</P>
<P>
   A bill to provide $6.6 million to 15 nonprofit groups was signed
Monday at ceremonies on a wild parcel in Lawrence Township which is
targeted for preservation by the Delaware &AMP; Raritan Greenway. The
property is part of a creek watershed affecting both the Stony
Brook and D&AMP;R Canal waterways, where extensive preservation has
taken place.
</P>
<P>
   The unique aspect of the bill is direct state funding to
nonprofit groups that have proposals to buy land, usually with a
mix of funding sources. In the past, such groups had to acquire
land on their own and seek state or federal funds afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Among the grants is $500,000 for the Tewksbury Land Trust to
preserve land in the governor's hometown, and another $500,000 to a
similar outfit for save land in the neighboring town of
Peapack-Gladstone.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman is scheduled Tuesday to sign a $14 million spending bill
at a farm in Union Township in Hunterdon County, some of it to
expand the land in county and state parks.

<HEADLINE> Department of Interior rejects town leaders' allegations  </HEADLINE>
jffonho
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTH STONINGTON, Conn. (AP) - The Department of Interior will
not investigate claims made by three Connecticut towns that the top
official at the Bureau of Indian Affairs has a conflict of interest
in the federal recognition case of two Indian tribes.
</P>
<P>
   The towns of North Stonington, Ledyard and Preston had asked
that Bureau of Indian Affairs director Kevin Gover be removed from
a decision on whether to grant federal recognition to the Paucatuck
Eastern Pequot and Eastern Pequot tribes. They claim Gover has a
conflict because he once served as an attorney for the Golden Hill
Paugusetts, another Connecticut tribe seeking recognition.
</P>
<P>
   But the federal Office of Inspector General ruled Monday that
the towns have failed to show how Gover's former position resulted
in a conflict. The office also said that by law, the BIA director
must be involved in the process.
</P>
<P>
   ''Moreover, it is premature to consider whether (Gover) acted
improperly in making the federal acknowledgment determination for
the tribe because the Department has not issued a final decision,''
Deputy Inspector General Mary Kendall Adler wrote in an Aug. 23
letter to James Cunha, chief of the Paucatuck Eastern Pequot Indian
Tribal Nation.
</P>
<P>
   Cunha said the BIA's decision ''backs up what we have been
saying about the town leaders and their attorneys.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They are only interested in trying to create delay, discord
and confusion,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   State Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, who has also
requested that Gover step aside, said the Department of Interior
has not responded to his, more detailed claim.
</P>
<P>
   ''This letter is not necessarily the final word on whether there
is a conflict of interest and what should be done about that,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Blumenthal said the point may be moot. Gover has said he
will step down at the end of the Clinton administration. A final
decision on whether to recognize the tribes is not expected until
after a new BIA official takes office.
</P>
<P>
   In a preliminary ruling in March, the BIA said the tribes meet
the criteria for federal recognition, including maintaining a
continuous historical government-to-government relationship with
the state since colonial times.
</P>
<P>
   But Preston First Selectman Robert Congdon said the towns still
have ''several remedies'' available to push for an investigation -
including seeking Congressional support or relief through the
courts.
</P>
<P>
   ''We built a record throughout this process that supports the
claims that we raise on this issue,'' Congdon said Monday. ''The
BIA has done everything that can to stall and delay the towns'
efforts to receive the full and complete record.''

<HEADLINE> MP3.com defends itself as a protector of copyrights  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - The chief executive of MP3.com portrayed himself
and his company as a friend of the music companies as a trial began
Monday to decide if MP3.com willfully violated the copyrights of
record companies.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Robertson said his San Diego-based music storage venture
is a rare Internet music company, forcing people to pay musicians
for their work.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff, who is hearing the civil case
without a jury, earlier this year ruled that MP3.com infringed the
copyrights of the nation's major record companies by offering music
online without permission.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he must determine whether the company purposefully
infringed the copyrights, which increase potential damages, to be
determined at a separate trial later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Since Rakoff's earlier ruling, four of the five major record
companies reached settlements with MP3.com, leaving only Universal
Music Group as a plaintiff. The terms of the settlements with
Warner Music Group, BMG, EMI and Sony Music Entertainment were not
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a lot of chaos on the Internet with digital music,''
Robertson told Rakoff. ''I thought it was important that there be
compensation for the copyright owners.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Why did you care?'' Rakoff asked him.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm trying to grow a long-term business,'' Robertson
responded. ''We thought this was a responsible system that would
grow the music industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson said the company went to great lengths to develop
software that would require customers to prove they already own CDs
before they were permitted to hear their favorite tunes over the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   MP3.com caused a stir in early January when it began the
MyMP3.com listening service, which allows customers to hear CDs
from anywhere once they prove they own them by inserting them into
a computer CD slot.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson proudly demonstrated the service Monday, playing bits
of the Steve Miller band and Stevie Ray Vaughn in a courtroom
darkened so everyone could view a computer screen of MP3.com's Web
site projected like a movie.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, a legal document warning customers that it is
illegal to copy CDs or otherwise infringe on copyrights was flashed
onto the large white screen.
</P>
<P>
   The judge questioned whether many customers actually read the
''boilerplate, five-page, single-space legal agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   If so, Rakoff suggested as he gestured toward the courtroom
windows and the East River and Brooklyn Bridge beyond them,
''there's a bridge right out there that I'd love to sell you.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge then asked Robertson if he truly believed his
customers read the legal agreement warning them not operate the
program illegally.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would have to agree with your honor and, secondly, I don't
want to buy the bridge,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson resumes his testimony Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Sierra Club airing ads in 12 congressional races  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) - The Sierra Club is returning to the airwaves
in seven states with television and radio ads praising a few
Republicans and many more Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The ads, many of which spotlight local environmental issues, are
part of an $8 million campaign to boost candidates that support the
club's environmental agenda and skewer those who don't.
</P>
<P>
   One radio ad praises a Republican and a Democrat - each of whom
represent districts served by stations in the Quad Cities, Iowa,
area. Listeners are asked to thank Reps. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, and
Lane Evans, D-Ill., for supporting higher standards on arsenic in
drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   The ad buy, which is for about two weeks, is costing the Sierra
Club more than $200,000, said Dan Weiss, the group's political
director.
</P>
<P>
   Positive TV ads will air about Democratic Reps. Mark Udall of
Colorado, Joseph Hoeffel of Pennsylvania and Brian Baird of
Washington state. Radio ads will support Republican Sens. Jim
Jeffords of Vermont and William Roth of Delaware, along with
Democratic Reps. Rush Holt of New Jersey and Jay Inslee and Adam
Smith, both of Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   Critical ads are airing against two Republicans, Sen. Slade
Gorton of Washington state and former Virginia Gov. George Allen, a
Senate hopeful. Television ads are airing in both races, with radio
spots also planned for Gorton.

<HEADLINE> 2 Killed in Russian TV Tower Fire  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW KRAMER
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- At least two people, an elevator operator and a
firefighter, were killed when an elevator plunged hundreds of feet
to the ground in a blaze that engulfed Moscow's landmark television
tower, officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The fire, which lasted for 26 hours before being put out Monday,
left the 1,771-foot Ostankino tower a spectacular hulk, much of its
interior scorched or soot-coated and webs of wiring melted.
Concerns rose that the protracted fire's intense heat may have
warped structural elements that could cause parts of the tower to
fall or put them beyond repair.
</P>
<P>
   The blaze was a backbreaking ordeal for firefighters, who hauled
heavy gear up dozens of flights of stairs. They finally
extinguished it around 5:40 p.m., Interior Minister Vladimir
Rushailo said.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of a high-ranking firefighter and an elevator
operator were found in the wreckage, said Viktor Beltsov, a
spokesman for the Moscow Emergency Situations Ministry. As many as
four people were believed to have been in the elevator and workers
continued to search through the debris, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The elevator had become stuck high up in the tower in the fire's
early phase, and it wasn't immediately clear whether the victims
were still alive when it plunged. Five other elevators also crashed
to the ground during the inferno, Russian media reported.
</P>
<P>
   The blaze knocked out most television service in the sprawling
Russian capital, leaving residents longing for news and
entertainment and dispirited over the latest in a string of
disasters that have underscored the country's deteriorating
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   Grigory Sokolov, an unemployed recent college graduate watching
the firefighting Monday afternoon, said he was disturbed ''not
because the soap operas are off the air, but because of the news
programs.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There was no safety system -- as usual,'' said retired engineer
Vladimir Ilin, gazing up at the tower.
</P>
<P>
   Automatic firefighting systems within the tower appeared to have
failed or had run out of fire-suppressing foam, officials said. The
fire started in the tower's thin spire about 1,470 feet above
ground, and spread downward, burning the observation deck and
restaurant that made the tower a popular attraction for Muscovites
and tourists.
</P>
<P>
   A Moscow city surveyor on the scene, Vladimir Aleksin, said the
tower's upper spire had tilted slightly, and that the tip of the
structure was off-center by about six feet.
</P>
<P>
   Bundles of steel support cables running up the middle of the
tower had been damaged, fire department deputy director Vyacheslav
Mulishkin said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The cables are weakened, but have not broken,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A series of recent disasters, including gas explosions,
industrial accidents and breakdowns in the power grid, have
highlighted how poor funding and maintenance have weakened Russia's
infrastructure. The fire came on the heels of an Aug. 12 accident
that sunk the nuclear submarine Kursk, killing all 118 people on
board.
</P>
<P>
   ''This emergency highlights what condition vital facilities, as
well as the entire nation, are in,'' President Vladimir Putin said
at a government meeting. ''Only economic development will allow us
to avoid such calamities in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Television channels were still able to transmit nationally in
spite of the fire. Putin on Monday ordered that broadcasts of the
major channels in Moscow be resumed within a week, but it was
unclear whether that could be accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   More than 300 firefighters and other emergency workers were
called in to battle the conflagration, which was apparently sparked
Sunday by a short-circuit in wiring belonging to a paging company.
Visitors were quickly evacuated from the tower's restaurant and

   Rushailo, the interior minister, said authorities considered it
unlikely that the fire was set intentionally. But prosecutors
opened an investigation Monday into whether criminal negligence was
responsible for the fire, the Interfax news agency reported.

   For decades, the Ostankino tower stood as a symbol of the Soviet
Union's powerful technological potential. It surpassed the Empire
State Building as the world's tallest freestanding structure when
it was built in 1967, and held the title until 1975 when it was
surpassed by the CN tower in Toronto.

<HEADLINE> Charge Dropped Vs. 'Survivor' Hatch  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- Prosecutors dropped a second-degree
child abuse charge Monday against ''Survivor'' winner Richard
Hatch, who had been accused of wrapping his hands around the neck
of his 9-year-old son in April.
</P>
<P>
   No explanation for the dismissal was given in the document filed
by prosecutors in state court. Jim Martin, spokesman for the
attorney general's office, said he could not comment because Hatch
is suing the state.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch has insisted since his arrest that he is innocent and that
police mishandled the case. He filed suit against the state's child
welfare agency, claiming it wrongly removed his son from his home.
</P>
<P>
   He also has sued his hometown, Middletown, for more than $1
million for alleged wrongful arrest and defamation. Middletown Town
Manager Michael Embury also would not comment.
</P>
<P>
   George Andrade, Middletown Town Council president, said the
council plans to reward Hatch with a proclamation at its Sept. 5
meeting, despite the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Hatch's son, then 9, told police Hatch wrapped his
hands around his neck when he tired on a run, days after the
39-year-old corporate trainer returned from filming the CBS show.
Hatch said the boy concocted the story because he was angry about
being forced to exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the arrest, a judge ordered the state child
welfare agency to return the child to Hatch.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch said the dropping of the charges Monday further proved his
constitutional rights were violated.

<HEADLINE> Record Fine for Lockheed Proposed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAK RIDGE, Tenn. (AP) -- The Department of Energy on Monday
proposed a record $1 million fine against one of its top
contractors stemming from a chemical explosion and other safety
violations at the Y-12 nuclear weapons plant.
</P>
<P>
   The fine against Lockheed Martin Energy Systems, which runs the
weapons plant, would be the largest under the department's nuclear
safety enhancement program begun in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   DOE program administrator John Gordon called it ''an important
tool that we can use to assure that our contractors are fully
accountable for safety.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed Martin was cited for a Dec. 8 chemical explosion that
injured 11 workers. The contractor also was sanctioned for improper
handling of nuclear materials and other safety violations that led
to a department-ordered ''stand down'' of the plant on Nov. 5.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department noted that some problems were identified
by the Defense Nuclear Facility Safety Board as early as 1994, but
that penalties were deferred then because of the contractor's
promises to make improvements.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging some improvements have been made recently, the
department said Lockheed Martin has until Sept. 23 to explain why
it shouldn't be fined now.
</P>
<P>
   ''We recognized these issues, reported them to the Department of
Energy and identified actions to correct them,'' said Bob Van Hook,
Lockheed Martin Energy Systems president.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are going forward and are fully committed to the safe,
secure and reliable operation of the Y-12 plant,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Drug War Worries Colombia Neighbors  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW SELSKY
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- On the eve of President Clinton's visit
to Colombia, neighboring countries are growing increasingly worried
about a planned U.S.-backed drug war -- and some are even preparing
for a possible spillover by sending troops to the borders.
</P>
<P>
   The offensive -- to be carried out by Colombian soldiers trained
by Green Berets and other U.S. special forces -- is expected to
displace thousands of people.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels, who earn millions of dollars from a drug-protection
racket, have vowed to fight the Colombian troops, who are to be
deployed on U.S.-donated combat helicopters. Eighty-three U.S.
troops are currently training soldiers from a new 1,000-member
anti-narcotics battalion at a military base in southern Colombia. A
total of 3,000 Colombian soldiers are to be deployed in the
offensive, expected to begin next year.
</P>
<P>
   Ecuador, which lies to the south of Colombia and is within sight
of Colombian cocaine-producing plantations, has doubled its border
forces to 4,000 troops, the Ecuadorean Defense Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees has sent delegates to
the Ecuador border region and is considering building a camp to
hold some 5,000 Colombian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   On Colombia's northwestern frontier with Panama, fighting
between rebels and government troops has crossed the untamed border
region in recent years, and thousands of Colombian refugees have
crossed into Panama.
</P>
<P>
   Panamanian officials fear the situation will only get worse when
the anti-drug war heats up.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although we are not in the position to say whether or not this
plan should be carried out, I personally believe it would be better
if it was not,'' Panamanian Interior Minister Winston Spadafora
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Spadafora said he has requested aid from the United Nations to
prepare for spillover.
</P>
<P>
   On Colombia's eastern border, Brazil has reportedly begun
beefing up security along its 960-mile frontier with Colombia, amid
fears the anti-drug offensive could send Colombian guerrillas
fleeing into Brazil or prompt coca-growers to move into its vast
Amazon jungle.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil is also worried that any defoliants used to combat
Colombian drug production could damage its rain forest, a Brazilian
Foreign Ministry official said Thursday in Sao Paulo.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, relations between Colombia and Venezuela, which
borders northeastern Colombia, have hit a sour note over the
planned anti-drug offensive and Colombian officials' accusations
that the Venezuelan army has been funneling weapons to Colombian
rebels -- allegations the Venezuelans deny.
</P>
<P>
   After Venezuela's Foreign Minister Jose Vicente Rangel said in a
radio interview last week that violence in Colombia threatened
neighboring countries, Colombian Foreign Minister Guillermo
Fernandez shot back that Rangel was showing ''a lack of respect for
Colombia.''
</P>
<P>
   Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori also warned last week the
anti-drug offensive could threaten regional stability.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions and fears persist despite efforts to quell them by both
Colombian and U.S. officials, including Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright and Clinton's new envoy to Colombia, Anne
Patterson.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson has called the concerns ''a little exaggerated,'' but
said Washington would do what it could to help remedy any problems.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia has also sought to calm the fears, with Fernandez
offering assurances in an interview Friday that the government
plans major social programs in drug-producing areas to help people
displaced by the fighting and to discourage them from fleeing into
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
   Demand is growing in Colombia for officials to cool the
situation.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Colombian conflict is becoming more of a concern for the
security of our five neighbors,'' the Bogota daily El Espectador
noted in an editorial Saturday. ''It's not easy being the nucleus
of a conflict, but if that is our luck, we must learn to manage the
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Colombia's widening conflict is expected to be among the top
agenda items at the South American Presidents Summit, to be held in
Brasilia on Thursday, the day after Clinton's visit to Colombia.
Clinton is not attending that summit.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, three leading human rights groups criticized the
Clinton administration for aiding the Colombian military, saying
President Andres Pastrana's government has failed to meet any of
the human rights criteria set by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton waived several of the conditions and released $1.3
billion in mostly anti-drug aid for Colombia last week. The
conditions were aimed at overcoming military abuses and bringing
human rights violators to justice.
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the Washington
Office on Latin America (WOLA) all assailed Clinton's decision.

<HEADLINE> PETA, Giuliani consider suits over 'Got prostate cancer?' ads  </HEADLINE>
By JR ROSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   Got lawsuit?
</P>
<P>
   People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals threatened Monday to
sue a Wisconsin advertising company that pulled down its billboards
spoofing the ''Got milk?'' campaign with an ad featuring the
likeness of New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani to suggest a link
between dairy products and prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, who has the disease, shot back Monday that he's
considering a lawsuit of his own against PETA for the ad that
pictures him with a milk mustache and ''Got prostate cancer?''
emblazoned across the billboard.
</P>
<P>
   PETA spokesman Bruce Friedrich said the group's lawyer gave
French Advertising Inc. until Tuesday to respond to its demand to
put the billboards back up in two Wisconsin cities. Otherwise, PETA
planned to sue to force the company to honor its contract.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a very legal right to use the graphic that we're
using,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Fond du Lac, Wis., company sent PETA a fax Friday saying it
would remove the billboards in Appleton and Oshkosh because the
group had not obtained Giuliani's permission to use his likeness in
designing the ads.
</P>
<P>
   A third board planned for Fond du Lac never went up. Another
outside Lancaster, Pa., was still up Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''My hunch is they got pressure and caved,'' Friedrich said.
</P>
<P>
   French Advertising did not return a message The Associated Press
left Monday seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said he was still thinking about suing PETA for using
his likeness in the ad campaign. He said the ad gives the
impression that he supports PETA, which he doesn't, and that
there's a link between dairy products and prostate cancer, which is
disputed.
</P>
<P>
   A Harvard School of Public Health study in April raised the
possibility that consuming dairy products may increase the risk of
prostate cancer. But the study also said the issue was far from
settled and recommended further study of calcium's effects on
health.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're not doing it because they care about cancer. This
isn't the American Cancer Association,'' Giuliani said. ''They're
worried about cows.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Friedrich said PETA plans to put up the ''Got prostate
cancer?'' billboards in others states. The ad campaign spoofs the
''Got milk?'' ads, which show famous people with milk mustaches.
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't be the first time an ad featuring Giuliani was the
subject of a lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   New York magazine sued the Metropolitan Transportation Authority
after it removed the publication's ads from buses because they
offended Giuliani. The ad featured the magazine's logo and read,
''Possibly the only good thing in New York Rudy hasn't taken credit
for.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani asked the MTA to remove the ads. The agency did, citing
a state law barring the commercial use of any living person's name
without consent.
</P>
<P>
   A federal trial judge called the ad a ''hybrid of commercial
speech and political satire,'' and ruled that it was entitled to
constitutional protection. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
ruled against MTA and the U.S. Supreme Court denied its appeal
without comment in October 1998.
</P>
<P>
   MTA put the ads back up after the lower court's ruling.

<HEADLINE> Federal court ties in case of youngster barred from reading Bible story </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) - A federal court Monday was evenly divided in
the case of a New Jersey boy barred from reading his favorite Bible
story to his first-grade class, letting stand a lower court ruling
that said the school district did not violate the boy's free-speech
rights.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's mother will appeal the ruling to the U.S. Supreme
Court, her lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   The full 12-member panel of the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals split, 6-6, in the case involving Zachary Hood and the
Haines Elementary School in Medford, N.J. The court sent back to
the district court a portion of the case involving a Thanksgiving
poster that Zachary drew.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact that the court tied, 6-6, highlights how complex and
important student religious expression is, and it's an issue that
the Supreme Court should now face head-on,'' said Eric W. Treene,
of the Washington, D.C.-based Becket Fund for Religious Liberty,
which is representing the boy.
</P>
<P>
   Zachary was a first-grader in 1996 when teacher Grace Oliva
rewarded students for their reading skills by letting them pick a
story to read to their classmates.
</P>
<P>
   Zachary, who is Catholic, chose a story about Jacob and Esau
from ''The Beginner's Bible: Timeless Children's Stories.'' Oliva
told him the story was inappropriate because of its religious
content and origin, even though it had no overt religious theme and
didn't mention God.
</P>
<P>
   The teacher allowed Zachary to read it to her in private, but
would not let him do so in front of the class, saying it might
influence other students. The boy's parents sought an apology and
later sued the teacher, the principal, the district and the
district superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   The court dissented on a second phase of the lawsuit that
alleged that Zachary's rights also were violated in kindergarten,
when a substitute teacher removed a poster he had made for a
Thanksgiving display in the hallway.
</P>
<P>
   Students were asked to make posters depicting what they were
thankful for. Zachary made a poster showing that he was ''thankful
for Jesus.''
</P>
<P>
   The substitute teacher removed the poster from the display, but
his regular teacher returned it to a less prominent place in the
hallway the next day.
</P>
<P>
   The court did not rule on the constitutional issues involved
regarding the removal of the poster. They gave Zachary's mother,
Carol Hood, a chance to amend her complaint to make it more
specific, Treene said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will be pressing ahead on both tracks,'' said Kevin J.
Hasson, Becket Fund president.
</P>
<P>
   Michael P. Madden, an attorney representing the Medford Township
school district, said he was pleased that the issue of the Bible
story has been resolved, but had been hoping both matters would
have been concluded by the court. He said he was confident that the
district will win on the issue of Zachary's Thanksgiving poster.
</P>
<P>
   Treene said student religious expression is quite different from
school prayer, and that the Supreme Court ''needs to speak with a
strong voice'' about it.
</P>
<P>
   ''They need to make a distinction between government-sponsored
religious expression, like a teacher leading prayer at the
beginning of the day, and genuine student religious expression,
like Zachary reading a story or a child wearing a T-shirt that
says, 'What would Jesus do?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Hasson said the Clinton administration's guidelines for public
schools say that ''students may express their beliefs about
religion in the form of homework, art work and other written and
oral assignments free of discrimination based on the religious
content of their submissions.''
</P>
<P>
   Hasson said such guidelines are meaningless if the Medford
Township school system's ''blatant defiance of the guidelines, and
the constitutional rights they seek to protect,'' are left in place
by the federal courts.
</P>
<P>
   The Hoods have moved to Lumberton, where Zachary is entering
fifth grade.
</P>
<P>
   Treene said he was impressed that the full court carefully
considered the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''We respect that the court grappled with this,'' Treene said.
''I think it says a wonderful thing about our constitution, that a
little boy's rights were taken so seriously that they would take
the time to have all 12 judges review it.
</P>
<P>
   ''So many countries would just see this as unimportant, but in
America one child's religious rights are worth stopping and taking
a look at.''

<HEADLINE> Mets Option McEwing, Call Reliever  </HEADLINE>
By JOSH DUBOW
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Concerned about the health of reliever John
Franco, the New York Mets purchased the contract of right-handed
reliever Jerrod Riggan from Double-A Binghamton on Monday and
optioned utilityman Joe McEwing to Triple-A Norfolk.
</P>
<P>
   Franco hasn't pitched since last Tuesday because of a strained
pectoral muscle in his left shoulder and Mets manager Bobby
Valentine didn't want his already-stretched bullpen to operate a
pitcher short.
</P>
<P>
   ''With Franco day to day and the fact that (Armando) Benitez has
pitched four of five days and Rick White has pitched so much, Bobby
wanted another pitcher,'' general manager Steve Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
   Franco, 39, has given up just one unearned run in his last 19
2-3 innings dating to June 24. He could be back as early as
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's getting better,'' Franco said. ''But we have a pretty
good cushion in the wild card race, so I don't want to push it.
</P>
<P>
   Riggan, 26, was 2-0 with 27 saves and a 1.16 ERA at Binghamton.
He wasn't the Mets' first choice, but Triple-A reliever Eric
Cammack got stuck in Norfolk, Va., because of bad weather.
Eventually the Mets called Riggan, who drove down from Binghamton,
N.Y., and arrived just before the game against Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Cammack could replace Riggan on Tuesday or be called up when
rosters expand Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a tough break for him,'' Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
   McEwing is hitting .227 with two homers and 18 RBIs. He must
stay at Norfolk until the end of the Triple-A season Sept. 4 unless
a player on the Mets' 25-man roster gets injured.
</P>
<P>
   He can be eligible for the postseason roster -- even though he
will be in the minors on Aug. 31 -- because shortstop Rey Ordonez is
on the 60-day disabled list.

<HEADLINE> Cowboys Sign Phillippi Sparks  </HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN HAWKINS
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Not completely comfortable with their
young, shaken-up secondary, the Dallas Cowboys on Monday signed
Phillippi Sparks to a five-year contract and expect him to play in
the season opener.
</P>
<P>
   During the offseason, after it was apparent that Deion Sanders
wasn't coming back, the Cowboys signed free agent Ryan McNeil and
used three of their five draft picks on cornerbacks.
</P>
<P>
   McNeil has earned his starting job, but two of the drafted
rookie cornerbacks have been injured, and Kareem Larrimore, the
rookie seemingly set to be a starter, struggled in preseason games.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Cowboys ended up without two players they expected.
</P>
<P>
   Sixth-year safety Charlie Williams will miss at least two games
recovering from offseason knee surgery. Cornerback Kevin Smith, an
eight-game starter last season, reported to camp, but decided to
retire instead of playing a ninth season.
</P>
<P>
   ''We went into two-a-days, we had some good young corners, young
talent and felt like we would have Kevin Smith and Charlie
Williams, some guys with experience,'' Cowboys coach Dave Campo
said. ''Now, we're in a completely different situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys also considered Sparks before signing McNeil, who
was in Cleveland last season after spending his first six NFL
seasons with Detroit and St. Louis. Sparks spent the past seven
seasons with the New York Giants, but then hinted he may retire and
didn't sign with a team before training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks admits that he's not yet in playing shape, describing
himself as ''partly cloudy but fair.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want to be a savior, but know I can help,'' Sparks
said. ''It's time for me to learn the system and get in playing
shape ASAP. It's something that hopefully won't take too long.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Campo and Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said Sparks would be on
the field when the team returns to practice Wednesday. They expect
him to play in Sunday's opener against Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel like there's no question that he can come in here and
really give us the experience plus very significant skill that will
really benefit this team,'' Jones said. ''This is every bit as much
about what Sparks brings to the table ... Larrimore will get the
numbers of snaps he was going to get anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   To make room on the 53-man roster, the Cowboys waived linebacker
Chris Bordano, acquired from New Orleans in an offseason trade that
sent cornerback Kevin Mathis to the Saints. Sparks got a $1.5
million signing bonus and will make about $500,000 this season with
Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Campo said Larrimore has done enough to be the opening-day
starter, and insisted that the move was not a reflection on the
rookie. But the coach wouldn't say who would be starting opposite
McNeil on the corner.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a business decision. I'm not too worried about any of
that,'' said Larrimore, a fourth-round pick out of West Texas.
''I'm still out there now and just have to continue to get better.
They are bringing him in for depth and he's a veteran.''
</P>
<P>
   Larrimore is the only one of the three rookie corners to stay
healthy during the preseason. Dwayne Goodrich, the second-round
pick from Tennessee, and sixth-round pick Mario Edwards from
Florida State both have strained hamstrings and have been limited
or held out for most of the last three weeks.
</P>
<P>
Notes: RB Emmitt Smith, who didn't play a snap in five preseason
games, declared himself ready to play in the opener. He showed no
ill effects of his strained calf during a practice session Monday.
''I feel good, not bad at all. I'm ready to play. I'm right there
where I am every year.'' ... TE O.J. Santiago, acquired from
Atlanta in a trade completed Sunday, went through his first workout
with the Cowboys on Monday. ... With Troy Aikman and Randall
Cunningham the only two quarterbacks on the final roster, WR Joey
Galloway is expected to be the emergency third-stringer. During
practice Monday, Galloway took snaps from center Mark Stepnoski and
practiced handoffs to offensive coordinator Jack Really. He didn't
throw any passes.

<HEADLINE> Votes Are Being Counted in Lebanon  </HEADLINE>
By SAM F. GHATTAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- Former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri made a
strong showing in the first round of parliamentary elections, with
allied candidates taking the majority of the 63 contested seats in
northern and central Lebanon, according to official results Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A tally of winners and losers from Sunday's vote in central and
northern Lebanon showed candidates backed by Hariri or tilting
toward him winning 34 out of the 63 seats, Interior Minister Michel
Murr announced.
</P>
<P>
   Hariri, a billionaire businessman who made his fortune in
construction in Saudi Arabia, is waging an undeclared battle for
the premiership against Prime Minister Salim Hoss.
</P>
<P>
   Elections for the remaining 65 seats in the 128-member
legislature will be held next Sunday in the capital Beirut, where
Hoss and Hariri are running for different seats. For the first time
in three decades, balloting will include the border zone vacated by
Israel in May.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a victory for democracy in Lebanon and a proof that
the system is working,'' Hariri said of the results.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's upset could have an effect on who becomes the next
prime minister. However, little was expected to change in Lebanon's
political landscape since both men are close to Syria, which has
30,000 troops in Lebanon and dominates this country militarily and
politically.
</P>
<P>
   Although the campaign was short on issues, the results reflected
public dissatisfaction with the government's policies.
</P>
<P>
   The government came under fire from opponents for its handling
of an economy in recession and for what the opposition says was the
increasing influence of the security services in the running of the
country. Opposition candidates have charged that the government's
security agencies have tried to influence the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Druse leader Walid Jumblatt, a legislator and a harsh government
critic, and his supporters swept 16 of the 35 seats in the Mount
Lebanon province. The outspoken Jumblatt, one of the rare voices to
publicly criticize the increasing role of the state's security
services in political life, said the results send a strong message
to the authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Hariri launched a multibillion-dollar program to rebuild Lebanon
from the devastation of the civil war during his 1992-1998 tenure.
He has been accused by the Hoss government of shackling Lebanon
with more than $20 billion in debt.
</P>
<P>
   Hariri may not be able to count for long on pre-election
alliances that have pulled together candidates from different
factions.
</P>
<P>
   But the strong showing for candidates he backed gave a boost to
his comeback bid for the premiership. The former prime minister
stepped down in November 1998 after a power struggle with President
Emile Lahoud. Under Lebanon's parliamentary system, the president
selects the prime minister after polling legislators on their
choice.
</P>
<P>
   Among the new young faces to win parliamentary seats in Mount
Lebanon are Lahoud's 25-year-old son, Emile Jr., and Pierre
Gemayel, the 29-year-old son of former President Amin Gemayel.

<HEADLINE> New game is tied to state-required exams  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - Meeting New York's new learning
requirements doesn't have to mean all work and no play for
students. Two Niagara County entrepreneurs have developed a board
game designed to help players prepare for the state-required exams.
</P>
<P>
   Creators Bob Hartz and Jeff Dinse of Wilson are busy shopping
''Master Guru'' around to school districts just in time for the
start of the new school year.
</P>
<P>
   So far they've found buyers in dozens of western New York
districts, including Hamburg, Williamsville, Niagara Falls and
Sweet Home.
</P>
<P>
   Dinse, a seventh-grade social studies teacher at Kenmore Middle
School, got the idea from a technique he used in the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've used a Trivial Pursuit-like game to quiz my kids on the
social studies curriculum and it hit me that something like it
could be used for all the subjects covered by the state tests,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hartz, a childhood friend and University of Rochester baseball
coach, agreed. The two formed a company called Harbor Town Games
and, with input from several fellow educators, came up with a game
for young students covering materials from the social studies,
math, science and English portions of the state tests.
</P>
<P>
   ''We decided to start with a third-grade-level game, so we can
catch kids who are having their first introduction to the subject
matter they'll be tested on as fourth-graders,'' Dinse said.
</P>
<P>
   Darryl Swanson, a Kenmore Middle School art teacher, was called
in to help with graphic elements of the game board, cards and
packaging.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a challenging game where players move through
three increasingly difficult levels of play to become Master Gurus.
To advance, players must answer questions from printed cards, each
of which has the correct answer and an explanation on the back.
</P>
<P>
   ''With math and science questions, it's really important to show
the steps or formula used to reach the answer,'' Dinse said. ''We
also think it will be very helpful to parents, who might need to
see an explanation themselves, so they can be a resource to their
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   While the current version of the game is geared for New York
third- and fourth-graders, versions for other grade levels are in
the works and the partners eventually would like to create editions
for students nationwide, noting that nearly every state has adopted
learning standards in recent years to boost academic proficiency.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's down the road a ways,'' Dinse said. ''Right now, our
big step was to move the business out of my garage into 3,600
square feet of rented space.''

<HEADLINE> Lieberman-Cline Leaving the Shock  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Nancy Lieberman-Cline, the only coach and general
manager the Detroit Shock have ever had, won't be back with the
team next season.
</P>
<P>
   The Shock said Monday it is not renewing the Hall of Famer's
contract. No replacement was named.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am extremely appreciative of the opportunity that Detroit
game me to be involved with the Shock and the WNBA,''
Lieberman-Cline said in a statement. ''I enjoyed my three years in
Detroit, and I wish the players and franchise well in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   She led the Shock to a 46-48 record.
</P>
<P>
   The team finished over .500 in its inaugural 1998 season, and
made the playoffs in 1999. But the Shock went 4-8 down the stretch
this year to miss the playoffs by a game.
</P>
<P>
   Attendance dropped each season.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nancy helped establish women's professional basketball in the
state of Michigan,'' team president Tom Wilson said. ''We will now
begin the search for a new head coach and look forward to a
successful 2001 WNBA season.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman-Cline, nicknamed ''Lady Magic,'' was enshrined in the
Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   She led Old Dominion to two national championships, became the
youngest basketball player to win an Olympic medal at 18 -- a silver
in the 1976 Montreal Games -- and led the Dallas Diamonds of the
Women's Basketball League to the 1981 championship.
</P>
<P>
   She was the first woman to play in a men's professional league,
with the USBL's Springfield Fame and Long Island Knights, and
played for the Phoenix Mercury in the WNBA's inaugural season.

<HEADLINE> Israel Seeks Turkey Defense Ties  </HEADLINE>
By SELCAN HACAOGLU
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANKARA, Turkey AP) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak lobbied
in Turkey on Monday for defense contracts amid reports that Turkey
was scaling back ties with Israeli firms.
</P>
<P>
   Turkish officials are apparently disappointed that Turkish firms
recently lost a major contract in Israel and were also angry that
an Israeli minister called for teaching the massacre of Armenians
along with the Holocaust in Israeli schools. Turkey insists that it
did not commit genocide against the Armenians during World War I
and regards any such allegations as anti-Turkish.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our defense industry would like to have more projects in
Turkey,'' Barak told reporters after meeting with Turkish Prime
Minister Bulent Ecevit. ''But we understand the rules of free
competition and Turkish authorities have to decide what is the best
thing for Turkey to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Turkey expects to spend some $150 billion during the next 25
years to upgrade its armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli firms are already working to modernize Turkish F-4
Phantom jet fighters and are competing with Russia for a $4 billion
deal to produce 145 attack helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   But there are reports that Turkish officials have told Israel
that it is no longer in the running for contracts to build a spy
satellite, upgrade Turkish M-60 tanks and supply Turkey with radar
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Those reports came after Turkey reportedly lost out in the
bidding to repair the Israeli port of Ashdod.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey's private NTV television said Israel promised to award
construction work to Turkish companies in return for military
deals.
</P>
<P>
   Barak and Ecevit also discussed Israel-Palestinian peace talks,
which stalled over the question of control of the city of
Jerusalem. Turkey has offered to act as a mediator. Barak returned
to Israel late Monday.

<HEADLINE> World Religious Leaders Gather  </HEADLINE>
By JULIA LIEBLICH
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Songs, cries and calls for prayer opened
the Millennium World Peace Summit of religious leaders at the
United Nations Monday, a gathering as much about private talks
between adversaries as formal resolutions passed in public.
</P>
<P>
   Participants say they hope the summit, which runs through
Thursday, will result in a declaration on peace, poverty and the
environment, as well as the formation of a council of religious
leaders to advise the United Nations on preventing and settling
disputes.
</P>
<P>
   But the meeting of more than 1,000 leaders drew controversy
before it even began when participants learned last month that
conference organizers did not invite the Dalai Lama to the first
two days of the event for fear of offending China. China accuses
the Tibetan Buddhist leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner ''creating
turmoil'' in Tibet, from where he fled in 1959 after an abortive
uprising against China's occupation.
</P>
<P>
   Dissent on that issue aside, participants said they were
grateful for the event, considering the number of global conflicts
with strong religious components. Sessions were planned on the role
of religion in conflict resolution, with specific workshops on the
Balkans, Russia and Central Asia, Africa, and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   ''This afternoon, this General Assembly hall has become a
sanctuary,'' Bawa Jain, the summit general secretary, told an
audience in gilded robes and woven tunics, pointed caps and long
white veils.
</P>
<P>
   Some noted that the real work happens away from the podium
</P>
<P>
   ''Sometimes you have a meeting between people who are officially
enemies who find they like each other,'' said Israeli Rabbi Adin
Steinsaltz, a leading Talmudic scholar. ''That makes more of a
difference than resolutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Eritrean Bishop Zekarias Yohannes said he plans to meet with
Ethiopian leaders. The two Horn of Africa neighbors recently signed
a cease-fire in a bitter border war.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Chief Rabbi Israel Meir Lau said he hopes to talk with
Muslim sheiks during the conference. ''Here we are not in a hostile
neighborhood,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sheikh Abdoulaye Dieye of Senegal said he had mixed feelings as
he entered the United Nations for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm full of hope, but I have fears,'' he said. ''The summit is
a very good thing for humanity if we manage it properly. There
shouldn't be too much politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet politics intruded on the issue of the Dalai Lama. During the
summit's opening session, a group of about 150 Tibetan monks,
exiles and activists protested in the plaza across from U.N.
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ''To not invite him is totally incongruous with what we're
trying to do here,'' said Yangdon Tsering, a Tibetan exile who
lives in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers invited the Dalai Lama only to the last two days of
the conference -- being held at a New York hotel. He declined.
</P>
<P>
   Bawa Jain, the chief summit organizer, said an eight-person
delegation of Tibetan Buddhist leaders had been sent by the Dalai
Lama, and that two of them would be speaking in the General
Assembly hall.
</P>
<P>
   ''But I don't want it to get into anything political,'' said
Jain, a member of the Jain faith from New Jersey by way of India.
''I've made that clear to them.''
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations did not sponsor the event nor issue
invitations. An interfaith coalition organized the program and
picked the participants. The only delegations chosen by their
government were China's and Vietnam's.
</P>
<P>
   Among the leaders on the program were Cardinal Francis Arinze,
president of the Vatican's Pontifical Council for Interreligious
Dialogue; Cambodian Buddhist leader Samdech Preah Maha Ghosananda;
the Grand Mufti of Bosnia, Mustafa Ceric and the Rev. Jesse
Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders who declined to come include Ecumenical Patriarch
Bartholomew I, who sent a videotaped message, and Jerusalem Mufti
Ikrema Sabri, who has refused to meet with Rabbi Lau.
</P>
<P>
   The summit has received funding from Ted Turner's U.N.
Foundation, Better World Fund and others. Turner, who once said
that Christianity was ''for losers,'' will give the keynote
address.

<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- The Baltimore Orioles optioned infielder Mike
Kinkade to Triple-A Rochester and returned outfielder Eugene
Kingsale to the minor league club Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Kinkade, 28, was selected to the U.S. Olympic baseball team last
week. He is on his way to San Diego for a workout this week before
heading to Sydney, Australia, for next month's Summer Games.
</P>
<P>
   Kinkade came to the Orioles in the June 28 trade that sent Mike
Bordick to the New York Mets. He went 3-for-7 in three games with
the Orioles, including a double to deliver the go-ahead run in
Sunday's 3-2 win over Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Kingsale was placed on the 15-day disabled list March 29 with a
torn right quadriceps muscle and was placed on the 60-day DL on May
12. He hit a combined .385, going 20-for-52 with two home runs and
12 RBI in a 14-game rehab stint at Gulf Coast, Frederick and Bowie.

<HEADLINE> Reds' Williamson on Disabled List  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Cincinnati pitcher Scott Williamson, bothered by
a lower back strain, was placed on the 15-day disabled list Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds recalled John Riedling from Triple-A Louisville. The
right-hander was en route to Atlanta and expected to arrive during
Monday night's game against the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Williamson (5-7, 3.16 ERA) has developed into Cincinnati's best
starter since he was moved from the bullpen to the rotation on July
9. He has allowed more than three earned runs only once in nine
starts and pitched at least six innings six times.
</P>
<P>
   In his last start, Williamson limited Philadelphia to one run
and four hits over seven innings Wednesday, but did not figure in
the decision. The Reds lost 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   Williamson was placed on the DL, retroactive to Thursday, after
returning to Cincinnati for an examination. Ron Villone (8-7)
stepped in to make his first start since July 22.

<HEADLINE> Iran Clash Leaves Policeman Dead  </HEADLINE>
By ALI AKBAR DAREINI
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Hard-line vigilantes clashed with reformist
students in western Iran, leaving a policeman dead, Iran's
state-run radio and a student leader said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The clashes, which began Thursday and reached a climax Sunday,
injured 25 to 30 students in the city of Khorramabad, about 300
miles southwest of Tehran, student leader Amir Hussein Balali told
The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   The confrontations put an end to a democracy seminar -- slated to
end Wednesday after a week -- when local authorities told student
organizers Sunday they could no longer guarantee security for the
sessions, Balali said.
</P>
<P>
   Rioting broke out Sunday night after the clashes between the
vigilantes and members of the Office for Fostering Unity, the
student group, Balali said after returning to Tehran. He did not
say how many students took part in the clashes and riots.
</P>
<P>
   ''Police officer Ardeshir Karami was killed Sunday evening
during clashes with opportunists and rioters who smashed windows of
shops causing damages to public and private properties,'' Tehran
Radio said.
</P>
<P>
   Balali, said: ''We heard that a police officer was killed in the
riots.''
</P>
<P>
   The democracy seminar opened on Wednesday with a message from
reformist President Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
   But Brig. Gen. Gholam-Reza Soleimani, a top officer of the elite
Revolutionary Guards in the region, warned in remarks published
Saturday of a ''crushing response'' if the seminar continued.
</P>
<P>
   After the seminar's close, the daily Hayat-e-Now quoted leading
reformist lawmaker, Ali Shakouri-Rad, as saying Monday: ''If the
establishment cannot provide security for a legal gathering, then
it has violated the philosophy of its existence.''
</P>
<P>
   Balali said armed Revolutionary Guards and police were present
during the clashes but did not intervene to stop the
confrontations.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time since July that hard-liners used violence
to silence reformists, who are calling for easing social and
political restrictions by hard-line Islamic authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Balali said that some 200 vigilantes and armed Revolutionary
Guards surrounded Khorramabad airport over the weekend and
prevented leading reformist thinkers Abdolkarim Soroush and Mohsen
Kadivar of Tehran University from leaving the station to address
the seminar. It said the two returned to Tehran.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Jobless Rate Remains Steady  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's unemployment rate remained steady in July
at 4.7 percent, as more part-time female workers helped offset a
rise in the number of jobless men, the government said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The jobless rate for men rose 0.1 percentage point from June to
4.9 percent, while unemployment for women eased 0.3 point to 4.3
percent, the Management and Coordination Agency announced.
</P>
<P>
   July's overall rate of 4.7 percent was in line with economists'
expectations. The rate had risen to 4.7 percent in June from May's
4.6 percent, ending three months of decline.
</P>
<P>
   The number of part-time jobholders rose 10.9 percent in July
from last year, or by 540,000 positions, with women occupying some
440,000 of those jobs. The number of part-time workers has risen
every month since September 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say that increasing reliance on part-timers reflects
efforts by companies to trim personnel costs by shifting away from
full-time employees.
</P>
<P>
   The total number of jobless people fell in July to 3.07 million,
a drop of 120,000, or 3.8 percent, from June.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate survey, the Labor Ministry said the ratio of job
offers to job seekers, an indicator of demand for labor, rose to
0.60 in July, an increase of 0.01 point.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is struggling to emerge from a decade-long slump, its
worst since the end of World War II.

<HEADLINE> Sox Replace Wakefield With Martinez  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- The Boston Red Sox have sent
struggling knuckleballer Tim Wakefield to the bullpen and replaced
him in the rotation with Ramon Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know he's disappointed, but he can help us there,'' Red Sox
manager Jimy Williams said before Monday night's game against Tampa
Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said Wakefield could make a couple spot starts down the
stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, on the 15-day disabled list with a right knee
contusion, is scheduled to pitch Saturday against Seattle. It will
be his first appearance since going on the DL on Aug. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said Martinez, 8-6 with a 6.14 ERA in 21 starts, will
throw 45-60 pitches in a simulated game Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Wakefield, who is winless in his past eight starts, declined
comment. He allowed nine runs -- seven earned -- over five innings in
an 11-7 loss Sunday to Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Wakefield is 6-9 with a 5.68 ERA in 39 games, including 15
starts.

<HEADLINE> Stephenson Leads Hy-Vee Classic  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Jan Stephenson battled tricky greens
while shooting a 2-under-par 70 Monday to lead after one round of
the Hy-Vee Classic, the second Women's Senior Golf Tour event.
</P>
<P>
   Stephenson, who put together three birdies on the back nine and
also birdied the fifth hole, was the only player to shoot under
par. She led Marta Figueras-Dotti and Susie Berning by two strokes.
</P>
<P>
   Vicki Fergon, Judy Dickinson and Jane Crafter all shot 73.
Fergon won the first tournament on the Women's Senior Golf Tour, at
Green Bay, Wisc., this month.
</P>
<P>
   Ten others, including LPGA Hall-of-Famers Amy Alcott and JoAnne
Carner, were within five strokes of Stephenson.
</P>
<P>
   The 36-hole tournament ends Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The greens are tricky here,'' Stephenson said. ''There were
two or three (putts) I missed because they were total local
knowledge greens. I wish I would have had a practice round or had
my caddie here. There's a lot of optical illusions on this golf
course.''
</P>
<P>
   Berning, who had a 2-under 34 on the back nine, sought the
advice of local amateurs in her group on how to play the greens.
</P>
<P>
   ''On some I didn't believe them, and they were right,'' Berning
said. ''The greens reminded me of some of the great championship
courses.''
</P>
<P>
   The 61-year old Carner also was fooled.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not getting a practice round in, I didn't know what was firm
or what would hold,'' she said. ''I missed total greens, and when I
did hit good shots, some went really long, which is not the thing
to do on this course.''
</P>
<P>
   The tournament, offering a purse of $250,000 with $35,000 going
to the winner, drew a crowd estimated by organizers at 3,000.

<HEADLINE> Jets Coach Expects Favre To Start  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- Quarterback Brett Favre, who missed the
last three preseason games with tendinitis in his right elbow,
should start the season-opener with the New York Jets.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have high expectations that he will play in the game,''
coach Mike Sherman said Monday. ''If he doesn't, it will be a shock
to me. There are no indicators at this time that says he won't be
able to play. Nothing is showing us he won't be Brett Favre again
when we play on Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision to rest Favre for the three preseason contests
ended his string of starts that stretched back 173 preseason,
regular season and postseason games. He took over as starter three
games into the 1992 season and has held the job ever since.
</P>
<P>
   If he opens against the Jets at Lambeau Field it will be his
126th consecutive regular-season start.
</P>
<P>
   Favre has tested the arm in recent days, throwing 50 passes
Sunday and throwing again Monday. He was not expected to throw in
workouts Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Offensive coordinator Tom Rossley expects Favre to throw close
to full speed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman said Favre likely will experience some soreness after
using the arm, but that is expected.
</P>
<P>
   Both Favre and backup Matt Hasselbeck will take practice snaps
with the first-team offense.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's absolutely no concern about Favre,'' Packers general
manager Ron Wolf said. ''I have to believe what everybody says is
true is true -- that he's going to go play.''
</P>
<P>
   Running back Dorsey Levens appears to have no chance of playing
against New York. Levens missed the last two games with knee
tendinitis.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be foolish to try to push him, coming off a surgery
(Aug. 15) to come back this quickly,'' Sherman said.
</P>
<P>
   Levens' backup, Ahman Green, could play Sunday. Green also
missed the last two preseason games with a sprained knee.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ahman has been able to push extremely hard straight ahead,''
Sherman said. ''It's the lateral movement that will be the
question.''
</P>
<P>
   If Green cannot play, the Packers expect to start either rookie
Herbert Goodman or Basil Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman said defensive tackle Santana Dotson (knee) will
practice Wednesday and play Sunday. Meanwhile, linebacker Bernardo
Harris (bruised knee) has a 50-50 chance of playing against the
Jets. If Harris doesn't start, Mike Morton will replace him.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the trade the Packers made with Oakland on Sunday for
defensive tackle Chuck Osborne was voided Monday when Osborne
failed his physical. The Packers had traded a fifth-round pick in
2002 for Osborne.
</P>
<P>
   In other moves Monday, the Packers claimed tight end Chris
Eitzmann on waivers from New England and linebacker Chris Gizzi on
waivers from Denver.
</P>
<P>
   The Packers cut third-year linebacker Jude Waddy.
</P>
<P>
   Green Bay signed guard Craig Heimburger, defensive end Kabeer
Gbaja-Biamila and linebacker Eugene McCaslin to the practice squad.
The three had been waived Sunday and became free agents after
clearing 24-hour waivers.
</P>
<P>
   The Packers have two more openings on the practice squad.

<HEADLINE> Judge approves $3.75 billion fen-phen settlement  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER BROWN
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) - A federal judge has approved the proposed
$3.75 billion national settlement of health claims stemming from
the diet drug combination fen-phen, which has been linked to
potentially fatal heart valve damage.
</P>
<P>
   Under the settlement approved Monday, fen-phen users would get
up to $1.5 million, though most would get far less, depending on
their level of injury and how long they took the drugs. The
settlement also includes money for their future medical monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Louis C. Bechtle gave preliminary approval
to the deal last November.
</P>
<P>
   More than 9,000 lawsuits have been filed against American Home
Products, maker of fenfluramine, the ''fen'' in the fen-phen diet
drug combination. The Madison, N.J.-based company sold the
combination under the brand name of Pondimin and also made Redux, a
chemical cousin.
</P>
<P>
   The drugs were withdrawn in September 1997 after a Mayo Clinic
study linked fen-phen to potentially fatal heart valve damage. The
second drug in the combination, phentermine, was not linked to the
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''The settlement resolves the vast majority of the claims and
potential claims that the company was facing and it's a very, very
significant step forward in resolving the litigation,'' said
Michael Scott of Philadelphia, one of the attorneys representing
American Home.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Edward F. Blizzard of Houston objected to the
settlement in June on behalf of a group of diet-drug users, saying
it would likely be reversed because of all the other lawsuits
pending. Blizzard, who did not immediately return a call for
comment Monday, had promised to appeal to the 3rd U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals if the judge gives his approval.
</P>
<P>
   Other opponents say monetary damages are deficient, the
settlement does not include compensation for people who may develop
health problems later and users had inadequate representation.
</P>
<P>
   Of 6 million people who took fen-phen before it was pulled from
the market, about 45,000 have refused the settlement and retain the
right to sue for punitive damages. Another 266,000 have registered
to join the class. Those people may still reject the settlement and
sue for compensatory damages but are forbidden from collecting
punitive damages.

Producer To Pay Sarah McLachlan's Court Costs
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- A music producer who
unsuccessfully sued singer Sarah McLachlan for copyright
infringement will have to pay the pop star more than $250,000 in
court costs.
</P>
<P>
   Darryl Neudorf ''made serious allegations of copyright
infringement against'' the Grammy and Juno-awarding winning singer,
her label and managers, British Columbia Supreme Court Justice
Bruce Cohen said in his written ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did Neudorf, a former drummer with the band 54-40, fail
to prove those allegations, but he also turned down a settlement
offer and forced a 39-day British Columbia Supreme Court trial.
</P>
<P>
   ''At the end of the day, based largely on the plaintiff's own
testimony, I held that the plaintiff had failed to prove'' his
claims, Cohen said in his ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Neudorf sued McLachlan -- the mastermind behind the wildly
successful Lilith Fair concert tour -- for cash and credit for work
on four songs on her 1998 debut album Touch.

Former Grand Chief Weighing Options
</P>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- Phil Fontaine, once Canada's most powerful
aboriginal leader, denies rumors he's on the verge of announcing
Liberal political ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   The former head of the Assembly of First Nations, defeated last
month in an upset victory by former Quebec Cree Grand Chief Matthew
Coon Come, says he's still weighing options.
</P>
<P>
   ''I haven't made any commitments'' on whether that includes
seeking a Liberal nomination for the next federal election,
Fontaine said in an interview Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you end up as a member of Parliament you represent not just
aboriginal issues. You represent the interests of all your
constituency.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to be careful about being seen as a single-issue or
special-interest representative,'' Fontaine said.
</P>
<P>
   He was responding to rumors that he'd announce during this
week's Liberal caucus meeting in Winnipeg plans to seek a
nomination in a Manitoba riding.
</P>
<P>
   ''There have been some discussions,'' Fontaine said from
Winnipeg. ''I've talked to people, people have talked to me, and
we've looked at the different possibilities. But there have been no
commitments made on either side.''

   Teen-ager Charged in Shooting Appears at Transfer Hearing
</P>
<P>
   LETHBRIDGE, Alberta (AP) -- A teen charged with gunning down a
fellow high school student listened calmly to the evidence in court
Monday while his mother sat nearby squeezing and clasping her
hands.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will be such a relief when this is over,'' the mother of
the 16-year-old boy said during a court break.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been so hard for so many people. I just feel so bad for
those children.''
</P>
<P>
   The children are those involved in the shootings at the W. R.
Myers high school in Taber, Alberta, in April 1999. Jason Lang, 17,
was fatally shot and another student wounded in the school hallway.
A third student was also shot at but not hit.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of teen-agers came to youth court Monday to hear
details of that fateful, dark day at the southern Alberta school.
It was the beginning of a two-week hearing to determine whether the
accused will have his case moved to adult court.
</P>
<P>
   He is charged with one count of first-degree murder and two of
attempted murder.
</P>
<P>
   In youth court, he would face a maximum sentence of six years in
prison and four years community supervision. In adult court, the
maximum sentence for a 14-year-old young offender convicted of
first-degree murder is life in prison with no chance of parole for
five to seven years.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Supports Grass-Roots Groups  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Secretary-General Kofi Annan urged
grass-roots groups from over 60 countries Monday to work with the
United Nations and its member governments to help make
globalization benefit the world's poor.
</P>
<P>
   Annan told more than 1,800 activists attending the annual U.N.
summit of non-governmental organizations that their misgivings
about the global economy -- which have resulted in protests at world
trade talks and other global gatherings -- were understandable.
</P>
<P>
   But he said activists should be part of the solution and not
remain on the protest sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has been said that arguing against globalization is like
arguing against the law of gravity,'' Annan said. ''But that does
not mean we should accept a law which allows only heavyweights to
survive.
</P>
<P>
   ''On the contrary -- we must make globalization an engine that
lifts people out of hardship and misery, not a force that holds
them down,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Annan called on the grass-roots groups to join partnerships with
the United Nations like the recently launched Global Compact
collaboration of corporations, U.N. agencies, labor unions and
human rights groups to promote good business practices around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   The three-day non-governmental summit is happening ahead of the
Sept. 6-8 U.N. Millennium Summit, where more than 150 world leaders
will converge at U.N. headquarters to try to chart a new course for
the United Nations in the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Hanan Ashrawi, a frequent spokeswoman for the Palestinians,
echoed Annan's call to activists to keep pressuring governments.
</P>
<P>
   ''We must not only shape the vision but articulate the vision,''
she said in a keynote address. ''That's what makes us different.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashrawi said individuals must be willing to take risks as
Palestinians did during the six-year uprising against Israeli
occupation to fight for peace and basic human rights.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe that the human will, the human spirit and ultimately
the decision to take risks to stand up and be counted are what make
a difference in terms of altering realities,'' said Ashrawi.

<HEADLINE> Authorities identify woman found dead at rest stop  </HEADLINE>
By MELISSA NELSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK (AP) - A woman was found stabbed to death near an
interstate highway rest area whose surveillance cameras were
out-of-service since at least last week, officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Video from the cameras could have shown investigators some of
the people who were at the Interstate 40 rest stop at Morrilton
when Kristin Ann Laurite, 25, of Scotch Plains, N.J., stopped there
during the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ''The cameras are focused on the building at the rest area. We
don't know if the surveillance would have picked up the crime, but
it could provide useful information,'' Highway Department spokesman
Randy Ort said. ''It's just extremely unfortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   The killing was the third at an Arkansas rest area in four
years. After killings in 1996 and 1997, the highway department set
up cameras and posted signs warning of the surveillance as a way to
improve safety.
</P>
<P>
   ''The cameras are still in place and the signs are still up (at
Morrilton),'' Ort said. ''Sometimes those things act as a
deterrent, but we do not have any videotape.''
</P>
<P>
   The equipment was removed and taken to Little Rock last
Wednesday for repair.
</P>
<P>
   Laurite, who was traveling to California, had told her mother
Friday afternoon that she planned to stop somewhere along the way
and sleep in her van, Conway County Sheriff Mark Flowers said.
</P>
<P>
   A truck driver found the woman's dogs running loose late
Saturday and called a phone number listed on the dog tags, Flowers
said. The truck driver reached the woman's mother, who said
something must be wrong because the dogs never strayed.
</P>
<P>
   The dogs led state police and sheriff's deputies to the woman's
body, on the bank of a pond near the rest area on the westbound
side of the highway.
</P>
<P>
   Flowers and Ort said there has been vandalism at the rest stop,
and the sheriff said there had been discussions recently about
closing the site. Interstate exits, with services, are nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ''That will be up to the state. They are in charge of the rest
area,'' Flowers said.
</P>
<P>
   Ort said the Morrilton area has had problems ''for quite some
time, as far as vandalism and crime.''
</P>
<P>
   In January 1997, truck driver Arthur Joe Cotton, 71, of
Sheridan, was shot to death in the bathroom of the Interstate
40-eastbound rest stop at Morrilton. Two half-brothers from West
Virginia were convicted of the murder.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1996, Russell D. Hinkle, 71, of Millstadt, Ill., was
shot and killed after he stopped with his family at a tourist
information center on Interstate 55 near Blytheville. Four
Blytheville teen-agers were convicted of the slayings.
</P>
<P>
   The state Highway Department in 1997 discussed hiring 24-hour
security guards but decided it was too expensive. It opted instead
for the surveillance cameras, which are aimed at the outside of the
restrooms.
</P>
<P>
   No one watches the video, but it is preserved should there be a
reason to review it.
</P>
<P>
   Ort said the Morrilton area was the only one with a broken video
system during the weekend. He said he didn't know how highway
commissioners would react to the incident, though closing the area
would be an option if motorists can't be protected.
</P>
<P>
   ''Safety is very important,'' Ort said.
</P>
<P>
   The truck driver said he would take the dogs to the woman's
mother, Flowers said.

<HEADLINE> Ryan Leaf on 'His Best Behavior'  </HEADLINE>
By BERNIE WILSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Imagine if Ryan Leaf had acted his age as a
rookie. And instead of letting interceptions eat at him to the
point of committing more blunders, think what might have been if he
came right back and threw touchdown passes.
</P>
<P>
   The San Diego Chargers think they finally have that Ryan Leaf in
uniform.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the more stunning turnarounds in the NFL this summer,
Leaf has played his way back into the starting quarterback job that
he'd lost as a highly touted rookie in 1998. Back then, as the
second pick overall in the draft, Leaf was viewed as a savior by a
franchise that desperately needed one.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he had one spectacular meltdown after another on and
off the field.
</P>
<P>
   Except for a brief scare when some scar tissue tore in his
surgically repaired right shoulder, it's been a quiet, businesslike
summer for Leaf. He's been on his best behavior and has said all
the right things. His passes have been crisp and there's been no
sign of the arrogance he showed as a rookie.
</P>
<P>
   And, despite spraining his right ankle during footwork drills
Monday, Leaf will take his first regular-season snap in more than
20 months when the Chargers open at Oakland on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''So many things had gone wrong, I guess you could say that
we're pleasantly surprised it's turned around as quickly as it
has,'' said player personnel director Billy Devaney.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the way we envisioned it when we drafted the guy.''
</P>
<P>
   What changed?
</P>
<P>
   Just 10 months ago, Leaf was still getting into trouble. While
rehabbing from the shoulder surgery that sidelined him last season,
he was suspended for four weeks without pay for cursing at
then-general manager Bobby Beathard. He seemed on the brink of
becoming one of the biggest busts in NFL history.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as the spring, a teammate called Leaf fat and
overweight.
</P>
<P>
   Having bottomed out, teammates and management sense that he's
growing up.
</P>
<P>
   Leaf admits he's learned a lot.
</P>
<P>
   ''My life is really, really different than what it was two years
ago, in every sense of the word,'' he said. ''It's just kind of a
night-and-day, drastic difference from what it was. Calming
everywhere, I think. In my head, in my soul, in this team, in the
coaching staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaf is engaged to a former Chargers cheerleader, and some of
coach Mike Riley's nice-guy attitude seems to have rubbed off.
</P>
<P>
   New quarterbacks coach Mike Johnson has been a positive
influence. Johnson and offensive line coach Joe Bugel, a former NFL
head coach, helped Leaf get comfortable reading defenses and
knowing his protection -- something had to be done about that ratio
of 2 TD passes to 15 interceptions Leaf had as a rookie.
</P>
<P>
   The Chargers said Leaf's ankle should be fine by Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Something like this always happens to me when I get an
opportunity,'' Leaf said of the sprain. ''It was a freak deal. I
was just going through drills and rolled it. I've got basketball
ankles. I can walk down the street and they just roll over.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley said his first thought was, ''Not now. It did scare me, I
will say that.''
</P>
<P>
   In Leaf's mind, it's all about being healthy. The shoulder
injury may very well have scared him straight.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been great in the fact that I've been able to be out on
the football field, period,'' Leaf said. ''It's been so long and so
frustrating.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that was the biggest change. For me, every other
aspect of it is just day by day, really. I'm trying to stay on that
even keel, and coach Riley's got me by the short tail. I'm just
kind of following how he acts. It's a good way to go about
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaf seemed appreciative, not cocky, that he won the job back.
</P>
<P>
   ''Earning it gives you credibility,'' he said on Monday. ''The
only credibility I had as a rookie was being the second pick
overall.''
</P>
<P>
   Can this new attitude last? Leaf has said several times in the
past that he had changed, only to take a step back.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot remains still to be seen from him, but he's definitely
heading in the right direction,'' said team president Dean Spanos.
</P>
<P>
   Star linebacker Junior Seau, who nicknamed Leaf ''Baby Boy'' as
a rookie, said the lack of off-field distractions has helped Leaf.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whenever you go out in public and do the things that he did,
obviously you don't give yourself a chance to perform as an
athlete. This year he stayed in his dorm and now he's a ballplayer
and he's concentrating on getting healthy and throwing the ball.''

   DALLAS (AP) -- With not even a hint of rain to settle the dust, North Texas

during the Dust Bowl days of the Depression. Lawns are burned, farmers and
ranchers have lost an estimated $595 million and reservoirs are shrinking fast,
even though rainfall for the year is close to normal. It's not just dry; it's
hot. Today was the year's 36th day of 100-degree temperatures in Dallas-Fort

<HEADLINE> Packers Coach: Favre Will Play Jets  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- Packers quarterback Brett Favre, who
missed Green Bay's last three preseason games with tendinitis in
his right elbow, should start the season opener against the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have high expectations that he will play in the game,''
Packers coach Mike Sherman said Monday. ''If he doesn't, it will be
a shock to me. There are no indicators at this time that says he
won't be able to play. Nothing is showing us he won't be Brett
Favre again when we play on Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision to rest Favre for the three preseason contests
ended his string of starts that stretched back 173 preseason,
regular season and postseason games. He took over as starter three
games into the 1992 season and has held the job ever since.
</P>
<P>
   If he opens against the Jets at Lambeau Field it will be his
126th consecutive regular-season start.
</P>
<P>
   Favre has tested the arm in recent days, throwing 50 passes
Sunday and throwing again Monday. He was not expected to throw in
workouts Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Offensive coordinator Tom Rossley expects Favre to throw close
to full speed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman said Favre likely will experience some soreness after
using the arm, but that is expected.
</P>
<P>
   Both Favre and backup Matt Hasselbeck will take practice snaps
with the first-team offense.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's absolutely no concern about Favre,'' Packers general
manager Ron Wolf said. ''I have to believe what everybody says is
true is true -- that he's going to go play.''
</P>
<P>
   Running back Dorsey Levens appears to have no chance of playing
against New York. Levens missed the last two games with knee
tendinitis.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be foolish to try to push him, coming off a surgery
(Aug. 15) to come back this quickly,'' Sherman said.
</P>
<P>
   Levens' backup, Ahman Green, could play Sunday. Green also
missed the last two preseason games with a sprained knee.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ahman has been able to push extremely hard straight ahead,''
Sherman said. ''It's the lateral movement that will be the
question.''
</P>
<P>
   If Green cannot play, the Packers expect to start either rookie
Herbert Goodman or Basil Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman said defensive tackle Santana Dotson (knee) will
practice Wednesday and play Sunday. Meanwhile, linebacker Bernardo
Harris (bruised knee) has a 50-50 chance of playing against the
Jets. If Harris doesn't start, Mike Morton will replace him.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the trade the Packers made with Oakland on Sunday for
defensive tackle Chuck Osborne was voided Monday when Osborne
failed his physical. The Packers had traded a fifth-round pick in
2002 for Osborne.
</P>
<P>
   In other moves Monday, the Packers claimed tight end Chris
Eitzmann on waivers from New England and linebacker Chris Gizzi on
waivers from Denver.
</P>
<P>
   The Packers cut third-year linebacker Jude Waddy.
</P>
<P>
   Green Bay signed guard Craig Heimburger, defensive end Kabeer
Gbaja-Biamila and linebacker Eugene McCaslin to the practice squad.
The three had been waived Sunday and became free agents after
clearing 24-hour waivers.
</P>
<P>
   The Packers have two more openings on the practice squad.

<HEADLINE> Ramseys Meet With Police  </HEADLINE>
By ERIN McCLAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- John and Patsy Ramsey's attorney accused a
prosecutor Monday of turning the Ramseys' first interview with
police in two years into a ''fishing expedition'' to prove the
couple killed their daughter, JonBenet.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney L. Lin Wood said prosecutor Michael Kane would not
consider any suspects other than the Ramseys. ''I'm not real
hopeful'' about further progress in the investigation, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kane threatened to walk out of an interview with Patsy Ramsey
when the two sides argued over questioning about fiber evidence and
security precautions for JonBenet's older brother, Burke, Wood
said.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate comment from Kane or from the rest of a
seven-member investigative team led by Boulder, Colo., police Chief
Mark Beckner. In Boulder, spokeswoman Jana Petersen said the police
department would have no comment on the interviews until they are
completed.
</P>
<P>
   The group questioned Patsy Ramsey at Wood's Atlanta office for
about seven hours Monday and planned to continue Tuesday morning,
followed by a session with John Ramsey.
</P>
<P>
   ''They may never clear our names till they find the killer,''
John Ramsey said Monday. ''We're not here to prove our innocence or
clear our name. We're here to find the killer of our daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   Wood said questions from the rest of the investigative team were
mostly fair. At a break in the talks earlier Monday, Patsy Ramsey
had said she was ''very comfortable'' with questions investigators
posed to her in a morning session.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe they're asking pertinent questions, so I'm happy to
be there,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides disagreed in the afternoon session over questions
about fiber evidence from the investigators who Wood said didn't
disclose all they knew about the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney said he also objected to questioning about Patsy
Ramsey's concern for 13-year-old Burke's security at school. Wood
said that questioning did nothing to help prosecutors find the
6-year-old beauty queen's killer.
</P>
<P>
   Beckner earlier Monday said investigators were planning to focus
on forensic evidence and questions about the Ramseys' book, ''The
Death of Innocence,'' in which they defend themselves and write
about people they consider suspects.
</P>
<P>
   JonBenet was found beaten and strangled on Dec. 26, 1996, in the
basement of her family's Boulder home. No suspect has ever been
named, though Beckner said her parents remain under suspicion. The
Ramseys have denied any involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Police first interviewed the Ramseys separately in April 1997
after months of negotiations. They were questioned separately again
in June 1998.
</P>
<P>
   A grand jury was convened in 1998 to investigate the slaying but
disbanded without an indictment. Critics claim police botched the
case early in the investigation and were overly deferential to the
Ramseys, who now live in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Before Monday's interviews began, Patsy Ramsey said she could
not envision a question the couple would not answer.
</P>
<P>
   ''They say they need our help,'' she said. ''We're here to
help.''
</P>
<P>
   The Boulder police team that met with the Ramseys on Monday is
much different from the team that investigated JonBenet's slaying
in 1996 and 1997. Beckner has replaced Tom Koby as chief, and three
of the top investigators have left the department.

<HEADLINE> Five men indicted on charges they ran sports betting operations  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Five men were indicted Monday on charges
they ran sports betting operations in three counties, according to
the state attorney general's office.
</P>
<P>
   Tung T. Nguyen, 28, and Truyen T. Vo, 35, both of East Hanover;
Tung V. Nguyen, 32, of Plainfield; and Tu Van Doan, 32, and Tuan M.
Nguyen, 34, both of South Plainfield, were indicted, the attorney
general's office said.
</P>
<P>
   Tung T. Nguyen and Vo were indicted on charges they promoted
gambling and possessed gambling records on Nov. 17, 1998 in East
Hanover, Morris County and Bernardsville, Somerset County,
authorities said. Vo was also indicted on charges of filing
fraudulent state income tax returns in the years 1995-98 and
failing to pay state income tax for those years, according to
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Van Doan, Tuan Nguyen and Tung V. Nguyen were indicted on
similar gambling charges related to events on Dec. 29, 1998 in
South Plainfield, Middlesex County, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   All of the charges carry up to five years in jail and fines of
$15,00 for each count.
</P>
<P>
   An attorney general's office spokeswoman said the indictments
did not specify what type of sporting events they defendants
accepted bets on.

<HEADLINE> Emergency Landing Made at LAX  </HEADLINE>
By ERICA WERNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The front of a Boeing 747 engine that broke
apart shortly after takeoff had been damaged, investigators said
Monday, and they were trying to determine whether a bird could have
been pulled into the engine.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses on a state beach said they heard loud bangs and saw
flames shooting from one engine before watching a large cone-shaped
exhaust assembly and two other chunks of metal fell from the KLM
Royal Dutch Airlines jet Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The four-engine jet, bound for Amsterdam for 449 people aboard,
circled over the ocean to dump fuel, then landed safely at the
airport.
</P>
<P>
   There were no injuries, and passengers applauded as the pilot
set the plane down on the runway.
</P>
<P>
   After inspectors looked over the jet Monday morning, National
Transportation Safety Board investigator Richard Parker a bird
should not have caused the back of the engine to fall away.
Inspectors also didn't see any feathers in the engine, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There could be a number of things, such as maybe a panel
coming loose, or metal fatigue, or something else,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But spokesmen for KLM and for the Federal Aviation
Administration said they were still focusing on the possibility
that a bird could have become caught in the engine.
</P>
<P>
   Inspections showed the engine's intake cowling and fan blades
were also damaged, said Doug Killian, a spokesman for Northwest
Airlines, which has a partnership with KLM.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the FAA ordered maintenance examinations for
the same type of engine, manufactured by General Electric Co.,
focusing on a part called the compressor spool.
</P>
<P>
   GE spokesman Rick Kennedy said a company field representative
was on the scene but had not yet determined what happened to the
engine, but he said a compressor spool was not involved.
</P>
<P>
   ''Drawing a correlation between the two is outrageously
irresponsible,'' Kennedy said. He said a problem with the spool
would result in engine failure, a different reaction than what
happened to the KLM jet.
</P>
<P>
   Air traffic controllers saw the exhaust cone fall and warned
Flight 602's pilot, whose flight instruments were recording
vibrations from the damaged engine, KLM spokesman Hugo Baas said.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot shut down the engine and dumped 83 tons of fuel over
the ocean so the plane would not exceed the maximum weight allowed
for landing, Baas said. He said the plane could fly safely to
Europe with three or even two engines, but the airline's policy is
to play it safe and land when there is an engine problem.
</P>
<P>
   Some passengers could hear and see signs of trouble from their
seats.
</P>
<P>
   ''During takeoff there were several loud noises, like loud pops
that shuddered quite a bit and I thought at the time, 'It's not a
good sign. It's not a good way to start a flight,''' passenger
Joane Slead told KCAL-TV.
</P>
<P>
   The passengers spent Sunday night in hotels and were put on
other flights Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Dockweiler State Beach, at the bottom of a slope at the
airport's west end, is popular with picnickers, joggers and
bicyclists.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Paquette and his wife, Sheila, were walking their dogs
when the plane took off. Paquette told the Los Angeles Times one of
the plane's engines appeared to backfire three times, shooting out
flames.
</P>
<P>
   ''On the third one, two huge chunks of metal blew right off the
back of the engine. One looked like the hood of a car,'' Paquette
said. ''There was a big blast of orange fire coming out of the
back. It was pretty scary. We said, 'Oh, my God.'''
</P>
<P>
   About 1,000 flights a day take off over the stretch of shore,
according to airport officials. Ken Johnson, a spokesman for Los
Angeles County Department of Beaches and Harbors, said he wasn't
aware of any previous incident where pieces of a plane fell on the
beach, or where the airport's proximity caused problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's been no reason for alarm in the past,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian State Urged in Morocco  </HEADLINE>
By MOHAMED MOUSTAID
<TEXT>
<P>
   AGADIR, Morocco (AP) -- Muslim and Christian religious leaders
joined a gathering of foreign ministers from Muslim nations for the
first time Monday, demanding sovereignty over Jerusalem, part of
marathon efforts by Yasser Arafat to rouse support for the
Palestinian cause.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign ministers from 16 countries ended their one-day
conference by calling for world recognition of a Palestinian state
with Jerusalem as its capital. They also appealed to the United
States not to transfer its Israeli embassy from Tel Aviv to
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The group, called The Al Quds (Jerusalem) Committee, released a
statement calling for ''equitable peace'' and continued
negotiations. It did not mention a date for when the Palestinians
should declare statehood.
</P>
<P>
   ''There can be no peace unless Palestinian Muslims and
Christians recover their holy city,'' said Attallah Hana, a leading
Greek Orthodox figure in Jerusalem, one of a delegation of Muslim
holy figures at the session.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat is under growing pressure to make concessions on
Jerusalem after the Camp David peace summit with Israel fell apart
last month over the fate of the city's eastern sector. Amid a
flurry of diplomatic activity since, President Clinton was to meet
Tuesday with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, whose officials have
been drawing up proposals over Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat refused to be squeezed, calling Jerusalem ''the key to
peace and war in the Middle East.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We refuse any sort of pressure that would lead to a
sovereignty other than the Palestinian, Arab, Islamic and Christian
sovereignty of the city,'' he told ministers at the opening
session, warning of the ''danger of the 'Judaization' and
occupation which hangs over al-Quds.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We have made sacrifices to build the peace of the brave,''
Arafat added. ''But that doesn't mean we will accept concessions on
any of our rights on our occupied territory and, above all, on
Jerusalem.''
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians were seeking a firm voice of support at the
meeting in Agadir, an Atlantic coastal resort town more than 200
miles from Rabat. The Jerusalem Committee, part of the Organization
of the Islamic Conference, is designed to protect the Arab and
Muslim character of Jerusalem. It has never before invited
religious figures to attend.
</P>
<P>
   In Paris, Israel's acting foreign minister told his French
counterpart, Hubert Vedrine, that Europe should ''tell Arafat tough
truths,'' the Israeli Foreign Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Arafat will have to make fateful decisions if he wishes to
achieve an agreement which will end the conflict,'' the Israeli
Foreign Ministry quoted Shlomo Ben-Ami as telling Vedrine.
</P>
<P>
   After peace talks collapsed at Camp David, Clinton said that
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak was more flexible than Arafat
during the talks, and said that Washington could reward Barak by
moving its embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Transferring the embassy would bolster Israel's claim to the
city -- which would anger the Palestinians, who hope to establish
their capital in east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The committee said it opposed such a move and ''asked the United
States administration not to consider this resolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel offered Arafat limited Palestinian sovereignty over some
areas in east Jerusalem during the Camp David summit. But Arafat
refused, demanding full sovereignty, particularly over Muslim and
Christian holy sites in the Old City.
</P>
<P>
   Morocco's King Mohammed VI said Jerusalem was the ''cause of all
Muslims in the world.'' He said he was ''convinced that ... Clinton
is determined to use all his weight'' to help achieve peace.
</P>
<P>
   Morocco presides over the Jerusalem Committee, whose members are
Bangladesh, Egypt, Guinea, Iraq, Iran, Indonesia, Jordan, Lebanon,
Mauritania, Morocco, Niger, the Palestinian Authority, Pakistan,
Syria, Senegal and Saudi Arabia.

<HEADLINE> Fire Forces Evacuations in Montana  </HEADLINE>
By BECKY BOHRER
<TEXT>
<P>
   RED LODGE, Mont. (AP) -- A fast-moving wildfire closed the scenic
Beartooth Highway to Yellowstone National Park and threatened up to
150 houses Monday, some of them million-dollar trophy homes in the
Montana woods.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, a firestorm in an Idaho forest destroyed most of the
buildings at a guest ranch, and a second guest ranch was ordered
evacuated.
</P>
<P>
   The fire near Red Lodge became the No. 1 firefighting priority
in Montana, but ground crews with shovels might not be on the job
before Tuesday because so many other blazes across the West are
demanding their attention.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even if we got everything we want, it may not be enough,''
Forest Service Ranger Rand Herzberg told exasperated residents.
''This is going to be a tough one, folks.''
</P>
<P>
   Les Linn, 76, said he packed up and got out of his house when
the fire was about half a mile away.
</P>
<P>
   ''We loaded up the back of the pickup,'' Linn said. ''The thing
I made sure I got first were my guns.''
</P>
<P>
   The Willie fire -- so named because Willie Nelson was headlining
a music festival in Red Lodge -- started Sunday when a motorcycle
crashed and caught fire a few miles south of town on the Beartooth
Highway that leads into the northeastern corner of Yellowstone. The
fire quickly grew to 3,000 acres on the west side of the highway,
which was closed on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Many tourists had to find another way out of the park after the
closure of the 65-mile route to Red Lodge.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're moving everybody back toward Yellowstone Park, telling
them to turn around,'' said a spokeswoman for the Montana Highway
Patrol.
</P>
<P>
   Flames were just feet from some of the evacuated houses.
</P>
<P>
   ''One side of the road has homes, the other side has fire,''
said fire information officer Scott Fitzwilliams.
</P>
<P>
   A few of the houses evacuated were worth as much as $1 million,
but most were middle-class homes, said Sheriff Luke Schroder.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, the fire six miles south of Red Lodge was moving
toward the resort town of some 1,875 people, but it changed
direction with a shift in the wind.
</P>
<P>
   Some hospital and nursing home patients were moved from Red
Lodge to Billings as a precaution. However, Red Lodge schools
planned to open as scheduled on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gusty wind in Idaho on Sunday turned one of the blazes in the
Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness into a firestorm that
raced six miles and burned 21 of the 29 buildings at the Pistol
Creek Ranch. The main lodge at the guest ranch was unharmed, but 17
private cabins were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   The area had been evacuated long before, and no injuries were
reported. The fire was one of a group of blazes that have blackened
about 142,000 acres.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities ordered the evacuation of another guest ranch 11
miles away and recommended evacuation of a third.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, fire lines were widened in the Black Hills of South
Dakota, where a blaze has consumed 64,900 acres. Gusts reached 40
mph Monday at Rapid City, about 25 miles northeast of the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities established a 24-hour hot line for people with
information on anything suspicious in the area of Jewel Cave
National Monument, where the fire started on Thursday. Officials
have said an arsonist may be to blame.
</P>
<P>
   Mount Rushmore National Memorial was at least 13 miles from the
fire's eastern edge.

<HEADLINE> BCA Classic Makeup Date Proposed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLACKSBURG, Va. (AP) -- Virginia Tech, ESPN and the Black Coaches
Association proposed Monday that Dec. 1 should be the makeup date
for the BCA Classic. However, Georgia Tech hasn't decided whether
it wants to play the game.
</P>
<P>
   Severe thunderstorms and lightning forced game and school
officials to cancel Sunday night's game at Lane Stadium just as the
teams were lined up for the opening kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Giles, president of the organization that produces the game
for the coaches' group, said officials decided to release the
tentative date after being inundated with questions about a makeup
game.
</P>
<P>
   If the schools do not play, the financial loss in ticket
receipts and revenues from sponsorships could amount to more than
$2 million, Giles said.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Stamus, sports information director at Georgia Tech, said
Monday night the school hasn't decided whether to make up the game
after playing rival Georgia on Nov. 25. It wasn't immediately clear
if the Yellow Jackets were legally obligated to meet Virginia Tech
on a different date.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech athletic director Dave Braine said Sunday night
that he wasn't inclined to schedule a makeup game.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think it's a good idea,'' he said. ''Our reasons for
playing a preseason game were because we had an inexperienced
quarterback. He will have 11 games by then.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yellow Jackets, seeking to replace Heisman runner-up Joe
Hamilton, were hoping to get their first look at George Godsey
against the Hokies.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Godsey will make his first college start Saturday against
Central Florida.

<HEADLINE> Urologist charged with murdering her parents  </HEADLINE>
AP Photo
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHATHAM, N.J. (AP) - By all accounts, Idella Kathleen Hagen was
in the middle of a brilliant career in medicine. A Harvard Medical
School graduate, Hagen became the first female resident to
specialize in urology at a Massachusetts hospital, and later broke
ground as the first woman to head a urology division at any
hospital in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years ago, however, Hagen abandoned the medical profession
for reasons unknown and went to the U.S. Virgin Islands, officials
say.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities are delving into her past for answers after charging
Hagen, 54, with smothering her elderly parents in their beds in the
home she had shared with them for a month.
</P>
<P>
   Morris County authorities declined to speculate on a motive for
the alleged slayings Monday and would not say if Hagen had
confessed. Superior Court Judge Reginald Stanton refused to make a
probable cause affidavit in Hagen's case public, saying it
contained prejudicial information against Hagen.
</P>
<P>
   Hagen was arrested Saturday after calling police to the modest
home with an overgrown yard she shared with parents Idella Hagen,
92, and James Hagen, 86, and reported they had died. The parents
were found in their pajamas in their twin beds, and had been dead
for at least several days, said Capt. Christopher Linne, spokesman
for the Morris County Prosecutor's Office.
</P>
<P>
   The parents ''had probably the normal ailments people of that
age would have,'' but were not dying of a specific illness, Linne
said.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors who had recently spoken to Hagen said she was
depressed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I remember suggesting that she see a therapist, and she said
'no,''' neighbor Laura Tucker told The Star-Ledger of Newark. ''But
later she called back and asked for the phone number.''
</P>
<P>
   Hagen had told Tucker and her husband, Scott, that she was
having a hard time coping after a recent divorce and was unsure
what to do about her career.
</P>
<P>
   ''I suggested she go to an employment agency. She sighed 'Oh
boy,''' Scott Tucker said. ''The feeling was, she didn't think
she'd get a great career by visiting an employment agency.''
</P>
<P>
   Hagen began her career in medicine at Rutgers' Medical School,
which is now the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, part of the
University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   She transferred to Harvard Medical School in 1971 and graduated
in 1973 under the name Kathleen Hagen Cook, Harvard spokeswoman
Judith Montminy said. She then spent six years as a resident at
Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, becoming the first woman
to specialize in urology, hospital spokeswoman Michelle Marcella
said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, she spent six months as an instructor in surgery at
Harvard Medical School, then returned to serve a clinical
fellowship in surgery at Massachusetts General, Marcella said.
</P>
<P>
   She moved on to Rutgers Medical School, where she became chief
of the division of urology in 1982, the first woman to head a
urology division at an American medical school, UMDNJ spokeswoman
Susan Preston said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987 she went to part-time status and in 1992 took an unpaid
leave from the job, Preston said. School records do not list a
reason for the leave, Preston said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say she went to the U.S. Virgin Islands and managed
a hotel that has since gone out of business. She moved in with her
parents in July, Linne said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's obviously a tragedy. It's obviously a shock,'' Hagen's
ex-husband, William Tyrrell of Stuart, Fla., said on Monday. He
said he had not been in contact with Hagen and declined further
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Hagen is being held at the Morris County Correctional Facility
in Morris Township on $2.5 million bail. Her arraignment is
scheduled for Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Georgia Suspends Receiver Greer  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. (AP) -- Georgia suspended senior receiver Michael
Greer for the first five games of the season on Monday for
violating team rules.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Jim Donnan did not specify the reason for the suspension
just five days before the 10th-ranked Bulldogs will open the season
at home against defending I-AA national champion Georgia Southern.
</P>
<P>
   ''Taking disciplinary action on any player is always
unpleasant,'' Donnan said in a statement. ''However, abiding by
team rules and policies are part of being a member of this football
program. Michael understands that he made a mistake and is willing
to pay the price. And I'm confident he'll still be a valuable
member of our team when he returns.''
</P>
<P>
   Greer, a three-year letterman from Athens, has 49 receptions for
738 yards and five touchdowns in his career. He also has returned
38 punts for 299 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ''I made a mistake and for that I apologize to the coaches and
my teammates,'' Greer said. ''I'm ready to pay the price and work
my way back so I can make a contribution to the goals that have
been set by this team.''
</P>
<P>
   While Greer is one of the team's most experienced receivers,
Georgia should have little trouble filling his spot.
</P>
<P>
   Terrence Edwards was the top receiver as a freshman with 53
receptions for 772 yards and nine touchdowns. The Bulldogs also
have a talented 1999 class of pass-catchers: Durell Robinson and
Reggie Brown, who sat out last season because of academic problems,
and redshirt freshmen Michael Johnson and Damien Gary.

<HEADLINE> Rider Pledges To Behave Himself  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. (AP) -- Newly signed Los Angeles Lakers guard
Isaiah Rider pledged Monday to end the tardiness problems that have
plagued him since his first NBA practice in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's up to me to dig myself out of the hole,'' Rider said at
an introductory news conference. ''We'll see in seven or eight
months what the outcome is.
</P>
<P>
   ''To me, this is an easy transition -- come in, do my job and be
a good citizen.''
</P>
<P>
   Rider, 29, said he will live in a location equally convenient to
the Lakers' practice facility in El Segundo near Los Angeles
International Airport, and Staples Center in downtown Los Angeles,
where the team plays its home games.
</P>
<P>
   He also said his new home would enable him to drive on surface
streets, avoiding the crowded freeways.
</P>
<P>
   ''An adjustment of 20 or 30 minutes a day in my life will be the
significant part of my turnaround,'' Rider said. ''Coaches know I
don't come dragging in in the morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, upon Rider's arrival, general manager Mitch Kupchak
was casting doubt about the return of free-agent forward Glen Rice,
saying, ''I wouldn't say it was likely,'' that Rice will be
re-signed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I also wouldn't say it's not going to happen, either,''
Kupchak said. ''We're half the equation. He's the other half of the
equation. If we were both on the same page, then he'd be back here
or he'd be gone by now.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice, who became a free agent at the conclusion of the playoffs,
appeared on his way to the New York Knicks as part of a four-team
deal last week, but the transaction fell through.
</P>
<P>
   It was to be a sign-and-trade deal, with the Lakers receiving
forward Christian Laettner from Detroit and center Chris Dudley
from New York and giving up Rice, forward-center Travis Knight,
guards Tyronn Lue and John Celestand and a first-round draft pick.
</P>
<P>
   Rider's constant tardiness caused him to clash with his coaches
in Atlanta last season and Portland before that. He was also late
to his first professional practice seven years ago with the
Minnesota Timberwolves.
</P>
<P>
   Kupchak said Rider demonstrated sincerity about changing his
ways by rejecting Miami's $2.25 million contract offer last week
before signing with the Lakers for $736,000 -- the minimum salary
for players with seven years experience.
</P>
<P>
   ''To me, it's the first step,'' Kupchak said. ''He's
acknowledging he's looked at the situation, he knows what he needs
and he's made a sacrifice, which is probably the most important
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Rider said it wasn't a difficult decision to accept the lower
offer.
</P>
<P>
   ''For me, it wasn't about money,'' he said. ''This is an
opportunity I thought I couldn't pass up, with premier players, a
good supporting cast and an organization that's been No. 1 for
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Rider and Kupchak said the one-year contract will provide
sufficient motivation for the 6-foot-5 player to solve his
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have my head on straight,'' he said. ''I'm really happy,
confident and not reluctant to be in this situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Rider averaged 19.3 points, 4.3 rebounds and 3.7 assists for
Atlanta last season, near his career averages of 18.1 points, 4.1
rebounds and 2.9 assists. The Hawks waived him a month before the
season ended.

<HEADLINE> Nader Petition Theft Casts Doubts  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- Ralph Nader barely met Monday's deadline
for filing to get on Wyoming's general election ballot, but the
theft of nearly 650 petition signatures on his behalf is casting
doubt on whether the Green Party presidential hopeful's name will
appear at all.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Nader's ballot status is also in question in
neighboring South Dakota because he missed the June 20 filing
deadline. But his lawyers told a federal judge Monday that he
should be put on the ballot anyway because the early filing
deadline amounts to an unconstitutional restriction on the ability
of third-party candidates to collect the required signatures.
</P>
<P>
   Nader failed to file the 2,602 signatures required of
independent candidates.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Charles Kornmann said he would issue a
ruling Tuesday, the deadline for the secretary of state to tell
counties what information should be on ballots for the Nov. 7
election.
</P>
<P>
   In Wyoming, someone walked off with a clipboard full of
signatures after being handed it to sign at a Laramie restaurant
last Thursday, according to Nader volunteer Roberta
Harper-McIntosh.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we had those signatures, we'd be a little more
comfortable,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters turned in about 4,000 signatures to state election
officials just one minute before Monday evening's filing deadline,
said Deputy Secretary of State Pat Arp.
</P>
<P>
   They had hoped to deliver between 5,000 and 6,000 -- just in
case.
</P>
<P>
   The Secretary of State's Office requires the signatures of 2
percent of the voting population, or 3,484 certified signatures, to
put a candidate or party on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will begin the petition-checking process right away and
should know within a few days,'' Arp said.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Environmentalist Sentenced  </HEADLINE>
By NATALIA PARRA
<TEXT>
<P>
   ACAPULCO, Mexico (AP) -- A peasant leader and award-winning
environmentalist was convicted on drug and weapons charges Monday
and sentenced to six years in prison. Human rights and
environmental groups immediately denounced the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities charged that Rodolfo Montiel and his supporters were
protecting marijuana plants and that he and Teodoro Cabrera Garcia
admitted belonging to guerrilla groups.
</P>
<P>
   Montiel has claimed the charges were lodged in retaliation for
his work as leader of a rural ecological group in Mexico's Pacific
coast state of Guerrero.
</P>
<P>
   Cabrera Garcia received a 10-year sentence on drug and illegal
arms possession charges Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We profoundly regret what happened today,'' said Cristian
Rojas, education coordinator for Amnesty International's Mexico
office. ''This represents a step backward in the process of
obtaining justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Rojas told The Associated Press that the court's action will
provoke ''international pressure even greater than what has already
existed.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We will pursue this case until they are freed,'' said Rojas,
who noted that Amnesty's Washington office already has petitioned
Mexico's President-elect Vicente Fox to intervene. Fox takes office
on Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Montiel and Cabrera Garcia were detained on May 2, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Montiel's group forms human chains to stop logging trucks from
passing through Guerrero. He is widely considered by environmental
groups to be a fearless crusader for trees. He and his supporters
believe old-growth forests in Guerrero are being excessively
logged.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the 44-year-old Montiel was one of seven recipients
worldwide of the $125,000 Goldman prize, given by the San
Francisco-based Goldman Environmental Foundation in recognition for
efforts to preserve the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty, which has declared Montiel a prisoner of conscience,
and Mexico's Human Rights Center claim that both Montiel and
Cabrera Garcia have suffered brutal torture at the hands of police
trying to extract confessions from them.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SIOUX CITY, Iowa (AP) -- Gene Sherman, a Sioux City sports
broadcaster, died Sunday in South Sioux City, Neb., following a
lengthy illness with cancer. He was 78.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman was the voice of the Sioux City Soos baseball team in
his early broadcasting years, then he became known widely as the
sports director for KMNS Radio and KCAU-TV.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1999, he was inducted into the Greater Siouxland
Athletic Association Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman received the Iowa Sportscaster of the Year Award in
1982, the distinguished service award from the Iowa High School
Athletic Directors Association.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman was the voice of the Morningside College Chiefs from
1950-65. He took over the Briar Cliff College basketball
play-by-play duties in 1975 and continued broadcasting the games
through the 1996-97 season.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Sioux City Nov. 13, 1921. He graduated in 1940
from Central High School and later the University of Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   A friend, Sheldon Singer, had taken a job as the first program
director at radio station KCOM, which signed on the air in 1949.
Sherman tagged along and helped Singer broadcast Sioux City Soos
baseball games. Not long after, Sherman went to work full-time for
the station, which became KMNS.
</P>
<P>
   He started broadcasting on television in 1956 as the host of a
weekly bowling show. He joined the station full-time in 1959, and
was named sports director at KCAU in 1961. Sherman, who was known
as ''Coach,'' retired in 1985. He also broadcast sports for KTIV
until 1994.

<HEADLINE> Atlanta Claims Wiley Off Waivers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Desperate for help on the defensive line, the
Atlanta Falcons claimed former Carolina Panthers defensive end
Chuck Wiley off waivers on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Wiley, who was released Sunday, started 16 games last year as
the Panthers' right defensive end. He made 67 tackles but had no
sacks.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons have major concerns with their pass rush. Starting
right end Brady Smith has been sidelined with a pulled groin for
two weeks. He missed practice again Monday and is doubtful for
Sunday's season opener against the San Francisco 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's injury forced Atlanta to start defensive tackles Ed
Jasper and Travis Hall at left end in the last two preseason games.
The picture was further clouded, though, when Jasper twisted his
right knee and ankle in a 31-20 preseason win at Jacksonville last
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Kerney, still listed as the Falcons starter at left end,
has played the last two games on the right side.
</P>
<P>
   Wiley, who had no sacks in 1999, lost his job when Carolina
signed Chuck Smith, second on the Falcons' career sacks list, to a
five-year, $21 million contract over six months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through his rookie training camp, Wiley won a starting
job. He missed the entire 1998 season, though, after rupturing his
Achilles' tendon in a preseason game at Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Wiley, a third-round draft choice out of Louisiana State in
1998, started three years for the Tigers and accumulated 19 sacks.
</P>
<P>
   To make room for Wiley, Atlanta cut defensive end Chris White,
claimed off waivers only four days ago from Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons also signed former Chicago Bears cornerback Terry
Cousin, who started nine games on the right side last year and
finished with 52 tackles, two interceptions, one fumble recovery
and one forced fumble.
</P>
<P>
   Cousin replaces Michael Booker, who was cut Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Guard Evan Pilgrim was released Monday when the Falcons claimed
Chris Banks off waivers from Denver. Banks started one of the 16
games he played in last year.

<HEADLINE> Millwood Breaks Nose in Practice  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Braves pitcher Kevin Millwood wound up with a
broken nose and deviated septum while working on his bunting in the
indoor batting cage at Turner Field before Monday night's game
against the Cincinnati Reds.
</P>
<P>
   Millwood bunted the ball and it bounced back up and hit him in
the nose, said team spokesman Jim Schultz. He is still expected to
make his scheduled start Thursday against the Reds in the finale of
a four-game series.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Saints Waive 4 Players, Claim 4  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- A day after the New Orleans Saints made
mandatory cuts to bring the roster down to 53 players, the team
continued shuffling its lineup Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Saints waived defensive end Uhuru Hamiter, defensive tackle
Robert Newkirk, wide receiver Ryan Thelwell and safety Gerald
Vaughn, team spokesman Greg Bensel said.
</P>
<P>
   The team claimed defensive tackle Martin Chase, defensive end
Marques Douglas, cornerback Todd Franz and running back Jerald
Moore off waivers.
</P>
<P>
   Chase, 6-foot-2 and 310 pounds, was drafted by the Baltimore
Ravens with its first pick in the fifth round of the 1998 NFL
draft. He saw limited action in 1999, making two tackles.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas, 6-2, 270, signed with the Baltimore Ravens as a free
agent in 1999 and spent 14 of 16 games on the Ravens' practice
squad. He was sent to the Rhein Fire of NFL Europe last spring and
finished tied for second in the league with nine sacks. He also had
21 tackles and two forced fumbles to help Rhein win the World Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Franz, 6-0, 194, was drafted by the Detroit Lions in the fifth
round of this year's draft. A three-year starter at Tulsa, he had
182 tackles and five interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Moore, 5-9, 230, was signed by the Oakland Raiders as a free
agent in March. He did not play in 1999, spending training camp and
the preseason with St. Louis. He was selected by the Rams in the
third round of the 1996 NFL draft.

American in Peru To Get New Trial
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- More than four years after hooded military judges
convicted American Lori Berenson of planning a rebel attack -- raising an outcry
from Washington -- Peru's military overturned her life sentence and cleared the
way for a new, civilian trial, officials said Monday. The 30-year-old New York
native was found guilty of treason by the secret tribunal in January 1996 for
allegedly helping the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement plan an attack on
Peru's Congress. The attack was foiled by Peruvian authorities.

   DALLAS (AP) -- With not even a hint of rain to settle the dust, North Texas

during the Dust Bowl days of the Depression. Lawns are burned, farmers and
ranchers have lost an estimated $595 million and reservoirs are shrinking fast,
even though rainfall for the year is close to normal. It's not just dry; it's
hot. Today was the year's 36th day of 100-degree temperatures in Dallas-Fort

Caesareans on the Rise Again

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Caesarean sections started dropping slowly in the early

the rise again. With Caesareans inching back up to 22 percent of U.S. births,
the nation's leading obstetricians' group is issuing new guidelines to reduce
unnecessary C-sections and reserve the surgery for mothers and babies who truly
need it. There are many suspects in the C-section rise -- state-by-state
variation particularly suggests doctors' habits sometimes can overshadow medical
need.

Airline Ruled Partly Liable in Asthma Death

<HEADLINE> Judge: Take Lindland to Sydney  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE ROBINSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Greco-Roman wrestler Matt Lindland is back on the
U.S. Olympic team, and Keith Sieracki is off it. For now.
</P>
<P>
   A judge ordered the U.S. Olympic Committee on Monday to take
Lindland to the Sydney Games, the latest reversal in a lengthy
dispute that has bounced between arbitrators and the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Lindland lost to Sieracki in the 167&AMP;frac12;-pound class at the
Greco-Roman wrestling trials in June and in a final arbitrator's
decision last week.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. District Judge B. Zagel ruled Monday that an
arbitration ruling that led to a rematch -- with Lindland winning --
was upheld by an appeals court and should settle the matter.
</P>
<P>
   A second arbitration held in Colorado was decided in Sieracki's
favor on Thursday, but Zagel said it has not been confirmed by the
courts.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an old proposition -- judges trump arbitrators when they
have jurisdiction,'' said Zagel, who stayed his order until 3 p.m.
Tuesday to give the USOC time to go to the 7th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   USOC attorney Irving B. Levinson said he would consult with the
committee before determining whether the ruling would be appealed.
Meanwhile, Sieracki is trying to get an order from a federal court
in Colorado upholding the arbitration that went his way.
</P>
<P>
   The wrangling goes back to the Olympic trials in June, when
Sieracki beat Lindland 2-1 on a referee's decision after overtime.
Lindland protested the match that decided the best-of-three series,
saying Sieracki tripped him, in violation of wrestling rules.
</P>
<P>
   After Lindland's protests were denied twice by USA Wrestling, he
appealed to an arbitrator, who ruled there should be a rematch.
Lindland beat Sieracki 8-0 in the Aug. 14 rematch.
</P>
<P>
   Sieracki then filed his own appeal. But hours later, the 7th
Circuit decided that Lindland, not Sieracki, should get the Olympic
berth.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys were girding for the possibility of more court action
in the tangled case.
</P>
<P>
   Sieracki was rated as the top wrestler for 2000-01 by Team USA
and USA Wrestling. But Lindland, who is working out with the U.S.
team, contends he should have been chosen.
</P>
<P>
   The official deadline to submit rosters for next month's Olympic
games was Friday, but the USOC took the weekend to make a decision.
USOC attorney Levinson argued that, because of the deadline, the
question was now out of USOC's hands.
</P>
<P>
   Lindland's attorney, Kevin B. Duff, said there was still plenty
of time to make a change.

<HEADLINE> KLM Jet Makes Emergency Landing  </HEADLINE>
By ERICA WERNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The front of a Boeing 747 engine that broke
apart shortly after takeoff had been damaged, investigators said
Monday, and they were trying to determine whether a bird could have
been pulled into the engine.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses on a state beach said they heard loud bangs and saw
flames shooting from one engine before watching a large cone-shaped
exhaust assembly and two other chunks of metal fell from the KLM
Royal Dutch Airlines jet Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The four-engine jet, bound for Amsterdam, Netherlands, with 449
people aboard, circled over the ocean to dump fuel, then landed
safely at the airport.
</P>
<P>
   There were no injuries, and passengers applauded as the pilot
set the plane down on the runway.
</P>
<P>
   After inspectors looked over the jet Monday morning, National
Transportation Safety Board investigator Richard Parker said a bird
should not have caused the back of the engine to fall away.
Inspectors also didn't see any feathers in the engine, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There could be a number of things, such as maybe a panel
coming loose, or metal fatigue, or something else,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But spokesmen for KLM and for the Federal Aviation
Administration said they were still focusing on the possibility
that a bird could have become caught in the engine.
</P>
<P>
   Inspections showed the engine's intake cowling and fan blades
were also damaged, said Doug Killian, a spokesman for Northwest
Airlines, which has a partnership with KLM.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the FAA ordered maintenance examinations for
the same type of engine, manufactured by General Electric Co.,
focusing on a part called the compressor spool.
</P>
<P>
   GE spokesman Rick Kennedy said a company field representative
was on the scene but had not yet determined what happened to the
engine, but he said a compressor spool was not involved.
</P>
<P>
   ''Drawing a correlation between the two is outrageously
irresponsible,'' Kennedy said. He said a problem with the spool
would result in engine failure, a different reaction than what
happened to the KLM jet.
</P>
<P>
   Air traffic controllers saw the exhaust cone fall and warned
Flight 602's pilot, whose flight instruments were recording
vibrations from the damaged engine, KLM spokesman Hugo Baas said.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot shut down the engine and dumped 83 tons of fuel over
the ocean so the plane would not exceed the maximum weight allowed
for landing, Baas said. He said the plane could fly safely to
Europe with three or even two engines, but the airline's policy is
to play it safe and land when there is an engine problem.
</P>
<P>
   Some passengers could hear and see signs of trouble from their
seats.
</P>
<P>
   ''During takeoff there were several loud noises, like loud pops
that shuddered quite a bit and I thought at the time, 'It's not a
good sign. It's not a good way to start a flight,''' passenger
Joane Slead told KCAL-TV.
</P>
<P>
   The passengers spent Sunday night in hotels and were put on
other flights Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Dockweiler State Beach, at the bottom of a slope at the
airport's west end, is popular with picnickers, joggers and
bicyclists.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Paquette and his wife, Sheila, were walking their dogs
when the plane took off. Paquette told the Los Angeles Times one of
the plane's engines appeared to backfire three times, shooting out
flames.
</P>
<P>
   ''On the third one, two huge chunks of metal blew right off the
back of the engine. One looked like the hood of a car,'' Paquette
said. ''There was a big blast of orange fire coming out of the
back. It was pretty scary. We said, 'Oh, my God.'''
</P>
<P>
   About 1,000 flights a day take off over the stretch of shore,
according to airport officials. Ken Johnson, a spokesman for Los
Angeles County Department of Beaches and Harbors, said he wasn't
aware of any previous incident where pieces of a plane fell on the
beach, or where the airport's proximity caused problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's been no reason for alarm in the past,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Expos 9, Diamondbacks 5  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- Orlando Cabrera and Michael Barrett each had
three hits and three RBIs as the Montreal Expos solved Curt
Schilling, beating the Arizona Diamondbacks 9-5 Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling (10-9) had pitched eight straight complete games
against the Expos. He got off to a good start this time, retiring
the first 13 batters, before Montreal caught up to him.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos scored four times in the seventh inning to take a 6-3
lead. Cabrera and Barrett doubled during the rally.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling allowed nine hits and six runs in seven innings. He
struck out seven and walked one.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks lost for the sixth time in seven games.
Montreal won for the second time in its last three games at Olympic
Stadium after losing nine straight at home.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Thurman (4-4) allowed six hits and three runs -- two earned
-- in seven innings. Anthony Telford got six outs for his third
save.
</P>
<P>
   After Tony Womack's RBI triple put Arizona ahead 3-2 in the
seventh, the Expos came back in the bottom half.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Guerrero walked and Geoff Blum singled with one out.
Cabrera doubled to center, just out of the reach of Steve Finley's
leaping attempt at the wall, to score Guerrero with the tying run.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett followed with a drive to right that Danny Bautista
couldn't hold on to for a double, scoring Blum. Cabrera held at
third.
</P>
<P>
   Pinch-hitter Wilton Guerrero hit an RBI single and Peter
Bergeron added a sacrifice fly to make it 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona closed within a run in the eighth on Finley's RBI double
off reliever Steve Kline and Bautista's RBI grounder.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal scored three times in the eighth off reliever Mike
Morgan on Cabrera's two-run single and Barrett's RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Bautista, who drove in three runs, gave Arizona a 2-0 lead with
an RBI single in the second and a run-scoring grounder in the
fourth.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos did not have a runner until Lee Stevens doubled down
the left-field line with one out in the fifth. Blum followed with a
bad-hop single past first baseman Greg Colbrunn that made it 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   With the game tied at 2 in the seventh, Damian Miller hit a
one-out single and advanced to second on Schilling's sacrifice.
Womack followed with a line drive to the gap in right-center for
his league-leading 11th triple.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Guerrero made an outstanding running catch to save a
run from scoring in the second.
</P>
<P>
   With Jay Bell on first and one out, Guerrero raced into the
right-field corner to catch a sinking liner by Luis Gonzalez that
appeared to be a sure extra-base hit.
</P>
<P>
   Bell, who hadn't broken stride as he approached third base,
merely continued directly into the Diamondbacks' dugout, reaching
it before the relay throw doubled him off first.
Notes: Schilling is 13-9 lifetime against the Expos. ...
Schilling's last complete game against Montreal was a 5-2 win at
Bank One Ballpark on Aug. 7. ... The Diamondbacks are 2-5 against
Montreal this season. ... Guerrero has 10 assists.

<HEADLINE> Yankees' Knoblauch's Knee Looks OK  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- A magnetic resonance imaging test on New York
Yankees second baseman Chuck Knoblauch's left knee showed no
damage, manager Joe Torre said Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's fine. He's taking a couple of days off,'' Torre said.
''But he's had a tough year physically.''
</P>
<P>
   The MRI was done Saturday after Knoblauch left his first minor
league rehab game Friday night in Kissimmee, Fla., after being hit
by a pitch on the outside of his left knee.
</P>
<P>
   Torre anticipated seeing Knoblauch on Friday night when the
Yankees return home to play Minnesota, or soon thereafter. ''It
might be the first or the third or the fourth,'' he said. ''We
don't know yet.
</P>
<P>
   ''But I'm planning on having him back,'' Torre added. ''He's
still going to be a benefit for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch's right elbow has bothered him for the past month. An
MRI earlier this month confirmed a previous diagnosis that he has
tendinitis and inflammation in the elbow.
</P>
<P>
   He said his elbow has not improved since starting his rehab at
the Yankees' player development center in Tampa, Fla., two weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch has not played second base for the Yankees since July
24. In 78 games with New York, he's hitting .291 with five home
runs and 22 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Sojo, who was acquired in a trade with Pittsburgh on Aug.
7, is playing second in Knoblauch's absence. Sojo was 2-for-4 with
an RBI in Sunday's win in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sojo is such a good player to have,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Ramiro Mendoza threw 40 pitches off the mound for
the first time Monday in Tampa as part of his throwing program and
reported no problems. Mendoza is on the disabled list with
tendinitis of his right shoulder. He's pitched in 14 games,
including nine starts, this season, with a 7-4 record and 4.25 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll see him Friday,'' Torre said. ''If everything works
well, he'll continue his throwing.''

batters later, Daubach put the Red Sox up 2-1 with his 20th homer,
one shy of his total as a rookie last year.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay tied it 2-2 in the seventh on doubles by Aubrey Huff
and Tyner.

<HEADLINE> Charge: Bengals' Dillon Hit Wife  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Cincinnati Bengals running back Corey Dillon
missed practice Monday following his weekend arrest in a Seattle
suburb after his wife was assaulted.
</P>
<P>
   Dillon, 25, also did not tell the team about his arrest
Saturday. Players were off on Saturday and Sunday, and Dillon told
the team he would be late returning.
</P>
<P>
   ''He had called and his agent had called, but the information
they relayed was not consistent with what I'm hearing,'' general
manager Mike Brown said from home Monday night. ''I just heard the
report (about the arrest) minutes ago. I have nothing to say
concerning that until I know about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Police said the former University of Washington standout was
arrested Saturday afternoon after officers responded to a domestic
violence complaint at a Federal Way, Wash., address.
</P>
<P>
   When officers arrived, they found Dillon's 23-year-old wife
bleeding from the mouth in front of the house. Dillon was in the
driveway, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Dillon was booked into the King County jail for investigation of
fourth-degree assault, but was released later Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the couple was in a car when Dillon struck his wife,
who was driving. She got out of the car and walked one block to the
address where police were summoned. It was not immediately clear
who lived at the house.
</P>
<P>
   Agent Marvin Demoff didn't return a telephone message Monday
night. The Bengals had been told that Dillon would be back for
practice on Tuesday, but that was before they learned of the
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was told he would be returning tomorrow,'' Brown said Monday
night. ''Whether that is the case, it is unclear to me at this
moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Dillon was repeatedly in trouble as a juvenile, prompting him to
slip to the second round in the 1997 draft. He's been arrested
twice while with the Bengals.
</P>
<P>
   He was arrested in March 1998 in Seattle for investigation of
drunken driving. He was later charged with driving under the
influence, negligent driving and driving with a suspended license.
In June 1998, he pleaded guilty to lesser charges of negligent
driving and driving with a suspended license.

<P>
   Earlier this month, Dillon ended a holdout and agreed to a
one-year contract reportedly worth $3 million. As a restricted free
agent, Dillon had threatened to miss the season's first 10 games
and play only in the last six so that he could become an
unrestricted free agent for next season.
</P>
<P>
   In his second preseason game last Friday in Cincinnati, Dillon
rushed six times for 45 yards in a 21-13 loss to Detroit. The
Bengals have a first-week bye and open the season Sept. 10 against
Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Dillon was the leading rusher for the Bengals the last three
years, going over 1,000 yards each season. He broke Jim Brown's
rookie rushing record in 1997 when he picked up 246 yards in a
victory over Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   He holds six school records at Washington.

<HEADLINE> Giants 5, Pirates 4  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Russ Davis led off the ninth with his second
pinch-hit homer of the season and the San Francisco Giants, despite
playing some unaccustomed shaky defense, beat the Pittsburgh
Pirates 5-4 Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Davis hit a 1-0 pitch from reliever Scott Sauerbeck (5-2) into
the left-field seats for his sixth homer, helping the Giants to
their 10th victory in 14 games and sending the Pirates their fifth
consecutive loss.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Embree (2-3) pitched a scoreless eighth inning for the
victor and Robb Nen finished for his 31st save in 36 chances, his
18th in a row.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates, who have the majors' worst record (52-77), lost
their sixth in seven games and 14th in 18 games.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants, who matched their largest lead of the season at 3&AMP;frac12;
games in the NL West, led 3-0 in the first and 4-2 in the second,
but lost the lead as both starter Shawn Estes and their usually
reliable defense had trouble settling down.
</P>
<P>
   After making two errors in 18 games, the Giants made two in two
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Estes's wild pitch in the first led to two runs as Adrian Brown
scored from third and Kevin Young came around from second when
catcher Bobby Estalella's throw sailed off a dugout railing for an
error.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates added a run in the second with the help of shortstop
Rich Aurilia's throwing error. The inning began when Estes failed
to cover the bag on Enrique Wilson's routine grounder to first,
giving Wilson a gift single.
</P>
<P>
   Estalella's passed ball following Warren Morris' leadoff walk in
the third led to Wilson's game-tying RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis Burks gave the Giants their 3-0 lead with a bases-loaded
double down the left-field line in the first. Third baseman Aramis
Ramirez partially dislocated his left shoulder diving for the ball
and left the game.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Mueller added a run-scoring triple for the 4-2 lead in the
second before Pirates starter Todd Ritchie shut out the Giants over
the next five innings.
</P>
<P>
   Estes also found a groove after laboring in the early innings,
finishing with four hitless innings before being lifted for a
pinch-hitter in the eighth. He struck out 10 and walked six, with
three of the four Pirates runs scored by batters he walked.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Giants are 12-2 on Mondays. ... Barry Bonds is tied
with Dave Parker for the second-most homers (88) in Three Rivers
Stadium. Willie Stargell hit 147 from 1970-82. This is Bonds' final
series in three Rivers. ... The Pirates are 0-4 on a seven-game
homestand that runs through Thursday. ... Pittsburgh is 11-24
against the NL West.

<HEADLINE> Sailboat Wreck Suit Goes To Court  </HEADLINE>
By BRUCE SMITH
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -- Libby Cornett choked back tears Monday
describing when she finally heard the distress call sent by the
sailboat Morning Dew after it wrecked on a stormy winter night in
1997, killing her husband, two sons and a younger cousin.
</P>
<P>
   ''I heard Daniel. I heard Daniel saying 'mayday,' '' she
testified, recalling her son's voice. ''I realized at that moment
they didn't have to die.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Cornett, 49, of Hiltons, Va.; sons, Michael Paul, 16,
and Daniel, 13; and cousin Bobby Hurd, 14, of Mountain City, Tenn.,
all died. Their families now are suing the Coast Guard for $35
million.
</P>
<P>
   They might have been saved, but the Coast Guard operated as
''stumbling, bumbling fools,'' the families' lawyer, Gedney Howe,
said as the trial opened in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Cornett has said that before she heard the tape of the
mayday call, it was easier to accept it as an accident. Now, she
says, ''It's a torment to us every passing day.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge David Norton will have to decide when the
search began. The Coast Guard is under no obligation to conduct a
search, but once one starts, the agency must do so in a reasonable
manner. The families contend that did not happen.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Cornett's mayday came at 2:17 a.m. on Dec. 29. The
sailboat had hit one of the Charleston Harbor jetties as a storm
raged.
</P>
<P>
   A Coast Guard petty officer tried to return the call but got no
reply. Later, the officer said he did not hear the word mayday.
</P>
<P>
   Another static-filled radio call came a few minutes later. The
officer said no message could be made out. The families said that
also came from the Morning Dew.
</P>
<P>
   About four hours later, a crewman on a ship coming into
Charleston said he heard a cry for help. A pilot boat returned to
search the area but found nothing.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard did not dispatch its units until about 11 a.m.,
when two of the boys' bodies were found on a nearby beach.
</P>
<P>
   ''This case is not about what the Coast Guard should have
done,'' said government lawyer Debra Kossow.
</P>
<P>
   The response to the voices in the water started before the Coast
Guard was even called and did not constitute a Coast Guard search,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Howe, however, said, ''There is certainly strong evidence in
this instance the harbor pilots responded at least partially on
behalf of the Coast Guard.''
</P>
<P>
   The boys who washed up on the beach showed faint signs of life.
Had the Coast Guard moved more quickly five hours earlier, they
might have been saved, he said.
</P>
<P>
   After the pilot boat reported it found nothing, however, the
Coast Guard aborted the search ''recklessly and without the
slightest degree of care,'' Howe said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Cornett did not know about the distress calls until almost
three months after the wreck and neither did the state Natural
Resources Department, which investigates wrecks of recreational
craft.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Pritcher, the agent investigating for Natural Resources,
testified initial logs from the Coast Guard did not mention the
calls. The Coast Guard said at the time there was nothing the
officer perceived as a distress call.
</P>
<P>
   ''They tried to cover it up,'' Howe told the judge. ''The lied
about it because they knew it was important.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard finally released details of the calls because
they knew they would have to respond to a request under the Freedom
of Information Act filed by The Boating News, Howe said.
</P>
<P>
   In its review of the accident, the National Transportation
Safety Board said Cornett's ''failure to adequately assess, prepare
for and respond to the known risks of the journey into the open
ocean'' most likely caused the crash. Cornett was severely fatigued
and suffering from hypothermia, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   However, the board added: ''Contributing to the loss of life in
this accident was the substandard performance of U.S. Coast Guard
Group Charleston in initiating a search-and-rescue response to the
accident.'' ------

<HEADLINE> American in Peru To Get New Trial  </HEADLINE>
By RICK VECCHIO
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- More than four years after hooded military
judges convicted American Lori Berenson of planning a rebel attack
-- raising an outcry from Washington -- Peru's military overturned
her life sentence and cleared the way for a new, civilian trial,
officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year-old New York native was found guilty of treason by
the secret tribunal in January 1996 for allegedly helping the Tupac
Amaru Revolutionary Movement plan an attack on Peru's Congress. The
attack was foiled by Peruvian authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The tribunal released a statement to The Associated Press saying
that Berenson's sentence was overturned on Aug. 18 and her case was
passed to a civilian court on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   First public word of the decision came earlier in the day in a
statement from Berenson's defense attorney, Grimaldo Achahui, on
Radioprogramas, Peru's leading station. He said she would remain
imprisoned pending the new trial.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have fought to the last moment so that she would be judged
in a civilian court where she will avail of due process with all
guarantees of a right to a defense,'' Achahui said. ''This does not
signify that she will be granted liberty.''
</P>
<P>
   Berenson's case has been a sore point in U.S. relations with
Peru. Washington has repeatedly pressed for a new trial, saying the
secret nature of the court violated her rights. The U.S. government
has also criticized as too harsh the living conditions she has
reportedly been held under in Peruvian prisons.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have maintained that the trial proceedings against her did
not meet due process standards,'' said U.S. Embassy spokesman
Douglas Barnes.
</P>
<P>
   The decision came despite the insistence by President Alberto
Fujimori that Berenson, a former Massachusetts Institute of
Technology student, is a terrorist and will remain in prison.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate comment by Fujimori's administration
about the move. After the announcement, he canceled a scheduled
news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Her parents have also led a campaign for her release that has
raised international concern over the case.
</P>
<P>
   ''Peru has now admitted that Lori Berenson was not a leader of
the MRTA. It knows she was not even a member,'' her father, Mark
Berenson, said at a news conference in New York. ''There is no
basis in truth, or law, for holding Lori another day.''
</P>
<P>
   Also at the conference was her mother, Rhoda, and their legal
adviser in the case, former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark.
</P>
<P>
   ''A fair trial on the charge of terrorism and on those of the
lesser charges, is impossible,'' said Clark.
</P>
<P>
   During her first three years of her sentence, Berenson was held
in the frigid Yanamayo prison, 12,700 feet above sea level in the
Andes. Her parents said she frequently complained of sickness until
she was finally transferred to Socabaya prison, 465 miles southeast
of Lima.
</P>
<P>
   Though Berenson has maintained her innocence, Peruvians caught
in the crossfire of rebel violence during the 1980s and early 1990s
have a difficult time sympathizing with her. She has been vilified
by government officials and the media for her alleged involvement
with the rebels -- a violent leftist group best known for its
invasion of the Japanese ambassador's residence in Lima in December
1996.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels held 72 hostages for four months before Fujimori
ordered a bold rescue that saved all but one of the hostages. All
of the guerrillas were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Before her conviction, Berenson was presented to the news media
in a wild spectacle during which she angrily screamed support for
Peru's poor and shouted, ''There are no criminal terrorists in the
MRTA,'' referring to the rebel group. ''It is a revolutionary
movement.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement was considered by most Peruvians to be an
admission of guilt.
</P>
<P>
   Berenson and her supporters have maintained that she was not
allowed to present evidence at her trial or to question prosecution
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The government maintains that secret military proceedings with
hooded judges were necessary during Peru's bloody battle with
leftist rebels because civilian courts were releasing too many
suspects and judges feared reprisals. The practice was abolished in
late 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Peru's internal war against leftist rebels reduced dramatically
in intensity after the capture of top rebel leaders in 1992, but
more than 3,000 convicted rebels remain in Peru's prisons.
</P>
<P>
   Berenson's case was the subject of an in-depth investigative
story in The Nation magazine's Sept. 4 edition, which appeared
Monday on the U.S.-based publication's web page.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing on never-before released Peruvian police documents
obtained by the magazine, in collaboration with Peruvian
journalists, the article claimed that the case against Berenson was
hastily thrown together based on the uncorroborated testimony of a
lone witness whose version was never challenged.
</P>
<P>
   Although The Nation article acknowledges strong circumstantial
evidence that Berenson was closely associated with the rebel group,
it asserted that little strong evidence existed that Berenson was
an MRTA leader or member.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori has faced increasing pressure to reform Peru's damaged
democracy since his highly questioned re-election in May, which was
marred by irregularities and accusations of fraud. For years,
reforming Peru's judiciary has been high on the list of human
rights groups.

<HEADLINE> Reds 6, Braves 3  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Cincinnati stunned Atlanta's Greg Maddux by
scoring five runs in the first inning, and fill-in starter Ron
Villone pitched the first complete game of his pro career for a 6-3
victory Monday night that knocked the Braves into a tie for first
in the NL East.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Mets defeated Houston 4-2, grabbing a share of the
lead, which had been held exclusively by the Braves since April 26.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta (78-53), trying to extend its already unprecedented
streak of division titles to nine, is only 13-13 in August and has
lost four of its last five. The Reds stopped a seven-game losing
streak at Turner Field dating to Aug. 6, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux (14-8) equaled his career high for most runs allowed in
the first inning, the previous time coming a decade ago when he was
an up-and-coming pitcher with the Chicago Cubs. Pokey Reese led off
the game with a homer and the first six Cincinnati hitters reached.
</P>
<P>
   It could have been worse, too. Brian Jordan made a spectacular
catch in right field for the first out of the game, and center
fielder Andruw Jones threw out Dmitri Young at the plate for the
second out.
</P>
<P>
   Villone (9-7) made his first start since July 22 because Scott
Williamson was placed on the 15-day disabled list before the game
with a sore back. Villone, whose previous nine appearances had been
in relief, had no trouble adapting his former role.
</P>
<P>
   The left-hander gave up only five hits, needing 112 pitches for
the first complete game of his eight-year professional career.
</P>
<P>
   Reese hit the fourth pitch of the game into the left-field
stands, the first time Maddux had surrendered a leadoff homer since
Sept. 28, 1991. It would only get worse for the four-time Cy Young
winner, who has lost five of his last seven decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Stynes singled, Ken Griffey Jr. walked and Dante Bichette
lined an RBI single to right, making it 2-0. Sean Casey followed
with a single that loaded the bases and Young hit a liner that
bounced into the left-field seats for a ground-rule double, driving
in two more runs.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan made a diving catch on Juan Castro's liner down the
right-field line, but Casey trotted home on the sacrifice fly to
make it 5-0. Jason LaRue lined the sixth hit of the inning to
center, but Jones threw out Young by at least 20 feet at the plate.
Villone finally ended the inning with a weak grounder to third.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux held the Reds scoreless over the next seven innings,
allowing just three more hits. But the damage was done.
</P>
<P>
   LaRue hit his third homer leading off the ninth against Scott
Kamienicki for Cincinnati's only other run.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta was held to Paul Bako's solo homer in the third inning
and a sacrifice fly by Chipper Jones in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest highlight of the night for the home fans came in the
ninth, when John Rocker was brought in to face Griffey. The
Cincinnati slugger missed a 96 mph fastball, then flied out to
short right field.
</P>
<P>
   B.J. Surhoff hit an RBI double in the ninth, before Walt Weiss
hit a game-ending flyout.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Maddux has surrendered five runs in the first inning only
two other times, both while still with the Cubs. The first came
July 18, 1987, at San Francisco; the second June 6, 1990, at
Pittsburgh. ... Villone threw a wild pitch in the sixth, giving the
Reds 83 for the season. That ties the club record, set in 1965, and
is only eight short of the NL record held by the 1970 Houston
Astros and 1989 Philadelphia Phillies.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Edgardo Alfonzo hit a three-run homer in the
first inning and Glendon Rusch made it stand up as the New York
Mets beat the Houston Astros 4-2 Monday night and moved into a
first-place tie in the NL East.
</P>
<P>
   New York has won four of five and is a major league-best 30-15
since the All-Star break. Atlanta had held first exclusively since
April 26.
</P>
<P>
   Rusch (9-10) allowed solo homers to former Met Roger Cedeno and
Richard Hidalgo, but pitched around three other extra-base hits.
</P>
<P>
   Houston's Tony Eusebio doubled to give him a team-record 24-game
hitting streak.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets did all of the scoring they needed on the first five
pitches against Brian Powell (1-1). Benny Agbayani singled to
center on a 1-0 pitch and went to third when Derek Bell singled on
the next pitch to snap an 0-for-21 stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Alfonzo then hit a 1-0 pitch into the seats in left center for
his 17th homer and a 3-1 Mets lead.
</P>
<P>
   That's all Rusch would need, although he did pitch out of
trouble a few times. He left the bases loaded in the second inning
and worked around two extra-base hits by Chris Truby.
</P>
<P>
   Rusch stranded Truby after a leadoff triple in the fourth,
striking out Tim Bogar and Powell and getting a groundout from
Julio Lugo after Cedeno walked with two outs. Truby hit a one-out
double in the sixth and was left at second.
</P>
<P>
   The left-hander allowed two runs and seven hits in seven
innings, striking out seven. Mets starters, whose 4.22 ERA is the
best in the league, improved to 4-0 with a 1.70 ERA over the last
five games -- one turn through the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets added an insurance run in the eighth when Jay Payton
doubled, went to third on a groundout and scored when Jose Cabrera
balked. Cabrera broke his hands while standing on the rubber, and
third base umpire Dan Iassogna called the balk.
</P>
<P>
   Turk Wendell pitched two innings for his first save since July
26, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Eusebio doubled in the second inning to extend his hitting
streak and break the team record held by Art Howe (1981) and Luis
Gonzalez (1997). Eusebio wasn't as sharp in the field, however,
throwing a ball away after a walk in the second inning, allowing
Mike Bordick to get to third.
</P>
<P>
   Bordick was running when Powell threw a ball on 3-2 to Todd
Pratt. Eusebio threw to second anyway, and the ball went into
center for an error. It didn't hurt Powell as the Mets left the
bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   Cedeno was playing at Shea Stadium for the first time since
scoring the game-winning run on Robin Ventura's grand slam single
in Game 5 of last year's NLCS against Atlanta. He led off the game
with a homer in his first at-bat in New York since he was traded
for Mike Hampton last winter.
</P>
<P>
   Hidalgo hit his 33rd homer with one out in the third to make it
3-2.
</P>
<P>
   Powell allowed three runs, five hits and six walks in five
innings.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Eusebio, whose hitting streak spans 51 days and 45 Astros
games, has raised his average from .203 to .289 during the streak.
... Mets C Mike Piazza took the day off. ... Houston is 10-18 in
games started by left-handers. ... The Mets have won 18 of 22 at
Shea Stadium and have a major league high 46 wins at home.

<HEADLINE> Defensive End Brayton Suspended  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- Colorado defensive end Tyler Brayton was
suspended indefinitely after a fight with another player during
practice Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Brayton scuffled with freshman tight end Jesse Wallace, who
suffered a mild concussion and a cut to the head, coach Gary
Barnett said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tyler got out of control,'' Barnett said.
</P>
<P>
   The suspension, Barnett said, could be for Saturday's game
against Colorado State, last for longer than Saturday's game or
could even include a game other than that one.
</P>
<P>
   Brayton, a 6-foot-6, 260-pound sophomore, had an impressive
training camp, posting a sack, a fumble recovery and an
interception in the only full scrimmage of the preseason.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Anwawn Jones will start Saturday if Brayton does not.

<HEADLINE> Mariners' Meche May Be Out for Year  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Gil Meche, who came out of a rehabilitation start
at Class A Everett after one inning, probably will not pitch again
this season, Seattle Mariners manager Lou Piniella said Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we'll probably shut him down for the rest of the
year,'' Piniella said. ''His arm feels real tired and real heavy.
We had to shut him down last night.''
</P>
<P>
   Meche lasted only one inning in Sunday's minor league game.
</P>
<P>
   Meche, 21, was supposed to be a mainstay in the Mariners'
rotation this season, but has been limited to 15 starts. He has
been on the disabled list twice this season with a strained right
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Meche made his last start for the Mariners July 4 in Anaheim,
going 5 2-3 innings in a 7-6 loss. He was put on the DL July 31.
</P>
<P>
   Piniella had hoped to add him to his rotation in September.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a little bit of a longshot for us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Piniella said Meche told Mariners officials he had similar
shoulder problems before he signed with the team in 1996. It was
diagnosed as tendinitis then.
</P>
<P>
   Meche has a 4-4 record with a 3.78 ERA in 85 2-3 innings for the
Mariners this season. As a rookie with Seattle last season, he was
8-4 with a 4.73 ERA in 15 starts after being called up in July.

<HEADLINE> NFL Camps Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   It took 11 games last season for Pittsburgh to
replace Kordell
Stewart as starting quarterback. The Steelers aren't even waiting
until the first game this year.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Coach Bill Cowher issued a three-paragraph statement Monday
saying Kent Graham, who previously lost starting jobs with Arizona
and the New York Giants, will start Sunday's season opener against
the Baltimore Ravens.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm just going to go out and play relaxed, because that's how
I play the best,'' Graham said. ''I know in this game, or any game,
if things aren't going well and the coach feels he'll need a spark,
he'll make a change. I don't think that's different from any other
team across the NFL.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham began the 1997 season as starting quarterback with the
Cardinals and with the Giants last year, but couldn't keep his job
either time.
</P>
<P>
   The decision caught Stewart by surprise. Stewart began the
preseason with the quarterback's job to lose.
</P>
<P>
   ''I won't say I was shook up, but was kind of stunned a little
bit,'' Stewart said. ''At the same time, I understood. You can't do
anything but accept it.''
</P>
<P>
   Only 18 months after signing a $27 million contract extension,
Stewart faces an uncertain future with a team that couldn't wait
any longer for him to play his way out of a two-year slump.
</P>
<P>
   Graham was 31-of-57 for 334 yards, three touchdowns and one
interception during the preseason. Stewart was 19-of-55 for 238
yards, one touchdown and two interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not flattered, let's be honest,'' Stewart said. ''The one
thing I hate most is leaving it up to the coaches. When you leave
it up to the coaches, you never know what kind of decision they'll
make.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you outright go out and outperform whomever it is you are
competing against, hands down ... but I left it up to the coaches.
I'm more upset with myself than anybody else because I had the
opportunity and I didn't seize it.''
Bengals:
</P>
<P>
   Running back Corey Dillon missed practice following his weekend
arrest in a Seattle suburb after his wife was assaulted.
</P>
<P>
   Dillon, 25, also did not tell the team about Saturday's arrest.
Players were off Saturday and Sunday, and Dillon told the team he
would be late returning.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the former University of Washington standout was
arrested Saturday afternoon after officers responded to a domestic
violence complaint at a Federal Way, Wash., address.
</P>
<P>
   When officers arrived, they found Dillon's 23-year-old wife
bleeding from the mouth in front of the house. Dillon was in the
driveway, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Dillon was booked into the King County jail for investigation of
fourth-degree assault, but later released.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the couple was in a car when Dillon struck his wife,
who was driving. She got out of the car and walked one block to the
address where police were summoned.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Cincinnati claimed safety Chris Carter and receiver
Danny Farmer off waivers, and waived receiver James Hundon and
safety Lawrence Wright.
</P>
<P>
   The Bengals also extended the contracts of offensive linemen
Brock Gutierrez through 2002, and Jamain Stephens through 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Signed to the practice squad were JoJuan Armour, a second-year
safety from Miami of Ohio; LaVell Boyd, a rookie receiver from
Louisville; Mike Doughty, a second-year offensive tackle from Notre
Dame; Sirr Parker, a first-year cornerback from Texas A&AMP;M, and
Roger Roesler, a rookie offensive guard from Texas.
Cardinals:
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Thomas Jones will start at running back in the season
opener against the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Vince Tobin decided Monday to move Jones, the No. 7
overall pick from Virginia, ahead of Michael Pittman, who started
all four preseason games.
</P>
<P>
   The move could mean rookie running backs will start for both
teams in the opener. The Giants will likely start their top draft
pick, Ron Dayne, chosen 11th overall.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, the second running back selected in the draft, shrugged
off the starting role as no big deal.
</P>
<P>
   ''It doesn't matter whether you start or not,'' he said. ''What
matters is at the end of the game how many yards you have, how many
big plays you have. I'd rather be out there making big plays and
scoring some touchdowns rather than starting just to be starting.''
</P>
<P>
   In the preseason, Jones rushed for 100 yards in 31 carries and
two touchdowns. He also caught six passes for 40 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona also claimed second-year defensive lineman Russell Davis
off waivers from the Chicago Bears, and waived running back
Clarence Williams, who spent all of his 1999 rookie season on the
Cardinals' practice squad.
Vikings:
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Cris Dishman signed a three-year deal that will pay
him about $500,000 this season.
</P>
<P>
   The 13-year veteran who played for Houston, Washington and
Kansas City, was waived by the Chiefs, who were deep in
cornerbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Dishman, whose first workout with the Vikings is Wednesday, will
play in the opener against Chicago on Sunday, coach Dennis Green
said.
</P>
<P>
   Dishman, a two-time Pro Bowler, has been a full-time starter
since 1990 and has 42 career interceptions. He had five
interceptions and 84 tackles last year.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota released linebacker Pete Bercich and replaced him with
linebacker Jim Nelson, who was waived by Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings also signed five players to their practice squad:
tight end Matt Cercone; quarterback Billy Cockerham; tackle Jay
Humphrey; defensive back Don Morgan, and guard Nick O'Brien.
Cowboys:
</P>
<P>
   Dallas signed cornerback Phillippi Sparks to a five-year
contract and expects him to play in the season opener against
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Kareem Larrimore, a rookie cornerback expected to start,
struggled in preseason games, sixth-year safety Charlie Williams
will miss at least two games recovering from offseason knee
surgery, and Kevin Smith retired.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks spent the past seven seasons with the Giants, but hinted
he might retire and didn't sign before training camp.
</P>
<P>
   To make room, the Cowboys waived linebacker Chris Bordano,
acquired from New Orleans in an offseason trade for cornerback
Kevin Mathis. Sparks got a $1.5 million signing bonus and will make
about $500,000 this season.
Browns:
</P>
<P>
   Derrick Alexander, a starting defensive end last season for
Cleveland, was placed on the reserve injured list and won't play
for the Browns again.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is not going to play again,'' coach Chris Palmer said. ''He
has a sprained right ankle and you cannot waive an injured player,
but we presented Derrick with several options. I feel good that he
will be with us in some capacity. Maybe even tomorrow morning.''
</P>
<P>
   That could be as an assistant coach.
</P>
<P>
   The 26-year-old Alexander, selected in the first round of the
1995 draft by Minnesota, signed with Cleveland as a free agent last
year after four seasons with the Vikings.

<HEADLINE> Phillies 3, Rockies 2  </HEADLINE>
By ROB MAADDI
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Bobby Abreu hit his third homer in two games
and Colorado's Todd Helton got three hits to raise his average to
.397 as the Philadelphia Phillies beat the Rockies 3-2 Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Helton's average went up three points. He singled in the first
inning, flied out in the third, and doubled in the fifth and eighth
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Abreu, batting .389 (14-for-36) since moving to the leadoff spot
nine games ago, gave the Phillies a 2-0 lead in the third with his
22nd homer -- a liner off the facing of the upper deck in right
field.
</P>
<P>
   Abreu hit a pair of homers, including a winning, inside-the-park
drive in the 10th in Sunday's 2-1 victory over San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Rockies manager Buddy Bell began serving a two-game suspension
for excessive arguing after his ejection following a bench-clearing
brawl against Atlanta last Tuesday. Bench coach Toby Harrah managed
the team in Bell's absence.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Person (7-4) allowed one run and six hits in seven
innings. He struck out four and walked two.
</P>
<P>
   Person, a hard-luck pitcher with 11 no-decisions, lowered his
ERA to 3.19, fourth in the league and fifth in the majors. He's
allowed two runs or fewer in seven of his no-decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Brantley pitched a scoreless ninth for his 21st save in 25
attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Lieberthal's broken-bat, bloop single gave the Phillies a
1-0 lead in the first. Doug Glanville singled, stole second and
scored on Lieberthal's two-out hit.
</P>
<P>
   Masato Yoshii (5-14) allowed two runs and six hits in six
innings. He matched a season-high with seven strikeouts and walked
one.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshii helped himself with an RBI single in the fourth that cut
it to 2-1. Todd Walker led off with a double, moved to third on a
single and scored on Yoshii's two-out liner to right.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies added an insurance run in the seventh when Tomas
Perez led off with a triple, and scored on an infield single by
Glanville to make it 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado came right back in the eighth off reliever Vicente
Padilla. Helton led off with a double to left, and scored on a
single by Jeffrey Hammonds.
</P>
<P>
Notes@: The Phillies have won four straight one-run games and are
23-22 overall. ... Lieberthal threw out Juan Pierre trying to steal
second to end the seventh. Lieberthal has nailed 40 percent of
basestealers (29-of-72). ... Lieberthal has 25 RBIs in his last 29
games. ... The Rockies were seeking a club record fourth straight
victory to start a road trip.

<HEADLINE> Notes From Monday's Baseball Games  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated PressAMERICAN LEAGUE:
Red Sox-Devil Rays
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON: Manager Jimy Williams dropped RHP Tim Wakefield from the
starting rotation and replaced him with RHP Ramon Martinez. ''I
know he's (Wakefield) disappointed, but he can help us there,''
Williams said. Martinez, currently on the 15-day disabled list with
a bruised right knee, is to pitch in a simulated game Tuesday and
is scheduled to start Saturday against Seattle. Wakefield (6-9,
5.68 ERA) allowed nine runs -- seven earned -- in five innings during
Sunday's 11-7 loss to Kansas City. ... Williams said RHP Rolando
Arrojo (bruised right ankle) should make his next scheduled start.
... RHP Bret Saberhagen (groin), who is playing catch, has no
timetable for a possible return.
</P>
<P>
   TAMPA BAY: The Devil Rays have kept Boston RHP Pedro Martinez
winless in his last three starts against them. It's the first time
Martinez, who is scheduled to start Tuesday, has ever gone three
straight winless starts against an AL team. ''We've probably had as
much success as anybody, but it's not a whole lot,'' Devil Rays
manager Larry Rothschild said. In his past three starts against
Tampa Bay, Martinez is 0-2 with a no decision. ... RHP Cory Lidle
is expected to start Tuesday's game against Martinez. The team has
not officially selected the starter ... 3B Vinny Castilla (lower
back) has resumed batting practice and might rejoin the Devil Rays
early next month.
Indians-Rangers:
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland: The Indians started Monday night with a major
league-best fielding percentage of .986 and had allowed a major
league-low 38 unearned runs. ... RHP Charles Nagy began a 30-day
rehab assignment Monday night, allowing one run, three hits in
three innings, with two strikeouts and a walk for Harrisburg
against Double-A Akron. Nagy had bone chips removed from his right
elbow, then made three minor league rehab starts from June 19-30
before a bone bruise.
</P>
<P>
   Texas: The Rangers plan to activate rookie RHP Ryan Glynn from
the 15-day disabled list to start Tuesday night's game against the
Indians. Glynn has been sidelined since passing out in the dugout
after a start against Boston on Aug. 11. He was hospitalized and
was diagnosed to have neurocardiogenic syncope, a fainting
condition that can be controlled with medication and a high-salt
diet. ... The Rangers entered Monday night 13 games under .500 for
the first time since the end of the 1988 season. They have lost
seven straight series and split the previous two.
White Sox-Athletics:
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: RHP Cal Eldred is scheduled to make his first rehab
start at Triple-A Charlotte on Tuesday at Richmond. He has been on
the DL since July 17 with a nerve problem in his right elbow. He
will be limited to 50 pitches or three innings. ... Rookie RHP Jon
Garland, struck below the right elbow by a line drive on Aug. 18
against Tampa Bay and later placed on the DL retroactive to Aug.
19, will pitch at Double-A Birmingham on Wednesday as part of his
rehab assignment.
</P>
<P>
   OAKLAND: 1B Jason Giambi sat out his second consecutive game
with a strained left shoulder, the seventh game he's missed because
of the injury. He underwent an MRI on Monday and trainer Larry
Davis said, ''It was essentially a normal study. It doesn't change
much what we're doing (in terms of treatment), but it does take
away the fear in the back of his mind that something is wrong.''
Davis said Giambi's range of motion with his left arm is improving.
''We'd like to get him back to playing every day. But it will take
a couple of days to get there,'' the trainer said. Manager Art Howe
said the results of the MRI were very encouraging and, ''It's about
relieving the pain so he can go the rest of the way.'' .... RHP
T.J. Mathews, who went on the 15-day DL retroactive to Aug. 11 with
tendinitis is his right elbow, made his first rehab start on Sunday
at Triple-A Sacramento and is scheduled to pitch again on Tuesday
and Thursday, then will be evaluated. ''He was a little sore after
pitching instead of because of pitching, which is an improvement,''
Davis said.
Blue Jays-Angels:
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO: Pitching coach Dave Stewart described Saturday night's
heated argument between himself and reliever John Frascatore in
Texas -- which began on the mound and continued in the dugout with
Stewart having to be restrained -- as ''water under the bridge.''
Frascatore also is willing to forget the incident. ''There's really
no differences between us,'' the right-hander said Monday. ''We've
learned from the same pitching coach (Dave Duncan), so we're both
very intense. Dave and I are just here to get the job done.'' ...
Darrin Fletcher's three-homer game against Texas on Sunday made him
the second catcher in Blue Jays history to accomplish the feat. The
other was Ernie Whitt, on Sept. 14, 1987. The homers were
Fletcher's first since July 30, and the RBIs were his first since
Aug. 4. ... Prior to Monday night, Dave Martinez had hit safely in
all 17 games he had played since joining the Blue Jays on Aug. 5 in
a trade from Texas. ... Plans are in the works for the Blue Jays to
play their 2001 season opener in Puerto Rico against the Rangers,
in addition to an exhibition game against Texas the day before.
</P>
<P>
   ANAHEIM: RF Tim Salmon was named Monday as AL player of the week
for a club-record fifth time in his career -- and second time this
month -- by virtue of his nine RBIs and 11 hits in 22 at-bats,
including two homers. ''Maybe it's because I have so many at-bats
under my belt now,'' said Salmon, who has raised his average 44
points to a season-high .303 since July 20. ''I have a game plan
that's working now, and it's like I'm on automatic pilot. Early in
the year, I was trying to find those things. I can remember three
months ago saying to myself, 'Man, what on earth's going on?' But
now, I'm at a point where I'm starting to resemble the Tim Salmon
of old. I just wish I could put together a full season like this.''
... RHP Tim Belcher, who has been on the 25-man roster for only 16
days this season because of elbow problems, is eligible to be
activated from the 60-day disabled list when the rosters are
expanded to 40 on Friday. The 14-year veteran, who underwent
surgery in December, has allowed 14 earned runs over 13 innings in
his four starts before going on the 60-day disabled list on July 3.
... Benji Gil entered Monday night's game having committed only two
errors in his last 48 at SS, after making eight errors in the
previous 25 games.
Yankees-Mariners:
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: A magnetic resonance imaging test on 2B Chuck
Knoblauch's left knee showed no damage, manager Joe Torre said
Monday night. ''He's fine. He's taking a couple of days off,''
Torre said. ''But he's had a tough year physically.'' The MRI was
done Saturday after Knoblauch left his first minor league rehab
game Friday night in Kissimmee, Fla., after being hit by a pitch on
the outside of his left knee. Torre anticipated seeing Knoblauch on
Friday night when the Yankees return home to play Minnesota, or
soon thereafter. ''It might be the first or the third or the
fourth,'' he said. ''We don't know yet.'' Torre added, ''But I'm
planning on having him back. He's still going to be a benefit for
us.'' ... RHP Ramiro Mendoza threw 40 pitches off the mound for the
first time Monday in Tampa as part of his throwing program and
reported no problems. Mendoza is on the DL with tendinitis of his
right shoulder. He's pitched in 14 games, including nine starts,
this season, with a 7-4 record and 4.25 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE: RHP Gil Meche, who came out of a rehab start at Class A
Everett Sunday night after one inning, probably will not pitch
again this season, Mariners manager Lou Piniella said. ''I think
we'll probably shut him down for the rest of the year,'' Piniella
said. ''His arm feels real tired and real heavy. We had to shut him
down last night.'' Meche was supposed to be a mainstay in the
Mariners' rotation this season, but has been limited to 15 starts.
He has been on the disabled list twice this season with a strained
right shoulder. Meche made his last start for the Mariners July 4
in Anaheim, going 5 2-3 innings in a 7-6 loss. He was put on the DL
July 31. Piniella had hoped to add him to his rotation in
September. ''It was a little bit of a longshot for us,'' he said.
NATIONAL LEAGUE:
Diamondbacks-Expos:
</P>
<P>
   ARIZONA: Curt Schilling has pitched eight straight complete
games against the Expos, including one at Phoenix on Aug. 7. ...
The Diamondbacks are 2-4 against Montreal this season entering
Monday night's game.
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL: The Expos are 8-28 at Olympic Stadium since June 5,
when they were a season-high eight games over .500 for the second
time this season following a 6-4 win over the New York Yankees. ...
Montreal entered Monday night's game with a 54-73 record, a
season-worst 19 games under .500.
Cardinals-Marlins:
</P>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS: The Cardinals recalled C Keith McDonald from Triple-A
Memphis and optioned RHP Gene Stechschulte. ... Fernando Tatis,
mired in a 2-for-19 slump, was scratched from the Cardinals' lineup
an hour before the game because of a sore left knee.
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA: Mike Lowell's game-winning homer Sunday for Florida
hiked his average to .400 (14-for-35) during career-high nine-game
hitting streak. ... Lowell was a late scratch from Monday's lineup
because of a sore left thumb.
Giants-Pirates:
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO: Giants LF Barry Bonds is playing his final four
games in the ballpark where he made his major league debut in 1986,
Three Rivers Stadium. He played for the Pirates from 1986-92,
winning the NL MVP award in 1990 and 1992. Bonds said that while
the 1979 World Series champion Pirates were known as ''being a
family, we were a family, too (on division-winning teams in
1990-92). We played clubhouse basketball games and there was a real
love on that team for each other.'' ... Before Monday, the Giants
were the only NL team not to play in Three Rivers this season. ...
Jeff Kent had a pair of five-RBI games in Three Rivers last season,
hitting for the cycle May 3. ... Bonds' 88 homers are tied with
Dave Parker for the second most in Three Rivers. Willie Stargell
hit 147.
</P>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH: According to the preliminary 2001 NL schedule, the
Pirates will open PNC Park April 9 against Cincinnati, also their
first opponent in Three Rivers Stadium on July 16, 1970. The
Pirates play their final game in Three Rivers on Oct. 1 against the
Cubs, who helped the Pirates close Forbes Field on June 28, 1970,
by losing a doubleheader. ... LHP Chris Peters may be part of a
six-man rotation when he returns from a minor-league rehabilitation
assignment (left elbow) sometime next month. Peters was to pitch
Monday night for Triple-A Nashville. ... RHP Kris Benson starts
Tuesday, two days later than originally scheduled due to a tired
arm. ... 3B Aramis Ramirez partially dislocated his left shoulder
diving into the turf trying to stop Ellis Burks' double down the
line in the first inning Monday against the Giants. The Pirates'
Single-A Bradenton rookie league team finished 34-26, its first
winning record since 1991.
Astros-Mets:
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON: Tony Eusebio doubled in the second inning to extend his
hitting streak to a team-record 24 games. Eusebio, a part-time
catcher, hasn't gone hitless since July 9 -- a span of 51 days and
45 Astros games. He broke the team-record set by Art Howe (1981)
and matched by Luis Gonzalez (1997). ... RHP Jay Powell will
undergo arthroscopic surgery on his right shoulder Tuesday in
Birmingham, Ala. ... 3B Ken Caminiti, out since June 16 with a
ruptured tendon in his right wrist, took batting practice. It is
uncertain when he will be able to return.
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: It wasn't quite Darryl Strawberry taking a swing at
Keith Hernandez at photo day in 1989 spring training, but Lenny
Harris and Pat Mahomes got into a shoving match in the clubhouse
after a team photo Monday. ''We play around like that all the
time,'' Mahomes said. Harris said someone told him they'd heard the
fight was real, to which he laughed: ''If that had been for real, I
would have beaten up 20 guys on this team.'' ... The Mets purchased
the contract of right-handed reliever Jerrod Riggan from Double-A
Binghamton and optioned utilityman Joe McEwing to Triple-A Norfolk.
New York wanted an extra pitcher because reliever John Franco is
day to day with a strained pectoral muscle in his left shoulder. '
... GM Steve Phillips said he hadn't heard from first-round pick
Billy Traber. The Mets offered the left-hander a signing bonus in
excess of $1 million, but cut the offer significantly when they
found damage in his pitching elbow. Traber's class at Loyola
Marymount begins Tuesday and if he attends, the Mets lose his
rights -- unless he drops out during the school year and enrolls at
a junior college. ... GOP Senate candidate Rick Lazio chatted with
Mets manager Bobby Valentine before the game.
Rockies-Phillies:
</P>
<P>
   COLORADO: When asked to name the toughest pitchers he's faced,
Colorado's Todd Helton chose an unlikely left-hander -- 15-game
loser Omar Daal. Helton, who continues his quest for .400, faces
Daal on Tuesday when the Rockies play at Philadelphia. Helton also
named Randy Johnson and Robb Nen. ... Helton's first-inning single
Monday gave him hits in 14 of his last 15 road games. ... Jeff
Cirillo, who strikes out once every 10.7 at-bats, struck out with
the bases loaded in the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA: Bobby Abreu, who is batting over .400 since moving
to the leadoff spot, is the first Phillies outfielder to hit 20
homers in back-to-back seasons since Greg Luzinski did it 1975-78.
... Travis Lee has reached base safely in 18 straight games.
Reds-Braves:
</P>
<P>
   CINCINNATI: Pokey Reese led off the game with a home run for the
second time this season and the third time in his career. ... RHP
Scott Williamson was placed on the 15-day DL, retroactive to last
Thursday, because of a sore lower back. ... The Reds were trying to
snap a seven-game losing streak in Atlanta dating to Aug. 6, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA: CF Andruw Jones, whose consecutive-game streak ended
Sunday at 301 games, was back in the lineup against the Reds. Jones
sat out the series finale against St. Louis to rest his sore legs.
The time off apparently did him good, as he threw out Dmitri Young
at the plate in the first inning. ... John Rocker did not pitch
during the four-game series against the Cardinals, but he still led
the Braves with 17 saves. Mike Remlinger and Kerry Ligtenberg were
next with 12 apiece.
Padres-Cubs:
</P>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO: Padres C George Williams got his first start since
his days with the Oakland Athletics in 1997. He started at catcher
in place of Wiki Gonzalez, who got the day off after 14 straight
starts. ... The Padres have won their last three series. ...
Heading into their four-game series with the Cubs, the Padres are
25-17 since the All-Star. Only three teams in the majors have won
more: the Mets (29), the Giants (27) and the Braves (26). The
Yankees also won 25.
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: Cubs president and general manager Andy MacPhail met
with Barry Axelrod, 1B Mark Grace's agent, on Monday. Grace is
eligible for free agency at the end of the season. MacPhail also
met with Sammy Sosa's agents. ... CF Gary Matthews Jr. became the
10th player to hit in the No. 2 spot for the Cubs this season.
Ricky Gutierrez had spent the majority of the season at No. 2, but
manager Don Baylor recently moved him down and likes what he's done
so far. ''Ricky Gutierrez has been very good down in the six or
seven spot. He's gotten some hits and he gives us some
credibility,'' Baylor said. ''I really didn't want to jam a bunch
of guys at one through four.'' ... With LF Rondell White out for
the rest of the season with a dislocated shoulder, Baylor will try
both Matthews and Roosevelt Brown there. ''I'll give them some
at-bats and see what I have in left field,'' Baylor said.
Dodgers-Brewers:
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES: One day after hitting his first two home runs as a
Dodger, Bruce Aven was a late scratch from the lineup. He had a
muscle strain in his left side. Jim Leyritz took his place in left
field. ... The next scheduled day off for Los Angeles is Sept. 7.
Entering Monday's game, the Dodgers were 7-4 in a stretch of 21
games in 20 days, from Aug. 18-Sept. 6. ... The next nine games for
the Dodgers are against opponents from the East and Central
divisions. The final 22 will be against West Division foes.
</P>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE: Milwaukee has been outscored in every inning except
the eighth and ninth. The club also has a 13-12 advantage in extra
innings. ... Every Brewer has hit a home run this season except
Mark Sweeney. His last one was April 29, 1999. ... Entering
Monday's game, Milwaukee was 10-3 in its last 13 games when scoring
four or more runs.

<HEADLINE> Oregon INS Director Under Fire  </HEADLINE>
By LANDON HALL
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Federal immigration inspectors in Oregon
lost some of their authority Monday in the wake of a furor over the
strip-search and jailing of a Chinese businesswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration and Naturalization Service Regional Director Johnny
Williams also promised an immediate review of incidents involving
Asian travelers detained at Portland International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Both Williams and Oregon INS Director David Beebe faced an angry
group of elected officials who have called for Beebe's resignation
because of the treatment last week of 36-year-old Guo Liming. She
was ordered to strip to her underwear, and then jailed, after
inspectors incorrectly thought her passport might have been
altered.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians said the hourlong meeting was constructive. But they
insisted that fixing problems at the airport -- and repairing
Oregon's damaged reputation -- must include Beebe's dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., called Oregon's INS department a
''rogue unit'' and characterized the behavior of inspectors as
''thuggish.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams called the description too harsh.
</P>
<P>
   ''I stop short of saying we have 'thuggish' behavior,'' he said.
''But I want to look at the entire operation at the Port.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said he would implement some changes right away.
</P>
<P>
   Portland INS inspectors must now get regional approval before
detaining travelers or conducting strip-searches, which are rare
anyway. Inspectors and supervisors also at the airport must get
training in cultural sensitivity and communication skills.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers rejected by INS inspectors in Portland have sometimes
been jailed until a flight to their homeland became available --
generating negative press in foreign countries and earning the city
the nickname ''Deportland'' in some Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
   Elected officials and business leaders, mostly from Oregon's
high-tech industry, worry that the incidents are an embarrassment
for the city, and have tarnished its standing as a hub for Pacific
Rim commerce and tourism.
</P>
<P>
   INS officials recently have made some changes, including putting
up rejected travelers in hotel rooms instead of jail cells if a
return flight could not be booked.
</P>
<P>
   But the controversy erupted again last week following reports of
Guo's treatment. After being ordered to strip to her underwear, she
was jailed for two nights. Her business partner and fiance had to
hire a lawyer before finding out where she'd been taken.
</P>
<P>
   Guo was released after officials determined her tattered
passport was valid. Beebe sent a letter of apology to the woman's
lawyer and indicated that the inspectors did not follow established
procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Beebe, 55, has been Oregon's top INS officer since 1988.

<HEADLINE> Turner Awarded Year of Eligibility  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Southern California forward Jarvis Turner,
whose college career appeared over, has been awarded a fifth year
of eligibility by the NCAA for medical hardship.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is great to have a veteran guy like Jarvis Turner back on
the team because he knows what it takes to win,'' USC coach Henry
Bibby said Monday. ''He's had a tough career at USC because of
injuries and hopefully he can make the most of this opportunity.
It's good to have another player on the bench who we know we can
count on.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner, a 6-foot-8, 240-pounder, played in only seven of USC's
30 games last season because of various foot injuries, averaging
1.7 points and 1.6 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Turner has started 23 times in 74 career games and averaged 6.5
points and 3.7 rebounds. As a sophomore in the 1997-98 season, he
averaged 10.6 points and 5.3 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   USC returns all five starters from last year's team, which
finished 16-14.

<HEADLINE> Lazios reveal 10 years of income tax records  </HEADLINE>
By FRANK ELTMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - After months of prodding by journalists and his
Democratic opponent, Rep. Rick Lazio on Monday gave reporters
access to a decade's worth of tax returns.
</P>
<P>
   The congressman and his wife Patricia, who works part-time as a
nurse, made about $150,000 in 1999. At first glance, the federal
and state tax returns dating back to 1990 didn't appear to contain
anything unusual, which prompted a question: what took so long?
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, who entered the U.S. Senate race against Hillary Rodham
Clinton in May after New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani backed out as
the Republican candidate, had promised since the early days of his
campaign to release his tax returns by the end of the summer.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, he was dogged in appearances around the state
by Democratic Party operatives - including various people in Uncle
Sam suits dubbed ''Tax Man'' - who barked at the candidate to
release the tax information.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Kauffmann, a spokesman for the state Democratic Party,
said Lazio still hasn't explained why it took three months to
releases his tax returns.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's time for Mr. Lazio to stop playing games and start
playing straight,'' Kauffmann said.
</P>
<P>
   While reporters were not able to take copies of the Lazios'
federal and state tax returns, they were permitted to review them
and were invited to pore over the figures for as long as necessary
- some stayed for hours.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio was not at campaign headquarters in Manhattan when the tax
forms were provided.
</P>
<P>
   The financial reports showed the Lazios with income from his
salary as a congressman, her work as a nurse and modest returns on
investments. The couple also reported income from the rental of a
vacation home on Fire Island.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, their income was $152,000, for which they paid $22,341
in taxes. The couple made $2,422 in charitable donations, although
the recipients of their largesse were not itemized. In 10 years of
marriage, the most the Lazios made in any year was $159,258, in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's tax filings also reflect a diverse investment strategy
over the past few years, with stock dealings involving Computer
Associates, Compaq, McDonald's, Nike, Halliburton, Monsanto, Sun
Microsystems, Johnson &AMP; Johnson and Quick &AMP; Reilly.
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission announced last week that
it would take no action following a probe into lucrative stock
option trading by Lazio in Quick &AMP; Reilly.
</P>
<P>
   Records showed that Lazio spent about $2,300 in early August
1997 for options on stock of Quick &AMP; Reilly, a Long Island-based
brokerage firm. On Sept. 17, 1997, the firm was bought by the Fleet
Financial Group. Lazio sold his stock options that same day for
almost $16,000.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Quick and Christopher C. Quick, former senior executives
of Quick &AMP; Reilly, who along with other company executives have
donated at least $35,000 to Lazio's campaigns since 1995, said they
had never discussed the company's stock or possible sale with the
congressman. Lazio denied any insider knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   In the early years of their marriage, Patricia Lazio's salary
was higher than her husband's income as a Suffolk County
legislator. In 1990 and 1991, he earned about $40,000 annually,
while she earned $44,000 and $52,000, respectively, for her work as
a nurse at Veteran's Administration hospitals in Manhattan and
Northport
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, the Clintons reported adjusted gross income of
$416,039. She had no immediate comment on the release of Lazio's
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Clinton grazed friendly political ground at three
campaign stops in the heavily Democratic Bronx. She greeted
commuters at a subway stop and later campaigned with congressional
candidate Larry Seabrook at Concourse Village housing complex near
Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Seabrook caught the spirit of the event when he told 150 soggy
supporters huddled under umbrellas, ''There are no more loyal
Democratic voters that the voters in Concourse Village.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also visited a senior citizens' center in the
Williamsbridge section and was applauded for her promise to include
prescription drugs in Medicare benefits and give tax credits to
families who take care of senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
   In between the Bronx campaign stops, Clinton spoke to the state
AFL-CIO convention in Manhattan, receiving a standing ovation from
800 union members when she pledged to fight for an increased
minimum wage and equal pay for women.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not just a woman's issue,'' she said. ''It's a family
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was endorsed by the state AFL-CIO last month.

ranchers have lost an estimated $595 million and reservoirs are shrinking fast,
even though rainfall for the year is close to normal. It's not just dry; it's

the nation's leading obstetricians' group is issuing new guidelines to reduce
unnecessary C-sections and reserve the surgery for mothers and babies who truly
need it. There are many suspects in the C-section rise -- state-by-state

<HEADLINE> Britain, Sierra Leone Captors Talk  </HEADLINE>
By CLARENCE ROY-MACAULAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- British officials have begun
talking to a renegade military faction that has taken 11 British
soldiers captive, and U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Monday
he expects the soldiers to be released soon.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers, held since Friday, have been in periodic radio
contact, including a discussion Sunday, officials said. The captors
in this west African nation also have been in contact with the
British.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have opened up dialogue with the group holding them through
their leader,'' Lt. Cmdr. Tony Cramp, a spokesman for the British
force, said. He said the British have communicated with a fighter
known as Brigadier Kalla, one of the top leaders of the group,
known as the West Side Boys.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard confirmed that talks
were under way and said the captives are doing well.
</P>
<P>
   Annan said earlier that ''there are expectations that they will
be released and progress will be made.'' He said he hoped the
soldiers would be released ''in the near future.''
</P>
<P>
   The captured British soldiers were stationed at Benguema, about
25 miles east of the capital Freetown, where British instructors
are training Sierra Leonean army recruits under a bilateral
agreement. They disappeared Friday in an area occupied by the West
Side Boys.
</P>
<P>
   The British troops are not part of the U.N. peacekeeping mission
in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   Rebels from the Revolutionary United Front reignited Sierra
Leone's nine-year civil war in May by seizing about 500 U.N.
peacekeepers and keeping 233 others surrounded for 2&AMP;frac12; months,
severely embarrassing the United Nations and prompting a
reassessment of the U.N. mission.
</P>
<P>
   Annan called Friday for a beefed-up U.N. force of 20,500
peacekeepers to help government troops regain control of the
country from the rebels. He was responding to a Security Council
resolution adopted earlier this month to increase the 13,000-member
force.
</P>
<P>
   Annan told reporters Monday that the United Nations is taking
steps ''to strengthen the peacekeepers, to give them the tools they
need to be able to defend themselves and their mandate.''
</P>
<P>
   Reports in several British newspapers said the government had
sent an SAS special forces team to Sierra Leone to stand by if
needed for a rescue. Two police hostage negotiators reportedly also
went.

<HEADLINE> Gore Promotes Prescription Drug Plan  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE GLOVER
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Al Gore told senior citizens Monday
that ''you deserve better'' from the government in help paying for
prescription drugs and said he's the only presidential candidate
with a plan to provide it.
</P>
<P>
   In campaign appearances and TV ads, Democrat Gore and Republican
rival George W. Bush hammered at the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do invite you to compare and contrast the plans we have put
forward,'' said Gore. ''Don't take it from me, go check it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush aides dismissed the vice president's proposal for a drug
benefit under Medicare as ''old-style'' big government but also
said the Texas governor would spell out details for his own
proposal soon, a tacit admission that Gore has scored on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, asked about the subject in Texas, praised a bipartisan
commission's plan that he said would allow senior citizens ''to
pick and choose amongst a variety of plans, all of which will
include prescription drugs.'' He has spoken favorably of the idea
of subsidizing insurance companies to provide drug coverage for
low-income senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spent the day hearing heart-wrenching stories from elderly
people who are unable to keep up with health care bills, and
offered stories of his own family's health.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Flatt, 77, told Gore he pays $1,800 a year in
prescription drug costs, also must care for a disabled son and
desperately needs a prescription drug benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been praying for one, not only for myself, but for those
who are worse off than myself,' he said. Gore told him, ''You are
carrying a bigger load than you should.''
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of people here want to hug you,'' Gore said, and he did
just that.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know I won't always be the most exciting politician, but I
will work for you every day and I will never let you down,'' said
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said Gore would spend the week focusing on health care, an
issue he used effectively in the primaries to defeat fellow
Democrat Bill Bradley and one that has seemed to help in recent
polls.
</P>
<P>
   The race between Gore and Bush, meanwhile, remains very close,
according to a CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll of likely voters released
Monday. Bush had 46 percent and Gore 45 percent, with Green Party
candidate Ralph Nader at 3 percent and Reform Party hopeful Pat
Buchanan at 1 percent -- a dead heat given the margin of error of
plus or minus 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   En route to New Mexico to tout his plan to expand health
coverage to all children, Gore said he was ''ready'' and ''eager''
for a spirited discussion with Bush as voters begin to pay
attention.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the gamble I took to talk about specifics is paying
off,'' he told reporters aboard Air Force Two. ''I'm feeling a lot
of enthusiasm in the response. We're now entering the heart of the
campaign where people feel they have a right to expect the
candidates to deal with the specifics of the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore again criticized Bush's lack of policy detail.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not about momentum, it's about substance. I think the
best substance in the end turns out to be the best politics. That,
in the view of some, is quaint,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has offered a 10-year, $253 billion package that would
include a prescription drug benefit in the Medicare program.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Dan Bartlett's take on that: ''Al Gore today is
proposing a nationalized drug plan that makes the federal
government the dispenser, similar to Hillary Clinton's attempt to
nationalize health care in 1993.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore told his audience in Florida, ''I believe it is time to
tell every senior in the country that we have come to the point
where we can improve Medicare.''
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of Gore's argument is the idea that medical
breakthroughs have brought new treatments into play but many are
beyond the means of fixed-income senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Touring a pharmacy and speaking with elderly people at a
round-table, Gore heard story after story of just that situation.
</P>
<P>
   Myrtle Jennings, 82, told him she suffers from heart troubles
and high blood pressure, as well as arthritis. She's currently
skipping her pain medication to pay for other drugs, she told Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ''God bless you,'' said Gore. ''I'll fight for you.''
</P>
<P>
   He also renewed his criticism of the big pharmaceutical
companies, which he said are so powerful ''they have the ability to
dictate the prices.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said his mother-in-law's arthritis medicine
costs $108 a month while the same medication from a veterinarian
would cost $37.80.
</P>
<P>
   ''Don't you think that ought to be changed?'' Gore asked.
''Don't you think we ought to lower the price for seniors''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican National Committee weighed in with new television
spots blasting Gore's proposal, and the Democratic National
Committee announced it would run new ads as well.
</P>
<P>
   Gore closed his campaign day with a noisy rally for several
thousand backers in Albuquerque, N.M., sounding standard campaign
themes and taking credit for the economy. ''This election is not a
reward for past performance,'' he said. ''We have to be willing to
make the hard choices.''

<HEADLINE> Japanese Volcano Erupts Again  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- A rumbling volcano on an island south of Tokyo
erupted again Tuesday, spewing gray ash five miles into the air and
forcing residents to stay inside. There were no reports of
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Mount Oyama, a 2,686-foot volcano on Miyake island, erupted at
4:35 a.m., the Meteorological Agency said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of reduced visibility from the falling ash, residents
were urged to stay indoors and refrain from driving.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 18, Mount Oyama erupted with a five-mile column of ash
mixed with volcanic rock in its largest eruption since the volcano
rumbled back to life in early July.
</P>
<P>
   About 2,000 people were temporarily evacuated to local shelters
after that eruption.
</P>
<P>
   The 22-square-mile island, part of the Izu chain, along with
some neighboring islands have also been shaken recently by
thousands of earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
   More than one-fourth of the 4,000 residents have fled the
island, most of them seeking refuge in Tokyo.

<HEADLINE> Concertgoer attacked with hatchet  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) - A Pennsylvania man said Monday that he has
no idea why somebody attacked him with a hatchet when he was
attending a rock concert.
</P>
<P>
   ''I got knocked down,'' said Chris Schneck, 21, a waiter from
Newtown, Bucks County. ''I really didn't know what happened, and
then when I woke up my hand was pretty much cut.''
</P>
<P>
   Schneck had just left the Creed concert at the E-Center on
Saturday night when someone attacked his friend with a piece of
lumber in the parking lot. Schneck said he was hit from behind as
he went to help.
</P>
<P>
   His father, Tom Schneck, said doctors described his nearly
severed hand as an injury you might see on a battlefield.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Schneck will undergo more surgery; doctors said
there is a good chance that he will not lose his right hand.
</P>
<P>
   The Schneck family is considering a lawsuit to bring about
tighter security.

<HEADLINE> Hazing Said To Occur Before College  </HEADLINE>
By ANJETTA McQUEEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Almost half the high school students who
answered a nationwide survey said they were made to eat disgusting
things, abuse alcohol or drugs or perform humiliating or illegal
acts to join athletic teams, the band, even church groups,
university researchers said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers at Alfred University in Alfred, N.Y. -- known for
studies of hazing among college sports teams, fraternities and
sororities -- said the report on high schools shows a willingness
among younger people to do violence or break laws for a sense of
belonging. It demonstrates as well that young people's social
activities should have greater adult supervision and gives proof
that no group is immune, the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Students may already be deeply immersed in the culture of
hazing before they arrive on our campuses as freshmen,'' said
Charles Edmondson, president of the private liberal arts university
in western New York. ''Our challenge is much greater than anyone
appreciated.''
</P>
<P>
   In the survey -- a two-page mail-in questionnaire sent to 11th
and 12th graders this spring -- students said they were most likely
to be hazed by a sports team or gang. They also reported being
hazed for music, art and theater clubs and church groups. Every
high school organization except school newspaper and yearbook
staffs had high levels of hazing.
</P>
<P>
   The university-funded survey does not represent the teen
population at large. Only 1,541 of those mailed surveys returned
them, just over 8 percent, but the project's lead researcher,
Nadine Hoover, said further studies could build on the findings.
</P>
<P>
   The results nevertheless furthered a debate over whether hazing
is more a time-honored rite of passage or a dangerous trend that
sends increasing numbers of children to hospitals or jails.
</P>
<P>
   In Winslow, Ariz., six of eight high school athletes charged in
the sexual assault of about a dozen basketball and track team
members accepted plea bargains in the cases; the basketball coach
was also indicted, accused of knowing about some of the abuses and
failing to stop them. In Trumbull, Conn., high school wrestlers
were charged after a 15-year-old wrestler was sexually assaulted
with the handle of a plastic knife. A high school newspaper in
Avon, Ind., documented assaults on young athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Schools need to do more, said Linda Murtie, an Essex, Vt.,
parent who campaigned against hazing after her 16-year-old
daughter, Lizzie, was hazed on the school gymnastics team. The team
progressed from having new members dress up in silly clothes to her
daughter's being forced to eat a banana protruding from a boy's
pants zipper.
</P>
<P>
   ''They think their harassment policies cover hazing, but they
don't,'' Murtie said. ''There is such an issue about whether the
kids are consenting to the hazing or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Some schools -- institutions including the Upper St. Clair, Pa.,
school district and the University of Vermont -- are cracking down
on hazing, creating strict policies and punishments. More than 40
states have anti-hazing laws, although researchers said the laws do
not appear to limit hazing significantly.
</P>
<P>
   ''Initiation rites are important. Groups need to bond,'' said
project leader Hoover, answering critics who she said accuse her of
trying to turn the nation's students into ''wusses.'' ''How you do
these initiation rites is at issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Hazing was defined by researchers as any humiliating or
dangerous act expected of new group members, regardless of
willingness to participate. Students said they were asked mostly to
do humiliating things: pushing a penny across the a school bus
floor with the nose; sucking someone's toes; skinny dipping; or
drinking foul mixtures such as urine, spoiled milk and eggs.
</P>
<P>
   One in five respondents said they were put in harm's way or
asked to break the law, which sounded an alarm to researchers who
say such acts go beyond critics' contentions of innocent fun.
Dangerous or illegal acts included being beaten, raped or sexually
assaulted or assaulting others, destroying or vandalizing property,
drinking alcohol until passing out, stealing, destroying or
vandalizing property.
</P>
<P>
   Schools have a bigger reason to be worried over such reported
behavior, said Norman Pollard, student counseling director at
Alfred University.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we look at recent incidents in high schools, such as
those at Columbine, Paducah and Springfield,'' Pollard said,
referring to multiple shootings, ''we see the dire consequences of
teens feeling excluded, rejected and humiliated.''

<HEADLINE> Philly Deals With 'Urban Decay'  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL RUBINKAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Years of urban decay are taking a serious
toll on Philadelphia's once vibrant neighborhoods. Twenty-two
buildings have collapsed since Thursday, and the city believes more
than 3,100 others could fall down at any moment.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent collapse happened Monday night in a rowhouse
that was occupied, but the residents were away and no injuries were
reported.
</P>
<P>
   All of the buildings that collapsed were rowhouses in and around
poverty-stricken North Philadelphia. Most were abandoned, and only
minor injuries resulted from the collapses. Two men were hurt when
a large wooden awning fell as they were walking by.
</P>
<P>
   Experts are not sure exactly what caused the rash of building
collapses but think it might have something to do with this
summer's wet weather. Water can erode joints and weaken
foundations, especially in houses with leaky roofs or inadequate
downspouts.
</P>
<P>
   ''You would be surprised at how certain things such as having a
downspout on your house, having your roof inspected -- that is what
keeps these properties from collapsing,'' said Andrea White of the
city's Department of Licenses and Inspections.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, though, was years in the making. Philadelphia's
housing stock has been deteriorating for three decades, largely the
result of a population exodus that cost the city 550,000 residents.
Philadelphia is now down to 1.4 million people.
</P>
<P>
   City officials said Philadelphia now has about 20,000 vacant
lots and more than 30,000 vacant houses. Of those, more than 3,100
are classified as ''imminently dangerous,'' or in immediate need of
demolition.
</P>
<P>
   City inspectors plan to use helicopters Tuesday to assess the
extent of the problem and look for telltale signs of buildings in
danger, such as rainwater pooled on roofs and trees growing wild
from the tops of houses.
</P>
<P>
   The city also plans to step up demolition from about 30
buildings a week to as many as 60. The cost ranges from $6,500 to
$11,000 per building.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're trying to get a better handle on what condition the
buildings are in, which is why we're going to overfly the
buildings. A lot of times you can tell if you can see the roofs,''
said Barbara Grant, a spokeswoman for Mayor John F. Street.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor, who has been in office since January, made a $250
million blight-removal program one of the centerpieces of his
campaign. It has yet to get off the ground, but aides promised the
money will be in place by fall.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Licenses and Inspections has been using what it
calls ''curbside demolition'': When an inspector determines a house
is about to collapse, the city asks demolition companies to submit
bids on the spot. The low bidder begins work immediately.
</P>
<P>
   From her stoop across the street, Velma McDuffy watched intently
Monday afternoon as an excavating machine tore into the remains of
two collapsed rowhouses. The abandoned buildings caved in last
week, adding another sad chapter to the gradual, decades-long
decline of McDuffy's North Philadelphia neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ''I remember everybody that ever lived there,'' said McDuffy, a
42-year resident of the block, motioning toward what is now just a
heap of rotted wood, insulation and bricks.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Pullins was overseeing the cleanup in McDuffy's
neighborhood. His company has lined up 10 or 15 demolition jobs,
with the promise of many more to come.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's plenty of work. We'll be doing this for the next 10
years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Residents were thankful nobody was hurt. McDuffy said a busy bus
stop is right in front of where the buildings collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   An after-school center at the end of the row has been forced out
until the city determines whether it is safe to go back.

<HEADLINE> Haitian Lawmakers Take Office  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL NORTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- Fending off international criticism
of their election, lawmakers from Haiti's Lavalas Family party took
office Monday and cemented former President Jean-Bertrand
Aristide's control over Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Incumbents from opposition parties boycotted the session to
protest the disputed election, which was held in three stages in
May, June and July.
</P>
<P>
   Senators chose Sen. Yvon Neptune, spokesman of Aristide's
Lavalas Family party, to be president of the upper house. Lower
house members chose Sainvoyis Pascal, 71, their eldest member, as
acting president.
</P>
<P>
   Aristide's party won 18 of 19 upper-house and 72 of 82
lower-house seats in the election.
</P>
<P>
   An Organization of American States election observation team
objected to the method used to determine which Senate candidates
should have gone to a second, run-off round. The United States and
the European Union have threatened to suspend aid if Haiti does not
amend the results.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of counting the votes of all candidates for Senate
seats, electoral officials only counted the top four contenders.
Opposition parties have accused President Rene Preval of having
rigged the election to favor the Lavalas Family.
</P>
<P>
   ''The senators were elected unconstitutionally,'' said
Jean-Claude Bajeux, a human rights activist and election observer.
''The constitution is in jeopardy and with it the civil rights of
Haitians.''
</P>
<P>
   International financial institutions have put about $400 million
on hold until Monday's installation, but it was unclear whether
they will accept its legitimacy. About 60 percent of Haiti's $800
million annual budget comes from such.
</P>
<P>
   Haiti had been without a legislature since January 1999, when
Preval locked lawmakers out of Parliament to end an 18-month power
struggle with opposition parties.

<HEADLINE> Tim Hardaway: I May Play for Pacers  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS SHERIDAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAHAINA, Hawaii (AP) -- Upset at being the only unsigned Olympian
and growing ever more impatient, Tim Hardaway now says there's a
50-50 chance he'll leave the Miami Heat and play elsewhere next
season.
</P>
<P>
   The Indiana Pacers wasted no time Monday seeing if Hardaway was
bluffing, placing a call to his agent.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm dead serious. I'll go play for a contending team like the
Pacers,'' Hardaway said. ''I'll go somewhere where they appreciate
me. I think (Indiana coach) Isiah (Thomas) appreciates me, and
right now I'm getting no love from the Miami Heat.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway, an unrestricted free agent, is seeking a three-year
contract from the Heat. But he says he will consider signing a
one-year deal with Indiana for the midlevel salary cap exception of
$2.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Heat can pay him much more, but Miami president Pat Riley
and Hardaway's agent, Henry Thomas, have made little progress
toward an agreement. With three months having passed since the Heat
was eliminated from the playoffs, Hardaway has lost his patience.
</P>
<P>
   ''I deserve a lot more respect than I'm getting,'' Hardaway
said. ''I took less money to stay there. (Riley) said he'd take
care of me, and it hasn't happened yet. I want to be there, but
I've got to look out for Tim Hardaway and Tim Hardaway's family.''
</P>
<P>
   Donnie Walsh, president of the Pacers, placed a call to Thomas
after hearing of Hardaway's dissatisfaction over the weekend.
Indiana plans to move Jalen Rose to the point-guard position after
losing Mark Jackson to Toronto on the free-agent market, but the
opportunity to sign Hardaway could alter those plans.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm looking into it to see if he's for real,'' Walsh said.
''I'm sure there's a place for Tim Hardaway somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway also said he would consider signing with the Chicago
Bulls, who have enough cap room to outbid the Pacers. Hardaway is
from Chicago and played for Bulls coach Tim Floyd at Texas-El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   Riley has made major changes to the Miami roster this summer,
acquiring Eddie Jones and Anthony Mason from Charlotte and agreeing
in principle on a three-team trade that will bring Portland free
agent Brian Grant to Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The Grant deal is expected to be finalized Wednesday, which will
presumably allow the Heat to turn their attention to Hardaway.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not on that team, so I'm not going to talk about the moves
they made,'' Hardaway said.
</P>
<P>
   An 11-year veteran and five-time All-Star, Hardaway has been
slowed by injuries the past two seasons. A deep bruise in his left
foot limited his movement in the playoffs last June when Miami lost
to the New York Knicks in seven games, but Hardaway says everything
has healed.
</P>
<P>
   Miami general manager Randy Pfund was expected to fly to Hawaii
later this week to meet with Hardaway and watch him scrimmage, but
those plans have changed, a Heat spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympic team will play exhibition games Thursday against
Canada and Saturday against the U.S. Select Team.
</P>
<P>
   Alonzo Mourning has been working out with Hardaway all summer
and has been in contact with Riley regarding the Hardaway
situation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Going into this, he should have been signed. But it's like
this: This is a cold, unpredictable business,'' Mourning said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know Timmy's going to be taken care of because there's a
certain level of loyalty with our organization, unlike other
organizations that I won't necessarily name,'' Mourning said,
making a veiled reference to the rival New York Knicks. ''We take
care of our own, and I know they're going to take care of Tim.''
</P>
<P>
   Mourning and Hardaway took it upon themselves to run wind
sprints Sunday after a spirited practice, and Hardaway's teammates
on the Olympic team said they had noticed that he had arrived in
training camp in much better shape than he did last summer when the
team qualified for the Olympics at a tournament in Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   Hearing Hardaway gripe about his status, Gary Payton told him
he'd be welcome in Seattle and Shareef Abdur-Rahim said he could
always come to Vancouver. Payton and Abdur-Rahim laughed as they
made their pitches, but Hardaway wasn't smiling back.
</P>
<P>
   ''To keep him quiet for this long has been a major
accomplishment, but he feels he has things he needs to say,''
Thomas said. ''Some of those feelings are coming out now.''

<HEADLINE> Dodgers 5, Brewers 3  </HEADLINE>
By GREG BEACHAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Kevin Brown allowed five hits in seven innings
and the Dodgers had a five-run first against Jeff D'Amico as Los
Angeles beat the Milwaukee Brewers 5-3 Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The anticipated pitching duel between D'Amico, who hadn't lost
since early June, and Brown was over moments after it began.
D'Amico's eight-game winning streak was snapped with the loss,
which left him two short of the franchise record for consecutive
victories.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles won for the seventh time in eight games and pulled
within 2&AMP;frac12; games of Arizona for second place in the NL West. The
Dodgers are six games behind division-leading San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amico (10-5) allowed a single to Tom Goodwin on the game's
first pitch, and singles by Mark Grudzielanek, Shawn Green and Eric
Karros followed.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Hundley added a sacrifice fly and Adrian Beltre, who hit
.538 average and 11 RBIs last week, had a two-run homer that capped
the rally.
</P>
<P>
   It was D'Amico's worst inning of the season, and it came in his
second-worst start. His ERA jumped from 1.94 to 2.20.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amico settled down, allowing just three hits and striking out
six in the next six innings, but the Brewers never mounted a large
rally against Brown (12-5). D'Amico retired 13 of his last 14
hitters.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, bedridden with a viral infection and nausea for two days
last week, showed no ill effects. A victim of poor run support
throughout the season, Brown had a five-run lead before he took the
mound, and he capitalized by striking out seven.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee closed to 5-3 in the sixth on Geoff Jenkins' triple,
Richie Sexson's RBI double and Tyler Houston's RBI single. But
reliever Terry Adams struck out Sexson and Jeromy Burnitz in the
eighth, and Jeff Shaw pitched the ninth for his 22th save in 29
chances.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Blanco and pinch-hitter Raul Casanova had two-out singles,
and pinch-rinner James Mouton stole second before Marquis Grissom's
game-ending popout to second.
</P>
<P>
   Moments before the game began, outfielder Bruce Aven was
scratched from the Dodgers' starting lineup with a muscle strain in
his left side. Aven, who hit two homers on Sunday against the Cubs
in just his second game since being recalled from Triple-A
Albuquerque, was replaced by Jim Leyritz.
</P>
<P>
Notes: D'Amico was hit on the right foot by Goodwin's grounder in
the seventh, but he threw out Goodwin at first and finished the
inning. ... Dodgers OF Gary Sheffield missed his eighth straight
game due to a five-game suspension and a bout of the flu. He stayed
in Los Angeles while the team traveled to Chicago, but Sheffield
might fly out for Tuesday's game. ... Brewers 3B Jose Hernandez,
out since Aug. 10 with back spasms, will start a rehab assignment
with Triple-A Indianapolis on Tuesday. He is hitting .247 with 11
homers and 110 strikeouts this season. ... Blanco threw out Beltre
on a steal attempt in the eighth. Blanco has thrown out 34 of 60
potential base stealers this year.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Ends Tournament Affiliation  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- Michael Jordan is ending his affiliation
with a charity golf tournament that has carried his name since
1988, and will start a similar event in the Bahamas.
</P>
<P>
   The Michael Jordan Celebrity Golf Classic, which benefits the
Ronald McDonald houses in North Carolina, will continue in
Greenville in 20001 under a to-be-determined name.
</P>
<P>
   ''This event has become well-established due to the work of
tournament officials and volunteers, as well as the support of
sponsors and celebrities,'' Jordan said in a written statement
released Monday. ''So I felt confident that this was a good a time
as any for me to try my hand at another such event.''
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of the Bahamas event in January, the Michael Jordan
Celebrity Invitational, are making a $300,000 donation to the state
Ronald McDonald houses, said Bill Freelove, chairman of the
Greenville tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ''What is happening is a win-win for the tournament,'' Freelove
said. ''We're thankful Michael has been so generous giving his time
as well as his money.''
</P>
<P>
   The local tournament started in 1984 to build Greenville's
Ronald McDonald House. Jordan participated in the tournament the
next year and agreed to lend his name three years later.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan have given hundreds of thousands of dollars to the
charity.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 tournament had nine major corporate sponsors. All have
verbally committed to supporting the event in the future, said
Emily Faulkner, an event organizer.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 event raised $300,000 for the charity.
</P>
<P>
   The new Jordan tournament, at the Ocean Club on Paradise Island
in the Bahamas, will be a four-day charity event with 36 celebrity
golfers. Organizers are negotiating television coverage.

<HEADLINE> Indians 5, Rangers 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Bartolo Colon allowed five hits over
eight innings as the Cleveland Indians beat the Texas Rangers 5-2
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians moved a half-game ahead of Boston in the
ever-changing AL wild card race.
</P>
<P>
   Colon (12-8) struck out six and walked two. He blanked the
Rangers until the eighth, when Mike Lamb hit a two-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Wickman pitched the ninth for his seventh save in nine
chances since being traded from Milwaukee to Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers have lost five of six and 12 of 16.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Lofton went 3-for-5 and Roberto Alomar homered for the
Indians, 16-8 since Aug. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Lofton and Omar Vizquel led off the game with singles against
Kenny Rogers (11-12). Manny Ramirez hit an RBI single and Travis
Fryman drove in another run with a groundout.
</P>
<P>
   Alomar led off the third with his 16th homer. The Indians went
on to load the bases and Einar Diaz's infield single made it 4-0.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers allowed four runs and nine hits over seven innings as he
dropped his third straight decision. Rogers struck out four, walked
two, and hit two batters.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland made it 5-0 in the eighth off reliever Darwin
Cubillan. Lofton doubled, went to third on Vizquel's single and
scored when center fielder Gabe Kapler overthrew the plate for an
error.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Haselman led off the Texas eighth with a single and Lamb
followed with his sixth homer.
Notes: Rogers has lost seven of his last nine decisions. ...
Ramirez extended his hitting streak to 12 games. ... Texas hasn't
won two straight in the last 29 games. The Rangers went 30 games
without back-to-back wins from May 6-June 6, 1990.

<HEADLINE> Padres 8, Cubs 2  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ARMOUR
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Phil Nevin hit a three-run homer in the eighth
inning and a three-run double in the ninth Monday night as the San
Diego Padres beat the Chicago Cubs 8-2.
</P>
<P>
   Nevin's six RBIs tied a career high that he set May 19 at
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   It was the 14th loss in 17 games for the Cubs and dropped them
18 games below .500. Chicago was within six games of .500 on Aug.
2.
</P>
<P>
   Cubs starter Ruben Quevedo (2-6) was strong for the first seven
innings, allowing only four hits, but ran into trouble in the
eighth.
</P>
<P>
   With the score tied at 2, he gave up singles to Desi Relaford
and Ryan Klesko, the first two batters he faced. That brought up
Nevin, who was 0-for-2 with a walk for the night.
</P>
<P>
   Nevin hit the ball over the left-field fence, putting the Padres
ahead 5-2. He has now reached base safely with either a hit or a
walk in 48 straight games.
</P>
<P>
   In the ninth, the Padres loaded the bases with two outs and
Nevin doubled off the wall in right-center against Tim Worrell.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Clement (12-12) wasn't exactly sharp, walking six and
throwing a wild pitch that set up a Cubs run. But he allowed only
two runs and three hits in 7 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Clement's biggest trouble came in a wild sixth inning. He walked
Gary Matthews Jr. and Sammy Sosa, dusting Sosa with ball four. The
Cubs then loaded the bases on a blunder by Padres catcher George
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Grace hit a chopper to Relaford, who threw home to cut off
Matthews. Matthews started hustling back to third and Williams held
on to the ball a little too long, allowing Matthews to slide and
beat the throw by inches.
</P>
<P>
   Roosevelt Brown struck out, but Ricky Gutierrez drove in
Matthews with a grounder to tie it at 2.
</P>
<P>
   Quevedo did not allow a hit until the fifth when Williams --
making his first start and playing in only his fourth game since
1997 -- singled to right field on the first pitch he saw from
Quevedo. It was his first hit in three years.
</P>
<P>
   Damian Jackson fouled a pitch off his left toe, collapsing as he
turned to run. A trainer ran out to check on him, but he got up
after a few minutes and stepped back into the batter's box.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson sent the next pitch he saw into center field for an RBI
single.
</P>
<P>
   After Relaford singled, Klesko hit an RBI single to right field
to give the Padres a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs opened the scoring with an RBI double by Sosa.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Feeling dizzy, Cubs 1B Mark Grace left the game after the
seventh inning. ... The Padres have won seven of their last nine
games. ... Former Cubs pitcher Rick Sutcliffe, now a broadcaster in
San Diego, was the guest conductor for the seventh-inning stretch.
... Cubs 3B Shane Andrews celebrated his 29th birthday Monday.

<HEADLINE> Pirates' Ramirez Injures Shoulder  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Pittsburgh Pirates third baseman Aramis
Ramirez partially dislocated his left shoulder Monday night and
will likely miss the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez was injured diving for Ellis Burks' double down the line
in the first inning against San Francisco. Ramirez was clutching
his left hand as he left the field, but an examination revealed the
shoulder injury.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez will be out 4-6 weeks, a period that would extend past
the end of the season. If he doesn't return, the Pirates will
likely encourage him to play winter ball.
</P>
<P>
   One of the few solid hitters on a slumping team, Ramirez was
hitting .323 over his last 28 games, going 31-of-96 with four
homers and 20 RBIs. For the season, he is hitting .256 with six
homers and 35 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates called up infielder Abraham Nunez from Triple-A
Nashville to take Ramirez's spot on the roster.
</P>
<P>
   Enrique Wilson, who has played second base, shortstop and third
since being traded by the Indians, becomes the everyday third
baseman with Ramirez out.
