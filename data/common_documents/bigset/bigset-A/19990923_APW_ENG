<HEADLINE> Amish Owning More Farms / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The number of farms owned by Amish people in  
Lancaster County has increased by about 17 farms annually over the 
past 15 years, according to a new study of Amish farming. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the proportion of farmers within the Amish  
church has declined since the mid-1980s, perhaps due to the move by 
Amish people into more cottage industries such as farm stands, bake 
shops and small tourist souvenirs, according to Conrad Kanagy, an 
associate professor of sociology at Elizabethtown College. 
</P>
<P>
	The study illuminates one of the central conflicts of Amish  
culture -- the balance between its agrarian roots and the struggle 
to make a living in an increasingly technical world. 
</P>
<P>
	``Reports of farming's demise among the Amish are exaggerated  
and inaccurate,'' Kanagy said Thursday. ``Although the proportion 
of Amish engaged in farming is declining, the actual number of 
Amish farmers and farms is increasing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Old Order Amish -- who are best known for their plain dress,  
horse-drawn buggies and eschewing of modern conveniences -- owned 
1,317 farms, or about 103,000 acres, in Lancaster County in 1997, 
Kanagy's study said. That is up from 1,200 farms, or 88,000 acres, 
in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, Old Order Amish farmers make up about 38 percent of all  
farmers in Lancaster County, a higher percentage than had been 
expected by experts. Including the Old Order Mennonites -- who dress 
in similar Plain clothing as the Amish -- the Plain groups own 57 
percent of all Lancaster County farms, Kanagy said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Part of this is because mainstream Mennonites and English as  
well are rapidly giving up farming,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Elizabethtown College study is one of the first in many  
years to examine the state of Amish farming. Experts estimated that 
Amish farm ownership is declining, often citing anecdotal evidence 
of Amish farmers-turned-businessmen. 
</P>
<P>
	The new study confirmed that presumption. Only 44 percent of Old  
Order Amish men owned farmland in Lancaster County in 1997, down 
from 53 percent in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	The percentage of farmers has decreased while the number of  
farms has increased because the population of the Amish has doubled 
in the past 20 years to about 20,000 adults. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of income coming into the Amish community  
through cottage industries,'' said Wes Newswanger, director of the 
Mennonite Information Center. ``Maybe the teen-aged boy would go 
off and get a job with the local builder and the mom might be 
making quilts or painting and selling them with their local crafts 
store.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The study also found that Lancaster County farms are smaller and  
six to seven times more profitable than other Amish communities 
around the country. Lancaster farms average about 86 acres per 
farm, making an average of $1,900 per acre. In comparison, farms in 
Holmes County, Ohio -- which is the nation's largest Amish 
settlement -- average 142 acres each and yield an average of $519 an 
acre. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is so much better because the limestone base makes it  
exceedingly rich,'' Kanagy said. 
</P>
<P>
	The study is based on tax assessment records since 1984 of  
Lancaster County landowners with more than 25 acres, which were 
coded as agricultural. That was then compared with Old Order Amish 
church directories, which are considered very accurate.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Backs Partial Embargo Lifting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Cuba is concerned that a congressional push to  
allow sales of U.S. food and medical supplies to the island could 
ease pressure for the full lifting of the nearly 40-year-old 
embargo against the Caribbean nation, the foreign minister says. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, Foreign Minister Felipe Perez Roque said in an  
interview with executives and editors of The Associated Press that 
the move in Congress to authorize the sales was a step forward. 
</P>
<P>
	``We support it,'' he said Wednesday. ``We see it as a positive  
symbol.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Perez Roque acknowledged that if approved, the legislation  
to authorize licensed exports could actually delay the day the 
entire embargo is abolished. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a danger that public opinion would consider that with  
the authorization of the sale of food and medicine to Cuba, 
everything would be resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	``But we would have to clarify that that is not the case,'' he  
said. ``The embargo is much bigger than that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He questioned how, even with an end to the ban on food and  
drugs, American companies could effectively sell their goods in 
Cuba when restrictions would remain on transportation and credit 
transactions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if it is approved, there still is a problem,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Senate last month overwhelmingly backed an amendment to a  
farm spending bill that would allow licensing of food and drug 
exports to Cuba. House and Senate negotiators were working on the 
bill Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	American farm groups and agribusinesses have been lobbying  
Congress to ease the embargo so they can gain access to the nearby 
Cuban market and sell off some of the glut of grain that has 
depressed commodity prices for the second year in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration hasn't taken a position on the  
measure. 
</P>
<P>
	Perez Roque, 34, discussed the legislation in a wide-ranging  
interview at AP headquarters ahead of his address Friday to the 
U.N. General Assembly. It will be his first speech to world leaders 
gathered for the annual U.N. debate since he was named foreign 
minister in May. 
</P>
<P>
	The surprise appointment capped a rapid rise in Cuba's communist  
hierarchy for Perez Roque, who became a member of the Communist 
Party Central Committee in 1991 -- at the age of 26. He spent the 
last eight years overseeing the personal schedule of Cuban 
President Fidel Castro. 
</P>
<P>
	In the interview, Perez Roque focused heavily on Cuba's desire  
for an end to the embargo, which Washington has maintained since 
1961 in an attempt to compel Castro to undertake democratic 
reforms. Last week, Cuba's National Assembly called it an act of 
genocide. 
</P>
<P>
	The foreign minister said it was incredible that the United  
States could ease sanctions on Vietnam and North Korea -- but 
maintain them on Cuba because of what he said was political 
pressure from a small group of Cuban exiles in southern Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	``It cannot be understood that the North American policy toward  
Cuba is today hostage to a small group of interests in the United 
States that constitute practically a municipality,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The policy, he said, ``neither expresses the opinion of the  
majority of Americans nor reflects the national interests of the 
United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perez Roque said he was heartened by what he considered growing  
opposition to the embargo in much of the United States. He noted 
that a stream of U.S. lawmakers and farm group representatives have 
recently visited Cuba and signaled their support for the new 
food-and-drug sale legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 90-minute discussion, Perez Roque also called for the  
U.N. Security Council to be expanded to include more permanent 
representation from the developing world and repeated Cuba's 
opposition to NATO's air campaign against Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba, along with Russia, China and many developing nations,  
condemned NATO's strikes because they were launched without 
explicit approval from the U.N. Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
	``I understand that the North American public opinion doesn't  
see these dangers'' of countries taking unilateral action against 
others, Perez Roque said. ``No one imagines that a coalition of 
countries would begin to bomb New York because they believe that 
(Americans) don't respect human rights.''

<HEADLINE> Woman Found Guilty of 'Air Rage' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) -- A woman who kicked a 12-year-old boy's seat  
aboard her flight, causing him to hit his head, has been found 
guilty of ``air rage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Celeste Keenan, 37, of Shamong, was found guilty by a federal  
judge Wednesday of assaulting an individual aboard an aircraft in 
flight. The conviction carries a maximum six months in jail and a 
$5,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	During the trial, passengers testified that Keenan walked onto  
the Spirit Airlines flight from Florida to Atlantic City in July 
and sprayed the cabin area with perfume after complaining about an 
odor. 
</P>
<P>
	Another passenger said Keenan glared at her and called her  
``white trash.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Keenan later fell asleep and pressed her feet against the seat  
in front of her, which was occupied by the 12-year-old boy. 
</P>
<P>
	When he reclined, Keenan complained and gave the seat a ``mule  
kick'' that broke the chair, sandwiching the boy. The boy said 
Keenan told him, ``I'll kill you. I'll sue your family so bad, 
you'll be living in the street.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sentencing was scheduled for December.

<HEADLINE> Does L.A. Really Want an NFL Team? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	As Los Angeles struggles to get back in the NFL game, three  
California cities that do have franchises are being thrown for 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Having the Raiders back is costing Oakland taxpayers millions.  
</P>
<P>
	San Diego has had to pony up for unsold Chargers tickets, and  
the city once planned to buy the tickets, then trash them. 
</P>
<P>
	The 49ers' plan for a new stadium stalled because of a family  
feud over ownership, and voters eventually may be asked to approve 
more public funding or risk losing the team. 
</P>
<P>
	So Los Angeles really wants a team of its own?  
</P>
<P>
	``You look at what's going on in California. Al Davis bounced up  
and down the coast, looking to maximize his investment,'' said Dave 
Synowka, a professor of sports management at Robert Morris College 
in Pennsylvania. ``He got a tremendous deal to move back, but how 
has it translated? He has alienated a lot of fans and 
politicians.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although a group of wealthy Los Angeles businessmen put together  
a plan to return the NFL to the Coliseum with mostly private 
financing, talks snagged when the league asked that $150 million in 
public funds be committed to the project. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all understand the reality of taxes in California since  
someone named Jarvis came on the national scene. But by the same 
token, this has to be a public-private partnership to succeed,'' 
NFL commissioner Paul Taglibue said earlier this year when the 
league zeroed in on the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	Because California still has the grass-roots, tax-cutting spirit  
that began with Howard Jarvis years ago, any plan to use taxpayer 
money to get a team would meet stiff opposition in LA. However, a 
recent proposal to use taxes from the revenues generated by a team 
might have a chance of being approved. 
</P>
<P>
	``The NFL is coming along after well-publicized fiascos in  
Oakland, San Francisco and San Diego, and I think taxpayers are 
more alert,'' said Ron Roach, spokesman for the Sacramento-based 
California Taxpayers' Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``Someone's got to draw the line. Maybe if they do it in LA,  
they'll do it in Houston and elsewhere. You would think that the 
NFL would pay LA to put a team there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There has been no great public outcry over Los Angeles' lack of  
a franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	``In some ways, I think the LA situation is unique,'' said Allen  
Sanderson, a University of Chicago economics professor who follows 
sports business. ``California has good weather and people have a 
lot of alternatives for entertainment and recreation. If they want 
to see football, they can go to a USC or UCLA game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oil billionaire Marvin Davis, who has talked with the league  
about building a stadium at Hollywood Park, reportedly is 
considering spending more than $1 billion of his own money to get a 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanderson believes Los Angeles eventually will have a team.  
</P>
<P>
	``The NFL will blink a little, LA will blink a little, and they  
will get a team, whether it's the 32nd or the 34th franchise,'' he 
said. ``Usually negotiations are one-sided. The cartel (the NFL) 
picks a city apart and can fleece it. 
</P>
<P>
	``But LA has about as level a playing field as a city is going  
to have with the NFL. If the mayor and officials and taxpayers play 
their cards right, they might wind up getting taken to a smaller 
cleaners than other cities have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles area has been without a team since the Rams left  
Anaheim for St. Louis and the Raiders left the LA Coliseum to 
return to Oakland, both following the 1994 season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Raiders' return has caused massive headaches for Oakland and  
Alameda County. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis and the Raiders have sued, claiming they can break their  
lease because the city and county failed to sell out home games. 
Oakland and Alameda County filed a lawsuit last year asking that 
the Raiders be bound to their lease. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of low attendance and higher than anticipated costs  
since the Raiders returned, the shortfall that will be covered by 
Oakland and by Alameda County is projected at $27.5 million for 
this fiscal year, county auditor-controller Patrick O'Connell said. 
</P>
<P>
	In San Diego, tickets have created a public relations  
embarrassment for the city, including the time the city council 
voted to buy unused Chargers tickets at $40 apiece and trash them. 
That idea was short-lived; the city still buys unused tickets, but 
donates them to military bases and other groups. 
</P>
<P>
	San Diego's contract with the Chargers contains a clause  
guaranteeing the team ticket sales of at least 60,000 per home 
game. If the gate falls short, the city purchases the remaining 
tickets and deducts the cost from stadium rent the Chargers pay -- 
one game last year cost the city $882,463 for 21,129 tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	A study predicted the guarantee will cost San Diego more than $1  
million in lost revenue for each year it's in effect, through the 
2006 season. 
</P>
<P>
	In San Francisco, the 49ers said two years ago they might move  
if they didn't get a new stadium. Voters narrowly approved a $100 
million bond toward a $500 million shopping mall-stadium complex. 
That plan has been shelved, however, because of soaring cost 
estimates and a team ownership dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the uncertainty over the stadium, the NFL took away  
the 2003 Super Bowl planned for the new facility. 
</P>
<P>
	That turned out to be a bonus for San Diego, which has been the  
host city for two Super Bowls and now will do it again in 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	San Diego Deputy City Manager Bruce Herring would tell other  
cities -- such as Los Angeles -- that having an NFL team is worth any 
hassles. 
</P>
<P>
	``An NFL team adds a lot to a city in terms of making it a big  
league city, and esprit de corps and all that,'' Herring said.

<HEADLINE> Ripken's Back Surgery a Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Cal Ripken underwent back surgery Thursday,  
ending his 1999 season nine hits short of 3,000 but giving 
baseball's Iron Man hope he can continue his career without pain. 
</P>
<P>
	The hospital said the 90-minute operation by orthopedic surgeon  
Dr. Henry Bohlman, director of University Hospitals' Spine 
Institute, accomplished its goal, ``to relieve pressure on the 
nerve roots located in Ripken's lower back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Dr. Bohlman and Orioles team physician Dr. Michael Jacobs, who  
observed the surgery, said Ripken is expected to make a full 
recovery,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	University Hospitals spokeswoman Eileen Korey said Ripken had  
requested that no further information about the operation be 
released. She did not know how long the Baltimore Orioles third 
baseman would stay in the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking in Baltimore, general manager Frank Wren said he was  
optimistic Ripken would be back next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``From our standpoint, it went very well,'' Wren said. ``We  
expect a full recovery and expect to see him at third base on 
opening day 2000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 39-year-old Ripken, who set a major league record by playing  
in 2,632 straight games, went on the disabled list for the first 
time in his 18-year career this season. 
</P>
<P>
	He first went on the DL on April 20 because of a bad back,  
missing three weeks, and was again sidelined after experiencing 
more back pain Aug. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken returned a month later and hit his 400th career homer on  
Sept. 2. He had been hot at the plate ever since, raising his 
batting average to a career-high .340, and at 2,9991 hits looked to 
be a lock to join the 3,000-hit club. 
</P>
<P>
	Had Ripken not missed Baltimore's final 12 games, he would have  
likely joined Tony Gwynn and Wade Boggs this year as the newest 
players to reach 3,000 hits. It would have been the first time 
three players reached the milestone in the same season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel bad that Cal's hurt because I wanted him to get 3,000,  
but he'll get it next year,'' Orioles manager Ray Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
	But even though Ripken had been playing well, the pain in his  
back never subsided and he finally decided this week that surgery 
was his only option. 
</P>
<P>
	The surgery ended a bittersweet and emotional '99 season for  
Ripken, whose father, Cal, died of lung cancer in March. His 
father's death weighed heavily on Ripken, who said he had trouble 
concentrating in the ensuing weeks, especially at the ballpark 
where the senior Ripken coached and managed the Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had to meet a lot of professional and personal challenges,''  
he said last week. ``When you look back, will it be a season to 
remember? I guess in some ways it would be, but for the most part, 
it represents something of a loss as well as something of a gain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken voluntarily ended his consecutive games streak on Sept.  
20, 1998, asking Miller to take him out of the lineup 30 minutes 
before a game against New York. A two-time AL MVP, Ripken played in 
his 17th straight All-Star game this year.

<HEADLINE> House Votes To End New Milk-Pricing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Encouraged by a strong show of support in the  
House, dairy producers are trying to stop the Clinton 
administration's new dairy-pricing system from going into effect 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The House voted 285-140 Wednesday to replace the Agriculture  
Department's new program with an alternative that's closer to the 
existing Depression-era system and favored by farmers outside the 
Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	The House action was largely symbolic, however.  
</P>
<P>
	The Senate has no plans to take up the alternative, and the  
White House is threatening to veto it. So its backers are pressing 
to attach it to a must-pass spending bill, along with authorization 
for regional pricing agreements that could set even higher milk 
prices in the Northeast and South. 
</P>
<P>
	Their effort has tied up action for two days in a House-Senate  
conference committee working on the agricultural appropriations 
measure while congressional leaders struggle to resolve the 
dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's vote was a ``clear signal that Congress disagrees''  
with the department's plan, said Jerry Kozak, chief executive 
officer of the National Milk Producers Federation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any system that reduces farm income while not producing any  
tangible benefit for dairy consumers is a lose-lose proposition for 
the dairy industry and the public,'' Kozak said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the government's current system, guaranteed minimum prices  
for fluid milk are lowest in the upper Midwest and highest in the 
South and West, up to $3 per hundred pounds higher in some places, 
because the price is based on a farm's distance from Eau Claire, 
Wis. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the USDA plan and the alternative approved by the House  
would scrap the Eau Claire system, but the department's program 
would go farther in narrowing regional disparities. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers would save 2 cents a gallon at the grocery store, USDA  
says, while the system approved by the House would raise milk 
prices slightly. The White House said the alternative plan would 
stimulate excess dairy production and reduce milk consumption. 
</P>
<P>
	The current system ``is a leftover relic of the 1930s when we  
had no modern transportation and very little modern 
refrigeration,'' said Rep. David Obey, D-Wis. ``At that time, the 
federal government was trying to generate milk production in 
regions where milk production was scarce.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But producers outside the upper Midwest say the USDA plan could  
cost them as much as $200 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's do what little we can to protect the family farmer,''  
said Rep. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue has produced odd alliances and divided longtime  
allies. Obey, one of the House's most fiercely partisan Democrats, 
united with Ohio Rep. John Boehner, a similarly outspoken 
Republican, to propose deregulating milk pricing altogether by 
2001. The House rejected the idea. 
</P>
<P>
	House GOP leaders want to keep the dairy issue out of the  
agricultural spending bill, according to Republican lawmakers. But 
it is a critical political problem for many lawmakers in both the 
House and Senate, including Sen. James Jeffords, R-Vt., who is up 
for re-election next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffords and Minnesota Sen. Rod Grams, widely considered to be  
the Republicans' most vulnerable incumbent next year, made repeated 
visits to the House-Senate conference committee Tuesday and 
Wednesday to talk to members and monitor their discussions. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin's senators are threatening to slow down the Senate's  
work to preserve the USDA plan and block authorization of the

<HEADLINE> Kathie Lee Talks About Sweatshops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Kathie Lee Gifford used her talk show to defend  
herself against charges that Salvadoran women are laboring in 
brutal sweatshops to produce her clothing line. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an issue that just doesn't go away because sweatshops,  
unfortunately, haven't gone away,'' Mrs. Gifford said on ``Live 
with Regis and Kathie Lee'' on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gifford said it is extremely difficult to monitor all the  
subcontractors who manufacture her apparel line, which is sold at 
Wal-Mart. 
</P>
<P>
	After the issue was raised three years ago, Mrs. Gifford pledged  
to help end labor abuse in the apparel industry. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, the National Labor Committee said there are still  
problems with the manufacture of her clothing line. Mrs. Gifford's 
own inspectors are looking into the claims. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gifford said she has been the victim of ``vicious personal  
attacks, which I think don't further the cause a bit. All it does 
is sell newspapers.''

<HEADLINE> Escaped Prisoner Recaptured in Kan. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COUNCIL GROVE, Kan. (AP) -- A child killer who climbed a 10-foot  
fence to escape from a jail recreation yard was recaptured without 
incident early today, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Law officers who had searched for Scotty Adam since Tuesday  
converged on an area south of town when he was spotted in a hilly, 
wooded area, said Scott Teeselink, spokesman for the Kansas Bureau 
of Investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Dogs and a helicopter tracked Adam back into town and he was  
taken into custody without incident, Teeselink said. Adam was not 
armed, and authorities believe he was always near the jail in a 
wooded area dotted with abandoned farmhouses and outbuildings. 
</P>
<P>
	``He never got very far,'' Teeselink said. ``The important thing  
is to let people know that he's back in custody and it's safe 
again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adam, 24, had scaled a razor wire-topped fence at the Morris  
County Jail hours after he had been sentenced to nearly 42 years in 
prison for shaking to death the 16-month-old child of his 
girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
	He escaped from the jail's recreation yard when he was allowed  
out to smoke a cigarette and deputies were diverted by a traffic 
accident in town, Sheriff R.J. Meierhoff said. 
</P>
<P>
	Adam originally was charged with first-degree murder in the 1998  
shaking death of Timothy Post. He pleaded guilty in August to 
second-degree murder and the judge on Tuesday doubled the 
recommended sentence to almost 42 years. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time of the boy's slaying, Adam was on parole after  
serving time for the 1993 stabbing death of a Kansas State 
University student.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Soar as Investors Seek Safety / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices soared Wednesday, pushing the  
30-year bond yield below 6 percent for the first time in nearly 
four weeks, as a selloff in stocks sent investors seeking the 
safety of government-backed securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds also got a push from a growing consensus among analysts  
that interest rates will remain stable for now. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 1 3/8 points,  
or $13.75 cents per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in 
the opposite direction, fell to 5.98 percent from 6.08 percent late 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time the yield on the long-term Treasury closed below 6  
percent was Aug. 27, when it was 5.97 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Government bonds, with a reputation as a secure investment,  
spiked higher in a ``flight to safety'' as stocks plummeted on Wall 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average fell 2 percent Thursday and has  
swooned more than 500 points, or by 4.5 percent, over the past 
three sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	Also helping bonds was increasing sentiment among traders that  
the Federal Reserve will leave interest rates stable at its Oct. 5 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
rose 3/16 point to 1/4 point, while intermediate maturities rose 
15/32 to 7/8 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a financial information 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	In other trading Wednesday, yields on three-month Treasury bills  
fell to 4.79 percent, as the discount fell 0.01 percentage point 
from Wedmesday to 4.67 percent. Six-month yields fell to 5.01 
percent, as the discount fell 0.04 percentage point to 4.82 
percent. One-year yields slipped to 5.16 percent as the discount 
fell 0.05 percentage point to 4.90 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, rose to 5.31 1/4 percent from 5.25 percent late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds rose 1/8 to 112 17/32. The average yield to 
maturity of the index was unchanged at 5.89 percent.

<HEADLINE> NYC Urges Museum To Buy Building </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The city told its second-largest museum Thursday  
to buy its building from the taxpayers if it wants to display an 
elephant-dung splattered painting of the Virgin Mary and other 
works the mayor considers blasphemous. 
</P>
<P>
	The suggestion surprised officials still reeling from Mayor  
Rudolph Giuliani's decision the day before to freeze the city's $7 
million annual support of the Brooklyn Museum of Art. That amounts 
to nearly one-third of the museum's budget. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's something we haven't given any thought to,'' said  
Robert Rubin, chairman of the museum board. ``We've been in a 
city-owned building for I think 100 years, and we've never thought 
about anything other than being part of the city.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The exhibit in question includes the dung-splattered image of  
the Virgin Mary; a 13-foot high rendering of a notorious British 
child killer, made with children's handprints; and pig halves 
floating in formaldehyde. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani called the exhibit ``sick'' and said work that offends  
religious sensibilities does not deserve public money. Critics said 
the move comes dangerously close to censorship. 
</P>
<P>
	Museum director Arnold Lehman said the items in ``Sensation:  
Young British Artists From the Saatchi Collection'' are important, 
no matter what the mayor thinks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Contemporary art has always been provocative, it's been  
challenging,'' Lehman said. ``That's what art of our time is 
about.''

<HEADLINE> Navy Airmen Nabbed for Cow Slayings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RENO, Nev. (AP) -- Two Navy airmen were jailed Thursday on  
charges of shooting to death seven pregnant cows. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff Bill Lawry said the two admitted they ``shot some  
moos.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We asked them why they shot the cows and their answer was  
`Because,''' Lawry said. ``We asked because why? And they really 
couldn't answer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joshua Osinski, 23, Scottsdale, Ariz., and Alan Peters, 21, Coos  
Bay, Ore., were charged with grand larceny and jailed on $35,000 
bail. They could get 10 years in prison if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	One cow was shot as it gave birth. One was shot 12 times.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's totally inhumane,'' said Roger Mills, a rancher who owned  
one of the cows. ``I just can't understand the sporting instinct 
when a cow just stands there and looks at you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two airmen, based at Lemoore, Calif., have been training at  
Fallon Naval Air Station in Nevada and were arrested at the base. 
</P>
<P>
	The air station is about 60 miles east of Reno, where dozens of  
wild horses were shot to death last December. Two former Marines 
and a high school buddy are awaiting trial.

<HEADLINE> NASA Loses Contact With Mars Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- NASA's first interplanetary weather  
satellite failed to re-establish contact with Earth early today 
after it was supposed to complete an engine procedure to place it 
in orbit around Mars. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mars Climate Orbiter, one of two probes scheduled to arrive  
at the red planet this year to study the weather and search for 
evidence of water, should have regained contact with Earth at 2:26 
a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're ... not quite sure what's happening,'' said project  
manager Richard Cook of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a 
half-hour after the signal was to be received on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	The probe was behind the planet -- and out of radio contact --  
during most of the 17-minute engine firing that should have placed 
it in orbit. Contact should have been established by 2:30 a.m. at 
the latest. 
</P>
<P>
	Mission organizers were scrambling to regain contact and said  
several features aboard the probe were designed to reconnect it 
with Earth in case of a computer shutdown or other common 
spacecraft problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point, we're still confident we're going to see the  
spacecraft signal in the next few hours,'' Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
	The orbiter and its companion, the Mars Polar Lander, carry  
instruments designed to discover the fate of water believed to have 
once formed rivers or lakes on the planet. Mission scientists say 
water is the key to determining whether life ever existed on Mars. 
</P>
<P>
	The lander, which was launched separately, is due to arrive Dec.  
3. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1,387-pound orbiter was to have fired its main engine early  
today, slowing the spacecraft to 9,840 mph from its interplanetary 
cruising speed of 12,300 mph. Within about a half-hour, the craft 
was to signal that it was not zooming past Mars or plunging to the 
surface. 
</P>
<P>
	The signal takes 11 minutes to cross the 121.9 million miles to  
Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	The craft is supposed to establish an elliptical orbit and then,  
over 45 days, dip into the planet's thin atmosphere and use the 
drag to make its course more circular. 
</P>
<P>
	By mid-November, the probe was to be in a 262-mile-high orbit  
and ready to relay data between Earth and the Mars Polar Lander 
when it arrives a few weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
	Both probes are part of a $327.5 million mission collectively  
known as Mars Surveyor '98, NASA's latest in a series of relatively 
inexpensive robot probes. The orbiter rocketed into space last Dec. 
11 and its sibling probe was launched Jan. 3. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Mars Pathfinder and its rover, Sojourner, explored the  
geology of the planet and found some evidence that water may once 
have flowed. The Mars Global Surveyor, which arrived later that 
year, mapped the surface and found more signs of once-flowing 
water. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mars Climate Orbiter is equipped with two instruments that  
will be turned on after the probe has finished relaying data from 
the lander. Observations will continue for 687 days -- a full 
Martian year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mars Color Imager will take wide- and medium-angle snapshots  
of the planet's atmosphere similar to an Earth-based weather 
satellite. Another instrument called the Pressure Modulator 
Infrared Radiometer will measure temperatures, dust, water vapor 
and clouds from the Martian surface to above the horizon.

<HEADLINE> Big Tobacco Stocks Hold Ground </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Tobacco stocks held their ground Thursday after  
being slammed in the previous session after the federal government 
filed a lawsuit seeking billions of dollars in damages from 
cigarette makers. 
</P>
<P>
	The performance by the two biggest tobacco companies was  
particularly impressive because the broader market posted big 
losses Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Morris Cos. shares were unchanged at $34.50 on the New  
York Stock Exchange after the biggest cigarette maker lost $1.12 1/2 a 
share a day earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Holdings Inc., the second  
biggest U.S. tobacco concern, rose 25 cents a share to $27.56 1/4 
after falling $1.18 3/4 a day earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said Wednesday's big decline in tobacco stocks reduced  
prices to levels that some investors found attractive. 
</P>
<P>
	They said the industry is expected to fight hard to get the suit  
thrown out and said it has some persuasive defenses even if the 
suit goes forward. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal lawsuit alleges the companies have conspired since  
the 1950s to defraud and mislead the public about the health 
consequences of smoking. 
</P>
<P>
	The tobacco companies vowed they would not settle the case out  
of court. 
</P>
<P>
	Company lawyers argued the government has required health  
warnings on cigarette packs for decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin Feldman, who follows the tobacco companies for Salomon  
Smith Barney and has been recommending buying Philip Morris stock, 
said Wednesday's selloff was an emotional reaction to the federal 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Philip Morris was trading far below what the market  
valued comparable companies not in the tobacco business. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices of smaller tobacco companies fell Thursday. Loews Corp.,  
parent of Lorillard Tobacco, was down 18 3/4 cents a share at $71.50, 
and Brooke Group Ltd., parent of Liggett Group, fell 43 3/4 cents a 
share to $17.31 1/4.

<HEADLINE> Diana Ross Frisked at Heathrow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A weary-looking Diana Ross said she was  
``treated like a criminal'' by airport officials in London after 
they detained her for more than four hours following an altercation 
with a security guard. 
</P>
<P>
	The entertainer arrived at Kennedy International Airport on  
Wednesday night, hours after leaving Heathrow Airport. She will not 
face charges for the incident, which happened after she was frisked 
by a female security guard. 
</P>
<P>
	``I travel a lot. The security checks usually use metal  
detectors,'' said Ms. Ross, 55. ``This woman went all around my 
body and up and down my legs. I felt very uncomfortable. I wanted 
to complain, but no one listened to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The problems started shortly before Ms. Ross was to board the  
morning flight to New York. She passed through the metal detector 
and something she was wearing apparently activated it. She was then 
given a body search by the guard. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Ross tried to protest to security staff at Heathrow Airport  
immediately after the search, but was given a leaflet about 
complaints procedures, said Phil Symes, her publicist. 
</P>
<P>
	Outraged, ``she then went back and approached the girl again and  
said, `How would you feel in this situation?' and actually touched 
the girl,'' Symes said. 
</P>
<P>
	The guard complained to police, accusing Ms. Ross of assault.  
</P>
<P>
	``I reacted because I was upset,'' Ms. Ross said.  
</P>
<P>
	She boarded the Concorde, but was led off in tears. She was  
detained for hours, then released after being cautioned by police. 
She was escorted through waiting reporters and photographers into a 
limousine, flanked by five London police officers. 
</P>
<P>
	She told reporters she felt like a prisoner. ``I sat in the  
police station like a criminal for five hours. I was frightened. I 
was scared.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She returned to Heathrow in time for a 7 p.m. flight to New York  
-- eight hours after she was scheduled to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have been through all the airports of the world and never  
been subjected to such an intrusive search,'' Ross said earlier in 
the day. ``I am a huggy person, I don't mind being touched, but not 
in this way -- it was far too personal.''

<HEADLINE> NBA Launches Television Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SECAUCUS, N.J. (AP) -- The NBA will soon be playing around the  
clock on a television screen near you. 
</P>
<P>
	NBA.com TV, a 24-hour television network, will be launched Nov.  
2, the night the regular season opens. 
</P>
<P>
	``NBA.com TV represents the convergence of the Internet,  
television and basketball,'' commissioner David Stern said in a 
statement released by NBA Entertainment. ``By combining the 
immediacy and depth of information from NBA.com with current and 
historical television programming from the NBA, NBA.com TV will 
offer our fans complete, round-the-clock coverage of the league.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This will be the first time a sports league has created a  
full-time television network. Produced by NBA Entertainment, 
NBA.com TV will combine scores, news and statistics from the 
league's official Internet site, NBA.com, with live ``look-ins'' of 
games in progress, highlights, vintage NBA games and videos, as 
well as basketball-related talk shows and movies. 
</P>
<P>
	``We see this as an opportunity to tap into the rich array of  
information available on NBA.com and the vast television 
programming from NBAE's video and film library,'' Adam Silver, 
president of NBA Entertainment said. ``This is also an opportunity 
to produce and acquire new and original basketball-themed 
programming specifically for the network.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NBA.com TV will be available to more than 5.6 million homes  
through DIRECTV, the nation's largest direct broadcast satellite 
service, and in an additional one million homes with upgraded 
digital cable systems through Viewer's Choice. NBA.com TV will be 
provided at no additional charge to DIRECTV customers who subscribe 
to NBA LEAGUE PASS, Total Choice Platinum or Total Choice Gold. 
</P>
<P>
	NBA LEAGUE PASS provides all games out of a viewer's immediate  
area.

	Joppy faces Dominican Republic native Julio Cesar Green -- who  
became interim WBA champion while Joppy recovered -- in a 
middleweight title doubleheader Friday night at the MCI Center. WBC 
champion Keith Holmes (33-2, 22 KOs) of Washington meets Andrew 
Council (30-6-3, 20 KOs) of Lanham, Md., in the other major bout. 
</P>
<P>
	Joppy (27-1-1, 21 KOs) and Green (25-3, 17 KOs) are fighting for  
the third time. Green, despite getting knocked down twice in the 
third round, rallied to win the decision and the title from Joppy 
at Madison Square Garden in August 1997. Joppy regained the title 
on another 12-round decision in January 1998 at Tampa, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	After beating Roberto Duran in August 1998, Joppy had been  
scheduled to defend thr title against Darren Obah of Australia at 
Washington in February. Then, on the way to his Silver Spring, Md., 
home from a training session, Joppy's van was hit by another 
vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew something was wrong,'' Joppy said. ``But I didn't know  
it was as serious as it was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joppy had a broken vertebrae. It was not a major fracture, but  
enough to keep him out of the gym for months. He didn't have to do 
anything special for rehabilitation -- except wait. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just time,'' Joppy said. ``Every day it got better and better.  
I knew I was coming back. I believed. I didn't feel it was that 
bad. I was already in good condition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joppy is pleased to be making his return in front of the home  
fans. Big-name promoters bypassed Washington for years, but 
promoter Don King has made the nation's capital a regular stop by 
scheduling three world title cards already this year. The District 
of Columbia City Council showed its appreciation this week by 
declaring Friday ``Don King Day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A third title fight scheduled on Friday's card, WBA junior  
welterweight champion Sharmba Mitchell against Elio Ortiz, was 
postponed after Mitchell strained a rib muscle in training. No new 
date has been set.

<HEADLINE> West Va. Community Without Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JEFFERSON, W.Va. (AP) -- It has the reputation as one of the  
bleaker towns in the state and now it won't even have its 
dust-covered police car to provide local protection. 
</P>
<P>
	The cops in tiny Jefferson -- known to some locals as the  
Badlands and the site of a trio of homicides last December -- are 
sidelined. Kanawha County Prosecutor Bill Forbes last week ordered 
feuding officials in this 2.8-mile strip of bars, clubs and X-rated 
bookstores to agree how they'll hire police. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a zoo down there, as you can imagine,'' Forbes said.  
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, State Police and county sheriff's deputies will  
provide protection for the town of about 400 residents just outside 
West Virginia's capital of Charleston. 
</P>
<P>
	Jefferson, hemmed in between railroad tracks on the north, the  
scenic Kanawha River on the south and with a billboard-covered 
highway right down the middle, began grappling with trouble in 
June. 
</P>
<P>
	The town's two police officers quit when Councilwoman Kathy  
Wolfe defeated incumbent Mayor Dan Jackson in municipal elections. 
One of the officers was Jackson's nephew. 
</P>
<P>
	``They left the squad car sitting on the side of the road,''  
said Councilman John Ash, an ally of Wolfe's and her boss at 
Po-Boy's Used Tires. 
</P>
<P>
	``And it had this much dust on it,'' Wolfe said, holding her  
thumb and index finger wide apart. 
</P>
<P>
	A feud soon developed between two council factions over who will  
hire police officers. ``I kept hiring and they kept firing,'' Wolfe 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson said Wolfe refuses to work with the council.  
</P>
<P>
	``She wants to run everything her way,'' he said. ``She thinks  
she's got an iron fist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rival council members hired a police chief, who accused the two  
new $9-an-hour officers of impersonating police. That's when Forbes 
stepped in, invoking state law authorizing him to act as the 
county's chief law enforcement officer. 
</P>
<P>
	He dismissed the impersonation charges and said town officials  
may not hire police officers unless the mayor and the council act 
together. Meanwhile, state and county authorities will provide 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't have people going out in a high-speed chase or be the  
first at the scene of a murder and screwing things up,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolfe said she will telephone her rivals to determine ``if  
they'll meet with me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far, that's been daunting. The two factions have been meeting  
separately, one at the fire department and the other at a meeting 
room at a local motel. 
</P>
<P>
	``How can they solve anything like that?'' asked Jo Spainhour, a  
25-year resident. ``They need to work for the people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wolfe said she wants to move on to other local issues, such as  
taxes, but Forbes said town officials must first solve their 
political problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone,'' he said, ``needs to look at the dysfunctional form  
of government down there.''

<HEADLINE> NHL Blues Owner Buys NBA Grizzlies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- The NBA league meetings  
opened Thursday with the host city in shock after the Vancouver 
Grizzlies were sold to an owner who could try to move the team to 
St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill and Nancy Laurie, heirs to the Wal-Mart fortune, agreed to  
pay John McCaw about $200 million for the Grizzlies, who entered 
the NBA four years ago when the league expanded into Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lauries, who earlier this year tried to purchase the Denver  
Nuggets, own the NHL Blues and the new Kiel Center arena in 
downtown St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no current plan to move the Grizzlies,'' said Laurie,  
who nonetheless refused to give any assurances to Grizzlies fans 
that he won't try to move the team in the next year or two. 
</P>
<P>
	Franchises wanting to relocate must submit a petition to the  
league before March 1 in order to move for the following season. 
The Grizzlies are prohibited by their expansion agreement from 
making such an application before May 15, 2000 -- a rule that would 
seem to ensure they will continue to be based in Vancouver for the 
next two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Louis hasn't had an NBA team since the Hawks left in 1968.  
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner David Stern voiced his personal opposition to a  
relocation, citing the league's record of not having any franchise 
migrations since the Clippers moved from San Diego to Los Angeles 
in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's my goal to see the Grizzlies stay and succeed in  
Vancouver,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision on whether to allow the team to move, however,  
would ultimately be made by the league's Board of Governors. Of the 
league's 29 owners, only 15 would be needed to approve a 
relocation. A three-quarters majority would be needed to approve 
the sale. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not unprecedented for an NBA team to move, but on the  
other hand when you place a franchise someplace you ask the fans to 
make a certain commitment to the team,'' Stern said. ``And it's not 
inappropriate for the fans to expect the team to have some 
commitment to them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Laurie, asked repeatedly if he would give the fans of Vancouver  
some kind of commitment or reassurance, refused to say anything of 
substance regarding his long-term plans for the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really feel uncomfortable with the skepticism, only because  
this is a big day for our family,'' Laurie said. ``This is a big 
step for us, and somehow some of the excitement and fun is being 
taken away by the cloud hanging over us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCaw also owns the NHL Vancouver Canucks and GM Place, the  
team's 19,000-seat arena. Both had been for sale, but McCaw said 
they are now off the market. 
</P>
<P>
	The purchase price of $200 million was confirmed to The  
Associated Press by two league sources speaking on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Laurie, an avid basketball fan and a former point guard for  
Memphis State, agreed in April to buy the Colorado Avalanche of the 
NHL, the Denver Nuggets of the NBA and Denver's new Pepsi Center 
for $400 million. But the Lauries, of Columbia, Mo., lost out when 
a rival group, given a second chance to bid, offered $461 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Speculation has swirled about the future of the Grizzlies  
franchise since McCaw said last month he was willing to sell part 
or all of his Orca Bay sports empire. 
</P>
<P>
	The Grizzlies have met with limited success since joining the  
NBA, never winning more than 19 games. Vancouver was 8-42 in the 
lockout-shortened 1999 season, the worst record in the 29-team 
league. 
</P>
<P>
	Shareef Abdur-Rahim, the Grizzlies' best player, reacted  
cautiously to the sale announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	``With everything happening as fast as it has, the reassuring  
thing is that the people I trust and the people I believe in are 
still there,'' Abdur-Rahim said. ``I believe in (general manager) 
Stu (Jackson) and the people up there, and as long as that 
situation is the same, it's cool. That was the determining factor 
in me signing (a contract extension last season) -- Stu being there 
and making me believe in his vision of what we need to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson has one year remaining on his contract as general  
manager of the Grizzlies.

<HEADLINE> Two-Legged, Cattle-Herding Dog Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENFIELD, Iowa (AP) -- Rusty was a 50-pound Australian red  
heeler who never understood the concept of surrender. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite loosing his two left legs in a hay mower accident 10  
years ago, the dog returned to pastures where he somehow resumed 
his calling to corral cattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Rusty was euthanized Tuesday after doctors at the Iowa State  
University veterinary hospital in Ames discovered a blockage in his 
intestine. They suspected cancer, and Rusty's owners, Bill and 
Alice Davis, didn't want to risk surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was in pain. We decided it was time to say goodbye,'' Mrs.  
Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rusty was 13, an age no veterinarian predicted he would reach  
after his many accidents. 
</P>
<P>
	After losing his legs in 1989, Rusty was run over three times,  
shattering one of his two remaining legs and losing part of his 
tail. But he always recovered, capturing the hearts of Iowans and 
attracting attention from as far as Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a dog that would never say no,'' said Phil Pearson, who  
retired from Iowa State's College of Veterinary Medicine in 1996. 
``Working on him was a challenge I'd never had before. He was 
really special to all of us at Iowa State.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Davises, who received Rusty as a Christmas present, farm 600  
acres about 50 miles southwest of Des Moines. Mrs. Davis recalled 
the dog's quick recovery in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	``We decided that if he wasn't going to be able to walk, we were  
going to put him to sleep,'' she said. ``But he got up on his two 
good legs and hopped over to us. He was a miracle dog. He knew one 
thing, and that was to fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Families from across Iowa went to Greenfield, population 2,000,  
hoping to breed their dogs with Rusty. An 80-year-old Oregon man 
traveled to the town to catch a glimpse of the wonder dog. 
</P>
<P>
	``He still gets Christmas cards,'' Mrs. Davis said. ``He was our  
dog, but he really belonged to Iowa.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rusty Ruger -- the dog's full name -- was buried with his mother,  
Porky, near the farm of Bill Davis' parents.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Fight Money-Laundering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration proposed a national  
strategy to fight money laundering Thursday, an announcement given 
extra attention in light of the government's inquiry into 
allegations of a huge scheme involving Russians and a big U.S. 
bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The package of proposed new laws and rules is aimed at stanching  
the flow of billions of criminal dollars, largely drug-trafficking 
profits, through the U.S. financial system. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials stressed that the long-awaited  
strategy, made public a few weeks after allegations of 
money-laundering through the Bank of New York came to light, has a 
far broader scope than Russia or any one country. 
</P>
<P>
	``Money laundering is a very sophisticated crime and we must be  
equally sophisticated,'' Attorney General Janet Reno said at a news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Accompanying her was Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, who  
called the package ``an essential front in the war on narcotics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The strategy seeks to bolster international cooperation in  
investigating money laundering and to strengthen U.S. enforcement 
through tighter regulation of banks and other financial 
institutions. It includes a requirement that storefront check 
cashiers, brokerage firms and casinos notify authorities of 
suspicious activities the way banks must do. 
</P>
<P>
	The government would designate new high-intensity  
money-laundering zones, industries and financial institutions, and 
``action teams'' of law enforcement authorities and regulators 
would be formed to concentrate on those areas. 
</P>
<P>
	The package also includes proposed legislation that would add  
new international crimes, such as corruption and illegal arms 
dealing, to the activities subject to U.S. prosecution under 
money-laundering laws. Tax evasion, which may have played a major 
role in the Bank of New York case, is not included. 
</P>
<P>
	Key Republican lawmakers have endorsed the proposals. Congress  
directed the Treasury and Justice departments to submit the new 
strategy early this year, before the case involving Russians and 
the Bank of New York broke. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal investigators have been trying to unravel the Bank of  
New York case. Russian businesses and individuals -- including 
organized crime groups -- are suspected of illegally channeling as 
much as $10 billion through the bank, the nation's 15th-largest and 
said to be its oldest. 
</P>
<P>
	Several other big U.S. banks also had accounts owned by or  
linked to a company at the center of the investigation. The 
company's owner, a Russian emigrant, is married to a former Bank of 
New York executive who was fired after news of the inquiry 
surfaced. 
</P>
<P>
	No one has been charged in the investigation by law enforcement  
authorities in the United States, Britain, Russia and other 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Treasury Secretary Stuart Eizenstat highlighted the  
complexities, noting, ``We don't know whether it involved illicit 
money or not. ... We don't know whether this is money laundering, 
capital flight or something else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the capital flight scenario, at least some of the money  
funneled through the Bank of New York could have come from 
thousands of small- to medium-sized Russian businesses that 
spirited funds through offshore companies to avoid enormous taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	The practice is illegal but extremely widespread in Russia,  
where taxes are punitive, rules are ever-changing and tax police 
say as many as 99 percent of businesses skirt some taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	On Capitol Hill Thursday, Deputy Secretary of State Strobe  
Talbott told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee he could not 
say with any certainty how many U.S. tax dollars, in the form of 
International Monetary Fund loans, may have been funneled out of 
Russia in money-laundering schemes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are all seeking to establish the facts,'' Talbott said.  
</P>
<P>
	``There is no question that Russia has suffered, generally, from  
the problem of capital flight,'' he said. ``Much of it goes, 
literally, into mattresses, because Russians don't trust banks. And 
much of it has fled the country.''

<HEADLINE> Fla. Campus Tense After Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Two apparently racist pipe bombings at  
predominantly black Florida A&AMP;M University have spread fear on 
campus and prompted school administrators to add security cameras 
and dozens of uniformed police officers. 
</P>
<P>
	Classes were mostly full and students milled about the  
quadrangle Thursday, one day after the second pipe bomb exploded. 
Despite the security measures, many were uneasy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Telling a freshman to not be afraid as they lay their head  
down for the night is something I can't see,'' said Nekeisha 
Briggs, a senior from New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither pipe bomb caused significant damage but an anonymous  
call to a Tallahassee television station threatening that the blast 
was ``just the beginning'' has many fearing that a racist serial 
bomber is on the loose. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's playing with the very life of our university,'' said  
Frederick Humphries, president of the 12,000-student school. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators wouldn't say Thursday if they have any suspects or  
even if the two bombings are connected, but they acknowledged 
similarities between the Aug. 31 explosion in an administration 
building restroom and Wednesday's explosion in the restroom in a 
classroom building. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first explosion, a caller used racial slurs and indicated  
he wanted to ``get rid of'' some of the people at Florida A&AMP;M. On 
Wednesday, a caller told ABC affiliate WTXL-TV that students at 
Florida A&AMP;M didn't need a university and that the explosion was 
``just the beginning, brother.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said anonymous calls were made about the time of  
both explosions and both pipe bombs were small. A $16,000 award was 
offered for information leading to an arrest and conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	To prevent further problems, the school announced Thursday it  
was adding a system of surveillance cameras, requiring ID badges on 
campus and hiring an outside security firm. It also is adding 50 
uniformed police officers from the city and county to its campus 
patrol until an arrest is made. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Jesse Jackson announced Thursday that he would visit  
the university Sunday to lead a prayer vigil. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether it is Oklahoma City or FAMU, none of us are safe until  
all of us are safe,'' Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
	While administrators tried to calm worried parents, Derric Heck,  
the student government vice president, urged students not to 
succumb to threats. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let them know that our education cannot be stopped,'' Heck  
told fellow students from the university's library steps Wednesday 
evening.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Mixed; Dow Down 2.85 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were narrowly mixed in early trading  
today as blue-chip stocks struggled to recover from two days of 
steep losses. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones  
industrial average was down 2.85 at 10,521.22. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
index was down 0.13 at 1,310.38, and the Nasdaq composite index was 
up 2.38 at 2,860.54. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors found little reason today to snap up stocks, as the  
dollar continued its slide against the Japanese yen. In European 
trading, the dollar was quoted at 104.01 yen, down from 104.22 yen 
late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar's weakness against the yen has contributed to a sharp  
decline in U.S. stocks this week, pushing the Dow down nearly 300 
points in the past two sessions. A weaker dollar makes imports more 
expensive, setting the stage for inflation. It also makes foreign 
investments more alluring. 
</P>
<P>
	United Technologies held the Dow lower, falling 2 5/8 to 56, after  
announcing plans to eliminate 14,500 jobs worldwide over the next 
three years -- 10 percent of its workforce -- because of a downturn 
in the aerospace industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq's modest gains were stimulated by the merger of two  
Internet service providers, EarthLink and MindSpring. Earthlink 
rose 3 1/8 to 46 5/8 and MindSpring fell 2 3/8 to 30 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 10-to-9 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 108.79 million 
shares, slightly ahead of Wednesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index rose 1.20 to 428.73.  
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's stock market was closed for a national  
holiday. In afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was up 1.2 
percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 1.4 percent, and France's 
CAC-40 was up 0.6 percent.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Softens on Defense Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House signaled a willingness  
Thursday to approve a massive military spending bill despite 
reservations about a provision that would create a new nuclear 
weapons agency and reorganize the Energy Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials said no decision had been made. But  
there was a softening of resistance to the reorganization after 
President Clinton heard from key GOP senators and met with Energy 
Secretary Bill Richardson, who vigorously opposed the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president met with Secretary Richardson yesterday, and  
they discussed some of the remaining concerns on the DOE 
reorganization,'' said White House press secretary Joe Lockhart. 
``I think Secretary Richardson recognizes the very important 
military aspects of that bill, from the readiness money to the pay 
raise, which is very important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart said there had been no formal decision, but ``we're  
going to continue to work through this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In response to months of allegations about Chinese espionage at  
the nation's nuclear weapons laboratories, Congress overwhelmingly 
agreed Wednesday to create a new nuclear weapons agency in the most 
dramatic reorganization of Energy in 22 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The reorganization was included in a $288.9 billion defense bill  
that included a military pay raise and a 4.4 percent 
across-the-board increase in Pentagon spending, including more 
money for military housing and hardware. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the Senate and the House approved the measure by veto-proof  
margins. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration, led by Richardson, had threatened a veto  
because of concerns about the nuclear weapons agency, but lawmakers 
assumed that a veto would be politically difficult, given the 
defense bill's overwhelming bipartisan support. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Democrats who voiced concern about the new weapons agency  
said the defense measure was too important to have it sidetracked 
on the reorganization issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John Warner, R-Va., chairman of the Senate Armed Services  
Committee, and Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., presented their case for 
the nuclear agency in a meeting with Clinton on Monday evening.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Dolphin Scheduled for Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BILOXI, Miss. (AP) -- Former Miami Dolphins running back Irving  
Spikes is scheduled for an Oct. 4 trial on federal drug and weapons 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Spikes and others were indicted as the result of an FBI  
investigation into cocaine sales in Ocean Springs, Spikes' 
hometown. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal authorities charged Spikes, who played for the Dolphins  
from 1994-98, with twice selling cocaine to the target of the 
investigation. The FBI identified that individual as Derek Lamont 
Joiner and has described him as a major drug dealer. 
</P>
<P>
	Spikes also sold fake cocaine to Joiner, and tried to do the  
same thing in March, when one of Spikes' accomplices got into a 
shootout with Joiner and took $17,000 from the man, the FBI 
charged. 
</P>
<P>
	Spikes has also been indicted in Florida of drug conspiracy and  
possession with intent to sell. 
</P>
<P>
	In Mississippi, the grand jury indicted Spikes on only one of  
the four drug charges filed against him. He was also indicted for 
using a firearm in connection with drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
	Spikes faces the possibility of spending the rest of his life in  
a federal prison, if convicted. He remains in the Harrison County 
jail without bond.

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Mets bought a Class-A minor league  
team Wednesday and plans to relocate the club to Brooklyn for next 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets purchased the St. Catharines franchise of the New  
York-Penn League. St. Catharines has an affiliation agreement with 
the Toronto Blue Jays through the 2000 season, and the new team 
will field Blue Jays minor leaguers for its first season. 
</P>
<P>
	The team would be the first to play in Brooklyn since the  
Dodgers left following the 1957 season. It would be the second 
minor league team in New York City, joining the Yankees' Staten 
Island affiliate of the New York-Penn League. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are pleased to have a signed agreement and expect to close  
the deal around year end,'' said Dave Howard, a senior vice 
president for the Mets. ``We are very excited about the prospect of 
returning professional baseball to Brooklyn next season.''

	NASA Spacecraft Vanishes Near Mars  
</P>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- A $125 million NASA spacecraft that had  
traveled 416 million miles to Mars vanished today as it was about 
to go into orbit around the Red Planet and it was feared destroyed. 
It was the second time in six years that a NASA spaceship was lost 
just as it reached Mars. The Mars Climate Orbiter, which was on a 
mission to study the planet's weather and look for signs of water, 
apparently flew too close to the Martian atmosphere and broke apart 
or burned up, the space agency said. The apparent loss, after the 
$1 billion Mars Observer probe disappeared in 1993, comes as 
Congress is threatening to cut a large portion of NASA's space 
exploration budget.

	Dow Drops 205.48 on Interest Rate Fears  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks plummeted today as investors sold heavily  
amid continued worries about higher interest rates and the strength 
of the dollar. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 205.48 to 
close at 10,318.59, bringing the Dow's decline over the past three 
sessions to 505.31 points. The Nasdaq composite index fell 108.33 
to 2,749.83, its fourth-biggest decline ever. The U.S. currency is 
lingering near its lowest levels against the yen since 1996, making 
imports more expensive and setting the stage for inflation. It also 
makes foreign investments more attractive.

	President Vetoes GOP's $792B Tax Cut  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton vetoed the Republicans' $792  
billion tax cut bill Thursday, saying it would undermine efforts to 
shore up the Social Security and Medicare programs, to reduce the 
national debt and to improve education. ``At a time when America is 
moving in the right direction,'' the president said, ``this bill 
would turn us back to the failed policies of the past.'' 
Republicans shot back that taxes are too high and that Americans 
deserve a break.

	Dragging Defendant Sentenced to Die

<P>
	BRYAN, Texas (AP) -- A jury decided today that racist ex-convict  
Lawrence Russell Brewer should pay with his life for the dragging 
death of a black man, sending him to death row to join an 
accomplice in the crime. James Byrd Jr., 49, was chained at the 
ankles to a pickup truck and dragged to pieces in the East Texas 
town of Jasper last year. Brewer's former prison buddy, John 
William King, 24, is already on death row, convicted in February in 
the murder of Byrd. A third man, Shawn Allen Berry, 24, goes on 
trial next month. Prosecutors will seek the death penalty in that 
case, too.

intentionally bombed the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia. Turning a 
joint news conference with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright

assailed the president of Taiwan, Lee Teng-hui, as a troublemaker 
for trying to promote a special state-to-state relationship with 
China.

earned him an Oscar he refused to accept, has died. He was 71. 
Scott died yesterday, Pat Mahoney, wife of Scott's publicist, Jim 
Mahoney, said today. For all his success in motion pictures, Scott 
disdained moviemaking, saying it was tedious and he did it only for

<HEADLINE> Estes Gearing Up for PGA Texas Open  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Bob Estes is in Texas this week. His mind is  
in Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
	Estes has been prepared to travel to the site of the Ryder Cup  
at a moment's notice should he be needed to fill in before today's 
opening ceremony, the last point when a substitution can be made. 
Match play begins Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, I would love to be playing on that team,  
representing my country,'' he said. ``It just didn't happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he and the players in the Texas Open at La Cantera Golf  
Club today are trying to keep their mind on the sprawling, hilly 
course and the $360,000 first prize for the PGA Tour event. 
</P>
<P>
	Estes barely missed making the U.S. team, and instead is  
settling for competing in San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was going to work out fine either way. I was really in a  
no-lose situation,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Estes finished sixth at the PGA Championship. Had he been fifth  
or higher, he would have secured a spot on the Ryder Cup team. The 
top 10 golfers on the Ryder Cup points list make the team, and the 
captain gets to choose two others. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. captain Ben Crenshaw selected Tom Lehman (No. 12) and Steve  
Pate (No. 14) over Estes (No. 11), who is the first alternate. 
</P>
<P>
	Estes is emphasizing the positives of the Texas Open.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just looking forward to playing in some warm weather on a  
firm, fast golf course, which we don't get that often,'' said 
Estes, 33, a former University of Texas golfer. 
</P>
<P>
	The 72-hole Texas Open, sponsored by Westin, takes place on the  
7,001-yard, par-72 La Cantera course on the edge of the Texas Hill 
Country. The purse is up to $2 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas Open is without several top golfers because of the  
Ryder Cup, including last year's Texas Open champion, Hal Sutton, 
who is on the U.S. team and is fifth on the money list. 
</P>
<P>
	Sutton shot a 4-under-par 68 for a 1-stroke victory over Justin  
Leonard and Jay Haas last year. Sutton had an 18-under 270 total, 
winning his first title on the PGA Tour in four years. 
</P>
<P>
	Estes captured his only tour victory by winning the Texas Open  
in 1994, the last year the tournament was played at Oak Hills 
Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
	By playing in the Texas Open this weekend instead of the Ryder  
Cup, Estes said, he'll have the opportunity to solidify his 
standing on the money list. He's currently 25th. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years after winning the 1994 Texas Open, Estes endured tough  
times and lost his fully exempt status by dropping out of the top 
125 on the money list in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, Estes has rebounded nicely. He climbed to 69th on  
the money list in 1997 and finished 28th last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Estes enters the Texas Open this year with four consecutive top  
15 finishes. He has finished in the top 10 in nine tournaments this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``This year has been going well,'' he said. ``It's been nice to  
make the progress that I have in the last couple of years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He attributed his improvement to changes in his equipment and in  
his physical approach to the game. 
</P>
<P>
	At La Cantera so far this week, Estes said he's seen few  
differences in the course compared with past years, although he 
noted the rough is not quite as high. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's playing very firm and very fast,'' Estes said. ``These  
greens are some of the toughest we play on.''

<HEADLINE> Entrepreneurs Study Space Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Space, tourism's final frontier.  
</P>
<P>
	As NASA assembles the international space station high above  
Earth, private lodging and travel companies are taking a serious 
look at orbiting hotels and other projects. Hilton Hotels Inc. 
confirmed this week that it is looking into the feasibility of a 
space hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to take a hard look at it and see if Hilton can be  
first into space,'' said Hilton spokeswoman Jeannie Datz. ``It's 
certainly not going to happen tomorrow. We're talking 15 to 20 
years down the road, if any of it makes sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hilton isn't alone. Robert Bigelow, owner of the Las Vegas-based  
Budget Suites of America lodging chain, has committed $500 million 
into a new company -- Bigelow Aerospace -- with the goal of building 
a ``cruise ship'' that would fly from Earth orbit to the moon and 
back. 
</P>
<P>
	The notion of space resorts may not be that farfetched. A 1997  
NASA study concluded that space tourism represents a potential 
market worth billions of dollars if economic and technical barriers 
can be overcome. Hilton plans to hold a symposium on the subject in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
	Space commercialization also was to be discussed today at the  
Space Frontier Foundation's annual conference in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA Administrator Dan Goldin, scheduled to address the group  
Friday, has raised the possibility of public space travel in the 
past. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are open to proposals,'' said NASA spokesman Brian Welch.  
``I don't think anybody believes it's going to happen tomorrow, but 
there are new space technologies coming on line. There are new 
spacecraft being built that could lead to widespread traffic back 
and forth into space.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The challenges of space tourism would be enormous. And at this  
point no one can say for sure whether a space hotel would be 
profitable or even appealing to tourists. 
</P>
<P>
	Gene Meyers, executive director of Space Island Group of West  
Covina, Calif., believes there would be plenty of entertainment in 
space. His company wants to use empty space shuttle fuel tanks to 
build an orbiting hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	Guest could take space walks, gaze down at the Earth and try  
their hand at space gardening and minor maintenance projects.

<HEADLINE>  Bush Emphasizes Defense, Weaponry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Promising a ``new architecture of American  
defense,'' Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush said 
Thursday that he would spend $20 billion more on futuristic weapons 
research, build a national defense against ballistic missiles as 
quickly as possible and cut back on overseas peacekeeping by 
American troops. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking at The Citadel military academy in Charleston, S.C.,  
Bush accused the Clinton administration of breaking faith with 
service men and women by deploying them too frequently and paying 
them too little. He said the administration has failed to use 
America's technological prowess to create a more lethal and mobile 
military. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last seven years have been wasted in inertia and idle  
talk,'' said Bush, who served in the Texas Air National Guard 
during the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, who holds a large lead in the polls, said the Clinton  
administration had weakened the nation's defenses by embarking on 
``vague, endless and aimless'' missions abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	As president, Bush said, he would order a top-to-bottom review  
of the military -- its structure, strategy and spending priorities -- 
and give his secretary of defense a mandate: ``Challenge the status 
quo and envision a new architecture of American defense for decades 
to come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas governor spoke to an overflow audience of about 600,  
including about 400 cadets in gray uniforms. Several cadets pumped 
their fists in the air as he was introduced. 
</P>
<P>
	``With that kind of reception, you've got amnesty,'' Bush told  
the cadets. ``I don't care what the general says.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's address -- part of a series of speeches designed to spell  
out his presidential agenda -- is an answer to critics who say Bush 
is not ready to be president and that his views on public policy 
are undeveloped. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Vice President Al Gore, who is seeking the  
Democratic nomination, made light of Bush's foreign policy 
credentials and his history of confusing names of countries. ``The 
governor's foreign policy expertise begins with Slovenia and ends 
with Slovakia, and even these have proven to be too much of a 
challenge,'' Chris Lehane said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of Bush's prescriptions for a healthier military are  
similar to those pursued by President Clinton, including pay raises 
for troops and innovations to make U.S. forces more adaptable and 
easier to deploy on short notice. Their differences are mainly a 
matter of degree. Bush, for example, would spend $5 billion more on 
pay raises over the coming five years, and he would commit more 
quickly to deploying a national defense against missile attack. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the earliest possible date'' his administration would  
deploy anti-missile systems to protect not only U.S. troops abroad 
and allies but also to shield the U.S. homeland from ``attack and 
blackmail.'' He did not spell out how extensive the national system 
would be, but aides said it would be more complete than Clinton 
envisions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration plans to decide as early as June 2000  
whether to deploy a limited national defense system. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said he would have the United States withdraw from the 1972  
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with Russia if Moscow refused to 
accept amendments allowing the testing and deployment of a national 
missile defense. The Clinton administration is pressing Moscow to 
accept such changes and has said withdrawal from the treaty remains 
an option. 
</P>
<P>
	A key distinction emphasized by Condoleeza Rice, the candidate's  
top foreign policy adviser, is Bush's intent to move the military 
out of its Cold War-era structure by emphasizing innovation and 
next-generation technologies. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said, for example, that he would earmark at least 20  
percent of the Pentagon's weapons procurement budget for programs 
that propel America ``generations ahead'' in military technology. 
He mentioned such possibilities as a ``stealthy ship'' packed with 
long-range missiles and unmanned aircraft capable of long-range 
missile strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said he would commit an extra $20 billion to defense  
research and development between 2001 and 2006. That would be in 
addition to the approximately $173 billion the Clinton 
administration has proposed over a similar period. 
</P>

	Responding to Bush's speech, David Leavy, chief spokesman for  
the White House's National Security Council, said it was wrong to 
say the administration had overused the military.

<P>
	``The president has made one of his key national security  
priorities making sure that our armed forces are the best trained, 
best led and best equipped fighting force in the world,'' Leavy 
said, adding that the administration has proposed the first 
sustained increase in overall defense spending since the late 
1980s.

<P>
	Bush said one of his first priorities would be to ``renew the  
bond of trust'' between the president and the military. Clinton, he

freely for open-ended missions like the peacekeeping effort in 
Bosnia that began in 1995 and continues with no end in sight.

<P>
	``Something has to give, and it's giving,'' he said.

<P>
	Bush said his administration would review U.S. troop commitments  
abroad -- except those of long standing like South Korea and Japan -- 
with an eye toward an ``orderly and timely withdrawal'' from Bosnia 
and Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will not be permanent peacekeepers, dividing warring  
parties,'' he said. ``That is not our strength or our calling.''

<HEADLINE>  Bush Emphasizes Defense, Weaponry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Promising a ``new architecture of American  
defense,'' Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush said 
Thursday that he would spend $20 billion more on futuristic weapons 
research, build a national defense against ballistic missiles as 
quickly as possible and cut back on overseas peacekeeping by 
American troops. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking at The Citadel military academy in Charleston, S.C.,  
Bush accused the Clinton administration of breaking faith with 
service men and women by deploying them too frequently and paying 
them too little. He said the administration has failed to use 
America's technological prowess to create a more lethal and mobile 
military. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last seven years have been wasted in inertia and idle  
talk,'' said Bush, who served in the Texas Air National Guard 
during the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, who holds a large lead in the polls, said the Clinton  
administration had weakened the nation's defenses by embarking on 
``vague, endless and aimless'' missions abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	As president, Bush said, he would order a top-to-bottom review  
of the military -- its structure, strategy and spending priorities -- 
and give his secretary of defense a mandate: ``Challenge the status 
quo and envision a new architecture of American defense for decades 
to come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas governor spoke to an overflow audience of about 600,  
including about 400 cadets in gray uniforms. Several cadets pumped 
their fists in the air as he was introduced. 
</P>
<P>
	``With that kind of reception, you've got amnesty,'' Bush told  
the cadets. ``I don't care what the general says.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's address -- part of a series of speeches designed to spell  
out his presidential agenda -- is an answer to critics who say Bush 
is not ready to be president and that his views on public policy 
are undeveloped. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Vice President Al Gore, who is seeking the  
Democratic nomination, made light of Bush's foreign policy 
credentials and his history of confusing names of countries. ``The 
governor's foreign policy expertise begins with Slovenia and ends 
with Slovakia, and even these have proven to be too much of a 
challenge,'' Chris Lehane said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of Bush's prescriptions for a healthier military are  
similar to those pursued by President Clinton, including pay raises 
for troops and innovations to make U.S. forces more adaptable and 
easier to deploy on short notice. Their differences are mainly a 
matter of degree. Bush, for example, would spend $5 billion more on 
pay raises over the coming five years, and he would commit more 
quickly to deploying a national defense against missile attack. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the earliest possible date'' his administration would  
deploy anti-missile systems to protect not only U.S. troops abroad 
and allies but also to shield the U.S. homeland from ``attack and 
blackmail.'' He did not spell out how extensive the national system 
would be, but aides said it would be more complete than Clinton 
envisions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration plans to decide as early as June 2000  
whether to deploy a limited national defense system. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said he would have the United States withdraw from the 1972  
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with Russia if Moscow refused to 
accept amendments allowing the testing and deployment of a national 
missile defense. The Clinton administration is pressing Moscow to 
accept such changes and has said withdrawal from the treaty remains 
an option. 
</P>
<P>
	A key distinction emphasized by Condoleeza Rice, the candidate's  
top foreign policy adviser, is Bush's intent to move the military 
out of its Cold War-era structure by emphasizing innovation and 
next-generation technologies. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said, for example, that he would earmark at least 20  
percent of the Pentagon's weapons procurement budget for programs 
that propel America ``generations ahead'' in military technology. 
He mentioned such possibilities as a ``stealthy ship'' packed with 
long-range missiles and unmanned aircraft capable of long-range 
missile strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said he would commit an extra $20 billion to defense  
research and development between 2001 and 2006. That would be in 
addition to the approximately $173 billion the Clinton 
administration has proposed over a similar period. 
</P>
<P>
	Responding to Bush's speech, David Leavy, chief spokesman for  
the White House's National Security Council, said it was wrong to 
say the administration had overused the military. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president has made one of his key national security  
priorities making sure that our armed forces are the best trained, 
best led and best equipped fighting force in the world,'' Leavy 
said, adding that the administration has proposed the first

<HEADLINE> Spending Panel Deadlocks on Abortion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A dispute over antiabortion restrictions is  
again threatening major foreign-policy legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	House and Senate negotiators deadlocked late Wednesday on a  
$12.6 billion foreign aid bill when they could not agree on 
proposed restrictions on U.S. funds for international organizations 
that support abortion rights. 
</P>
<P>
	A similar dispute threatens to hold up separate legislation that  
would authorize about $1 billion in delinquent U.S. payments to the 
United Nations, some of which dates to the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest snag came a day after President Clinton told the U.N.  
General Assembly he would redouble efforts this year to end what 
has become a perennial dispute with the Republican-led Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The foreign aid bill already was threatened by a presidential  
veto because of its deep cuts in many international programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration also is unhappy that negotiators rejected its  
request to provide funds for carrying out the so-called Wye River 
Middle East peace accords. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only has Congress ignored the administration's request for  
at least $500 million for Israel and the Palestinians to carry out 
the accords in the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, but foreign aid 
negotiators also cut $100 billion that had been promised to Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Money for Jordan was in the bill and it was taken out,''  
complained Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican leaders said they supported U.S. funds to support the  
peace plan, negotiated at Wye River, Md., in late 1998, but that 
spending ceilings under the 1997 balanced-budget act made it hard 
to find the money at this time. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., chairman of the Senate negotiating  
team, suggested it could be taken care of in an emergency spending 
bill expected to deal with damage from this month's hurricanes. 
Money contained in such emergency bills is exempt from the spending 
ceilings. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rep. David Obey of Wisconsin, senior Democrat on the House  
Appropriations Committee, asserted, ``Wye is in significant 
jeopardy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steps by congressional conservatives to attach antiabortion  
restrictions to foreign policy measures have drawn vetoes from 
Clinton in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	House negotiators said Wednesday they were willing to drop  
controversial language that would deny U.S. funds to support 
organizations that lobby foreign governments to repeal antiabortion 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
	But in return, they wanted to eliminate $25 million previously  
approved by both House and Senate for the United Nation's family 
planning assistance program. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate negotiators refused to go along with the cut in funds,  
and the talks were recessed, at least for the time being. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we're right back where we've been in the past,'' said  
Rep. Sonny Callahan, R-Ala., chairman of the House negotiators, 
told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Current law already bans the use of U.S. taxpayer funds from  
going to organizations that perform abortions overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	But conservatives, led by Rep. Christopher Smith, R-N.J., have  
managed to attach an amendment to various bills that would extend 
the prohibition to organizations that merely support abortion 
rights or lobby for changes in abortion laws.

<HEADLINE> School of the Americas Funds Renewed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House and Senate negotiators have restored  
funding for the School of the Americas, the controversial Army 
school in Georgia that the House moved last summer to shut down. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Jack Kingston, R-Ga., said House conferees on the fiscal  
2000 foreign operations spending bill agreed Wednesday to accept 
the Senate's position that provided $2 million in the State 
Department budget to pay the expenses of Latin American soldiers 
who attend the school at Fort Benning. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote won't become final until the conference on the entire  
bill is concluded, but Kingston, one of the House conferees, said 
the section covering funding for the school has been closed and 
cannot be reopened. 
</P>
<P>
	``The School of the Americas is in there,'' he said. ``It's  
survived another year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The House voted 230-197 last summer to eliminate the $2 million  
in training funds. It marked the first time in five House votes 
since 1993 that the lawmakers have gone on record in opposition to 
the school. 
</P>
<P>
	The school has been the target of a decade-long campaign by  
religious activists upset that some of its graduates were linked to 
the 1989 murders of six Jesuit priests and two women in El 
Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
	Father Roy Bourgeois, the Maryknoll priest who has spearheaded  
the campaign against the school, said the conference committee 
action Wednesday won't slow the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not going away,'' he said. ``We're going to keep coming  
back to Washington and to the main gate of Fort Benning in greater 
and greater numbers every year until that school is shut down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The House conferees voted 8-7 to recede to the Senate position.  
</P>
<P>
	Kingston said the House agreed to restore the funding because  
members of the foreign operations spending panel did not want to 
lose jurisdiction over the school, which also receives money from 
the Defense Department budget. 
</P>
<P>
	Kingston said House conferees felt that the Pentagon would find  
a way to continue operating the school, even if the $2 million in 
training funds had been eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
	The $2 million represents about half the school's annual budget.  
The rest comes out of the Pentagon budget, which also pays the 
salaries of the military officers who serve as instructors. 
Congressional opponents of the school estimate it costs the 
taxpayers $20 million a year.

	CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybean and grain futures prices were mixed in  
early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade, as investors 
kept an eye on harvest conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean futures prices rose slightly after weekly export sales  
proved stronger than expected, but then turned lower. Soybean 
prices have dropped in the past week as the harvest accelerated and 
forecasts predicted ideal weather conditions through the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures opened slightly lower, despite support from strong  
but anticipated USDA weekly export sales. Wheat inched higher, 
before falling. Oats opened slightly higher. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Religion Today  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- There's a growing moral debate over something  
smaller than the period at the end of this sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Such is the size of the early human embryo, or blastocyst, the  
cluster of cells formed just after fertilization that will grow 
into a newborn infant if nature is allowed to take its course. 
</P>
<P>
	How should citizens view this tiny thing? Is it a human being? A  
potential human being? Does it have rights? Should society protect 
it? 
</P>
<P>
	Or, if there's a potentially big payoff in terms of medical  
progress, should society allow it to be put to death? In the 
classical formulation, does the end justify the means? 
</P>
<P>
	This issue -- paralleling the abortion debate -- engages  
theologians, researchers, politicians and such organizations as the 
American Cancer Society. 
</P>
<P>
	Research using human embryos is currently limited by a  
congressional ban on federal funding. That could change, depending 
on reaction to a 111-page report issued last week by the National 
Bioethics Advisory Commission that urges public aid. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel of 17 scientists and academicians, chaired by  
Princeton University President Harold T. Shapiro, advises the 
government on the ever more complex moral conundrums in biological 
research. 
</P>
<P>
	The embryo debate, brewing for years, was newly energized by  
scientific developments late last year. A University of Wisconsin 
team reported it had extracted and cultivated human ``stem cells'' 
taken from early embryos. And a Johns Hopkins University team 
acquired stem cells from aborted fetuses, a technique the panel 
also discusses. 
</P>
<P>
	Both projects were privately funded, by the Geron Corp. of Menlo  
Park, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Stem cells have the ability to produce the wide variety of cells  
that make up tissues in the human body. Researchers hope these 
wonder cells might provide powerful new therapies for Alzheimer's 
disease, Parkinson's disease, diabetes, heart failure and many 
other ailments. But that would require extensive research on human 
embryos and fetuses. 
</P>
<P>
	In its 1973 decision legalizing abortion, the U.S. Supreme Court  
decided embryos and fetuses are not ``persons'' or entitled to 
legal protection until late in pregnancy. But the bioethics 
commission says most Americans believe ``human embryos deserve 
respect as a form of human life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weighing such respect against projected medical benefits, the  
federal panel endorses research that kills unwanted human embryos, 
those left after in vitro fertilization treatments. It also favors 
publicly funded research using aborted fetuses. 
</P>
<P>
	Panel member Thomas H. Murray, president of the Hastings  
Institute, a think tank on bioethics, reasons that the embryos and 
fetuses ``are going to be destroyed anyway'' and, medically, ``the 
potential is quite enormous.'' He says it's like using the bodies 
of accident victims for research. 
</P>
<P>
	Anticipating the federal panel's proposals, the Center for  
Bioethics and Human Dignity in Bannockburn, Ill., issued a protest 
in July from 340 scholars and activists who say embryos are ``the 
tiniest of human beings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Citing the post-Nazi Nuremberg Code, the World Medical  
Association's Helsinki declaration and the United Nations 
Declaration of Human Rights, this group declares that ``members of 
the human species who cannot give informed consent for research 
should not be the subjects of an experiment unless they personally 
may benefit from it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the signers is C. Christopher Hook, director of ethics  
education at the Mayo Graduate School of Medicine in Minnesota. 
Hook, a lay Protestant, says it's scientifically clear that ``when 
fertilization is complete, a unique genetic human entity exists.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He says society must not allow ``subsets of the population to be  
targeted for destruction in the name of usefulness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With tissue from aborted fetuses, Hook said, proponents can  
argue there's a conflict between the claims of the fetus and of the 
mother, but no such conflict justifies the purposeful killing of 
embryos. 
</P>
<P>
	These critics also contend there's no need to use embryos and  
fetuses because recent research indicates similar benefits could 
come from stem cells taken from adults. The bioethics panel doubts 
this. 
</P>
<P>
	Religious views vary widely, according to the panel, which heard  
from 11 religious representatives on May 7. Strong support for 
protection of the embryo and fetus comes from the Catholic Church 
and conservative Protestants. But the panel cites support for its 
approach from thinkers like Margaret Farley, a Catholic ethicist at 
Yale divinity school, and Rabbi Elliot Dorff of the University of 
Judaism in Bel Air, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel opposes the buying and selling of human embryos and  
fetuses and production of stem cells through human clones and 
human-animal hybrids. It also opposes ``at this time'' the notion 
that the government should support the cultivation of human embryos 
specifically for research purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal study group endorsed such human embryo farming in  
1994. But the current panel decided the supply of stem cells from 
abortions and fertility treatments is sufficient for now. 
</P>
<P>
	Murray says problems of supply or developments in biology could  
bring reconsideration, say in five years. ``At that point the 
public will have had five years to reflect on how they feel. I am 
unwilling to predict where the American people will be on this in 
five years.''

<HEADLINE> Lehman Bros. Posts 92 Percent Jump </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. reported profits  
Thursday of $290 million for its fiscal third quarter, a 92 percent 
increase from last year's figure and well above analysts' 
predictions. 
</P>
<P>
	Lehman attributed the strong earnings numbers to the company's  
increased focus on its highly profitable investment banking and 
stock trading units. 
</P>
<P>
	Lehman earned $2.20 a share, 19 cents more than analysts'  
expectations of $2.01 a share. The previous high was $2.12 a share, 
posted in the second quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	During the third quarter of 1998, the New York-based company  
reported net income of $151 million, or $1.10 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	``The firm is well on its way to having its most profitable year  
ever, a clear indication that our strategy of expanding key 
business franchises and broadening our international presence has 
been successful,'' Richard S. Fuld Jr., chairman and chief 
executive of Lehman, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	But Lehman's stock fell along with the rest of the stock market  
Thursday. Shares fell $1.87 1/2 to $53.37 1/2 in trading on the New York 
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Net revenues, which exclude interest expenses, totaled $1.36  
billion for the three months ended Aug. 31, up from $930 million in 
the year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of Lehman's fiscal year, profits  
totaled $830 million, a 25 percent increase from the $662 million 
in the first nine months of fiscal 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine month revenues were $3.93 billion vs. $3.45 billion.

<HEADLINE> 8 European Stock Exchanges To Link </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- Eight European stock markets agreed  
Thursday to join in a ``virtual'' exchange that would give 
customers a single, computerized point of access to all of their 
trading platforms. 
</P>
<P>
	In a joint statement, chiefs from the Amsterdam, Brussels,  
Frankfurt, London, Madrid, Milan, Paris and Zurich exchanges said 
the system will ``for the first time create across Europe common 
access for each exchange's customers to the alliance markets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It will be done by linking their computer systems through a  
common interface. 
</P>
<P>
	The officials, meeting in Brussels, said the system should be up  
and running by November 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Initially, the exchanges had considered merging into a single,  
unified stock market based in one European city. The new system 
will bring them closer, but through technological means. 
</P>
<P>
	George Moeller, head of the Amsterdam Exchange, said the idea of  
a single stock exchange to replace the eight exchanges is still 
``down the road.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It may be something that will be achieved if future conditions  
merit it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the new model is expected to simplify transaction  
procedures and attract new capital flows. 
</P>
<P>
	Moeller suggested the single entry point would work mainly for  
``blue chips,'' big companies such as Shell and Unilever. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bourses also agreed to harmonize their trading rules as much  
as possible as well as the schedule of trading hours and holidays.

<HEADLINE> Stephen King Buys Van That Hit Him </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRIDGTON, Maine (AP) -- Horror writer Stephen King has obtained a  
macrabre souvenier from the accident that left him seriously 
injured: He bought the minivan that struck him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, we've got the van, and I'm going to take a sledgehammer  
and beat ... it!'' King told Thursday's editions of the The 
Bridgton News.

<P>
	The driver, Bryan Smith, 42, said in an earlier interview that  
King's lawyer and two other men paid $1,500 for the 1985 Dodge 
Caravan that he was driving when he hit King. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith has said he was distracted by his Rottweiler when he hit

<HEADLINE> Senate Panel Probing Justice Dept. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Republicans on Thursday created a task  
force to investigate how President Clinton's Justice Department 
handled inquiries into the Waco standoff, campaign finance abuses 
and nuclear espionage. 
</P>
<P>
	A key Democrat scoffed, questioning the Republicans' motives and  
saying he wouldn't participate. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said the task force would by  
chaired by Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., and would focus on ``what in 
the world is happening at the Justice Department? Why is there no 
justice at the Justice Department?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lott said the five-member task force would be bipartisan with  
two more Republicans and two Democrats in addition to Specter. But 
only one other Republican member, Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa, 
was present at Thursday's announcement and no Democrats attended. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a Republican task force. No Democrats have been  
involved,'' said Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the senior Democrat 
on the Judiciary Committee. ``I don't intend to be part of a 
Republican-organized, partisan investigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Specter already has moved forward on his probe. He said that his  
aides had traveled to Texas to preserve evidence collected from the 
siege and found that only one of two possibly flammable tear gas 
canisters which federal agents only recently admitted firing. 
``Nobody knows'' what happened to the other one, Specter said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also confirmed he had talked with Charles LaBella about  
leading the panel's investigation. LaBella is a former Justice 
Department prosecutor who publicly disagreed with Attorney General 
Janet Reno's decision to not have an outside, independent counsel 
investigate fund-raising abuses by the Clinton-Gore campaign in the 
1996 election. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a great, great many questions which are left  
unanswered,'' Specter, said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Things just aren't right,'' agreed Grassley. Sen. Strom  
Thurmond of South Carolina will round out the Republican side of 
the panel, Specter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Specter said that at the request of former Sen. John Danforth he  
will hold off for 30 days before talking to witnesses of the 
government's siege of the Branch Davidian compound. Reno named 
Danforth to head an independent investigation of the government's 
use of force during the 1993 standoff in Waco. The siege ended in a 
fire and the deaths of about 80 Davidians. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to the Judiciary Committee last week, Danforth  
complained that Specter's investigators already had interviewed 
witnesses. ``In the interest of avoiding even the appearance of a 
turf battle,'' Specter told reporters Thursday, he agreed to hold 
off on interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	The probes were sparked by revelations last month that the FBI  
used potentially incendiary tear gas on the final day of the siege. 
The bureau had denied the use of such devices for years and failed 
to turn over to Congress videotapes that may have pointed to such 
use. 
</P>
<P>
	Government officials maintain that Branch Davidians, and not  
federal agents, set the fatal fire on April 19, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	As Danforth and House Government Reform Committee investigators  
pursued their probes, Senate Republicans squabbled for weeks over 
the size and scope of what was to be the Senate's investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, wanted a  
narrowly focused probe; Specter and Lott advocated a broader look 
at the Justice Department. Hatch did not attend Thursday's news 
conference on the issue, and later told reporters he grudgingly 
signed off on Specter's plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would have preferred it be done another way,'' Hatch said.  
``It's out of my hands now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Specter was ready to start putting a staff in place. LaBella, he  
said, ``would hit the ground with a sprint.'' But he added that he 
will not extend a formal offer to LaBella until after he has spoken 
with Democrats over the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
	Concerned that LaBella's stewardship of an investigation that  
would focus largely on his former boss' performance, Specter said 
he has received informal approval for the hiring from officials on 
the Senate Ethics Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	LaBella would have intimate knowledge of the campaign finance  
investigation, but Specter said the task force probe would stretch 
to a third topic, the Justice Department's handling of Chinese 
nuclear espionage investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI has expanded its probe of alleged Chinese espionage,  
following criticism that for more than three years it focused too 
narrowly on the Los Alamos nuclear weapons lab.

<HEADLINE>  IOC Defending Anti-Drug Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Under fire from the White House and key  
international sports officials, the International Olympic Committee 
is fighting to uphold its latest initiatives in the fight against 
performance-enhancing drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven months after holding an international conference on the  
escalating drug crisis in sports, the IOC is facing scathing 
criticism of its plans for a world anti-doping agency and new 
anti-doping code. 
</P>
<P>
	White House drug czar Barry McCaffrey said Wednesday the IOC's  
drug agency project is unacceptable, claiming it lacked 
transparency, accountability and independence, and maintained ``the 
Byzantine elements of the current IOC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's not the first time McCaffrey and the IOC have locked horns.  
At the anti-drug summit in February, IOC officials responded to 
McCaffrey's criticism by telling him to solve the serious doping 
problem in American sports before lecturing the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	Dick Pound, an IOC vice president who is among those  
spearheading the anti-doping agency project, said he would write to 
McCaffrey to contest his latest remarks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a little disappointed with his approach,'' Pound said in a  
telephone interview. ``It ignores a lot of good work that has been 
done leading to an international consensus for the agency. That's 
what we promised at the world conference and that's what we've 
delivered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jacques Rogge, an IOC executive board official, accused  
McCaffrey of ignoring that the agency plans have been backed by 
European governments, the United Nations, World Health Organization 
and other bodies. 
</P>
<P>
	``If that's not a strong political agreement, I don't know what  
is,'' he said. ``If Gen. McCaffrey is not happy, he better consult 
with the other governments who have given their approval. He should 
not point the finger at the IOC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The drug agency is designed to coordinate drug testing around  
the world, including unannounced out-of-competition controls. The 
IOC, which is putting up $25 million to get the agency started, has 
promised it will be established by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC director general Francois Carrard said a Swiss foundation,  
run by a board of directors consisting of government and sports 
officials, would be set up shortly to manage the agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Several contentious issues remain to be decided -- namely where  
the agency will be located and who will run it. Critics, like 
McCaffrey, say the agency should be completely independent of the 
IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	Lausanne, Switzerland, where the IOC is based, is one of the  
possible sites being considered for the agency's headquarters. 
Other cities which have expressed interest include Vienna, Austria; 
Madrid, Spain; Lisbon, Portugal, and Stockholm, Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the agency's tasks will be to apply the IOC's  
controversial new ``Olympic Movement Anti-Doping Code.'' The 
95-page document sets out guidelines on drug testing, sanctions, 
rules and procedures for all Olympic sports. 
</P>
<P>
	The code, approved by the IOC at its session in Seoul, South  
Korea, in June, is scheduled to go into effect Jan. 1. But it has 
come under attack from several leading Olympic officials. 
</P>
<P>
	John Coates, president of the Australian Olympic Committee,  
recently sent a 12-page letter to IOC president Juan Antonio 
Samaranch criticizing the code as ``unworkable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coates, a lawyer, found numerous holes in the document,  
including flaws in the definitions of doping and trafficking and 
failure to fully address the issue of out-of-competition testing. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound, who drafted the document along with fellow IOC vice  
president Keba Mbaye of Senegal, said the code is a ``work in 
progress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not perfect,'' Pound said. ``No document in this field  
will ever be perfect. If any changes should or will be made, they 
ought to be made at the behest of the agency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senior officials of two major Olympic sports, track and field  
and swimming, have expressed serious reservations about the code. 
</P>
<P>
	Gunnar Werner, honorary secretary of the international swimming  
federation, said he agreed with many of Coates' complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope (the document) will be delayed or reconsidered,'' he  
said. ``The main problem is it completely changes the whole system 
of sanctions. It conflicts with our rules. At the moment, we would 
not be able to apply it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arne Ljungqvist, chairman of the International Amateur Athletic  
Federation's medical commission, said his federation would also 
need to change its rules, noting that the next IAAF congress won't 
be held until 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	The code lists a scale of sanctions for drug offenses, including  
``intentional doping.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For example, recommended penalties for a first offense for use  
of stimulants or other minor substances are: a warning, a ban from 
one or several competitions, a fine of up to $100,000, and a 
suspension of one one to six months. 
</P>
<P>
	For intentional doping with steroids, the listed penalties are:  
life ban from participation in any sports event, fine of up to $1 
million, suspension of four years to life from all sports 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Werner and Ljungqvist questioned how sports officials will be  
able to prove intentional doping. According to the document, 
intentional doping can be proved ``by any means whatsoever, 
including presumption.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pound, a lawyer, said the sanctions were drafted in a way so  
they can withstand legal scrutiny.

<HEADLINE> Book Gives Reagan Blunt Appraisal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ronald Reagan's official biographer doubts  
Nancy Reagan will like what he's written. 
</P>
<P>
	``My guess is that she's going to be disturbed by it,'' Edmund  
Morris tells CBS' ``60 Minutes'' in a program to be broadcast 
Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris' ``Dutch: A Memoir of Ronald Reagan,'' credits Reagan  
with making a profound impact on the country and judges him to be a 
consequential leader. But leaked excerpts also betray the author's 
blunt appraisal of Reagan's state of mind as president and his 
frequent disengagement with the functions of his job. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris told ``60 Minutes'' he was surprised Mrs. Reagan did not  
ask to see a prepublication copy of the book, noting ``Nancy likes 
to be in on everything.'' CBS on Thursday released a sample of its 
coming segment on Morris. 
</P>
<P>
	Random House will release the book next Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	Morris said Mrs. Reagan will probably be disturbed by the book  
``because it observes her husband very, very objectively. 
</P>
<P>
	``And I do not hide the fact that Reagan was frequently an old,  
spaced-out man, inattentive to details. I do not disguise the fact 
that he was boring in private.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reagan himself has been silenced by Alzheimer's disease.  
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Reagan's office asked for questions to be submitted in  
writing Thursday and did not immediately respond. She said earlier 
this week she had not seen the book. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris said in earlier interviews Reagan's mental and physical  
health began declining after he was shot and seriously wounded in 
1981, but that he was not suggesting the president had Alzheimer's 
while in office.

<HEADLINE> Fina Aquitaine Bid To Close Oct. 15 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- France's stock market regulator on Thursday set a  
date of Oct. 15 for the closure of Total Fina's friendly takeover 
bid for rival oil giant Elf Aquitaine. 
</P>
<P>
	The Conseil des Marches Financiers, the regulatory group that  
sets the stock market calendar for takeover bids, announced the 
closing date in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sept. 13, Total Fina and Elf brought an acrimonious,  
weeks-long takeover fight to a close by agreeing to a friendly 
merger in which Total Fina sweetened its bid for Elf. 
</P>
<P>
	Total Fina is now offering 19 of its own shares for 13 Elf  
shares in a deal worth about 52.4 billion euros ($55 billion). Its 
earlier unsolicited offer, launched July 5, was a 4-for-3 share 
swap, which Elf then countered with its own bid for Total Fina.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Members Issue Iraq Statement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The five permanent members of the U.N.  
Security Council have failed to bridge their differences on a new 
policy toward Iraq but were finishing up a joint statement today 
pledging to keep working to reach an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement by the United States, Britain, France, China and  
Russia also will reaffirm that Iraq must live up to obligations 
including the elimination of its weapons of mass destruction before 
sanctions are lifted. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a step forward,'' said China's deputy U.N. ambassador  
Shen Guofang, whose country is coordinating the statement. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. ambassadors from the five veto-wielding countries have been  
meeting for months to try to develop a new U.N. Iraq policy that 
would lead to the resumption of inspection of Iraq's weapons 
programs. The diplomatic effort was stepped up this month, with 
senior diplomats meeting in London last week and in New York twice 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraq was to be on the agenda at a lunch today for foreign  
ministers of the five nations hosted by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi 
Annan. Chinese and U.S. diplomats said the statement would be 
issued this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very brief statement and in very general terms,'' Shen  
told The Associated Press. ``We tried very hard to narrow our 
differences, but finally they're still there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. deputy ambassador Peter Burleigh said ``the meetings have  
been steps forward, but there's still a distance to go before there 
can be agreement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has been pressing for a resumption of weapons  
inspections in Iraq but has run into tough Russian resistance in 
reaching agreement on a resolution. France and China are holding 
out as well. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. weapons inspectors pulled out of Iraq in mid-December  
shortly before the United States and Britain launched airstrikes 
against Iraq for its failure to cooperate with the inspections. 
</P>
<P>
	All five permanent council members agree on the need to resume  
weapons monitoring in Iraq, and to improve living conditions for 
the 22 million Iraqis living under U.N. sanctions -- but exactly 
what Baghdad must do before the council will loosen sanctions, and 
how far those restrictions should be eased, remains in dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	China, France and Russia, Iraq's closest allies on the Security  
Council, have tabled a draft resolution that would suspend all 
sanctions if Iraq cooperates with a new commission that would 
monitor its banned weapons programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain and the Netherlands have tabled a rival resolution,  
which the United States supports. It would suspend only the oil 
embargo on Iraq if Baghdad answers key remaining questions about 
its weapons programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf repeated  
Wednesday that his country wouldn't consider any plan that didn't 
include the total lifting of sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be no progress except by lifting sanctions,''  
al-Sahhaf said.

<HEADLINE> IMF Head Says Relief for Poor Near </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers and the  
head of the International Monetary Fund both expressed optimism 
Thursday that agreement will soon be reached on how to finance 
greatly expanded debt relief for the world's poorest countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Michel Camdessus, the IMF managing director, said finance  
officials were ``within striking distance'' of a deal. One of the 
key elements of the revamped proposal is the sale of 14 million 
ounces of the IMF's gold reserves to IMF member countries, rather 
than on the open market. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale will pay for the IMF's contribution to a program  
intended to forgive $90 billion in debt held by the world's 41 
poorest nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers said the administration this week asked Congress for  
nearly $1 billion to finance a larger U.S. contribution to debt 
relief, hoping that will serve as a catalyst for increased 
contributions from other wealthy countries and the international 
lending agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	He told reporters at the Treasury of ``a unique opportunity, at  
the dawn of a new millennium,'' to focus on the unsolved moral 
problem of dealing with the crushing debt burdens carried by the 
world's poorest nations. 
</P>
<P>
	In previewing the upcoming meetings of the 182-nation IMF and  
its sister lending organization, the World Bank, Summers said the 
United States would proposal strengthening the IMF's ability to 
guard against misuse of its loans -- one of the allegations made 
against Russia in a widening investigation of money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the U.S. proposals, which the IMF's governing board would  
have to approve, the IMF would be directed to order independent 
audits of central banks in countries suspected of misusing loans. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF also would get greater leeway to penalize borrowing  
countries caught lying to the agency about domestic economic 
conditions. The IMF also could impose penalties for abuse even 
after a country has stopped borrowing from the agency. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration's package comes in the wake of renewed  
criticism by Republicans in Congress that the IMF's approach to 
handling Russia, strongly supported by President Clinton, has 
failed. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the IMF meetings came amid extreme turmoil in global  
financial markets, following the August 1998 collapse of the 
Russian ruble and the near failure of a large U.S. hedge fund. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years of turbulence forced the IMF to assemble more than  
$100 billion in bailout packages for crisis countries. Now, though, 
economic prospects are looking up, with hardhit Asian nations 
beginning to pull out of steep recessions. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the good news, Camdessus said, ``There is no room for  
complacency. This is a time for pushing ahead with structural 
changes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before the IMF and World Bank meetings, finance ministers and  
central bank presidents of the world's seven largest economies -- 
the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and 
Canada -- are gathering Saturday. Their hosts are Summers and 
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets believe the G-7 may discuss a plan to jointly  
intervene in currency markets to buy dollars to support the U.S. 
currency, which has dropped sharply in value recently against the 
Japanese yen. 
</P>
<P>
	But despite repeated attempts, Summers would not discuss what  
the G-7's joint statement might say about cooperation on currency 
matters. He repeated the administration's view that a strong dollar 
is in the best interests of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF's complex financing arrangement for debt relief would  
involve revaluation of 14 million ounces of its huge gold reserves 
from $47 per ounce, the current value on the IMF's books, to world 
market prices, now more than $250. The extra money would be 
invested; the proceeds would finance the IMF's debt relief 
contribution. 
</P>
<P>
	Camdessus said the IMF's own review had found no basis for  
accusations that IMF loans had been used. He called those charges 
``totally unjustified.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He indicated the IMF is going forward with preparations to  
extend the next installment of $4.5 billion in loans to Russia this 
year because Russia now is exceeding the IMF's economic 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	Camdessus was more critical of another big borrower, Indonesia.  
The IMF program with that country will remain suspended until the 
situation in East Timor stabilizes and the Indonesian government 
produces a report answering allegations that Bank Bali improperly 
transferred around $70 million from the bank to a private company 
controlled by a senior official in the ruling Golkar Party.

<HEADLINE> Possible Help for Muscle Diseases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Bone marrow transplants could restore strength to  
patients with muscular dystrophy and other muscle-wasting diseases, 
researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers at Children's Hospital who infused muscular  
dystrophy-weakened mice with bone marrow cells taken from healthy 
mice found that the cells generated healthy muscle cells. 
</P>
<P>
	Those healthy cells then traveled through the blood stream and  
to some extent restored the mice's ravaged skeletal muscles, 
according to lead researchers Richard Mulligan and Louis Kunkel of 
Children's Hospital and Harvard Medical School. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings are important because adults may have a reservoir  
of these cells in their bodies that have the potential to generate 
other types of cells, said Emanuela Gussoni, a biologist in 
Kunkel's lab and lead author of the paper in Thursday's issue of 
the journal Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	In a related experiment, Gussoni and her colleagues isolated  
muscle stem cells from mice and demonstrated they could generate 
adult muscle cells as well as bone marrow cells. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Leon Charash, chairman of the medical advisory committee of  
the Muscular Dystrophy Association, said the findings were 
``exciting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The work may eventually lead to an unanticipated treatment  
approach for all the muscles ravaged by neuromuscular disease,'' he 
said.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Wants in on E-Commerce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Microsoft Corp., hoping to snare a bigger share  
of the growing Internet commerce market, announced a series of 
initiatives Thursday aimed at allowing consumers easier ways to 
surf and shop and giving businesses new software tools to sell 
their products. 
</P>
<P>
	Included was a new shopping service through Microsoft's msn.com  
Web site that lets consumers compare prices for everything from 
electronics to clothing to furniture and buy them on the spot. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft also said that on Sept. 30 it will launch bCentral, an  
Internet gateway site to help small businesses build Web sites and 
market to new customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft wants to make the Web ``an indispensable part of life  
and is doing that with software,'' said Richard Belluzzo, hired 
less than three weeks ago to help the company better challenge 
rival Web sites Yahoo! and America Online. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft officials also talked about their plans for something  
they called the ``Everyday Web,'' technology that allows consumers 
and businesses to use Internet services such as browsing, shopping 
and e-mail without a personal computer. The company has been 
building partnerships with wireless carriers to access the Web 
through handheld portable computers such as the Palm, cellular 
phones and its WebTV service. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have the experience, software and services to do things  
that other people aren't doing,'' said Brad Chase of Microsoft's 
Consumer and Commerce Group. ``What we're talking about with the 
Everyday Web is making the Web as ubiquitous as the phone, but a 
thousand times more useful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company also announced Thursday that it plans an initial  
public offering for its Expedia travel reservations site, a move 
that will give investors the opportunity to focus on just one 
aspect of the company's business and bring in as much as $75 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Expedia stock offering is the latest in a series of  
maneuvers Microsoft has made to jump start its online ventures. 
</P>
<P>
	Just this week, Microsoft announced it would form a joint  
venture with Ford Motor Co. to allow users of Microsoft's CarPoint 
automotive service to ``build-to-order'' a car. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear how well the new initiatives would improve  
Microsoft's position in the competitive world of electronic 
commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	Several Microsoft rivals such as IBM and Sun Microsystems have  
already staked their own claims in selling e-commerce software, an 
attempt to grab a piece of consumers' estimated $12 billion in 
Internet purchases this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts called Microsoft's plans interesting but not  
earthshaking. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems the company that has the latest technology is the  
company that has the latest press release,'' said Peter Goldmacher 
of Merrill Lynch. ``It's a game of inches right now, and we'll see 
how AOL and others respond.''

<HEADLINE> Fla. Campus Tense After Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Two apparently racist pipe bombings at  
predominantly black Florida A&AMP;M University have spread fear on 
campus and prompted school administrators to add security cameras 
and dozens of uniformed police officers. 
</P>
<P>
	Classes were mostly full and students milled about the  
quadrangle Thursday, one day after the second pipe bomb exploded. 
Despite the security measures, many were uneasy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Telling a freshman to not be afraid as they lay their head  
down for the night is something I can't see,'' said Nekeisha 
Briggs, a senior from New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither pipe bomb caused significant damage but an anonymous  
call to a Tallahassee television station threatening that the blast 
was ``just the beginning'' has many fearing that a racist serial 
bomber is on the loose. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's playing with the very life of our university,'' said  
Frederick Humphries, president of the 12,000-student school. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators wouldn't say Thursday if they have any suspects or  
even if the two bombings are connected, but they acknowledged 
similarities between the Aug. 31 explosion in an administration 
building restroom and Wednesday's explosion in the restroom in a 
classroom building. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first explosion, a caller used racial slurs and indicated  
he wanted to ``get rid of'' some of the people at Florida A&AMP;M. On 
Wednesday, a caller told ABC affiliate WTXL-TV that students at 
Florida A&AMP;M didn't need a university and that the explosion was 
``just the beginning, brother.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said anonymous calls were made about the time of  
both explosions and both pipe bombs were small. A $16,000 award was 
offered for information leading to an arrest and conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	To prevent further problems, the school announced Thursday it  
was adding a system of surveillance cameras, requiring ID badges on 
campus and hiring an outside security firm. It also is adding 50 
uniformed police officers from the city and county to its campus 
patrol until an arrest is made. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Jesse Jackson announced Thursday that he would visit  
the university Sunday to lead a prayer vigil. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether it is Oklahoma City or FAMU, none of us are safe until  
all of us are safe,'' Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
	While administrators tried to calm worried parents, Derric Heck,  
the student government vice president, urged students not to 
succumb to threats. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let them know that our education cannot be stopped,'' Heck  
told fellow students from the university's library steps Wednesday 
evening.

	Aussie Peacekeepers Come Under Sniper Fire  
</P>
<P>
	DILI, East Timor (AP) -- As hostile automatic gunfire crackled  
across the city for the first time since the force arrived in East 
Timor's devastated capital, Australian peacekeeping troops came 
under sniper fire in Dili today. Gunmen fired from nearby trees at 
a house commandeered by the Australians, Associated Press 
Television News reported. There were no immediate reports of 
casualties. Earlier, shots were fired near the sports stadium where 
refugees were seeking protection from pro-Indonesia militias.

	Russian Police Defuse Large Bomb  
</P>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Police discovered an explosive device set to blow  
up in the basement of a 12-story apartment building in western 
Russia, the Emergency Situations Ministry said today. Police did 
not say whether there was a link between the device, found last 
Wednesday in the city of Ryazan, and four apartment bomb blasts 
that killed some 300 people in Moscow and two other Russian cities 
this month. Authorities were alerted by a resident of the building 
who claimed to have seen people hauling large sacks from a car with 
covered license plates, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.

	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- NASA's first interplanetary weather  
satellite hurtled closer to Mars early today as controllers 
anxiously awaited word that it had begun orbiting the red planet. 
The orbiter and its companion, the Mars Polar Lander, carry 
instruments that will try to discover the fate of water believed to 
have once formed rivers or lakes on the planet. Mission scientists 
say water is the key to determining whether life ever existed on 
Mars. The lander, which was launched separately, is due to arrive 
Dec. 3.

	Council Members Agree on Iraq Policy

<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The five permanent members of the U.N.  
Security Council have agreed on general principles on a policy 
toward Iraq, but could not forge a common stance that would lead to 
the resumption of arms inspections. An agreement would mark a 
modest step forward in the search for ways to resume U.N. 
inspections of Iraq's weapons programs after a halt of more than 
nine months. But the five council members -- the United States, 
Britain, France, Russia and China -- remain sharply divided on key 
issues.

	Vets at Higher Risk for Hepatitis C  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Many veterans unknowingly harbor a  
liver-destroying virus, according to a new campaign encouraging 
veterans to seek testing and treatment for hepatitis C. An 
estimated 2.7 million Americans are infected with hepatitis C. 
Although it kills up to 10,000 Americans a year, it can lurk for 
decades without causing symptoms, so many people don't know they 
are infected until their liver is seriously damaged. Veterans may 
be at special risk.

	Justice Dept. Sues Tobacco Ind. for Billions  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department sued the nation's  
tobacco industry yesterday to recover billions of dollars that 
federal health plans spent treating smoking-related illnesses. The 
civil suit, which also targets research and public relations 
institutes funded by the industry, alleges cigarette makers 
conspired to defraud and mislead the public about the dangers of 
tobacco. Attorney General Janet Reno said the cigarette companies 
gave profits a higher priority than public health.

	GENEVA (AP) -- The prosecutor in charge of investigating alleged  
Russian money laundering in Switzerland said yesterday that Boris 
Yeltsin will be immune from Swiss questioning as long as he remains 
president of Russia. Bertossa is overseeing the main Swiss 
investigation into allegations of Russian money-laundering, 
including supposed channels to the Bank of New York. Investigators 
have alleged that Russian businesses and individuals illegally

called the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, has largely

<HEADLINE> Ashland Raises Offer to Superfos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COVINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Ashland Inc.'s bid to purchase Superfos  
won the support of the Danish company's chairman after the 
Kentucky-based company raised its offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashland boosted its offer 6.5 percent to 160 kroner a share, the  
equivalent of $22.63 a share. The new offer raises the total 
purchase price from $650 million to $690 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is still contingent on Superfos' board recommending it  
to shareholders, Ashland said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashland initially offered $21 a share on Aug. 9 after a bid to  
buy the Danish company's U.S. paving assets was rejected. Ashland 
wants to merge the $700 million paving operation with its $1.44 
billion APAC paving and construction unit. 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from the paving business, Superfos owns packaging,  
chemicals and aerosols operations, some of which Ashland is 
expected to sell if it acquires Superfos. 
</P>
<P>
	The new deal was brokered by Superfos Chairman Kjeld Ranum and  
James R. Boyd, Ashland senior vice president and group operating 
officer over APAC and Arch Coal. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to APAC, Ashland owns specialty chemical and  
distribution companies, Valvoline car-care products, and large 
equity stakes in Arch Coal and Marathon Ashland Petroleum.

<HEADLINE> Utah Agents Find 10,000 Pot Plants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LIBERTY, Utah (AP) -- A hiker stumbled across an estimated 10,000  
marijuana plants growing in the mountains in what could be the 
biggest pot seizure ever in the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Police continued searching the rugged mountain area near the  
North Ogden Divide for more plants following Wednesday's discovery 
on land that may be owned by the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
	Two men were taken into custody Thursday as possible suspects.  
No other information about the suspects was released. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Blackhawks Sign Anders Eriksson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Defenseman Anders Eriksson ended his 20-day  
holdout and agreed to a one-year contract with the Chicago 
Blackhawks. 
</P>
<P>
	Eriksson, a 24-year-old defenseman, agreed to the deal  
Wednesday, general manager Bob Murray said. Published reports today 
quote team sources as saying the contract guarantees Eriksson 
$800,000 with performance bonuses that could add $300,000 to it. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blackhawks had offered a three-year contract worth $3  
million, but couldn't agree with Eriksson on money for a long-term 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Eriksson was acquired from Detroit last year along with  
first-round picks in 1999 and 2001 in a trade that sent Blackhawks 
captain Chris Chelios to the Red Wings. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-2, 220-pound native of Sweden played in 11 games with  
Chicago and had eight assists. Eriksson's best year was in 
1997-1998 with Detroit, where he scored 7 goals in 66 games and had 
14 assists. 
</P>
<P>
	Eriksson's signing leaves the Blackhawks with one player still  
holding out for a better deal. Murray said negotiations have 
resumed with defenseman Boris Mironov's agent, but he had no 
progress to report.

<HEADLINE> Gas King Labonte Back at Dover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DOVER, Del. (AP) -- As a hard charger from the outset of his  
career, Bobby Labonte never figured to be the fuel economy king of 
NASCAR. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, when gas mileage looks to be a factor near the end of a  
race, radio scanners often crackle with this phrase: ``The 18 car 
says it has enough to go the distance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Labonte smiles when he hears that, and knows that on Sunday the  
same message might be passed along pit road should the MBNA Gold 
400 become an economy run. He isn't embarrassed by it, but that 
certainly wasn't the way he figured he'd win for the first time at 
Dover Downs International Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	``All those years, we were a top-five, top-10 car, and then to  
win on gas mileage, well ...'' he said, his voice fading off almost 
as if he can't believe it happened. 
</P>
<P>
	That it did, three months ago in the MBNA Platinum 400, and  
Labonte has been labeled as a gas miser ever since. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been fast here, and that's not the way I wanted to win,  
but we'll take it, whatever,'' the driver for Joe Gibbs Racing 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Labonte, who seeks his 12th career victory and fifth this  
season, takes little of the credit for his new-found ability. 
</P>
<P>
	``It starts off with the shop, with preparation of the race car,  
tuning of the engine,'' he said. ``It doesn't burn excess fuel, 
just enough not to hurt the performance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Teammate Tony Stewart, whose stout run for the front in June  
ended when he was forced to pit for a late splash of gas, marvels 
at Labonte's ability to go farther than the rest on a tank of fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bobby's a right-foot braker, and I'm a left-foot braker,'' he  
said, noting a difference in driving styles. 
</P>
<P>
	A driver who uses his left foot on the brake pedal gets on it  
before his right foot completes its throttle-down maneuver in the 
turns. A right-footed driver is off the gas before touching the 
brake. His lap time might be slower, but his fuel mileage better. 
</P>
<P>
	That's especially true on a high-banked oval like Dover. Here,  
they build great speed on the long straightaways before the drivers 
must throttle down and in just a few seconds get back on the gas. 
</P>
<P>
	It's an art. Come off of the gas too abruptly, and precious  
power is lost. Get back on too hard, and fuel is wasted. 
</P>
<P>
	Labonte can't say exactly why he's become so adept at it.  
</P>
<P>
	``My style of driving seems to complement what the crew has  
done,'' he said. ``I don't have any other answer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he knows what an advantage he has, and in a sport as  
competitive as Winston Cup racing anything one team does better 
than the others can be worth several positions on the race track. 
In Labonte's case, it can be even more dramatic. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just about every race we go to, it seems like we can go a lap  
further than a lot of people,'' he said. ``It's not me. It's just 
efficiency, all of us working together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Crew chief Jimmy Makar said, ``Everybody's got a race track that  
seems to agree with the way the car's set up. Dover's just a place 
where we've been able to run, a place Bobby likes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That part is remarkable, considering the feelings of most racers  
about The Monster Mile. That Labonte runs it so well is important, 
Makar insists. 
</P>
<P>
	He says the attitude of a driver often permits him to figure out  
new ways to attack a track. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like the place,'' Labonte said. ``I don't know why, because  
nobody else does.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps, but Labonte's principal competition Sunday has  
accounted for six victories at Dover. Dale Jarrett, who leads him 
by 254 points with eight races remaining, also won on fuel, in June 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Martin, third in the points, another 18 behind Labonte, is  
the two-time defending race champion. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Gordon, who led the past two June races until pitting in  
the waning laps, is a three-time Dover winner. He shares with Jeff 
Burton the series lead in victories. Both are seeking their sixth 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Nemechek, who got his first career victory last Sunday at  
Loudon, N.H., also might figure in the mix.

<HEADLINE> Athletics 9, Orioles 6, 1st game  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Miguel Tejada hit a tiebreaking homer in the  
eighth inning as the Oakland Athletics ended the Baltimore Orioles' 
13-game winning streak with a 9-6 victory Thursday in the opener of 
a doubleheader. 
</P>
<P>
	Matt Stairs, Ben Grieve and Mike Macfarlane also homered for the  
A's, who moved within 4 1/2 games of Boston in the AL wild-card race. 
Boston was to play Toronto on Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Albert Belle homered for the Orioles, whose 13-game streak was  
one short of the team record set in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
	The doubleheader was a makeup of two games washed out last week  
by Hurricane Floyd. The A's traveled from Oakland and will move on 
to Texas on Friday; the Orioles, who came from Texas, will play in 
Boston on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Tejada led off the eighth by hitting the first pitch from Gabe  
Molina (1-2) into the left-field seats to put Oakland up 7-6. Jason 
Giambi then singled in a run with his third hit of the game and 
another scored on a throwing error. 
</P>
<P>
	T.J. Mathews (9-4) worked 1 2-3 innings for Oakland and Jason  
Isringhausen worked the ninth for his seventh save. 
</P>
<P>
	Stairs and Grieve hit solo homers off Sidney Ponson in the fifth  
to give Oakland a 6-3 lead. Stairs' blast, estimated at 423 feet, 
was his 36th of the season and 100th of his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Baltimore pulled even in the bottom of the inning, taking  
advantage of two errors and a wild pitch by rookie Brett Laxton to 
score three unearned runs. 
</P>
<P>
	Laxton, recalled from Triple-A Vancouver before the game,  
allowed three earned runs and seven hits in 4 2-3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Bordick doubled and Belle hit his 36th homer to give  
Baltimore a 2-0 lead in the first inning. Macfarlane then put the 
A's in front with a three-run shot in the second. 
</P>
<P>
	After Oakland loaded the bases with no outs in the third, John  
Jaha drove in a run with a grounder before Ponson struck out Grieve 
and Tejada. Bordick hit a sacrifice fly in the Orioles' half to 
make it 4-3. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Macfarlane's homer was his third in 213 at-bats this  
season. ... Orioles pitchers struck out a season-high 15. ... 
Ponson struck out eight but gave up three home runs. He has allowed 
a team-high 34 homers, including at least one in 20 of 26 starts. 
... Stairs became the 24th player in the eight-year history of 
Camden Yards to hit a ball onto Eutaw Street beyond the right-field 
scoreboard.

<HEADLINE> Jobless Claims at 25-Year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- New claims for unemployment benefits dropped  
unexpectedly last week to the lowest level in a quarter of a 
century. But economists chalked up much of the decline to Hurricane 
Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	A total of 272,000 Americans filed new claims for jobless  
benefits for the week that ended Saturday, down 17,000 from the 
previous week, the Labor Department said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	That was the fewest since Jan. 5, 1974, when claims totaled  
269,000. Many economists had forecast a rise in last week's claims 
to 290,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors have been concerned that the Federal Reserve might  
raise interest rates a third time this year to slow economic growth 
and keep inflation in check. The Dow Jones industrial average 
closed down 205.48 points at 10,318.59, reflecting those fears 
along with continued concerns about the strength of the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	Some private economists believe Hurricane Floyd prevented some  
unemployed people from getting to claims offices. Labor Department 
officials acknowledged that part of the drop could have been 
related to the hurricane but had no specific data on the storm's 
effects. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a temporary blip,'' said economist Richard Yamarone of  
Argus Research Corp. ``It is not indicative of a worsening in the 
already tight labor market. It's unrelated to true economic 
conditions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He and other economists expect claims to increase in next week's  
report, putting them more in line with levels seen over the last 
few months. 
</P>
<P>
	However, last week was the ninth in a row with claims below  
300,000. Economists consider such jobless claim levels an 
indication of an extremely tight labor market. 
</P>
<P>
	While that's good news for workers, it is potentially worrisome  
to economists. Their fear: Employers scrambling for workers woo 
them with higher wages and benefits, and those costs may drive up 
prices and spark inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Thus far, inflation is well behaved.  
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Reserve said Wednesday in a survey on business  
conditions around the nation that there have been ``few reports of 
acceleration in nominal wages and salaries'' even as companies find 
it difficult to hire qualified workers for job openings. The survey 
noted that some areas reported ``a substantial upswing in the cost 
of health-care benefits'' while consumer prices are stable. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department said the four-week average for claims,  
which smoothes out week-to-week volatility, also was down last 
week, to 285,750. That was the lowest level since April 21, when 
the four-week average was 284,500 claims. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tight labor market remains the Fed's chief concern,'' said  
Merrill Lynch economist Karen Dexter. She expects the nation's 
unemployment rate in September to slip to 4.1 percent from its 
current 29 year low of 4.2 percent. The unemployment report will be 
released in early October. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week ending Sept. 11, the Labor Department said, 42  
states and territories reported decreases in new jobless claim 
applications, while 10 reported increases. The state data lag a 
week behind the national figures. 
</P>
<P>
	States with the biggest decreases were California, down 4,359;  
Missouri, down 2,615; Kentucky, down 2,261; Illinois, down, 2,026, 
and Pennsylvania, down, 1,672. 
</P>
<P>
	The states with the biggest increases were North Carolina, up  
902; North Dakota, up 222; Arkansas, up 167; Minnesota, up 95; and 
Vermont, up 91.

<HEADLINE> Blues Owner Laurie Buys Grizzlies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- The Vancouver Grizzlies, who  
entered the NBA four years ago when the league expanded into 
Canada, will be sold to billionaire Bill Laurie, owner of the NHL's 
St. Louis Blues. 
</P>
<P>
	Two league sources, speaking on the condition they not be  
identified, told The Associated Press that an agreement in 
principle has been reached to sell the team. 
</P>
<P>
	The league's Board of Governors still must approve the sale,  
which could conceivably result in the team being relocated to St. 
Louis for the 2000-01 season. The sale price was not immediately 
known. 
</P>
<P>
	The owners of the Grizzlies, Vancouver Canucks and the GM Place  
arena called a news conference for 3:30 p.m. EDT today to announce 
the sale. It comes the same day that commissioner David Stern 
arrived in town for the NBA's league meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Canadian Press also reported that the Grizzlies would be  
sold, citing an unidentifed source connected with the owners. 
</P>
<P>
	Laurie, a former Memphis State point guard, and his wife, Nancy,  
an heir to the Wal-Mart fortune, recently bought the NHL's Blues 
and the Kiel Center in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	Laurie, an avid basketball fan, certainly has the financial  
resources. He and his wife agreed in April to buy the Colorado 
Avalanche of the NHL, the Denver Nuggets of the NBA and Denver's 
new Pepsi Center for $400 million US. But they lost out when a 
rival group, given a second chance to bid, offered $461 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Speculation has swirled about the future of the Grizzlies  
franchise ever since Seattle-based owner John McCaw said last month 
he was willing to sell part or all of his Orca Bay sports empire. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Louis has not had an NBA team since the Hawks left in 1968,  
but Laurie won't be able to move the Grizzlies for at least one 
season. Under NBA rules, an expansion franchise has to stay five 
years in the new city. 
</P>
<P>
	If Laurie wants to move the team for the 2000-01 season, he must  
apply to the NBA by March 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The Grizzlies have met with limited success since joining the  
NBA, never winning more than 19 games. Vancouver was 8-42 in the 
lockout-shortened 1999 season, the worst record in the 29-team 
league. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, a spokesman for Laurie confirmed he was interested  
in the Grizzlies. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's logical to assume that the Lauries would look at the  
Grizzlies as they have looked at other NBA properties,'' said Peter 
Webb, chief spokesman for Laurie's Paige Sports Entertainment. 
``It's no secret they have looked to acquire an NBA team.''

<HEADLINE> Charges Dismissed in Day Care Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDENTON, N.C. (AP) -- Sex abuse charges have been dropped against  
the former operator of a day-care center who was once sentenced to 
12 consecutive life terms, his attorney said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The remaining charges against Robert F. Kelly Jr., who owned the  
Little Rascals day-care center, involved a woman who accused him of 
sexually abusing her when she was 9 years old. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors dismissed those charges Wednesday, said Gerald  
Beaver, Kelly's attorney. The move ends one of the most notorious 
cases in North Carolina history. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly, 51, said he and his new wife will celebrate with a trip.  
He has been out of jail on bond for the past four years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going out of state, and I'm not sure where we are going  
yet,'' Kelly said in today's Fayetteville Observer-Times. ``I just 
want to go because I can go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors did not return telephone messages left by The  
Associated Press on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly was charged along with six others in 1989 with molesting  
29 children attending the center. He was convicted in 1992 and 
sentenced to 12 life terms. 
</P>
<P>
	Kathryn Dawn Wilson, the center's cook, was found guilty the  
next year, but both convictions were overturned on appeal. The 
charges eventually were dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors in 1996 dropped charges against three women who  
never were tried, while two other defendants pleaded no contest to 
sexual abuse charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Children testified at Kelly's trial that they were forced to  
have sex with adults and each other at the day-care center and 
other places. The children also told tales of spaceships and 
trained sharks. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense argued that the children were coached into telling  
stories that fit their parents' fears. 
</P>
<P>
	Trial for Kelly, who has maintained his innocence, lasted nine  
months and cost about $1 million -- the longest and most expensive 
in state history.

<HEADLINE> Dems Decry GOP Social Spending Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans pushed a $316 billion social  
spending bill through a House subcommittee Thursday that would cut 
many of the White House's education, health and labor priorities. 
President Clinton immediately promised to veto it. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the measure equals or exceeds Clinton's requests for  
educating handicapped students, treating AIDS patients and the Job 
Corps, Democrats denounced it for cuts it would extract elsewhere. 
These included the president's plans for hiring teachers, job 
training for teen-agers and Head Start. 
</P>
<P>
	``This bill is proof that America's highest priority -- improving  
our schools -- remains the Republican Congress' lowest priority,'' 
Clinton said in a written statement. He added, ``Our nation's 
children deserve much better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans unveiled their bill the same day Clinton vetoed the  
GOP's 10-year, $792 billion tax cut. Just as he criticized the tax 
cut as a bloated misuse of budget surpluses, he called the 
labor-education measure ``another step in the same misguided 
direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill's reductions raised questions about whether it would  
ever be approved by Congress, let alone reach his desk. The 
likeliest scenario was that it would join a parade of other 
spending bills that, with or without vetoes, would reach final form 
only in negotiations between lawmakers and White House officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans defended the measure, saying they paid for it while  
honoring their pledge to not use Social Security surpluses in the 
coming fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are committed, all of us, to stop bleeding Social Security  
reserves,'' said Rep. John Porter, R-Ill., chairman of the House 
Appropriations Committee subcommittee that approved the bill. 
``That takes some discipline.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Porter did not mention the bookkeeping devices Republicans used  
to let them claim they would leave Social Security alone. This 
included delaying billions in spending until 2001, declaring $1.4 
billion in a decades-old home-heating aid program for the poor to 
be an ``emergency,'' and reclaiming $3 billion in unspent welfare 
funds from the states -- a move that governors lambasted. 
</P>
<P>
	``This bill is a fantasy,'' said Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., top  
Democrat on the Appropriations Committee. ``If it were to be 
considered real, it would do real damage to the country's future,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure -- the biggest of the 13 spending bills for the  
coming fiscal year that begins Oct. 1 -- was approved by Porter's 
subcommittee on a party-line 8-6 vote. The full committee will not 
consider it until at least next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the measure covers automatically paid benefits such as  
Medicaid. Of the remainder -- money for every other federal 
education, health and labor program -- the GOP would provide $89.4 
billion. That is $2.2 billion less than Clinton requested, and $300 
million less than is being spent this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would provide $17 billion for biomedical research at  
the National Institutes of Health, $1.1 billion more than Clinton 
requested. It also would outspend Clinton for community health 
centers, and maternal and child care grants to states. 
</P>
<P>
	But it would trim Clinton's requests for the Occupational Safety  
and Health Administration and literacy programs. And it would 
combine favorite Clinton programs for hiring new teachers, training 
teachers and improving local education standards into grants that 
states could use as they choose, but with $400 million less than 
the president requested for the three initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
	With just a week to go before fiscal 2000 begins, Congress has  
sent Clinton only four of the 13 annual spending bills that keep 
federal agencies functioning. 
</P>
<P>
	With veto threats facing seven of the bills and lawmakers moving  
slowly through internal disputes, leaders planned a stopgap measure 
that will keep government open for three additional weeks as 
problems are addressed. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile:  
</P>
<P>
	--House-Senate bargainers edged toward a compromise that would  
keep production of the F-22 stealth fighter alive but might not let 
the Air Force purchase any next year. 
</P>
<P>
	--Negotiators from the two chambers remained at odds over foreign  
aid and agriculture spending bills. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Senate voted 89-10 to approve a $14 billion measure  
financing the Interior Department after oil-state senators, by 
51-47, won language blocking the Clinton administration from 
raising royalties that oil companies pay to drill on federal lands.

<HEADLINE> Norway, Sweden To Merge Phone Cos. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OSLO, Norway (AP) -- Sweden and Norway reached final agreement  
today to merge their state telephone companies after repeated 
disputes had threatened the planned combination. 
</P>
<P>
	The combination of Sweden's Telia and Norway's Telenor would  
create a company worth about $18.6 billion and employing about 
51,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is with great pleasure that we can say the merger of  
Telenor and Telia will be completed in keeping with the original 
agreement,'' the Norwegian Minister of Transport and 
Communications, Dag Jostein Fjaervoll, said in a news release. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials say the goal is to become the leading  
telecommunications company in Europe. They also say the merged 
company will be better positioned to face competition once 
telecommunications in both countries are deregulated. 
</P>
<P>
	Merger plans were announced in January. The deal includes  
partial privatization of the state-owned companies. But a final 
agreement was reportedly delayed in part due to Swedish opposition 
to Telenor leader Tormod Hermansen as chief executive of the merged 
concern. 
</P>
<P>
	The countries were under pressure to send a final contract to  
the European Union for approval by a Friday deadline after having 
asked Brussels for extra time last week. The companies now promise 
to meet EU conditions, including the sale of their cable television 
divisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Swedish and Norwegian owners have agreed to follow the  
terms of the agreement that was reached earlier this year,'' said 
Fjaervoll. ``Recently there have been tough negotiations, but that 
is natural in such a comprehensive and complex case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the agreement was announced, Telia chairman Jan Stenberg  
withdrew as proposed chairman for the new company, a Swedish 
Ministry of Trade and Industry news release stated. 
</P>
<P>
	Stenberg is head of Scandinavian Airlines System. He'll be  
replaced as Telia-Telenor's chairman by Telia's chief officer 
Jan-Aake Kark. 
</P>
<P>
	``Personally I feel that we have reached a good agreement,''  
Swedish Trade and Industry Minister Bjoern Rosengren said in a 
statement. ``It is good for Sweden and it's good for the Swedish 
tax payers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the terms of the January deal, the Swedish government  
would initially hold 60 percent in the new company and the 
Norwegian government, 40 percent. Sometime after 2000, those stakes 
will be reduced to 33 percent as the remaining third is sold to 
investors.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Fight Money-Laundering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As U.S. investigators painstakingly unravel  
the case, government officials are conceding they have more 
questions than answers in the inquiry into allegations of a huge 
money-laundering scheme involving Russians and the Bank of New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration's announcement Thursday of a new  
national strategy to fight money laundering received extra 
attention in light of the federal investigation of the Bank of New 
York case. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian businesses and individuals -- including organized crime  
groups -- are suspected of illegally channeling as much as $10 
billion through the bank, the nation's 15th-largest and said to be 
its oldest. No one has been charged in the related investigations 
by law enforcement authorities in the United States, Britain, 
Russia and other countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know whether it involved illicit money or not. ... We  
don't know whether this is money laundering, capital flight or 
something else,'' Deputy Treasury Secretary Stuart Eizenstat told 
reporters who questioned him about the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the capital flight scenario, some of the money funneled  
through the Bank of New York could have come from thousands of 
small- to medium-sized Russian businesses that spirited funds 
through offshore companies to avoid enormous taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	The practice is illegal but very widespread in Russia, where  
taxes are punitive, rules are ever-changing and tax police say as 
many as 99 percent of businesses skirt some taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	On Capitol Hill Thursday, Deputy Secretary of State Strobe  
Talbott was quizzed on the Bank of New York case by members of the 
Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He told the panel: ``We are all 
seeking to establish the facts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no question that Russia has suffered, generally, from  
the problem of capital flight,'' testified Talbott, who had just 
returned from a mission to Moscow. ``Much of it goes, literally, 
into mattresses, because Russians don't trust banks. And much of it 
has fled the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If and when either our intelligence or law enforcement  
community comes into possession of specific information, we'll deal 
with the facts as they emerge,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration's new anti-money-laundering strategy is a  
package of proposed laws and rules aimed at stanching the flow of 
billions of criminal dollars, largely drug-trafficking profits, 
through the U.S. financial system. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials stressed that the long-awaited strategy, made public a  
few weeks after allegations of money-laundering through the Bank of 
New York came to light, has a far broader scope than Russia or any 
one country. 
</P>
<P>
	``Money laundering is a very sophisticated crime and we must be  
equally sophisticated,'' Attorney General Janet Reno said at a news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	With her was Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, who called the  
package ``an essential front in the war on narcotics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The strategy seeks to bolster international cooperation in  
investigating money laundering and to strengthen U.S. enforcement 
through tighter regulation of banks and other financial 
institutions. Under the plan: 
</P>
<P>
	--Storefront check cashiers, brokerage firms and casinos would be  
required to notify authorities of suspicious activities the way 
banks must do. 
</P>
<P>
	--The government would designate new high-intensity  
money-laundering zones, industries and financial institutions, and 
``action teams'' of law enforcement authorities and regulators 
would be formed to concentrate on those areas. 
</P>
<P>
	--Proposed legislation would add new international crimes, such  
as corruption and illegal arms dealing, to the activities subject 
to U.S. prosecution under money-laundering laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Tax evasion, which may have played a major role in the Bank of  
New York case, is not included. 
</P>
<P>
	Key Republican lawmakers have endorsed the proposals. Congress  
directed the Treasury and Justice departments to submit the new 
strategy early this year, before the case involving Russians and 
the Bank of New York broke.

<HEADLINE> CDC: State Health Depts. Y2K Ready </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- State health departments are ready for the  
millennium bug, the federal government reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that a  
survey conducted from June through August identified no 
``significant'' vulnerabilities to the Y2K problem in state health 
department systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Some experts fear the arrival of the year 2000 could result in  
shutdowns or other malfunctions by causing some older computers to 
think it is 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	The CDC survey looked at nine areas, including medical and lab  
equipment with date-sensitive computer chips and critical 
administrative services such as admissions and access to records. 
The survey found that 90 percent of the systems still operated when 
the date changed over.

<HEADLINE>  Big Hunk of Berlin Wall Dedicated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) -- The Freedom Forum marked the coming 10th  
anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall by dedicating a 
32-foot-wide section of it, along with an original guard tower, 
outside its journalism museum Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The section outside the Newseum is the largest on display  
outside Germany, said the Freedom Forum. 
</P>
<P>
	At the ceremony, former Secretary of State James Baker  
remembered rushing from a luncheon with then-Philippine President 
Corazon Aquino on Nov. 9, 1989, after he heard the borders between 
East and West Germany had been opened. 
</P>
<P>
	``By the time I arrived at the White House to discuss our  
response with President Bush, CNN was already broadcasting those 
unforgettable images of young Germans literally chipping away at 
the Wall,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The watchtower in the exhibition, topped by a searching light,  
originally was less than a mile from ``Checkpoint Charlie,'' the 
famous crossing between East and West Berlin. It was one of 300 
guard towers standing along the Wall. 
</P>
<P>
	``To really understand what was going on in Germany, it is  
important to know that the wall ... was a painful daily reality for 
the people of Berlin and Germany as a whole,'' said German 
Ambassador Jurgen Chrobog. The exhibit ``can only give an idea of 
how oppressive and disturbing this division was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The exhibition will be part of Freedom Park outside the Newseum,  
along with items such as the jail door of the cell where Martin 
Luther King Jr. was held in custody in 1963 and a replica of the 
Goddess of Democracy, made by plaster and paper by the students on 
the Tiananmen Square in Beijing during the democracy movement in 
1989.

<HEADLINE>  Russia Buries Raisa Gorbachev </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Mikhail Gorbachev bent slowly over his wife  
Raisa's coffin and gave her a last kiss on the forehead today 
before burying the woman whose vibrant personality and high style 
redefined the role of first lady of the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
	The emotional moment in Moscow's elite Novodevichy Cemetery  
climaxed a difficult two months for the former Soviet president, 
who sat at his wife's bedside in a German hospital while she 
battled leukemia. She died Monday at age 67. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gorbachev's body was carried in an open coffin on the  
shoulders of six pallbearers down a walkway strewn with red roses 
in the cemetery, where dense trees block out the tumult of central 
Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
	Her forehead was wrapped in a traditional Russian Orthodox  
funeral scarf. Priests swinging censers of incense chanted a burial 
service as dignitaries including former German Chancellor Helmut 
Kohl and President Boris Yeltsin's wife, Naina, looked on. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were a real pair. She was a part of him, almost always at  
his side,'' said Kohl, who became close to Gorbachev during talks 
on the Soviet Union aiding German reunification. ``Much of what he 
achieved is simply unimaginable without his wife.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier today, a stream of prominent Russians, ambassadors and  
other foreign guests brought wreaths, bouquets and words of 
condolence to Gorbachev and other family members as they sat with 
the coffin in the Russian Cultural Foundation, which Mrs. Gorbachev 
founded. 
</P>
<P>
	A small delegation of students from the philosophy department at  
Moscow State University, where Mrs. Gorbachev used to teach, 
brought a large wreath of white roses and fir fronds. 
</P>
<P>
	Gorbachev, his daughter and two granddaughters walked behind the  
open coffin as it was carried out of the foundation to a black 
hearse for the journey to Novodevichy. 
</P>
<P>
	A large picture of Mrs. Gorbachev and a wreath from Yeltsin were  
carried in front of the coffin. A bouquet of white roses lay in the 
coffin at her feet. 
</P>
<P>
	A drawn-looking Gorbachev and his family stood watching as the  
coffin was covered and placed inside the hearse. A stream of 
limousines and buses then conveyed the mourners to the cemetery, 
where a private service preceded the burial. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of ordinary Russians strained behind police barricades  
in hopes of catching a glimpse of the funeral procession. 
</P>
<P>
	At Novodevichy, the mourners attended a private service in a  
chapel on the grounds of the convent adjacent to the cemetery. Nine 
bells rang in descending minor intervals as the service concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	While Mrs. Gorbachev was deeply admired in the West, many  
Russians disliked her for her elegant clothes, polished manner and 
prominent public role. 
</P>
<P>
	But sentiment changed when she was hospitalized in a German  
clinic on July 25 with a rare form of leukemia. She and her husband 
were inundated with letters offering support, advice and money. 
</P>
<P>
	After Mrs. Gorbachev died from the blood disease on Monday, her  
husband returned home with several boxes full of the letters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was always enchanted by Raisa Maximovna's elegance, her  
beauty. She was a woman who could present herself in the West. She 
was respected there as an equal in government circles,'' said 
Lyubov Saldatkina, a retired auto worker who stood near the 
cultural foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	World leaders including President Clinton, French President  
Jacques Chirac and German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder sent 
condolences to the Gorbachev family. 
</P>
<P>
	The Novodevichy cemetery is Russia's most historic burial place,  
and many famous Russians -- including former Soviet leader Nikita 
Khrushchev, poet Vladimir Mayakovsky and writer Anton Chekhov -- are 
interred there. 
</P>
<P>
	Born Raisa Maximovna Titarenko in 1932, Mrs. Gorbachev is  
survived by her husband, daughter Irina Virganskaya, two 
granddaughters -- Ksenia and Anastasia -- and a younger sister, 
Ludmila Titarenko.

<HEADLINE> Good Weather Sinks Soybeans / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybean futures sank Thursday on the Chicago  
Board of Trade in response to excellent harvest conditions, while 
grain futures were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	Ideal harvest weather throughout the soybean belt sent soybean  
prices down by 1 1/2 percent to its lowest level this month. Investors 
said the trend was likely to continue Friday, with the harvest 
expected to accelerate this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Expectations that the corn harvest also will experience an  
active weekend also sent futures for that commodity lower, closing 
near eight-week lows. The fall harvest is expected to move west of 
the Mississippi River this weekend, with forecasts for clear 
weather throughout the Midwest boding well for field work. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat prices rallied on late commercial buying.  
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery rose 3 1/2 cents to $2.73 1/4 a bushel;  
December corn fell 2 cents to $2.08 1/4 cents a bushel; December oats 
rose 1/2 cent to $1.13 1/4 a bushel; November soybeans fell 7 1/4 cents to 
$4.78 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef futures closed slightly higher on the Chicago Mercantile  
Exchange, while pork futures were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	October live cattle rose .02 cent to 66.37 cents a pound;  
October feeder cattle rose .08 cent to 79.40 cents a pound; October 
lean hogs rose .55 cent to 46.10 cents a pound; February frozen 
pork bellies fell .23 cent to 59.42 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Wash. OKs Male-Female Boxing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- The state Department of Licensing has approved an  
Oct. 9 boxing match between a 36-year-old woman and the second man 
to agree to fight her. 
</P>
<P>
	The state had previously given the go-ahead to a match between  
Margaret McGregor of Bremerton, Wash., and Hector Morales, 23, but 
Morales backed out last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The bout approved Wednesday will pit McGregor, 130 pounds,  
against 34-year-old Loi Chow, 125, of Vancouver, British Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	The department's boxing program treated this fight application  
like any other, said spokeswoman Geraldine Calvo, since Washington 
state law doesn't prohibit male-female boxing. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we feel it's a fair match, we go with it,'' she said of the  
first pro mixed match approved in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Chow, a jockey and weightlifter, has a 0-2 record. McGregor, a  
landscaper, housecleaner and former kickboxer, has a 3-0 record 
against women since turning pro in April. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seemed like it was just routine,'' Vern Miller, McGregor's  
trainer, said of the state's approval. ``We'd been told this wasn't 
a gender issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morales, who had been planning to make his pro debut against  
McGregor, didn't give his reason for backing out, although he had 
previously said he was ashamed to tell his mother about boxing a 
woman.

<HEADLINE> Co.: More Genes Exist Than Thought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- There may be thousands more human genes  
than currently believed, suggesting that scientists trying to 
unravel genetic disorders may have a far more difficult job ahead, 
a pharmaceutical company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers at Incyte Pharmaceuticals, Inc., one of the private  
entities competing to map every human gene, believe about 140,000 
genes make up the proteins that program cells in the human body. 
</P>
<P>
	Previous estimates put the number between 80,000 and 100,000.  
</P>
<P>
	``It simply means the human genome is probably more complex than  
previously predicted,'' Dr. Randy Scott, president of the Palo 
Alto-based company, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	While some inherited disorders are caused by single genes, other  
diseases seem to result from groups of genes. Research into these 
diseases will be more difficult if there are more genes, since 
there could be more possible interactions between them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Finding the genes in simply inherited disorders like  
Huntington's disease, cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, has been 
relatively simple,'' said Victor McKusick, a genetics professor at 
Johns Hopkins University. 
</P>
<P>
	``The focus now is on common disorders -- high blood pressure,  
asthma -- in which it isn't just one gene but a whole cadre that 
cause the disorder,'' he said. ``That's already a very complex 
problem to tackle; if there are more genes it will complicate that 
issue appreciably.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the entire human genome includes about 3 billion base  
pairs of DNA molecules, the number of genes, or particular 
sequences of DNA, has always been an estimate. Biologists can't yet 
tell exactly where one sequence ends and another begins in the 
seemingly endless strands of molecules. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the jury is still out on what the real number is,''  
said Gerald Rubin, who leads a federally funded consortium at the 
University of California, Berkeley, that is working to map the 
fruit fly's much smaller genome. ``If true, it is surprisingly 
high.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Incyte scientists came up with the new estimate by combining  
data from two decoding methods. 
</P>
<P>
	In one, they decoded the heads and tails of transcribed copies  
of DNA, known as RNA, and determined there were 130,000 genes in 
the genome. In the second method, based on a feature that occurs in 
about half of known genes, they calculated 143,000 genes in every 
human cell. The two figures produced the 140,000 estimate.

<HEADLINE> Corzine Announces N.J. Senate Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUMMIT, N.J. (AP) -- Jon S. Corzine, a wealthy former investment  
banker who has never run for office, announced Thursday he will 
seek the Democratic nomination for the Senate seat being vacated by 
Frank Lautenberg. 
</P>
<P>
	Corzine's estimated $300 million fortune was rumored to be a  
crucial factor in Gov. Christie Whitman's decision earlier this 
month not to seek the Republican nomination. She later denied that 
had anything to do with her decision. 
</P>
<P>
	The 52-year-old former Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co. co-chairman laid out  
a liberal campaign platform of universal health care, gun control 
and public education. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a U.S. senator, I won't owe anything to anyone but you,''  
he told supporters on the front lawn of his home. ``I won't stand 
up for anyone but you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Whitman abandoned her campaign earlier this month, she  
shook Republican hopes and set off a scramble for a GOP candidate 
with the name recognition and cash to take the seat away from the 
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Whitman  
was disturbed by the prospect of having to raise large amounts of 
money to compete against Corzine. 
</P>
<P>
	Corzine said he wants to require employers to provide health  
insurance to all workers. Every gun owner should be required to 
pass a background check and a safety test to get a license, and 
licenses should be renewed regularly, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why can't we set the same minimum standards for owning a  
firearm as we do for driving a car?'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other Democrats exploring a run for the Senate seat are former  
Gov. Jim Florio and former Democratic state chairman B. Thomas 
Byrne Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican candidates include Rep. Robert Franks, Essex  
County Executive James Treffinger and Murray Sabrin, who ran as a 
Libertarian for governor in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Gert Weakens to Tropical Storm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. JOHN'S, Newfoundland (AP) -- A powerful storm hit parts of  
eastern Canada with strong winds and rain Thursday, sinking five 
boats and damaging 45 others, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tropical Storm Gert was downgraded from a hurricane earlier  
Thursday before it hit Canada's eastern coast with gale-force 
winds. The boats were sunk and damaged in Newfoundland ports. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was like something you watch in a horror movie,'' said  
Albert Young, who watched a giant wave knock three men off the 
wharf at St. Bride's, a tiny community on Newfoundland's Avalon 
Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the men was injured, said harbormaster Aloysius McGrath,  
whose small office was leveled by water. 
</P>
<P>
	As the storm approached on Wednesday, some offshore oil rigs had  
shut down, and evacuated nonessential staff to land. 
</P>
<P>
	Gert's outer bands were dropping light to moderately heavy  
amounts of rain from Maine into eastern New Hampshire and 
Massachusetts, and storm warnings remained in effect for coastal 
Newfoundland. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm was moving northeast at about 30 mph, and was expected  
to die out as it headed toward the north Atlantic, the U.S. 
National Hurricane Center in Miami said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the week, the hurricane brushed Bermuda with the  
outer edge of winds up to 110 mph, whipping up waves that smashed 
seaside cottages and washed away prime stretches of beach.

<HEADLINE> Keeneland Yearling Sale Sets Marks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
        LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- More money changed hands during Keeneland's  
September Yearling Sale than in any other yearling auction in the history 
of the thoroughbred industry. 
</P>
<P>
        When the 11-day auction ended late Thursday afternoon, gross  
sales totaled $233,075,800 topping the previous record of $175,932, 
000, set at Keeneland's two-day 1984 July Selected Yearling Sale. 
</P>
<P>
        This year's September total also was the second highest for  
a thoroughbred auction of any type. It was topped only by last year's 
November Breeding Stock Sale, where buyers spent $264,657,700 for 3, 
379 horses. 
</P>
<P>
        The previous record gross for the September sale was $169,811,  
800 set last year. 
</P>
<P>
        Many September sale records fell including average price, number  
of horses sold, highest price for a colt and highest price for a filly. 
</P>
<P>
        The average price increased for the seventh consecutive year  
to $77,357, up 30.3 percent from the previous record of $59,375 set 
last year. The median price was $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
        Keeneland sold 3,013 horses, an increase of 5.3 percent from  
2,860 last year. The previous record for number of horses sold at the 
September sale was 2,958, set in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
        Twenty-three horses brought $1 million or more, topped by the  
$3.9 million Sheik Mohammed al Maktoum paid for a bay colt by Kris 
S. out of Mr. P's Princess. The previous record of $2.3 million was 
set in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
        Demi O'Byrne paid a sale record for a filly when he bid $2  
million for a daughter of Storm Cat and Piquetnol. It topped the previous 
record of $1,450,000 set last year. 
</P>
<P>
        Before this year, only 17 horses sold for $1 million or more  
in the history of the September sale.

<P>
	AMERICUS, Ga. (AP) -- Jimmy Carter's 75th birthday gala is such a  
popular event that one of his relatives is accused of trying to 
scalp a ticket. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis Patrick Harrison Jr. was arrested Saturday on charges he  
sold a ticket to the sold-out event for $500 to an undercover agent 
with the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, Sheriff Randy Howard

<HEADLINE>  Missouri Seeks Upset of Nebraska </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, Mo. (AP) -- For Missouri, it's another crack at a  
breakthrough game. For Nebraska, it's a chance to prove its No. 6 
ranking isn't based simply on reputation. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday night, Missouri (2-0) will be trying to end two  
lengthy losing streaks. The Tigers have lost 20 straight to the 
Cornhuskers (3-0), with the last victory in 1978. They've also 
dropped 35 straight to teams ranked in the Top 10, with the last 
victory in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a long time,'' coach Larry Smith said. ``It's time,  
right?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith has 12 victories over Top 10 teams during his career, with  
the last in 1992. He's 0-13 at Missouri, but has come close the 
past three games, losing by six points to No. 1 Kansas State, by 
three to No. 6 Texas A&AMP;M and by seven to Nebraska last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Missouri is a 17 1/2-point underdog heading into the Big  
12 conference opener, this game could be a lot closer. Nebraska has 
struggled offensively, and managed only 185 yards in a 20-13 
victory over Southern Mississippi last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cornhuskers have endured the departure of tailback DeAngelo  
Evans and a quarterback shuffle. Bobby Newcombe has been moved to 
wingback and Eric Crouch is the starter, although his numbers 
haven't been impressive. 
</P>
<P>
	Crouch was 6-for-10 for 66 yards and two interceptions last  
week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have something to prove,'' Crouch said. ``I think it's about  
time we have a huge offensive day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then there's the recent history. Last year's game, won by the  
Cornhuskers 20-13 at Lincoln, Neb., came down to the final play. 
And in 1997, Nebraska needed freshman Matt Davison's miracle catch 
of a ball tipped first by a defender and then kicked in the air by 
teammate Shevin Wiggins, to force overtime and preserve a national 
championship season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember driving to the stadium two years ago and seeing how  
their fans were fired up,'' Davison said. ``They thought they could 
beat us. They gave it a good shot and almost got the job done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The game has been sold out for weeks, and a hostile reception is  
expected. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had to leave our helmets on two years ago because we were  
getting things thrown at us,'' Davison said. ``But that's what 
makes it all fun, I think.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Missouri again will alternate sophomore Jim Dougherty and  
redshirt freshman Kirk Farmer at quarterback. They have similar 
numbers thus far, with Dougherty 15-for-26 for 142 yards with one 
touchdown and an interception, and Farmer 15-for-27 for 177 yards, 
five touchdowns and two interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both are very talented players,'' Solich said. ``Both move  
very well -- not your typical quarterbacks that don't get around in 
the pocket.''

<HEADLINE> NHL Denies Collusion on Salaries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- While a few teams continue to take hard stands  
with unsigned players, NHL president Gary Bettman denied there is 
an understanding among owners to hold the line on player salaries. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not colluding, we don't collude,'' Bettman said  
Thursday before attending a meeting of the league general managers 
at the Air Canada Centre. ``Our clubs will continue to act 
individually and make whatever judgments they think is correct.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Ottawa Senators are refusing to renegotiate holdout Alexei  
Yashin's contract, the Toronto Maple Leafs are continuing 
negotiations with no-shows Bryan Berard and Dimitri Yushkevich, and 
the Boston Bruins, in an unprecedented move, let forward Dmitri 
Khristich become a free agent rather than pay the $2.8 million an 
arbitrator set as his salary. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whenever you have individual negotiations in this day and age  
in professional sports there are going to be skirmishes because the 
players want as much money as possible,'' Bettman said. ``And it's 
their right and prerogative to want as much money as possible and 
the owners have the right to negotiate as hard as they need to make 
economic sense of their teams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the collective bargaining agreement between the NHL and  
the players' association doesn't expire until after the 2003-04 
season, it has come under scrutiny because of the wrangling over 
the NHL's participation in the 2002 Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The players want a longer break than two weeks, but the NHL  
wants them back to work sooner to prevent the season from going too 
long. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not something we intend to change,'' Bettman said. ``Many  
people are concerned about how late the season goes and we're not 
looking to put ourselves in a situation where it goes so late -- 
that in June everybody forgets that we went to the Olympics in 
February.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NHL also is creating a ``collective bargaining agreement ''  
fund of $300 million at $10 million per team to prepare for 
possible labor problems in four years. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there is disharmony in 2004, you have to be as strong as  
possible,'' Bettman said.

<HEADLINE> Dole Tries Closing Gap With Bush </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) -- Elizabeth Dole strode into the crowded  
college ballroom, and nodded approvingly at the giant banner 
declaring simply: ``It's time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She drew cheers from her mainly young, female audience as she  
sketched out her education proposals and praised the college 
students ``who have spent literally hundreds of hours supporting my 
campaign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really on the move these days,'' Dole declared.  
</P>
<P>
	After a rocky start last spring, Dole saw new summertime life  
breathed into her campaign with a solid showing in an Iowa straw 
poll last month. Some analysts, however, are questioning how well 
she's capitalized on that break. 
</P>
<P>
	``If she doesn't do it soon, the momentum will fade and her  
ability to do so will diminish,'' said Ed Gillespie, a Republican 
strategist not aligned with a presidential campaign. ``She's going 
to lose the chance to strike while the iron is hot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There have been some ups and downs in Dole's bid for the  
Republican presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Entering the race she was a hot commodity, a high-powered  
political name coupled with decades of experience on the 
presidential campaign trail. Not to mention the notion of luring 
women voters to the GOP, where a gender gap has cost the party 
dearly. 
</P>
<P>
	But early troubles dogged the campaign, including a reluctance  
to chart out clear differences with rivals and set a distinct 
campaign agenda. She also fell victim to the fund-raising draw of 
Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who dried up money for other candidates 
with a mammoth financial operation. 
</P>
<P>
	While many began to count her out, Dole got a lift last month  
when she finished third in the straw poll, a showing backers said 
certified her standing as a top-tier candidate. Critics say not 
much has happened since. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been one of the strangest top-tier political campaigns  
I've ever observed,'' said University of Virginia political 
scientist Larry Sabato. ``It seems to me that her objective is more 
to stay alive than make progress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While most Americans aren't focused on the presidential  
election, activists are and Iowa's leadoff precinct caucuses are 
barely four months away. The nomination fight in both parties is 
likely to be settled within six weeks of that test, meaning it's 
coming close to crunch time for candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	While many are critical of Dole's campaign, there are others who  
say she has scored some significant milestones. Republican 
strategist Scott Reed noted that she's assembled the financial 
resources to stay in the mix deep into the primary season, and also 
has put into place a potent organizational network. 
</P>
<P>
	``That guarantees she'll be a serious player through the initial  
tests,'' said Reed. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said there is another factor that sets Dole apart from  
the other candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	``She is the only Republican other than George W. Bush who  
consistently beats Al Gore in the polls,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, polls have not shown her closing the gap with Bush.  
</P>
<P>
	This week, she launched a series of policy speeches designed to  
define her campaign. An education speech Wednesday in Melrose, 
Mass., came a week after Bush covered many the same issues in his 
own policy speech. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole has said she needs time to complete the enormous task of  
assembling a presidential campaign, and there's some sympathy for 
that view. There's also some impatience. 
</P>
<P>
	She has occasionally been reluctant to step forward on major  
issues, and a couple of campaign aides have moved on in 
frustration. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a small window of opportunity here for her to press  
the front-runner,'' said Gillespie. ``I can understand why she 
waited until after Labor Day, but I don't think she can wait until 
Halloween.''

<HEADLINE> Milestone Awaiting Buckeyes' Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- If Ohio State beats Cincinnati on  
Saturday, don't count on coach John Cooper blowing out 100 candles 
on a cake at midfield. 
</P>
<P>
	With a 99-34-4 record in 12 years with the Buckeyes, Cooper  
doesn't get misty when he thinks about what others call a 
milestone. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm proud and happy that I've lasted that long, hopefully, to  
win 100 games,'' he said. ``But I'm not here counting, let me put 
it that way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his frequently up and occasionally down tenure with the  
Buckeyes, the native Tennessean has come close to winning a couple 
of national championships -- and has also come closer to being fired 
at least that many times. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper has taken Buckeyes teams to the No. 2 spot in the final  
polls in two of the last three years, yet still hasn't captured the 
hearts of many of the fans. After the Buckeyes lost to Miami 23-12 
in the Kickoff Classic, those naysayers repeated a common refrain: 
``He can't win the big one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 62-year-old Iowa State graduate has not been forgiven for  
his 2-8-1 record against archrival Michigan and a 2-8 bowl record 
with the Buckeyes. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet his team swept both of those games last year -- the first  
time that's happened since he's been in Columbus -- and he has made 
No. 12 Ohio State a fixture in the Top 25. 
</P>
<P>
	His job was in jeopardy after several losses to Michigan and a  
couple of tough bowl defeats, including a surprise to Air Force in 
the 1990 Liberty Bowl. He flirted with leaving to take the LSU job 
a few years ago, but was lured back with a multi-year contract that 
features rollover years for victories in those ``big games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He is close to signing another contract that will pay him in  
excess of $1 million a year, including ancillary agreements that 
include TV and radio shows and other responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
	No one questions that he has rejuvenated a program that was  
declining under Earle Bruce, who was let go in a messy firing at 
the end of the 1987 season. 
</P>
<P>
	There are still occasional academic and legal problems with his  
players, but for the most part Cooper has restored the luster 
brought to Ohio State in Woody Hayes' 28 years as head coach. Only 
Hayes, with a 205-61-10 record, has won more games with the 
Buckeyes, and only Hayes and John Wilce (16 seasons) have longer 
football tenures at the school. 
</P>
<P>
	A hundred wins may not be his goal, but he is looking at another  
round number. His career record, encompassing 23 years as head 
coach at Tulsa, Arizona State and Ohio State, is 181-74-6. 
</P>
<P>
	``I look more at the big picture,'' he said. ``I know how many  
games I've won at this point in my career. I'm thinking more and 
more about trying to win 200. Part of that is it doesn't take too 
long.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he has no desire to challenge the win totals of some of  
his peers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to hunt down (Joe) Paterno or (Bobby) Bowden or  
LaVell Edwards,'' he said. ``They've been at it a lot longer than I 
have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper said he hasn't contemplated retirement.  
</P>
<P>
	``I feel good. I've got good young players in the program. So  
why not?'' Cooper said. ``If I wasn't coaching, what would I do? 
I'd have to get a job.''

<HEADLINE>  Moynihan Endorses Bradley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- New York's most prominent Democrat, Sen. Daniel  
Patrick Moynihan, endorsed Bill Bradley for president Thursday, 
saying Vice President Al Gore ``can't be elected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 72-year-old senator, known for his quirky intellectual  
style, quoted Woodrow Wilson as saying the presidency required 
candidates ``from among wise and prudent athletes, a small class.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley was a Rhodes scholar and a player on two NBA  
championship teams with the New York Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've seen this particular athlete, wise and prudent, work in  
the U.S. Senate for 18 years,'' Moynihan said. ``He is a man with 
heart and courage and stamina.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why he wasn't supporting the vice president, the  
Democratic front-runner, Moynihan replied: ``Nothing is the matter 
with Gore, but he can't be elected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Gore's campaign headquarters, communications director Kiki  
Moore suggested Moynihan's imprimatur would make little difference: 
``I'm sure President Bob Kerrey appreciated (Moynihan's) support in 
1992.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But opinions varied.  
</P>
<P>
	``At this point in time, it makes a difference because Moynihan  
is a venerated figure within the Democratic Party,'' said 
Democratic consultant George Arzt. ``But over the long term, it 
usually doesn't translate into votes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``An endorsement from Moynihan in this state has got to be a  
great day for the Bradley campaign,'' said Robert McClure, senior 
associate dean of Syracuse University's Maxwell School of 
Citizenship and Public Affairs. ``Bradley is pitching himself as 
exactly the kind of intellectual, moderate progressive that Senator 
Moynihan has always been seen as.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Comptroller Carl McCall, a Gore backer, said the endorsement  
``makes a good story today. In terms of impact over the long run, 
it means very little.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley acknowledged his difficult course.  
</P>
<P>
	``I know we are up against a party establishment that has a lot  
of entrenched power,'' he said. ``But this will ultimately be 
decided by the people themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moynihan is the third senator to endorse Bradley, joining Paul  
Wellstone of Minnesota and Bob Kerrey of Nebraska. Bradley served 
three terms as a New Jersey senator, working with Moynihan -- who 
was first elected in 1976 -- on the Senate Finance Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore has been endorsed by more than 100 members of Congress,  
including 10 of the 19 Democrats from New York. The state's other 
senator, Democrat Charles Schumer, has not made a formal 
endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
	National polls show Gore leads Bradley, but recent surveys in  
New Hampshire and New York have shown a tight race between the two 
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	New York is one of 14 states to pick presidential nominees on  
March 7. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to win this primary on March 7,'' Moynihan said.  
``We'll be proud of ourselves for having been here early. We can do 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moynihan also backed first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, a Gore  
supporter, to replace him as senator when he retires at the end of 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about the conflict of supporting Mrs. Clinton but not  
Gore, Moynihan said simply: ``I think she can be elected senator.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton would not comment on whether Moynihan's endorsement  
of Bradley was awkward for her, saying only that she strongly 
supports Gore but is grateful for Moynihan's backing for her own 
aspirations.

<HEADLINE>  Gunfire Rattles East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DILI, East Timor (AP) -- Gunfire rattled across the ravaged city  
of Dili today, sending international peacekeepers nervously chasing 
gunmen they believed were hostile militiamen or undisciplined 
Indonesian soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
	No contact was made, and no one was hurt. But a series of  
shooting incidents -- the first since the multinational force 
arrived Monday -- and reports of militias gathering in West Timor 
raised tensions and dissipated the peacekeepers' warm welcome. 
</P>
<P>
	A British officer said Indonesian soldiers on trucks opened  
fire, apparently to test the reflexes of the force. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were firing to see what our response drills are like,''  
said Brig. David Richards, commander of the British contingent. 
``They are probing our responses. It is a test.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There are those who are trying to create an impression in the  
minds of everyone that things are less secure'' now that control of 
Dili's chaotic capital has passed from the Indonesian army to the 
Australian-led multinational force, Richards said. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses reported several incidents of shooting, but Richards  
indicated the bursts of automatic weapons fire came from three 
truckloads of soldiers passing from the British-controlled sector 
to the Australian zone. 
</P>
<P>
	There was great confusion on the ground about whether the firing  
was hostile and directed against the international force. 
</P>
<P>
	Civilians scurried for cover. Troops moved cautiously through  
the city, crouching in combat formation, picking through littered 
back alleys and courtyards, and roughly searching anyone they found 
for weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	With the daunting prospect of controlling the countryside still  
ahead of them, the force's commander, Maj. Gen. Peter Cosgrove, 
said he did not currently have enough soldiers to protect all 
residential areas in Dili. 
</P>
<P>
	Cosgrove said he would try to speed up deployment of troops  
still waiting at the staging point in Darwin, northern Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	About 3,000 soldiers were on the ground as of midday today, with  
another 4,500 yet to come. 
</P>
<P>
	Cosgrove said he heard reports that pro-Jakarta militia in West  
Timor were massing on the border with the east and ``planning to 
come into the province.'' He said peacekeepers were monitoring 
them, but had no mandate to act outside East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	He welcomed the redeployment of Indonesian army troops, mostly  
locally recruited. The army has been accused of participating in 
the orgy of killing and looting after East Timor voted 
overwhelmingly on Aug. 30 to separate from Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
	The army is evacuating the half-island and handing over control  
to the peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses say Indonesian troops are setting fire to their own  
barracks and to civilian property as they leave. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, a large blaze at a local government building sent black  
smoke billowing over the city and ignited rounds of ammunition that 
had been left inside. The building was used as a temporary barracks 
for Indonesian soldiers being evacuated. Another building close by 
also was set ablaze. 
</P>
<P>
	There were reports of clashes between pro- and anti-independence  
militias in the countryside. On Wednesday, the body of a Dutch 
journalist was found in a Dili suburb, the first foreign casualty 
since the multinational force began arriving. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Indonesians accuse the foreign media of stirring up  
problems in East Timor and conspiring with the United Nations to 
rig the outcome of the referendum. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of East Timorese descended from the hills Wednesday  
morning and stormed a government warehouse, looting 110-pound sacks 
of rice, sugar and tins of cooking oil. Indonesian guards were 
overwhelmed, but peacekeepers soon arrived and brought the crowd 
under control without using force. 
</P>
<P>
	Relief efforts were expected to pick up today. Food drops  
resumed Wednesday after being suspended since Monday in favor of 
airlifting peacekeepers and their supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia lifted its demand that U.N. flights stop at Dili  
airport for cargo inspection, opening the way for more flights. 
</P>
<P>
	Supplies could start coming through the airport at Baucau, 80  
miles east of Dili, where 150 peacekeepers in Blackhawk helicopters 
landed Wednesday. The airport could bring quicker access to 
desperate refugees hiding in the thickly forested mountains. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents found five bodies in a well in central Dili, in what  
could be the first sign of a mass killing. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents said victims were tortured and hung from meat hooks  
before they were decapitated, dismembered and thrown into the well. 
</P>
<P>
	At the United Nations in New York, Indonesian Foreign Minister  
Ali Alatas rejected suggestions for an international investigation 
into possible war crimes, saying Indonesia itself should first look 
into allegations of human rights violations. 
</P>
<P>
	In Dili, peacekeepers drove armored personnel carriers down the  
devastated streets, searching for anyone who looked suspicious. 
Within 24 hours, the soldiers had rounded up dozens of suspected 
militants and confiscated hundreds of guns, knives and machetes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have lost count of the number of weapons,'' Evans said.

<HEADLINE> Three Boys Arrested in Girl's Rape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL (AP) -- Three of seven boys suspected of gang raping an  
8-year-old girl have been arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	The three -- ages 10, 11 and 13 -- were being held at a juvenile  
detention center today on preliminary charges of first-degree 
criminal sexual conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	``We figured that enough had come together to bring them in,''  
said police spokesman Michael Jordan. ``They are accused of a 
significant crime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because the boys are under 14, they cannot be tried as adults.  
If convicted, they could be confined in a juvenile institution 
until they turn 19. 
</P>
<P>
	The other four boys accused in the rape are under 10, the  
minimum age for criminal prosecution in Minnesota. One of the four 
is the victim's 9-year-old brother, who police say led the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said four of the boys raped the girl, including her  
brother. Two other boys, including a 6-year-old, admitted fondling 
the girl's genitals, police said. A 9-year-old boy told police he 
only observed. 
</P>
<P>
	After questioning the boys, police determined that the younger  
brother had instigated the attack in a vacant house and told her 
not to tell their mother what happened. 
</P>
<P>
	But KSTP-TV on Wednesday reported that the victim's mother said  
the brother was forced to take part in the assault. 
</P>
<P>
	``They told my son that if my son came and told me, then they  
would beat up my son,'' she said in Hmong through an interpreter.

<HEADLINE> Davenport, Seles Advance in Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Top-seeded Lindsay Davenport swept past Anna  
Smashnova of Israel 6-0, 6-1 today to advance to the quarterfinals 
of the Toyota Princess Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Three-time defending champion Monica Seles, the second seed,  
also advanced with a 6-1, 6-0 victory over Swiss qualifier 
Miroslava Vavrinec. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first singles match both for Seles and Davenport, who  
had first-round byes. 
</P>
<P>
	The fifth-ranked Seles, seeking her sixth singles title in the  
tournament, faces fifth seed and No. 14 Amelie Mauresmo of France 
in the quarterfinals. The second-ranked Davenport takes on 
sixth-seeded Conchita Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
	Davenport dominated the play against Smashnova and needed only  
35 minutes for the victory, losing only the first game in the 
second set. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of a sudden, she hit a couple of good serves and hit them  
a little harder than she had served. I was really disappointed,'' 
Davenport joked. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was happy I played so well considering I didn't get in till  
late Tuesday night and there was a lot of jet lag from 
California,'' she said of her tedious journey coming to Tokyo after 
winning the Fed Cup final Sunday against the Russian team in 
Stanford, California. 
</P>
<P>
	Davenport and Seles led the U.S. team, which also included  
sisters Venus and Serena Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	Seles said she was tired and happy to have had an easy match.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'll just try to have a good night's sleep and get ready for  
tomorrow's match,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	In other second-round matches, third-seeded Julie Halard-Decugis  
breezed past Nicole Pratt of Australia 6-1, 6-0; No. 4 Amanda 
Coetzer of South Africa rallied from a set down and 1-3 in the 
second set to beat Maureen Drake of Canada 4-6, 6-3, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
	Ai Sugiyama, the eighth seed, won the final five games in  
beating American Jane Chi 6-2, 6-4.

<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- She is the actress formerly known as  
Courteney Cox. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Friends'' star, who wed actor David Arquette on June 12,  
has officially changed her name to Courteney Cox Arquette. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's for real. It's on my Social Security card, everything. No  
hyphen,'' she told the ``Entertainment Tonight'' television 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	``It feels like, wow, I'm changing my identity. It was scary. It  
feels good, like I'm really committed. It feels better than not

<HEADLINE> Dems Edgy About Bradley Strength </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bill Bradley's growing strength in the polls  
has Democrats edgy about the political implications of a rough 
nomination fight, with some saying for the first time that Vice 
President Al Gore could be beaten. 
</P>
<P>
	Carolyn Boyce, vice chairman of Idaho Democrats, said Gore will  
be forced to spend precious campaign money to fend off a challenge 
from Bradley, while GOP front-runner George W. Bush is building up 
a huge campaign fund for the general election. 
</P>
<P>
	``It diverts money and Democratic money is so limited,'' said  
Boyce, who was in town Thursday for a meeting of the Democratic 
National Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The DNC is a stronghold of Gore support, but some in their ranks  
concede a tough primary fight could be costly. In a stark contrast 
to the DNC's spring meeting, when Bradley was just beginning to 
make inroads against the vice president, party regulars were saying 
Thursday that Gore is a vulnerable front-runnner. 
</P>
<P>
	One Southern chairman said he had seen a ``sea change'' since  
spring and he worried Gore's campaign was unprepared for a stiff 
challenge from Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	Edward Marcus, state chairman of the Connecticut Democratic  
Party, acknowledged the uneasiness among some party officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``People who are neophytes tend to get shaken up,'' he said.  
It's less worrisome for ``those who have been around for a while.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is good for the party. I'm seeing a lot of people getting  
energized who were not involved in the past. I think part of that 
is due to Bill Bradley, who is touching people who might be coming 
back to the party,'' said Iowa party chairman Rob Tully. ``It will 
be a close race, but it will make Gore a better candidate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore had a much stronger presence than Bradley at the DNC  
meeting. He had staff in every meeting, a political table set up 
near the registration desk and scheduled a meet-and-greet breakfast 
for Friday. Gore can't afford to lose support within the DNC; 
Bradley has never depended upon it, and hopes instead to draw less 
active Democrats and independents to his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	A contested primary season could be useful for Gore -- up to a  
point, said Gore supporter Charles Rangel, a New York congressman 
who has noted Gore needs to do more to reach out to fellow 
Democrats and unify the party. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, a former New Jersey senator, has shown strength in the  
polls in several states with early primaries. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've seen enough surveys to suggest that something is going on  
out there,'' said political analyst Stuart Rothenberg, who 
cautioned it's way too early to focus on point margins. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley has also demonstrated the ability to raise money. Gore  
had $9.4 million in the bank at the end of June, and Bradley had 
$7.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley and Gore are neck-and-neck in recent polls in New  
Hampshire and New York. Party activists are taking note of polls 
showing Bradley doing better than Gore in matchups against Bush, 
partially due to Bradley's appeal with independents. 
</P>
<P>
	Many key primary states have no recent poll results on the  
presidential race and are unlikely to resume polling on that 
question until middle or late fall, state pollsters say. 
</P>
<P>
	While Bradley has shown signs of making it a race in parts of  
the Northeast, some political veterans note that Gore has the 
support of much of the political establishment nationwide and from 
traditional Democratic groups. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gore has the support of most Democratic officeholders,'' said  
Merle Black, an Emory University political scientist. ``He would 
have the party establishment behind him in the South as well as the 
support of most black officeholders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley got the endorsement Thursday of Sen. Daniel Patrick  
Moynihan of New York, the third senator to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why he preferred Bradley over Gore, Moynihan responded  
simply, ``Nothing is the matter with Gore, but he can't be 
elected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, by comparison, has compiled endorsements from more than  
100 members of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley trailed Gore by a 50 percent-to-32 percent margin among  
nationwide Democrats and independents who lean Democratic in a CBS 
News poll out Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent polls by Gallup and the Pew Research Center for the  
People &AMP; the Press suggest Gore's support is strongest among 
registered Democrats, blacks and women. Bradley runs closest to 
Gore among independents, men and the better educated. 
</P>
<P>
	Polls this early in the political process often don't reflect  
what will happen, especially for Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1971 and 1975, the early polls gave no indication that  
eventual nominees George McGovern and Jimmy Carter would win. In 
September 1987, Michael Dukakis was among the candidates, but not 
the Democratic leader in the Gallup poll. In the fall of 1991, 
Gallup had no clear front-runner. However, Gore is the first 
Democrat to run for the nomination as a sitting vice-president 
since 1968. 
</P>
<P>
	The increased strength shown by Bradley may be more of a  
statement against Gore than for Bradley, said Andrew Kohut, 
director of the Pew poll, who notes some Americans are tired of the 
Clinton administration. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most people aren't too familiar with Bill Bradley,'' said  
Kohut. ``Our surveys show that most people, including Democrats, 
are not paying too much attention.''

<HEADLINE> Dollar Rises Against the Yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar rose slightly against the Japanese  
yen on Thursday for the first time in four days, but traders were 
cautious ahead of this weekend's meeting of the Group of Seven 
industrialized nations. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 103.95  
Japanese yen, up just slightly from 103.93 late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders braced for the G-7 meeting on Saturday, where many hope  
that Japan will be able to enlist help from its economic partners 
in curbing the yen's rise. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan has intervened in currency markets several times this  
summer in an attempt to slow the yen's gains, but without success. 
Japanese officials believe that the yen has strengthened too much 
and could harm the country's fledgling economic recovery. A rising 
yen makes it harder for Japanese exports to compete on world 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
	But traders aren't confident that the United States would be  
willing to support a new currency policy. 
</P>
<P>
	William McDonough, president of the New York Federal Reserve  
Bank, said that he was not concerned about the level of the dollar 
versus the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	``The level of the U.S. Dollar is not a problem for the U.S.  
economy,'' he said in a speech Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	In other trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0440, down from  
$1.0448 late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.5362 Swiss francs, down from  
1.5369, and 1.4711 Canadian dollars, up from 1.4702. The British 
pound rose to $1.6407 from $1.6284. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Thursday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8734 German 
marks, up from 1.8719; 6.2831 French francs, up from 6.2780; and 
1,854.66 Italian lire, up from 1,853.16.

<HEADLINE> Delta, Pilots In Tentative Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Delta Air Lines reached a tentative agreement  
with its pilots covering two new, larger planes. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement with the Air Line Pilots Association announced  
today provides new pay scales for pilots flying the Boeing 777 and 
767-400 aircraft, as well as other contract improvements. It does 
not settle the ongoing negotiations aimed at reaching a new overall 
agreement with Delta pilots. 
</P>
<P>
	Pay rates will be $250 an hour for the 777 and $230 for the  
767-400. The pact also creates a process for creating 
``appropriate'' rest areas for pilots and flight crew on 
international flights on the new planes. 
</P>
<P>
	``This tentative agreement balances the best interests of our  
company and our pilots, and it is a demonstration of a positive 
effort by ALPA and Delta,'' said Delta's president and chief 
executive, Leo F. Mullin. ``Once this agreement is ratified, Delta 
can move forward with our plans for offering our customers the most 
modern fleet in the industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Delta pilot Charles S. Giambusso, the chairman of the union's  
executive council, said the agreement was ``a big score for the 
Delta pilots, but ... we still have a long way to go to restore our 
profession.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The airline began flying the much larger 777s in May, but took  
delivery on only two of the planes -- delaying 11 other orders -- 
because it had not reached agreement with the pilots on their pay 
for flying the planes. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta later discontinued use of the 777 in its winter schedule  
and threatened to sell or lease the planes if an agreement wasn't 
reached. Company spokesman John Kennedy said today the company 
hopes to immediately begin using its two 777s in its winter 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	The order for 11 more planes will be put back on track as soon  
as the agreement is ratified, a process that could take months, 
Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline and its 9,200 pilots began negotiating a new overall  
contract earlier this month. The current overall contract extends 
until next May. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy said the new salary and rest amendments won't  
necessarily carry over into the overall contract, but that they 
``set a constructive and positive tone in the continuing 
negotiations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, a Delta pilot refused to continue a flight to  
Tokyo because he and his crew did not get adequate rest in what 
pilots considered cramped and noisy quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision was later upheld by the company and was introduced  
into the contract talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Other improvements in the agreement announced today include the  
folding of a 6 percent profit sharing payout into pilots' base pay 
rates, a 3 percent raise for pilots not covered by the new 
777/767-400 agreement and adjustments to the pay scale progression 
for non-captains.

<HEADLINE> Russian Jets Bomb Chechnya Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Russian warplanes bombed the airport in  
Chechnya's capital today, killing at least one person in the first 
major attack on the city since the end of a bloody 1994-96 war. 
</P>
<P>
	An air force spokesman in Moscow confirmed Russian warplanes  
conducted operations over the breakaway region, but refused to give 
any details about the targets. 
</P>
<P>
	The Interfax news agency reported that two bombers attacked an  
arms depot and radar complex allegedly used by Islamic militants, 
who have attacked the neighboring Russian region of Dagestan in 
recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the report, the jets also targeted an An-2 aircraft  
that the rebels may have used, an oil refinery, a fuel storage site 
and power installations in the village of Raduzhny outside Grozny. 
</P>
<P>
	One person who was repairing a plane at the airport was killed,  
according to an AP reporter on the scene. 
</P>
<P>
	The attack represented a major escalation in the growing  
conflict between Russian forces and Islamic militants operating out 
of Chechnya. The Chechen government, which says it does not support 
the militants, had warned it would hit back against any Russian 
attacks on its territory. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian military had said today it would carry out  
airstrikes on targets it believes the militants are using, Interfax 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has launched several artillery and airstrikes  
against suspected rebel bases since the fighting with the militants 
started in early August. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier today, Islamic militants attacked three Russian border  
guard posts along the frontier with Chechnya, but didn't inflict 
any casualties, the military said. 
</P>
<P>
	The gunmen attacked a checkpoint in a region where up to 1,500  
Islamic militants are said to be gathering in preparation for a new 
invasion into Dagestan. Other militants also traded fire with 
government troops at two border posts to the south. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian military has been massing troops along the  
Dagestan-Chechen border to ward off another invasion. 
</P>
<P>
	The Interior Ministry said today that its defenses and scores of  
air raids on suspected rebel strongholds in Chechnya had prevented 
the militants from launching a new incursion. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, Russia has lost 281 policemen and soldiers since the  
fighting in Dagestan began in early August. The government claims 
that as many as 2,000 militants have been killed, but the number 
couldn't be independently confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
	Also today, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin met with several  
ministers in Moscow to discuss the Caucasus situation, Interfax 
said. According to the report, Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said 
Russia must create a security zone around the Chechen border, but 
did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	Putin was then to head to the city of Rostov-on-Don, near the  
site of a bomb blast last week that ripped through an apartment 
building and killed 18. Authorities have linked that bomb and three 
others in Russia, which have left over 300 people dead, to the 
Islamic militants in southern Russia.

<HEADLINE> Moynihan Endorses Bill Bradley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan today endorsed Bill  
Bradley for the Democratic presidential nomination. He said the 
former New Jersey senator's only opponent, Vice President Al Gore, 
``can't be elected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moynihan called Bradley ``a man with heart and courage and  
stamina.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't govern, as Woodrow Wilson said, without those  
qualities. He has shown them all his life in one way or another,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	An appreciative Bradley acknowledged that his campaign is ``up  
against an establishment,'' but he said that Moynihan's endorsement 
was ``important. I think people will take notice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why he preferred Bradley over Gore, Moynihan responded  
simply, ``Nothing is the matter with Gore, but he can't be 
elected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moynihan, a New York Democrat who is retiring from the Senate,  
and Bradley have been friends for more than two decades. Bradley 
served three terms as a New Jersey senator, and spent time with 
Moynihan on the Senate Finance Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement was made at the 92nd Street Y, where Bradley  
often worked out while winning two NBA title with the New York 
Knicks. It was an unusual location for a political announcement; 
the ``Y'' is better known as a spot for cultural events and book 
readings. 
</P>
<P>
	Moynihan held up a copy of Bradley's 1996 memoir, ``Time  
Present, Time Past,'' and called it ``a brilliant book.'' He again 
quoted Wilson as saying that presidents come from ``wise and 
prudent athletes, a small class.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, a Rhodes Scholar, was an All-American basketball player  
at Princeton before joining the Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	Moynihan is the third senator to endorse Bradley, joining  
colleagues Paul Wellstone of Minnesota and Bob Kerrey of Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore has been endorsed by more than 100 members of Congress.  
</P>
<P>
	While national polls have indicated that Gore is still the  
Democratic leader, recent polls in New Hampshire and New York have 
shown a tight race between Bradley and the vice president.

<HEADLINE> Clips Don't Offer Taylor Extension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Los Angeles Clippers have decided not to  
offer third-year forward Maurice Taylor the contract extension 
requested by agent David Falk, who says his client will never 
re-sign with the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor, the 14th overall selection in the 1997 NBA draft, will  
be paid $1,367,400 in the upcoming season, the last under his 
three-year rookie contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor, who averaged a team-leading 16.8 points and 5.3 rebounds  
last season, was seeking a six-year deal for around $71 million, 
the maximum allowed under the league's new collective bargaining 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have the utmost respect for Maurice Taylor and the role that  
he plays in contributing to our team's development,'' Clippers vice 
president Elgin Baylor said in a statement. ``However, it would be 
best if Maurice were to have the opportunity in the final year of 
his contract to further develop his game and therefore justify an 
agreement to extend him a long-term contract of $12 million a 
year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Falk has asked the Clippers to trade Taylor, but Baylor  
indicated such a move would not be made. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a demand, it's a suggestion,'' Falk said Thursday.  
Clippers owner Donald Sterling ``has every right not to pay him, 
but he'd be crazy to lose a $70 million asset for nothing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor will be eligible for free agency after this season.  
</P>
<P>
	Falk flew to Los Angeles earlier this month to discuss Taylor's  
contract, and was miffed that Sterling didn't attend the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``When Sterling stood me up, I met with Elgin as a courtesy, to  
discuss possible trades,'' Falk said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clippers did make a trade Thursday, acquiring point guard  
Eric Murdock from the New Jersey Nets in exchange for forward 
Johnny Newman. 
</P>
<P>
	Murdock, an eight-year NBA veteran who played for Clippers coach  
Chris Ford in Milwaukee, averaged 7.9 points, 4.4 assists and 2.3 
rebounds in 15 games last season. He missed 35 games with a sore 
left knee and strained left groin. 
</P>
<P>
	Murdock, taken by Utah with the 21st pick in the 1991 NBA draft,  
has averaged 10.5 points and 5.0 assists in his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Newman, a 13-year NBA veteran, was acquired by the Clippers from  
the Cleveland Cavaliers last month along with Derek Anderson in 
exchange for Lamond Murray.

<HEADLINE> Ovarian Implant Called Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- An experimental ovarian tissue transplant has  
worked and allowed a prematurely menopausal woman to ovulate and 
have a normal menstrual period, a doctor said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	International experts praised the work, saying it could give  
women with ovarian cancer another chance to have a child. The 
American Cancer Society estimates that 25,200 women will be 
diagnosed with ovarian cancer this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``This case indicates that we are on the cusp of safe, reliable  
transplantation of human ovarian tissue,'' said Larry Lipshultz, 
president of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Kutluk Oktay performed the procedure in February at New York  
Methodist Hospital on a 30-year-old woman in the hopes of reversing 
symptoms of menopause brought on by the removal of her ovaries. 
</P>
<P>
	The organs were taken out for medical reasons, although the  
specifics were not made public. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman had some of her ovarian tissue preserved through  
freezing after her second ovary was removed two years ago. Her 
first ovary was removed when she was 17. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors used miniature instruments and robotic equipment to  
implant the tissue through three tiny holes in the patient's 
pelvis. 
</P>
<P>
	Four months after the procedure, Oktay gave the woman fertility  
drugs to test ovarian function. The woman developed an egg, 
ovulated, and had a normal menstrual period, Oktay said. 
</P>
<P>
	Oktay will be presenting his work next week at a meeting of the  
American Society for Reproductive Medicine in Toronto. He said 
ovarian tissue transplants could give new hope to young girls and 
women who face the loss of their ovaries to cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's probably the best news they can have,'' Oktay said.  
``After they hear they have cancer, there is someone telling them 
they may have hope for the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. James Drife, a London-based professor of gynecology, said  
Oktay's operation was an important step forward. 
</P>
<P>
	``My gut feeling is that this development wouldn't really create  
a stampede of women saying, `let's finish our careers then have 
children in the last 20 to 30 years of our lives,''' he said.

<HEADLINE> Chiquita To Cut Up to 200 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Chiquita Brands International Inc. plans to  
eliminate as many as 200 jobs during the next several months to 
save at least $15 million a year in operating costs, management 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The jobs are to be cut in corporate and staff ranks in the  
United States and Latin America, as well as banana operations in 
North America and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	The reductions will cost the company $6 million before taxes in  
the third quarter to cover severance expenses, benefits extensions 
and job placement services, the Cincinnati-based company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chiquita's earnings have lagged because of weak third-quarter  
sales of bananas in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has protested seven years of European Union limits  
on banana imports. The World Trade Organization judged the quotas 
to be illegal and authorized the United States to impose $191 
million of punitive tariffs on European goods. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> BP Exploration Pleads Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- BP Exploration (Alaska) Inc. agreed  
Thursday to pay $22 million to settle charges that one of its 
contractors illegally dumped hazardous waste at a North Slope oil 
field. 
</P>
<P>
	The plea agreement entered in U.S. District Court in Anchorage  
calls for the company to pay a $500,000 criminal fine and $6.5 
million to settle civil charges. It will also spend $15 million to 
establish an environmental management system throughout its U.S. 
operations during a five-year probation period. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal prosecutors said the company failed to immediately  
notify state and federal authorities when it learned that Doyon 
Drilling Inc., one of its contractors, had dumped waste oil, paint 
thinner, solvents and other hazardous chemicals into oil shafts at 
the Endicott oil field. 
</P>
<P>
	The company acknowledged it failed to adequately supervise  
Doyon's activities and pleaded guilty to a single felony count of 
violating federal environmental reporting requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	Doyon pleaded guilty last year to 15 counts of violating federal  
oil pollution laws and paid a $1 million fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of barrels of waste were dumped from January 1993 to  
September 1995, prosecutors said. Company officials said they heard 
allegations of dumping on Aug. 31, 1995, but didn't report them for 
two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	BP officials said they first conducted an internal investigation  
and alerted the Environmental Protection Agency when the company 
confirmed that violations had occurred. Company officials said they 
mistakenly thought federal environmental laws allowed them to 
determine whether the allegations were credible before reporting 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert C. Bundy, U.S. Attorney for Alaska, said he expected the  
case would send a message to other companies in the oil industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``You cannot contract away your environmental responsibility,''  
Bundy said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Bundy praised BP for what he called an extraordinary degree of  
cooperation with the investigation. Federal prosecutors are 
continuing their investigation in the case, but would not say 
whether additional criminal or civil charges were expected. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the money to be paid out under the settlement  
agreement, BP said it has already spent $5 million to improve its 
environmental management within Alaska during the criminal 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The $15 million national environmental management system will  
cover all of BP's operations in the United States and the Gulf of 
Mexico. The program will include hiring an environmental monitor 
and regular audits of the company's environmental practices. 
</P>
<P>
	The intent is to make sure that employees and contractors  
understand environmental regulations and are properly trained in 
waste disposal, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are ultimately responsible for what occurs in our oil  
fields and these improper disposals would not have occurred if the 
systems that we had in place were working as well as we believed. 
We've learned from this mistake and have taken steps to prevent a 
recurrence,'' BP spokesman Ronnie Chappell said. 
</P>
<P>
	BP maintains no environmental damage occurred from the dumping  
at its Endicott field, but federal prosecutors say some of the 
material reached the surface. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no plans to try to determine the extent of the  
pollution or to clean up the shafts where the waste was dumped 
because it would be too expensive and could cause further 
environmental damage. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's done is done,'' Bundy said.

<HEADLINE> Germany Conglomerate To Split </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUESSELDORF, Germany (AP) -- German conglomerate Mannesmann said  
Thursday it plans to split its fast-growing telecommunications 
business from its engineering and automotive divisions in a bid to 
boost profits. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement sent Mannesmann shares soaring on the Frankfurt  
stock exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	By creating two independent companies with separate identities,  
Mannesmann's business strategy ``can be powered in an even stronger 
and more focused manner,'' a company statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mannesmann's board of directors made the proposal to the  
supervisory board Thursday, the company said. A decision was 
expected early next year. 
</P>
<P>
	After the announcement, Mannesmann shares rose sharply. They  
closed at 152 euros ($145.60), up 7.9 percent from Wednesday's 
close. 
</P>
<P>
	Mannesmann said the separated companies will be financed  
separately from 2001. By the end of next year, it plans to install 
separate executive boards to manage them. 
</P>
<P>
	Mannesmann said it also aims to list the two companies  
separately on European capital markets in 2001 and wants both 
companies to be components of Germany's DAX 30 blue chip index. 
</P>
<P>
	Mannesmann, which has its headquarters in Duesseldorf, reported  
revenue of $22.34 billion in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Floyd Causes Hospital Water Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- Eastern North Carolina's largest  
hospital has tapped into its rehabilitation swimming pool to keep 
toilets flushing and water flowing in the aftermath of Hurricane 
Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	Fire department water trucks are sucking water in the pool and  
circulating it through the plumbing system at Pitt County Memorial 
Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think a flood is the worst disaster a hospital could sustain  
because it affects all areas of a hospital and all parts of the 
infrastructure,'' the hospital's Dr. John Meredith said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The hospital was disconnected from the city's water system on  
Tuesday, after nearly a week of on and off service. Flooding has 
crippled the city's water treatment plant. Fire trucks and water 
tankers have been bringing water to the rehab pool and department 
pumper trucks then relay the greenish water into hospital pipes. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the system has enabled the 731-bed hospital to continue  
operating, the temporary solution has created its risks. 
</P>
<P>
	A gasoline truck refueling the fire trucks exploded Wednesday  
night. About 1,000 gallons of gasoline ignited, but no one was hurt 
and the hospital was not damaged. Firefighters on the scene 
extinguished the flames in minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Bottled water is still being used for drinking, while doctors  
and nurses have used alcohol to sterilize their hands. The hospital 
has limited surgeries to urgent and emergency cases to conserve 
water, postponing others. 
</P>
<P>
	Russell Gibbs, senior administrator of the hospital's operations  
department, estimates several hundred thousand gallons of water 
since Tuesday morning have gone into the 80,000-gallon swimming 
pool -- described as roughly half the size of an Olympic-size pool -- 
and then into the hospital's water system. 
</P>
<P>
	Gibbs said the hospital likely will return to the city system  
later this week.

<HEADLINE> Casino Regulators OK Trump Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -- Regulators have approved plans by  
casino mogul Donald Trump to close and demolish his money-losing 
Trump World's Fair Casino to make way for a new Atlantic City 
mega-resort. 
</P>
<P>
	The Casino Control Commission on Wednesday gave Trump permission  
to proceed with demolition of the World's Fair, which is located 
between historic Convention Hall and Trump Plaza on the Atlantic 
City boardwalk 
</P>
<P>
	Gambling will cease at World's Fair at midnight on Oct. 3, but  
guests who have booked rooms that night can stay over and check out 
the next day, according to Joseph Fusco, executive vice president 
of Trump Hotels &AMP; Casino Resorts Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Slot machines, gaming tables and other equipment will be removed  
over the following four to six weeks and demolition will occur 
sometime after that, he said. Demolition alone will cost between $3 
million and $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Trump hasn't disclosed specific plans for the new casino, but  
his company said in July that clearing the 12-acre site ``will give 
us the flexibility to develop the kind of world-class signature 
property that has made the Trump Organization the dominant 
developer in New York.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new casino hotel, which could have up to 4,000 rooms, would  
cost about $750 million -- an amount that might force Trump to 
partner with investors or another casino company. 
</P>
<P>
	Construction could begin in early 2001, said Trump Hotels chief  
executive Nicholas L. Ribis. 
</P>
<P>
	Trump World's Fair, a 21-story structure originally built as a  
Playboy casino-resort, was bought by Trump for $63 million in 1989. 
He ran it as a non-casino hotel, Trump Regency, before pumping $48 
million into renovations and reopening it in 1996 as Trump World's 
Fair. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite that, it has been losing about $10 million a year. The  
casino is considered an extension of Trump Plaza and operates under 
its license.

<HEADLINE> Flood Victims Return to Ruin, Mud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCKY MOUNT, N.C. (AP) -- Some of the thousands of people who  
were driven out by Hurricane Floyd's floodwaters a week ago finally 
went home Thursday and found ruin at every turn: soaked carpeting, 
ruined keepsakes, mud everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
	In a neighborhood near the Tar River in Rocky Mount, Jackie  
Bailey salvaged china from a cabinet that had crashed to the floor 
of her mother's home. Everything was caked in muck, but none of the 
china broke. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're probably going to bulldoze this,'' she said. She bent  
over a warped photo of her father that had fallen off the wall, 
where mildew already was forming. 
</P>
<P>
	Down the road, Bailey's husband, Mickey, was hosing brown grime  
from tables and chairs hauled from Bob Melton's barbecue 
restaurant, which has stood on the banks of the Tar for 75 years. 
Water reached the roof earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew there would be flooding. We didn't know it would be  
the flood of the millennium,'' said Bailey, who owns the building. 
He said Bob Melton's owners feel almost dutybound to reopen because 
the restaurant is a city institution. 
</P>
<P>
	``They'll figure if Bob Melton's can come back, they all can,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A week after the storm dumped 20 inches of rain here, more than  
700 roads remained flooded, the death toll rose to 42, and 
thousands were still in shelters. The eaves of homes poked through 
floodwaters in Princeville, a community of 1,900 founded 130 years 
ago by freed slaves. 
</P>
<P>
	National Guard helicopters continued to airlift bottled water  
and supplies to stranded communities across the soggy, 
18,000-square-mile region. 
</P>
<P>
	The 42nd confirmed death was Spec. Leon Reece Penland Jr., a  
National Guardsman killed Wednesday when his Humvee overturned. 
</P>
<P>
	Though waters were receding across much of eastern North  
Carolina, in Kinston, the bloated Neuse River was cresting at 28 
feet, twice its flood stage. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Wiggins, an emergency room technician at Lenoir County  
Memorial Hospital, peered across the street at his parents' home in 
Kinston, where floodwaters slapped at the top step. His parents had 
evacuated earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the only house I have,'' he said. ``That's the one you  
come back to when you don't have anywhere else to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Displaced families moved into a trailer village that opened  
Wednesday outside Rocky Mount, and another temporary community is 
planned near Greenville. Between the two, some 1,000 families will 
have homes, and state officials said more villages may open in 
other cities. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Gov. Jim Hunt went to Washington to lobby for more  
federal disaster aid. Losses are expected to surpass Hurricane 
Fran's $6 billion in 1996, with farm losses accounting for more 
than $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is the worst flood in the history of our state and maybe  
this country,'' Hunt said. ``We absolutely cannot recover without a 
great deal of help from our government.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Veto GOP Spending Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Eager to confront Republicans over the issue  
of schools, President Clinton is promising to veto a GOP-written 
$316 billion measure financing education, health and labor 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton issued his threat Thursday after Republicans pushed the  
bill through a House Appropriations subcommittee by a party-line 
8-6 vote. Though the bill's $35.6 billion for education is only 
$1.5 billion less than Clinton proposed, its cuts for more 
teachers, literacy training and adult education drew the 
president's objections. 
</P>
<P>
	``It fails to give public schools the resources to succeed, and  
does nothing to demand accountability for results,'' Clinton said 
in a written statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation is the biggest of the 13 annual spending bills  
for the coming fiscal year, only four of which Congress has sent to 
the White House. GOP leaders already plan to send Clinton 
legislation to keep agencies functioning for three weeks after Oct. 
1, when fiscal 2000 begins. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate was hoping to complete its $97 billion spending bill  
for veterans, housing, environment and space programs. It is among 
seven spending bills facing veto threats, this one because it falls 
short of Clinton demands for some environmental and other programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's veto threat on the labor-health bill was unusual  
because it was issued in his name and at only the subcommittee 
level. The action reflected how happy Democrats are to engage the 
GOP over education. Polls show the public trusts Democrats more 
than Republicans to deal with schools. 
</P>
<P>
	House Appropriations Committee Chairman Bill Young, R-Fla.,  
acknowledged that negotiations with the White House are likely 
before the bill takes its final shape, calling it ``the beginning 
of a process, and the process will require some adjustments as we 
go along.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, Republicans defended the measure, saying they paid for  
it while honoring their pledge to not use Social Security surpluses 
in the coming fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are committed, all of us, to stop bleeding Social Security  
reserves,'' said Rep. John Porter, R-Ill., chairman of the 
subcommittee that approved the bill. ``That takes some 
discipline.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans have adopted a number of bookkeeping devices to let  
them claim they would leave Social Security alone. This includes 
delaying billions in spending until 2001, declaring $1.4 billion in 
a decades-old home-heating aid program for the poor to be an 
``emergency,'' and reclaiming $3 billion in unspent welfare funds 
from the states -- a move that governors lambasted. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the measure covers automatically paid benefits like  
Medicaid. Of the remainder -- money for every other federal 
education, health and labor program -- the GOP would provide $89.4 
billion. That is $2.2 billion less than Clinton requested, and $300 
million less than is being spent this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure equals or exceeds Clinton's requests for educating  
handicapped students, treating AIDS patients and the Job Corps. But 
it also cuts the president's plans for after-school programs, job 
training for teen-agers and Head Start. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would provide $17 billion for biomedical research at  
the National Institutes of Health, $1.1 billion more than Clinton 
requested. It also would outspend Clinton for community health 
centers, and maternal and child care grants to states. 
</P>
<P>
	But it would trim Clinton's requests for the Occupational Safety  
and Health Administration. And it would combine favorite Clinton 
programs for hiring new teachers, training teachers and improving 
local education standards into grants that states could use as they 
choose, but with $400 million less than the president requested for 
the three initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile:  
</P>
<P>
	--House-Senate bargainers edged toward a compromise that would  
keep production of the F-22 stealth fighter alive but might not let 
the Air Force purchase any next year. 
</P>
<P>
	--Negotiators from the two chambers remained at odds over foreign  
aid and agriculture spending bills. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Senate voted 89-10 to approve a $14 billion measure  
financing the Interior Department after oil-state senators, by 
51-47, won language blocking the Clinton administration from 
raising royalties that oil companies pay to drill on federal lands.

<HEADLINE>  Gunfire Rattles East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DILI, East Timor (AP) -- Gunfire crackled across East Timor's  
chaotic capital Thursday, sending civilians scrambling for shelter 
and peacekeepers for their rifles in what was seen as a test of 
multinational authority in the province. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the shooting was not an attack, it prompted the commander  
of the peace mission, Maj. Gen. Peter Cosgrove, to warn that his 
men would use ``lethal force'' against anyone who even pointed a 
weapon at them. 
</P>
<P>
	Three truckloads of Indonesian soldiers, apparently resentful at  
having lost East Timor in a referendum on independence, unleashed 
bursts of automatic fire as they drove through the Australian- and 
British-controlled sectors of Dili. 
</P>
<P>
	No one was hurt, and the soldiers were not caught. But the  
incident demonstrated the dangers multinational troops face, and 
hinted at the prospect of deadly confrontations with 
anti-independence militias. Troops and other foreigners are 
particularly jittery after a Dutch journalist was found dead 
Wednesday in a Dili suburb. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indonesian army, which invaded East Timor in 1975 after  
Portugal abandoned its former colony, is now evacuating and handing 
control over to the multinational force. 
</P>
<P>
	``Twenty-four years ago, it was our responsibility to accept the  
territory ... in order to stop an ongoing fratricidal carnage after 
a disastrously bungled decolonization process,'' Foreign Minister 
Ali Alatas told the U.N. General Assembly on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Alatas said, Indonesia would help East Timor realize its  
expressed will for independence. He assured his country would 
depart from the territory ``honorably, peacefully and amicably.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. peacekeepers began entering East Timor this week, with  
about 3,000 soldiers on the ground as of midday Thursday and 4,500 
yet to come. 
</P>
<P>
	Cosgrove warned the militias against provocation.  
</P>
<P>
	``If they carry those weapons openly, if they point them at any  
other East Timorese or at my soldiers, then we will use lethal 
force against them,'' he said bluntly. ``That time is possibly not 
far away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cosgrove said he would try to speed up deployment of troops  
still at the staging point in Darwin, Australia. He has admitted 
that he does not have enough troops to secure all residential areas 
of the capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Brig. David Richards, commander of the British contingent, said  
the men who fired their weapons in the air wanted ``to see what our 
response drills are like. They are probing our responses. It is a 
test.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They also wanted to create fear and show that the peacekeepers  
have less control over the city than the Indonesians did, Richards 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Jakarta, the Indonesian Justice Minister Muladi announced  
Thursday that martial law had been revoked in East Timor, and 
responsibility for security would be handed over to the 
multinational force. The government had imposed martial law on 
Sept. 7 after the rampage began. 
</P>
<P>
	Cosgrove said he had reports that militias who wrought havoc on  
East Timor were massing across the border in the Indonesian 
province of West Timor. He said he is closely monitoring those 
groups, but his troops have no authority to operate in West Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	In Geneva, the U.N. Human Rights Commission held an emergency  
meeting Thursday to discuss alleged abuses in East Timor. The 
European Union called on the session to send an international 
commission to the province to gather evidence of war crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	At the United Nations in New York, Indonesian Foreign Minister  
Ali Alatas rejected suggestions for an international investigation 
into possible war crimes, saying Indonesia itself should first look 
into allegations of human rights violations. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people were killed when the  
militias went on a rampage of killing and looting after the 
referendum on independence, in what human rights groups say was an 
operation orchestrated by the Indonesian military to annul the 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. personnel took a two-hour helicopter tour Thursday of the  
towns of Ainaro, Same, Suai, Ermera, Liquica and Maliana, and found 
them almost completely deserted and half destroyed, U.N. spokesman 
Fred Eckhard said in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Between 190,000 and 300,000 people fled into the mountains and  
other areas during the violence, in addition to 141,000 who fled to 
Indonesian-controlled West Timor, according to a UNICEF report. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. workers warned Thursday that the international community  
has only a few weeks to get food to starving refugees before the 
rains ground flights and bog down roads. 
</P>
<P>
	Evidence of atrocities was beginning to emerge in Dili, which  
has been virtually razed. 
</P>
<P>
	In central Dili, reporters were shown a water well where eight  
dismembered bodies were found. Residents said as many as 30 victims 
were thrown in the well after being tortured. 
</P>
<P>
	Domingos Xavier, pointing to meat hooks hung from the rafters of  
a nearby house, said: ``These were used to hang people with cloth 
tied around their necks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A woman claimed that sacks containing body parts from the house  
were thrown in a nearby sewerage drain.

<HEADLINE>  Gunfire Rattles East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DILI, East Timor (AP) -- Gunfire crackled across East Timor's  
chaotic capital Thursday, sending civilians scrambling for shelter 
and peacekeepers for their rifles in what was seen as a test of 
multinational authority in the province. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the shooting was not an attack, it prompted the commander  
of the peace mission, Maj. Gen. Peter Cosgrove, to warn that his 
men would use ``lethal force'' against anyone who even pointed a 
weapon at them. 
</P>
<P>
	Three truckloads of Indonesian soldiers, apparently resentful at  
having lost East Timor in a referendum on independence, unleashed 
bursts of automatic fire as they drove through the Australian- and 
British-controlled sectors of Dili. 
</P>
<P>
	No one was hurt, and the soldiers were not caught. But the  
incident demonstrated the dangers multinational troops face, and 
hinted at the prospect of deadly confrontations with 
anti-independence militias. Troops and other foreigners are 
particularly jittery after a Dutch journalist was found dead 
Wednesday in a Dili suburb. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indonesian army, which invaded East Timor in 1975 after  
Portugal abandoned its former colony, is now evacuating and handing 
control over to the multinational force. 
</P>
<P>
	``Twenty-four years ago, it was our responsibility to accept the  
territory ... in order to stop an ongoing fratricidal carnage after 
a disastrously bungled decolonization process,'' Foreign Minister 
Ali Alatas told the U.N. General Assembly on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Alatas said, Indonesia would help East Timor realize its  
expressed will for independence. He assured his country would 
depart from the territory ``honorably, peacefully and amicably.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. peacekeepers began entering East Timor this week, with  
about 3,000 soldiers on the ground as of midday Thursday and 4,500 
yet to come. 
</P>
<P>
	Cosgrove warned the militias against provocation.  
</P>
<P>
	``If they carry those weapons openly, if they point them at any  
other East Timorese or at my soldiers, then we will use lethal 
force against them,'' he said bluntly. ``That time is possibly not 
far away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cosgrove said he would try to speed up deployment of troops  
still at the staging point in Darwin, Australia. He has admitted 
that he does not have enough troops to secure all residential areas 
of the capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Brig. David Richards, commander of the British contingent, said  
the men who fired their weapons in the air wanted ``to see what our 
response drills are like. They are probing our responses. It is a 
test.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They also wanted to create fear and show that the peacekeepers  
have less control over the city than the Indonesians did, Richards 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Jakarta, the Indonesian Justice Minister Muladi announced  
Thursday that martial law had been revoked in East Timor, and 
responsibility for security would be handed over to the 
multinational force. The government had imposed martial law on 
Sept. 7 after the rampage began. 
</P>
<P>
	Cosgrove said he had reports that militias who wrought havoc on  
East Timor were massing across the border in the Indonesian 
province of West Timor. He said he is closely monitoring those 
groups, but his troops have no authority to operate in West Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	In Geneva, the U.N. Human Rights Commission held an emergency  
meeting Thursday to discuss alleged abuses in East Timor. The 
European Union called on the session to send an international 
commission to the province to gather evidence of war crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	At the United Nations in New York, Indonesian Foreign Minister  
Ali Alatas rejected suggestions for an international investigation 
into possible war crimes, saying Indonesia itself should first look 
into allegations of human rights violations. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people were killed when the  
militias went on a rampage of killing and looting after the 
referendum on independence, in what human rights groups say was an 
operation orchestrated by the Indonesian military to annul the 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. personnel took a two-hour helicopter tour Thursday of the  
towns of Ainaro, Same, Suai, Ermera, Liquica and Maliana, and found 
them almost completely deserted and half destroyed, U.N. spokesman 
Fred Eckhard said in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Between 190,000 and 300,000 people fled into the mountains and  
other areas during the violence, in addition to 141,000 who fled to 
Indonesian-controlled West Timor, according to a UNICEF report. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. workers warned Thursday that the international community  
has only a few weeks to get food to starving refugees before the 
rains ground flights and bog down roads. 
</P>
<P>
	Evidence of atrocities was beginning to emerge in Dili, which  
has been virtually razed. 
</P>
<P>
	In central Dili, reporters were shown a water well where eight  
dismembered bodies were found. Residents said as many as 30 victims 
were thrown in the well after being tortured. 
</P>
<P>
	Domingos Xavier, pointing to meat hooks hung from the rafters of  
a nearby house, said: ``These were used to hang people with cloth 
tied around their necks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A woman claimed that sacks containing body parts from the house  
were thrown in a nearby sewerage drain. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the main militia groups, Aitarak, had its headquarters at  
the Hotel Tropical three doors away. 
</P>
<P>
	Even on Thursday, arson continued in Dili. Smoke billowed from a  
large government building recently evacuated by Indonesian troops. 
</P>
<P>
	Determined not to leave anything behind, soldiers vandalized and  
set fire to their barracks before departing, leaving behind live 
ammunition to explode in the heat.

<HEADLINE>  Students Protest in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Thousands of university students  
rampaged in more than a half-dozen Indonesian cities today, 
clashing with police in protests against a new law giving the armed 
forces sweeping emergency powers. 
</P>
<P>
	Local news media, including radio station Sonora, reported three  
demonstrators were killed in Jakarta, but there was no confirmation 
from authorities or local hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	A total of 53 people were injured, the SCTV network reported. At  
least four were rushed to the hospital with bullet wounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The protesters claim the new law will strengthen the military's  
already powerful role in domestic politics, and threaten the giant 
country's move toward democracy. 
</P>
<P>
	The clashes sent the Indonesian currency into a dive on fears of  
renewed anarchy. The rupiah lost 4.3 percent of its value against 
the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	Police fired rubber bullets and beat students with clubs in two  
Jakarta protests. An estimated 6,000 students and their supporters, 
many carrying sticks, clashed with police outside parliament, 
starting early in the afternoon and going into the evening. 
</P>
<P>
	Police also fired tear gas into a sea of angry demonstrators,  
who set several vehicles on fire. At least five police officers 
were burned when they were hit by firebombs in Jakarta. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 4,000 protesters flooded into the streets in the country's  
second-largest city, Surabaya, and more than 200 rallied on the 
resort island of Bali. 
</P>
<P>
	At the governor's office in the violence-wracked province of  
Aceh, 300 students smashed windows and fought with police. Similar 
protests were also taking place in Semarang, Ujung Pandang and 
Yogjakarta. 
</P>
<P>
	Just hours earlier today, Indonesia's parliament unanimously  
approved the law giving the armed forces wide-ranging emergency 
powers, triggering the violent reaction. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure allows the military to ban protests, take over the  
telecommunications system and mail service, and curb freedom of 
expression if a state of emergency is proclaimed. Even before the 
new law, the military held a dominant role in governing this 
country of 210 million people. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bill will be enacted not to serve the interests of the  
military but to safeguard the unity of the nation,'' said Gen. 
Wiranto, head of the Indonesian armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
	Even before its passage, the law had sparked days of protest in  
Jakarta and elsewhere in Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
	University students, who led the movement that toppled President  
Suharto in May 1998, claim the new measure threatens Indonesia's 
fledgling democratic rule and gives the military too much power. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first protest today, 500 students rallied at Jakarta's  
Moestopo University in the southern part of the city. In a second 
protest, 6,000 students marched on parliament to protest the new 
law. They were blocked by riot police, and then started throwing 
rocks, pieces of wood and everything else they could grab. 
</P>
<P>
	Demonstrations in Jakarta continued into the night, with  
protesters and police blocking key downtown avenues and exchanging 
volleys of rubber bullets and Molotov cocktails. 
</P>
<P>
	One person was carried away wrapped in a white sheet, but it was  
not known whether the person had died.

<HEADLINE> Neb. Investigates Free Insurance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) -- State officials, including the governor,  
are puzzled over why state employees married to other state 
employees have not had to pay for health insurance benefits since 
the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think you'll find many plans out there anymore where  
the employer pays 100 percent of the premium cost,'' Gov. Mike 
Johanns said Wednesday. ``I don't understand where this came 
from.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Single workers and those married to non-state employees have  
paid their share, but state employees married to other state 
employees have been exempt since 1981, according to a review of 
insurance manuals by The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The exemption was written into state insurance manuals, but no  
one is sure exactly what prompted the change. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor's chief of staff, Larry Bare, was budget director  
for the state from 1982 to 1986. He said he vaguely remembers the 
policy being put in place because it was less expensive for the 
state to pay for a married couple's policy than to pay for two 
individual policies. 
</P>
<P>
	The practice got instituted when it made sense financially, Bare  
said, but when theosts increased to where it no longer saved the 
state money it was never revisited. 
</P>
<P>
	It may take weeks to determine how and why the change was made  
and whether the current practice is legal, Johanns' spokesman Chris 
Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
	A review of the current policy shows the practice costs the  
state up to $270,000 per year, with 1,576 married state employees 
paying nothing for health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	State law and a labor contract require Nebraska to contribute 79  
percent of the cost of health insurance for employees; the rest is 
paid by employees.

<HEADLINE>  Actor George C. Scott Dead at 71 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- George C. Scott, whose eagle profile and  
gravel-voiced, commanding air brought new life to Gen. George S. 
Patton and earned him an Oscar he refused to accept, has died. He 
was 71. 
</P>
<P>
	Friends and staff found Scott dead Wednesday afternoon at his  
home in Westlake Village, 40 miles northwest of Los Angeles, said 
Mitch Breese, chief deputy coroner's investigator for Ventura 
County. An autopsy was scheduled today to determine the cause of 
death. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was unexpected,'' said Jim Mahoney, the actor's publicist,  
who noted that Scott had suffered an aneurism several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``He worked so hard at his trade but it came so easy to him,''  
Mahoney said. ``When he did a role he not only knew his role, he 
knew every role word for word. He took great pride in his work and 
he was good, real good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scott captivated audiences in roles ranging from the dangerously  
explosive, yet sympathetic Patton in 1970 to the fatuous blowhard 
Gen. Buck Turgidson in Stanley Kubrick's 1964 classic ``Dr. 
Strangelove.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two were opposite ends of a spectrum of memorable film  
characters: the shark on the sidelines who tries to devour Paul 
Newman in ``The Hustler''; the high-powered ringer brought in to 
steamroll small-town lawyer James Stewart in ``Anatomy of a 
Murder''; the dedicated doctor ground down by red tape and 
institutional incompetence in ``The Hospital.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For all his success in motion pictures, Scott disdained  
moviemaking, saying it was tedious and he did it only for the 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to work in the theater to stay sane,'' he said. ``You  
can attack the stage fresh every night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Scott rose from a sickbed at age 68 to star in the 1996  
Broadway revival of ``Inherit the Wind,'' one critic said it was 
like watching a horse buggy powered by a Ferrari engine. 
</P>
<P>
	In private life, Scott was for years a bellicose drinker whose  
profile was marked by a nose broken five times, in four barroom 
brawls and one mugging. He was married five times -- twice to the 
same woman, actress Colleen Dewhurst. 
</P>
<P>
	When Scott played in ``Plaza Suite'' in 1968, co-star Maureen  
Stapleton reportedly told director Mike Nichols at rehearsal, ``I'm 
so frightened of George, I don't know what to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``My dear,'' Nichols replied, ``the whole world is frightened of  
George.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scott was born in Wise, Va., on Oct. 18, 1927, but grew up in  
Detroit. He joined the Marines in 1945, too late for action in 
World War II, and spent his four years in service burying the dead 
at Arlington by day and boozing at night. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't look at that many widows in veils and hear that many  
`Taps' without taking to drink,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He left journalism school in 1950 without a degree and threw  
himself into acting, spending seven years performing more than 100 
roles with stock companies in Toledo, Ohio; Washington and Ontario, 
Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	His breakthrough came when he was 30 years old and caught the  
eye of Joseph Papp, impresario of the New York Shakespeare 
Festival. 
</P>
<P>
	In rapid succession, the unknown Scott played the title role in  
``Richard III'' in November 1957, Jacques in ``As You Like It'' in 
January 1958 and a poisoning peer in the off-Broadway ``Children of 
Darkness'' in March 1958. 
</P>
<P>
	For his work in all three productions he received the  
off-Broadway best actor Obie and a Theatre World award as a 
``promising personality.'' For the Shakespeare performances, he won 
a Clarence Derwent Award as most promising actor and a Vernon Rice 
Award for contribution to off-Broadway theater. 
</P>
<P>
	Later in 1958, his Broadway debut in ``Comes a Day'' earned the  
first of his four Tony Award nominations. The others were for ``The 
Andersonville Trial'' in 1959, ``Uncle Vanya'' in 1974 and ``Death 
of a Salesman,'' which he also directed, in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	In his career, he also won a second Obie, two television Emmys  
out of five nominations and was nominated for Oscars four times. 
</P>
<P>
	His film debut came in 1959, as a charismatic loony who stirs up  
a lynch mob against Gary Cooper in ``The Hanging Tree.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The same year, ``Anatomy of a Murder'' brought his first Academy  
Award nomination. He said nothing about it. 
</P>
<P>
	When he was nominated again in 1962 for ``The Hustler'' he wired  
the academy ``no thanks.'' The academy did not withdraw his name, 
but he didn't win. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott said later he didn't think he'd be nominated again and  
regretted only that ``I wasn't able to shock the academy into doing 
something constructive'' about what he viewed as a meaningless 
popularity contest. 
</P>
<P>
	The academy ignored his withdrawal again in 1970 and gave Scott  
the best-actor Oscar for ``Patton.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh my God!'' Oscar presenter Goldie Hawn exclaimed. ``The  
winner is George C. Scott!'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the film collected seven Academy Awards, Scott spent the  
evening watching hockey. 
</P>
<P>
	His last nomination was for ``The Hospital'' in 1971.  
</P>
<P>
	He won Emmys for directing ``The Andersonville Trial'' on PBS in  
1970 and acting in ``The Price'' on the Hallmark Hall of Fame in 
1971. He also was a nominee for acting in Hallmark's 1976 ``Beauty 
and the Beast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Early marriages to Carolyn Hughes and Patricia Reed produced two  
daughters, Victoria and Devon, and a son, Matthew. Scott also 
acknowledged a child born out of wedlock during his school years. 
</P>
<P>
	He met Dewhurst when they appeared together in ``Children of  
Darkness'' and they were married in 1960, divorced in 1965, 
remarried in 1967 and divorced in 1972. They had two sons, 
Alexander and Campbell. He married actress Trish Van Devere in 
1972.

<P>
	``My dear,'' Nichols replied, ``the whole world is frightened of  
George.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scott was born in Wise, Va., on Oct. 18, 1927, but grew up in  
Detroit. He joined the Marines in 1945, too late for action in 
World War II, and spent his four years in service burying the dead 
at Arlington by day and boozing at night. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't look at that many widows in veils and hear that many  
`Taps' without taking to drink,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He left journalism school in 1950 without a degree and threw  
himself into acting, spending seven years performing more than 100 
roles with stock companies in Toledo, Ohio; Washington and Ontario, 
Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	His breakthrough came when he was 30 years old and caught the  
eye of Joseph Papp, impresario of the New York Shakespeare 
Festival. 
</P>
<P>
	In rapid succession, the unknown Scott played the title role in  
``Richard III'' in November 1957, Jacques in ``As You Like It'' in 
January 1958 and a poisoning peer in the off-Broadway ``Children of 
Darkness'' in March 1958. 
</P>
<P>
	For his work in all three productions he received the  
off-Broadway best actor Obie and a Theatre World award as a 
``promising personality.'' For the Shakespeare performances, he won 
a Clarence Derwent Award as most promising actor and a Vernon Rice 
Award for contribution to off-Broadway theater. 
</P>
<P>
	Later in 1958, his Broadway debut in ``Comes a Day'' earned the  
first of his four Tony Award nominations. The others were for ``The 
Andersonville Trial'' in 1959, ``Uncle Vanya'' in 1974 and ``Death 
of a Salesman,'' which he also directed, in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	In his career, he also won a second Obie, two television Emmys  
out of five nominations and was nominated for Oscars four times. 
</P>
<P>
	His film debut came in 1959, as a charismatic loony who stirs up  
a lynch mob against Gary Cooper in ``The Hanging Tree.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The same year, ``Anatomy of a Murder'' brought his first Academy  
Award nomination. He said nothing about it. 
</P>
<P>
	When he was nominated again in 1962 for ``The Hustler'' he wired  
the academy ``no thanks.'' The academy did not withdraw his name, 
but he didn't win. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott said later he didn't think he'd be nominated again and  
regretted only that ``I wasn't able to shock the academy into doing 
something constructive'' about what he viewed as a meaningless 
popularity contest. 
</P>
<P>
	The academy ignored his withdrawal again in 1970 and gave Scott  
the best-actor Oscar for ``Patton.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh my God!'' Oscar presenter Goldie Hawn exclaimed. ``The  
winner is George C. Scott!'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the film collected seven Academy Awards, Scott spent the  
evening watching hockey. 
</P>
<P>
	His last nomination was for ``The Hospital'' in 1971.  
</P>
<P>
	He won Emmys for directing ``The Andersonville Trial'' on PBS in  
1970 and acting in ``The Price'' on the Hallmark Hall of Fame in 
1971. He also was a nominee for acting in Hallmark's 1976 ``Beauty 
and the Beast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Early marriages to Carolyn Hughes and Patricia Reed produced two  
daughters, Victoria and Devon, and a son, Matthew. Scott also 
acknowledged a child born out of wedlock during his school years. 
</P>
<P>
	He met Dewhurst when they appeared together in ``Children of  
Darkness'' and they were married in 1960, divorced in 1965, 
remarried in 1967 and divorced in 1972. They had two sons, 
Alexander and Campbell. He married actress Trish Van Devere in 
1972.

<HEADLINE> Sergio Gets Tiger in Ryder Pairings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROOKLINE, Mass. (AP) -- The Ryder Cup captains unwittingly gave  
everyone the pairing they wanted to see -- Tiger Woods and Sergio 
Garcia -- even though the two youngest and brightest stars in golf 
will have some company. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods will be paired with Tom Lehman and the 19-year-old Spanish  
sensation will be joined by Jesper Parnevik in the second of four 
alternate-shot matches that kick off the 33rd Ryder Cup on Friday 
morning at The Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
	The pairings were publicly announced during the opening ceremony  
Thursday afternoon, and drew the loudest cheer of all. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods, who held off Garcia by one stroke to win the PGA  
Championship, shrugged it off. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not 1-on-1. It's alternate shot, and you only hit half  
the shots,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The buzz that pairing will bring wasn't lost on Lehman or U.S.  
captain Ben Crenshaw. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even though it's a team format, Sergio and Tiger going at is a  
golf fan's dream,'' said Lehman, who was surprised to be paired 
with Woods since they had not played together all week. 
</P>
<P>
	The pairings process is a blind draw, with Crenshaw and Mark  
James separately submitting, in order, their four groups for each 
set of matches. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mark James and I met down by the skating pond on No. 3 and  
worked this out for you all,'' Crenshaw cracked. ``The pairing came 
out and everybody just kind of shook their head a little bit. That 
adds so much excitement, obviously. It's something that people want 
to see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That wasn't the only surprise.  
</P>
<P>
	Davis Love III thought he might be paired with Justin Leonard.  
Instead, Crenshaw benched Leonard for the morning matches and put 
Love with U.S. Open champion Payne Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	Crenshaw said leaving Leonard out of the morning matches was  
simply a case of having too many players on top of their game. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's an impossibility to try to look at four names and say,  
`Well, who am I going to leave out?' I've driven myself nuts,'' he 
said. ``You've got to push the button somewhere. I mean, the whole 
lineup is playing well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest surprise for Europe was who won't be playing right  
away -- Masters champion Jose Maria Olazabal, the most experienced 
player for Europe who has never missed a Ryder Cup match. 
</P>
<P>
	Olazabal has been wild off the tee and is quick to degrade  
himself. After a 75 in the first round of the U.S. Open, he slammed 
his fist into a hotel wall and broke his hand. Since then, he has 
missed the cut three times and not finished better than 40th. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wasn't ready,'' assistant captain Sam Torrance said. ``I  
think that's awesome he would do that. That's being honest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Accuracy off the tee is crucial in alternate-shot matches, but  
Olazabal conceded even on Tuesday that the fairways of The Country 
Club are ``not wide enough for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miguel Angel Jimenez instead will be paired with Irishman  
Padraig Harrington, who made his first Ryder Cup team by finishing 
second in the final tournament to qualify. They will be in the 
third match against Love and Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	James put Olazabal and Harrington together for a final practice  
round Thursday morning ``so that Jose Maria could see that if he 
actually didn't play, someone who is playing very well was going to 
take his place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	James is leading off with his best player. Colin Montgomerie and  
British Open champion Paul Lawrie will play against Phil Mickelson 
and David Duval, the only Ryder Cup rookie for the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The final match puts Lee Westwood and Darren Clarke,  
affectionately known as ``The Spice Boys'' in Europe for their love 
of fast cars and nightlife. They will be matched against two of the 
straightest players for the United States, Hal Sutton and Jeff 
Maggert. 
</P>
<P>
	The pairing with Woods and Garcia could really be a wash if one  
winds up hitting tee shots from the odd-numbered holes, and the 
other tees off on the even-numbered holes. And as much as Crenshaw 
was fascinated that the pairing worked out that way, he wasn't 
locked in on the two young stars. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tiger has a got a very solid horse right there with him,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States is hoping to get off to a fast start,  
particularly since Europe has won or retained the Ryder Cup five of 
the past seven times. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be an interesting start,'' Love said. ``If we  
can get ahead, we can do real well. We just don't want to get 
behind. Hopefully, those first couple of matches we can get out 
there and get off to a good start.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the first set of matches hardly determines the outcome.  
The last time Europe led after round one was in 1973.

<HEADLINE> Babbitt Faulted on Indian Accounts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate's only American Indian on Wednesday  
accused the Interior Department of making excuses instead of 
seriously trying to make amends for mismanaging more than $3 
billion of American Indians' money. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, chairman of the Senate Indian  
Affairs Committee, clashed with Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt at 
a hearing on the money issue, saying Babbitt's department dragged 
its feet and hindered efforts to correct problems with missing 
paperwork, lax oversight and poor investments for the Indian funds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Indians are owed more than promises, and enough is enough,''  
said the Colorado Republican and member of the Northern Cheyenne 
tribe. ``Indian Country has continued to be asked to wait for their 
money, and Indians still don't have their money,'' Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Babbitt retorted that Campbell's own proposed solutions were  
``ill-advised'' and ``fantasy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just creating another process to quarrel over,'' Babbitt  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The department's Bureau of Indian Affairs oversees trust  
accounts for both individual Indians and tribes: about 1,500 
accounts worth more than $2.5 billion for 338 tribes and more than 
300,000 accounts for individual Indians worth more than $500 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Babbitt and other department officials admit that both kinds of  
accounts have been mismanaged for decades and are plagued by 
incomplete, inaccurate, missing or contradictory record-keeping. 
Auditors could not account for billions of dollars' worth of past 
transactions involving the accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week Campbell introduced legislation that would create a  
semi-independent ``special trustee'' at the department to oversee 
``data cleanup'' -- the process of checking paper records, ensuring 
they are accurate and entering them into a computer database. 
Campbell's proposal also would create an independent commission to 
hear from tribal leaders and other experts about what other steps 
should be taken to solve the account management problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Tribes have criticized the handling of the trust funds for  
years, and a group of individual account holders is suing the 
department, seeking court oversight of reform efforts and billions 
of dollars in compensation. The judge in that case cited Babbitt 
and BIA head Kevin Gover for contempt of court earlier this year 
for repeated delays in handing over documents. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawyer for the Indians, Keith Harper, said Wednesday that both  
sides have recently been trying to negotiate a settlement to at 
least part of the case. Harper said his clients want the courts to 
have a role in overseeing reforms, whether or not Campbell's 
legislation requiring more independent oversight of reform efforts 
passes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think anything Congress does should dissuade the court  
from taking a role,'' Harper said in an interview. ``Congress can't 
have a hearing every day. The court can.''

<HEADLINE> Dissident Umpires Call Phillips Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Dissident umpires launched their campaign  
Thursday to oust union head Richie Phillips, saying they were 
starting to collect signatures to decertify the current union and 
start a new one. 
</P>
<P>
	The dissidents claim they have the support of more than 40  
umpires, enough to force the National Labor Relations Board to hold 
an election by secret ballot. 
</P>
<P>
	It's unclear, however, if they have the backing of a majority of  
the 93 major league umpires, a group that includes 22 who were let 
go earlier this month but continue to get paid through Dec. 31 
under a settlement worked out in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want a union that does not encourage its members to follow  
flawed and dangerous strategies,'' 13 umpires on the organizing 
board said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten of the 13 members of the board, which calls itself the Major  
League Umpires Independent Organizing Committee, were among the 14 
who issued a statement July 29 criticizing the leadership of the 
current union. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel very, very confident that there's a silent group out  
there that will look very favorably on our approach to a new, open, 
democratic form of government that will unify this group,'' said 
Dave Phillips, a dissident organizer who is not related to the 
union leader. 
</P>
<P>
	The three newcomers included Fieldin Culbreth and Mike Everitt,  
two of the new umpires hired by the American League, and Larry 
Young, a veteran AL ump. 
</P>
<P>
	Wally Bell, Mark Hirschbeck and Jeff Nelson, the only three NL  
umpires to break with the union leadership before the mass 
resignation strategy collapsed, are the only NL members of the 
board. 
</P>
<P>
	Under federal labor law, the NLRB conducts a ballot if it  
receives a request from 30 percent or more of the bargaining unit, 
which means 28 umpires can force an election. The dissidents are 
asking for votes to both decertify the current union and to 
designate a new union as their exclusive collective bargaining 
agent. 
</P>
<P>
	Richie Phillips was in a meeting and could not be reached for  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Silverman, the head of the NLRB's New York region office,  
said in typical cases, the agency will call for a hearing to take 
place about two weeks after it receives a petition. The agency 
takes 4-6 weeks to decide whether to call an election and then 
holds an election about a month later, meaning in this case it 
probably would take place in December or January. 
</P>
<P>
	The umpiring controversy began July 14 when more than 50 umpires  
said they would resign en masse to force an early start to 
negotiations to replace their labor deal, which expires Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Their strategy collapsed when more than two dozen umps either  
failed to resign or quickly withdrew their resignations. All 
umpires then tried to withdraw their resignations, but by then 
baseball had hired 25 news umps. 
</P>
<P>
	In an effort to force baseball to keep the 22 umps let go, the  
union has filed a grievance against the leagues. However, the sides 
still haven't agreed on arbitrator.

<HEADLINE> Bill Doesn't Let Patients Sue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Small businesses would be encouraged to buy  
health insurance for employees under Republican legislation that 
also would penalize health plans for refusing to pay for medically 
necessary treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	But unlike two patient protection measures pending in the House,  
the bill, unveiled Thursday by Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio, would not 
give patients the right to sue. 
</P>
<P>
	``Patients don't want lawsuits. They want a system that punishes  
HMOs severely if they refuse to provide the treatment physicians 
prescribe,'' he said at a news conference. ``Patients want care, 
not court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boehner said his bill would cover the 161 million Americans with  
private-sector health insurance, as well as the 43 million 
uninsured. 
</P>
<P>
	Patients would be guaranteed the right to have disputed  
decisions about HMO coverage reviewed by outside doctors whose 
findings would be legally binding. Plans that refuse to comply 
could be prosecuted and fined. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also has other protections, including the right of  
patients to continue receiving care from a doctor who has left 
their HMO and the option of choosing a doctor from outside of their 
network, Boehner said. 
</P>
<P>
	It would also would end HMOs prohibiting doctors from telling  
patients their full range of treatment options, and guarantee 
direct access to emergency care for all and to 
obstetrician-gynecologists for women. 
</P>
<P>
	Boehner opposes two other pending measures because he said both  
would expose employers to lawsuits and jeopardize employer-based 
health coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., has promised to bring the  
patient protection measures to the floor sometime next month. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Association of Health Plans issued a statement  
endorsing the Boehner plan as one that ``begins to address the real 
issues without sending costs through the roof or feathering the 
nest of trial lawyers.''

<HEADLINE> Spanish Find Centuries-Old Ice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADRID, Spain (AP) -- Scientists studying global climate changes  
say they've made a startling find -- centuries-old ice in sunny 
southern Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	The discovery came in the Sierra Nevada mountains of Andalusia,  
in a range called the Corral del Veleta, at an altitude of 10,300 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Until now, the southernmost point in Europe known to have such  
material, called permafrost, was 420 miles to the north, in another 
Spanish mountain range, the Picos de Europa, said Antonio Gomez, a 
geology professor at the University of Barcelona. 
</P>
<P>
	Gomez, the lead researcher on the project, said Wednesday that  
it was too early to say what the presence of the ice in the south 
means or even determine exactly how old it is. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, his best guess is that the ice is the remnants of a  
glacier that may have formed as far back as the 15th century and 
has gradually eroded. His team confirmed the presence of the ice 
this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	That was made possible by a drought, which melted snow that  
normally covers the mountaintop and thus simplified the team's 
thermal measuring process, carried out by digging holes in the rock 
and inserting sensors the size of a roll of film. 
</P>
<P>
	Gomez said the ice is mixed with rock and begins just 5 feet  
below the surface but may go as deep as 60 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	The next step is to monitor the temperature of the ice over the  
course of several years. If it drops, that would provide further 
evidence of global warming. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an excellent tool for following the evolution of the  
global climate,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Mitchell Cautious on NIreland Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Northern Ireland's key  
politicians are serious about salvaging their moribund peace accord 
despite ``grounds for pessimism,'' American mediator George 
Mitchell said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The former U.S. senator's remarks were his first in public since  
Sept. 6, when he began trying to reconcile local politicians' 
polarized interpretations of the Good Friday accord of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell, who led 22 months of negotiations that produced the  
agreement, declined to say how long he intended to pursue his 
latest initiative. He managed to joke about his daunting task. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since everyone else in Northern Ireland thinks I'm going to  
fail, I think there ought to be someone anticipating success,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The two parties at the heart of the dispute are the Ulster  
Unionists, who represent much of the province's British Protestant 
majority, and Sinn Fein, the Irish Republican Army-linked party 
that has its roots in the most deprived Roman Catholic areas. 
</P>
<P>
	For more than a year, the Ulster Unionists have refused to  
accept Sinn Fein within a four-party Cabinet for Northern Ireland, 
the central goal of the accord, until the IRA starts to disarm. The 
IRA has refused to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the parties are serious. They want to try and get the  
job done. The difficulty is in translating that attitude and state 
of mind into concrete action,'' said Mitchell, who this week 
brought Sinn Fein and the Ulster Unionists together for their first 
face-to-face meeting since July. 
</P>
<P>
	Hard-line Protestants criticized Ulster Unionist leader David  
Trimble for meeting Sinn Fein. Trimble insisted Thursday that most 
people still think the Good Friday accord ``embodies the best 
chance that they have had, or are likely to have for decades.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell said he understood ``the difficulties involved and the  
grounds for pessimism'' and emphasized: ``I don't want to be 
unrealistic in a foolish way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``But I would not be here if I were convinced that it could not  
be done. I'm still hopeful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his last meeting before departing for the United States,  
Mitchell met with the Rev. Ian Paisley, whose Democratic Unionist

<HEADLINE>  Moynihan Endorses Bradley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- New York's most prominent Democrat, Sen. Daniel  
Patrick Moynihan, endorsed Bill Bradley for president Thursday, 
saying Vice President Al Gore ``can't be elected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 72-year-old senator, known for his quirky intellectual  
style, quoted Woodrow Wilson as saying the presidency required 
candidates ``from among wise and prudent athletes, a small class.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley was a Rhodes scholar and a player on two NBA  
championship teams with the New York Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've seen this particular athlete, wise and prudent, work in  
the U.S. Senate for 18 years,'' Moynihan said. ``He is a man with 
heart and courage and stamina.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why he wasn't supporting the vice president, the  
Democratic front-runner, Moynihan replied: ``Nothing is the matter 
with Gore, but he can't be elected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Gore's campaign headquarters, communications director Kiki  
Moore suggested Moynihan's imprimatur would make little difference: 
``I'm sure President Bob Kerrey appreciated (Moynihan's) support in 
1992.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But opinions varied.  
</P>
<P>
	``At this point in time, it makes a difference because Moynihan  
is a venerated figure within the Democratic Party,'' said 
Democratic consultant George Arzt. ``But over the long term, it 
usually doesn't translate into votes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``An endorsement from Moynihan in this state has got to be a  
great day for the Bradley campaign,'' said Robert McClure, senior 
associate dean of Syracuse University's Maxwell School of 
Citizenship and Public Affairs. ``Bradley is pitching himself as 
exactly the kind of intellectual, moderate progressive that Senator 
Moynihan has always been seen as.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Comptroller Carl McCall, a Gore backer, said the endorsement  
``makes a good story today. In terms of impact over the long run, 
it means very little.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley acknowledged his difficult course.  
</P>
<P>
	``I know we are up against a party establishment that has a lot  
of entrenched power,'' he said. ``But this will ultimately be 
decided by the people themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moynihan is the third senator to endorse Bradley, joining Paul  
Wellstone of Minnesota and Bob Kerrey of Nebraska. Bradley served 
three terms as a New Jersey senator, working with Moynihan -- who 
was first elected in 1976 -- on the Senate Finance Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore has been endorsed by more than 100 members of Congress,  
including 10 of the 19 Democrats from New York. The state's other 
senator, Democrat Charles Schumer, has not made a formal 
endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
	National polls show Gore leads Bradley, but recent surveys in  
New Hampshire and New York have shown a tight race between the two 
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	New York is one of 14 states to pick presidential nominees on  
March 7. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to win this primary on March 7,'' Moynihan said.  
``We'll be proud of ourselves for having been here early. We can do 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moynihan also backed first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, a Gore  
supporter, to replace him as senator when he retires at the end of 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about the conflict of supporting Mrs. Clinton but not  
Gore, Moynihan said simply: ``I think she can be elected senator.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton would not comment on whether Moynihan's endorsement  
of Bradley was awkward for her, saying only that she strongly 
supports Gore but is grateful for Moynihan's backing for her own 
aspirations.

<HEADLINE> Dividend Sets New Record in Alaska </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- Alaskans consider themselves different  
from other Americans, and this year that difference pays a record 
$1,769.84. 
</P>
<P>
	That's the amount more than 575,000 residents will receive as  
their share of earnings from the Alaska Permanent Fund, a savings 
account set up more than two decades ago to preserve a portion of 
the state's oil-field revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue Commissioner Wilson Condon revealed the dividend amount  
Wednesday. The payout is the highest in the program's 18-year 
history, and it represents the eighth straight year that the amount 
has increased. 
</P>
<P>
	Anyone who has collected every dividend since the inception of  
the program in 1982 will see their grand total rise to more than 
$16,500 with this year's addition. 
</P>
<P>
	Just over $1 billion will be distributed in dividends, also a  
record, according to the state Department of Revenue. Those who 
lived in the state for all of 1998 are eligible for the money. 
</P>
<P>
	Alaskans will have cash in hand beginning in early October. For  
many, a spending frenzy begins: holidays in Hawaii, new cars and 
snowmobiles, Christmas shopping sprees. Others save or use the 
money to retire debt. 
</P>
<P>
	In rural areas the dividend is among the major annual sources of  
cash and buys necessities like hunting rifles and fishing nets. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're talking about total personal income in the state,  
(the dividend) is a big player,'' said Neal Fried, a state labor 
economist. ``It's bigger than almost any industry payroll. ... It's 
bigger than the oil industry payroll.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A prolonged stock market boom has driven up the value of the  
fund to $26.4 billion as of this week, more than double what it was 
seven years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The dividend amount is roughly calculated as 10.5 percent of the  
fund's net income over the last five years divided by the number of 
eligible Alaskans.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Helps Gore Raise Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton articulated what he called  
Vice President Al Gore's ``great challenge'' in asking voters to 
give him the nation's top job: ``People think at election time 
they're supposed to vote for change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, meanwhile, continued to grapple for a message that would  
make clear a vote for him is not a vote for a third Clinton-Gore 
term. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the course of one day -- a day that ended with him  
side-by-side with the president -- Gore's rhetoric went from a 
direct hit on the administration he shared with Clinton (``I'm not 
satisfied,'' Gore said) to a more nuanced appeal for his own 
ascendancy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been doing a lot of things right, but it is time to  
start a new wave of change in this nation,'' Gore said Wednesday 
night as he and Clinton courted some three dozen fund-raising 
heavyweights over a pair of intimate dinners. 
</P>
<P>
	The president perhaps got carried away when he tried to work  
with Gore's ``change'' theme: ``Do we need a change? The answer is, 
yes we do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a voice hoarse from allergies and strain, Clinton continued,  
``The question is how are we going to change? Are you going to 
build on the good things that are going on in America now to face 
the unmet challenges of this country in the 21st century? Or, will 
we basically go back to the approach that got us into so much 
trouble in the first place?'' 
</P>
<P>
	With 11 fund-raising events in 10 days, Gore sprinted toward  
month's end and the next official tally of candidate cash. He was 
meeting some 250 people, including Maryland Gov. Parris Glendening, 
at two Georgetown residences tonight for back-to-back dinners worth 
about $300,000, campaign aides said. 
</P>
<P>
	Taking in about $1 million this week alone, Gore's fund raising  
is on track but won't yield blockbuster surprises in the 
third-quarter Federal Election Commission reports, said his 
longtime fund-raising guru, Peter Knight. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eye-popping is what George W. does,'' said Knight, referring  
to Republican rival George W. Bush's record-setting $52 million 
tally to date. 
</P>
<P>
	As of June 30 and the last quarterly FEC report, Gore had raised  
$17.5 million to Bill Bradley's $11.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley is Gore's only challenger for the Democratic  
presidential nomination and on Wednesday, Gore sounded increasingly 
like a man battling for the prize once considered inevitably his. 
</P>
<P>
	Where once he shadowboxed with Bush, the vice president now  
aimed punches at Bradley and the former New Jersey senator's 
campaign for ``big ideas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	America's problems will not be solved with ``pie-in-the-sky  
rhetoric that's not matched with practical, good, hard-nosed common 
sense,'' Gore told a Washington luncheon of some 1,200 working 
women who contributed at least $125 apiece to Gore's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore played to his audience of women, including his wife,  
Tipper, who introduced him. ``I love it when she beckons me with 
her finger like that,'' Gore laughed slyly. ``I always respond.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He asked the women to sustain their enthusiasm ``from autumn to  
autumn'' and warned of a long road ahead. ``This struggle we're 
involved in is a marathon, not a sprint,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	His schedule for the last two weeks of September suggested more  
of a frenzied dash. The vice president had fund-raisers this week 
in Boston, New York and Washington. On Sunday, he mines Connecticut 
and then trolls Chicago and New York again next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday night's dinners were meant to court past heavyweight  
contributors and people who have agreed to raise money for Gore. 
Among them were Robert Kennedy Jr., former Texas Gov. Ann Richards 
and Communications Workers of America President Morton Bahr. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Gore's speeches -- and his ``I'm not satisfied'' refrain --  
reflected his ongoing attempt to show himself to voters as someone 
separate from Clinton with his own ideas. 
</P>
<P>
	To a morning meeting of the American Medical Association, Gore  
said, ``I'm here today because I'm not satisfied'' with the state 
of health care in HMOs. And to his luncheon crowd, Gore said remedy 
was his goal -- to ``make things the way they are supposed to be, 
where no child is hungry, no American is illiterate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, with Clinton at his side before dinner, Gore granted  
that, ``We've been doing a lot of things right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's appeal for fund-raising help made clear that electing  
Gore is a way to carry on his own legacy: ``He needs you. 
Everything we have worked for all these years requires your 
continued efforts.''

<HEADLINE> IRS Urges Swift Tax Law Extensions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With President Clinton poised to veto the $792  
billion Republican tax cut bill, the Internal Revenue Service is 
urging Congress to move swiftly to extend expiring tax provisions 
so forms can be drafted for next year. 
</P>
<P>
	IRS Commissioner Charles Rossotti met Wednesday with Rep. Bill  
Archer, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, to stress 
that tax law changes effective for the 2000 filing season needed to 
be on the president's desk by Oct. 7. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's pretty much the drop-dead date,'' Rossotti said.  
``Printing the forms -- you've got to have some lead time to do 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Archer, R-Texas, said he would attempt to comply by moving  
forward on a tax package -- possibly as early as Friday -- that would 
extend several expiring provisions at a one-year cost of roughly $3 
billion. These ``extenders'' are part of the larger $792 billion 
tax cut, but unlike that bill they have broad bipartisan support. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to move it as quickly as we can,'' Archer said.  
</P>
<P>
	Also Wednesday, Senate Finance Committee Chairman William Roth,  
R-Del., asked GOP leaders to reserve $4 billion of the projected 
$14 billion fiscal 2000 non-Social Security surplus for the 
extenders package and for Medicare costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton is expected to veto the larger GOP tax bill on Thursday  
at the White House, and it remains unclear whether Republicans and 
Democrats can agree on a compromise other than the extenders. 
Archer, however, said those provisions should move on their own. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would prefer to keep it as simple as possible,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The driving forces behind the package are a research and  
development tax credit favored by high-tech companies and 
manufacturers and a provision ensuring that millions of 
middle-class taxpayers don't fall subject to the higher alternative 
minimum tax if they take personal credits on their income tax 
returns such as the $500 per child credit and education credits. 
</P>
<P>
	``We promised these benefits to middle-income families and we  
should not let AMT interfere with these credits,'' Roth said in a 
letter to Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss. 
</P>
<P>
	Other provisions include extension of credits aimed at  
encouraging businesses to hire workers from certain targeted groups 
and to provide jobs for former welfare recipients. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Democrats generally support these items, some disagree  
with Archer's plan to use projected budget surplus dollars to pay 
for them. Rep. Charles Rangel of New York, top Democrat on the Ways 
and Means Committee, said he will propose an alternative that 
raises the necessary revenue by closing several corporate tax 
loopholes. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP version, Rangel said, is a ``threat'' to Social Security  
because it could tap into money earmarked for that retirement 
program, saying, ``No attempt is being made to pay for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rangel said his version also would extend and expand an expiring  
school construction bond program that expires on Dec. 31.

<HEADLINE> Dems Begin Minimum Wage Effort </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Democrats began a push Thursday to force  
their minimum wage bill to the floor as a bipartisan effort on the 
same issue was moving forward. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have the votes to pass a higher minimum wage. The only  
question is ... when will the legislation come up? When will the 
Republican leadership stop trying to avoid the issue?'' said Rep. 
David Bonior of Michigan, the House Democratic whip. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure backed by most congressional Democrats and the White  
House would increase the minimum wage, now $5.15 an hour, by 50 
cents an hour in each of the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonior filed papers that allow rank-and-file lawmakers to  
petition for a vote on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	A bipartisan measure taking shape calls for increases totaling  
$1.30 over four years. But it also is expected to include a variety 
of tax breaks and other provisions designed to mollify Republicans 
who customarily oppose minimum wage increases. 
</P>
<P>
	The tax breaks include a provision making health care costs  
deductible for the self-employed, an increase in the deductibility 
of meals for certain businesses; a credit to partially offset the 
cost of wages paid to certain low-wage workers; and a series of 
pension improvements. 
</P>
<P>
	House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas, is  
pushing to include a gradual repeal of the estate tax, a key 
priority for small business groups. Archer ``wants to take every 
opportunity to kill the death tax. He is considering attaching it 
to the minimum wage,'' said spokesman Trent Duffy.

<HEADLINE> Search for Escaped Killer Grows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COUNCIL GROVE, Kan. (AP) -- A man escaped from a county jail  
hours after he was sentenced to nearly 42 years for shaking a young 
boy to death, a getaway that came while the sheriff's department 
was busy with a traffic accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Adam escaped Tuesday from a jail exercise yard by climbing  
a 10-foot chain-link fence topped with razor wire in this small 
town 50 miles southwest of Topeka. 
</P>
<P>
	Adam, 24, pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in the October  
1998 death of 16-month-old Timothy Post, the son of his former 
girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers searched for him Tuesday night, but tracking dogs lost  
his scent and the search, said Sheriff R.J. Meierhoff. The search 
continued Wednesday with tracking dogs and aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	The escape came while the sheriff's department, whose offices  
are located in the building that houses the jail, was responding to 
a traffic accident. Meierhoff said the department has five officers 
and some at the jail were sent to the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were in the process of dispatching units to an accident, so  
it was a little lax then,'' he said. ``We got a little busy because 
of the car accident.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the time of the boy's slaying, Adam was on parole after  
serving time for the 1993 stabbing death of a Kansas State 
University student.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Czar Decries Drugs in Sports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The use of drugs by athletes to enhance  
their performance is out of control, White House drug czar Barry 
McCaffrey said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're seeing an era in which athletic competition is believed  
to require chemical engineering of the human body if you expect to 
be competitive. That's true even in Little League baseball and 
high-school swimming,'' said McCaffrey, director of the White House 
Office of National Drug Control Policy. 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey was in Salt Lake City to consult with Olympic  
organizers on their drug-detection plans for the 2002 Winter Games. 
Medal winners will go straight from the finish line to a 
``doping-control'' tent to produce a urine sample. 
</P>
<P>
	But McCaffrey said the ``cat-and-mouse game'' requires  
increasingly sophisticated testing to catch new 
performance-enhancing drugs. Testing now in use ``essentially only 
catches the stupid cheater,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey said he was trying to build international consensus  
for an independent world testing agency. He criticized a plan to 
have the International Olympic Committee police drug use, saying 
the IOC wasn't trustworthy. 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey said drug use among athletes from cyclists to soccer  
players is so prevalent that many athletes feel they must use drugs 
to remain competitive even if they don't want to. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's assumed that if you win, you must be using some kind of  
drug,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	There's even a new drug to steady a marksman's nerves in  
pistol-shooting contests, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Especially popular are steroids that build muscles and other  
drugs that produce extra red blood cells to carry more oxygen in an 
athlete's body, said Doug Rollins, the medical doping officer for 
the Salt Lake Organizing Committee president Mitt Romney vowed that 
the 2002 Games will be a ``drug-free, clean Olympics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To that end, the top four competitors in each Olympic event will  
immediately be escorted to a doping-control station, given a sealed 
bottle of spring water and kept under careful watch as they produce 
a 3-ounce urine sample in a cup. 
</P>
<P>
	From that, two samples will be sealed, one for testing, the  
other for a backup. A courier will deliver the samples to SLOC's 
future doping lab at the University of Utah for testing. 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey and Romney toured the lab at the Associated Regional  
and University Pathologists. 
</P>
<P>
	``You haven't heard the end of it,'' McCaffrey told reporters.  
``This is an ongoing dialogue. We have to change the nature of the 
game. We don't like what we see.''

<HEADLINE> Drought Hurts Pa. Pumpkin Crop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEDIA, Pa. (AP) -- You might need a smaller candle to light your  
jack-o-lantern this year. And a few more dollars to buy it. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot fewer and my pumpkins I grew in my yard really  
shriveled up. It's a sin,'' Holly Manzone of Pocopson said while 
looking through the wooden bins full of pumpkins at Linvilla 
Orchards, about 15 miles west of Philadelphia. ``But at least the 
ones they have look healthy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A yearlong drought in the East followed by soaking rains has led  
to fewer pumpkins, many of which are small or have ripened more 
than a month before the peak buying weeks leading to Halloween. The 
shortage will mean higher prices for that perfect gourd at the 
local farmer's market, farmers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are problems all over the country,'' said Michael  
Orzolek, a professor of vegetable crops at Penn State University. 
``You can find some beautiful pumpkins and you can find some very 
poor pumpkins. I wouldn't be panicked but I would encourage the 
general public to start making their purchases early.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Halloween to pumpkin farmers what Christmas is to tree  
growers, pumpkins are a key commodity this time of year. More than 
74,000 acres of pumpkins were planted at more than 10,000 farms in 
the United States in 1997, the most recent year figures were 
available from the National Agricultural Statistics Service. In 
1992, about 63,000 acres were planted on 9,500 farms. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. crop, led by producers in Illinois and Pennsylvania, is  
about 60 to 65 percent below normal this year, Orzolek said. Prices 
should be about 35 to 45 cents a pound, up from an average of about 
28 to 37 cents last year. 
</P>
<P>
	At Linvilla Orchards, stacks of pumpkins in various shapes and  
shades of orange sold for 39 cents a pound. A round pumpkin about 
the size of a soccer ball that weighed a little more than 8 pounds 
cost $3.30. 
</P>
<P>
	``That seems a bit high,'' said Annmarie Hally of East  
Lansdowne. She brings her niece and nephew to the farm every year 
to pick out a pumpkin to carve and make a pie. 
</P>
<P>
	Dry weather caused pumpkins to be small, while the hot weather  
prevented fertilization resulting in fewer and smaller pumpkins. 
Conditions are especially bad on the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Mosbah Kushad, a food crop specialist for the University of  
Illinois, said the summer's heat also spurred an outbreak of 
phytophthora, a fungal disease in the root system of some plants. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are still pumpkins out there,'' Kushad said. ``But the  
supply is going to be tight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Caroll Swartz of the Golden Kernel farm in Grottoes, Va., blames  
the late and heavy rains from Hurricane Floyd that flooded the East 
Coast. Swartz sells about 300 tons of pumpkins a year, many of 
which he gets from Pennsylvania and Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	His northwestern Virginia farm already has about 30 tons ready  
to be sold and he's noticed wholesale prices running 40 to 50 
percent higher this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you get a lot of rain when the pumpkins are mature it  
causes fungus to grow and pumpkins to rot out. It would have been a 
lot more beneficial to get the rain earlier on in the season,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Problems are similar in the Midwest, said Cindy Flyte, a  
spokeswoman for the Market Vegetable Growers Association in Coloma, 
Wis. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of the pumpkins are mature right now and pumpkins don't  
last too long,'' Flyte said. ``Ours are ripe, they're orange and 
they're pretty much going downhill this year. It's not good for the 
market.''

<HEADLINE> No Charges Filed in Yosemite Deaths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK, Calif. (AP) -- Cary Stayner had figured  
out an excuse to be knocking on the door of Room 509 at 11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Saying he had to fix a leak, the hotel handyman talked his way  
into the room where a mother and two teenage girls were watching 
videos on the last night of their vacation. He was hiding a rope 
and a .22-caliber pistol. 
</P>
<P>
	On this Monday after Valentine's Day, most of the weekend guests  
had already left the lodge near the western gate to Yosemite 
National Park. Every other room in the ground-floor wing was 
vacant. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner, a clean-cut man with a friendly demeanor, came out of  
the bathroom flashing the gun, saying it was a robbery. He ordered 
Carole Sund, her daughter Juli and their Argentine friend Silvina 
Pelosso to lie face-down on the beds. 
</P>
<P>
	After binding their hands with duct tape and gagging them, he  
ordered the two girls into the bathroom and turned his attention to 
Mrs. Sund. 
</P>
<P>
	It went smoothly, he explained later to the FBI. They did  
everything he told them to do. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a victim, we choose to believe we're going to live if we  
cooperate,'' said Clinton Van Zandt, a former FBI behavioralist and 
serial killer expert. The thinking is, ``if we do what he says, he 
will let us go, and that's all I have to hold on to right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the scenario Stayner described to the FBI is true, he took a  
lot of risks, left a lot of clues and was lucky to evade capture 
for months until his fantasies about killing women drove him to 
strike again. 
</P>
<P>
	Only after he was picked up for the July 21 murder of Joie  
Armstrong, a woman who led children on nature hikes through the 
park, did he admit killing all four women. The confession shocked 
the FBI, which was trying to build a case on circumstantial 
evidence that pointed to a group of ex-convicts in Modesto. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner said in a jailhouse interview with a television reporter  
that he would plead guilty to all four murders. He has since 
pleaded innocent to Ms. Armstrong's killing, saying he wants to 
live. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, he was arraigned on additional charges of  
kidnapping and trying to sexually assault Ms. Armstrong. He already 
faces a death sentence in her case. 
</P>
<P>
	No charges have been filed in the sightseers' murders. Law  
enforcement sources say that's because they want to rule out any 
possibility Stayner didn't act alone last February. 
</P>
<P>
	A transcript of the confession has not been made public. But  
physical evidence collected in the weeks since Stayner began 
talking has given agents a clearer picture of how he could have 
single-handedly overpowered the women and remained on the loose for 
so long, according to law enforcement sources with direct knowledge 
of the case. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner said he strangled Mrs. Sund with the rope while the  
girls were in the bathroom, and put her body in the trunk of the 
rental car parked outside. Then he returned to the girls, and 
ordered them to perform sex acts. Silvina resisted. Pulling the 
rope so tightly that his fingertips grew numb, he said he strangled 
her in the bathroom, out of Juli's view. 
</P>
<P>
	Silvina took her last breaths in the bathtub. At the time,  
Stayner was assaulting Juli. 
</P>
<P>
	It was hours later and early morning when he took Juli to an  
adjacent room and began to hide the evidence. He put Silvina's body 
in the trunk, and arranged the room so it appeared that the women 
had simply checked out and left. He even wet the towels to make it 
seem that they took showers in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
	About 4 a.m., Stayner said, he wrapped Juli, naked, in a motel  
blanket and fled with her loosely bound in the passenger seat of 
the rental car. Choosing lonely highways that are white-knuckle 
drives under the best conditions, he swerved around the plunging 
canyons and steep cliffs on Yosemite's western ridge. 
</P>
<P>
	With dawn approaching, Stayner turned off at Lake Don Pedro and  
carried Juli up a worn dirt path to a small clearing overlooking 
the water. 
</P>
<P>
	He cut her throat more than once. She begged for death, he said,  
pointing her forefinger and thumb at her temple like a gun and 
``pulling'' the trigger. 
</P>
<P>
	He couldn't shoot her, he told her. There were no bullets in his  
gun. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, he hid her body in a thicket, leaving her wrapped in  
the blanket with her arms crossed over her chest. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner said he considered ditching the car in the reservoir,  
but decided against it when he saw a fisherman. He drove until he 
found a snow-covered hill, and drove the car as far as he could 
into the forest. Then he caught a cab back to Yosemite Valley, 
paying the fare with $150 he'd stolen from Mrs. Sund's purse. 
</P>
<P>
	Two days later he returned to the car to burn it, then drove two  
hours west and dumped Mrs. Sund's billfold insert on a Modesto 
street corner to fool police. 
</P>
<P>
	Then -- nothing. A huge team of state, local and federal agents  
searched everywhere, with no solid leads. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators didn't suspect Stayner, not when they first  
questioned him right after the vacationers' disappearance and not 
months later when they came back to show pictures of the Modesto 
suspects and collect blankets as potential evidence. It was Stayner 
the handyman who opened the motel doors for them. 
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't set off any bells. He wasn't overly eager and he  
wasn't uncooperative,'' a task force source said, recalling the day 
he helped the agents. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner had already given the FBI a big clue: on March 15, he  
sent them a taunting letter with a map pointing to Juli's body. By 
the time they opened it a week later, a hunter had already found 
the burned car with the other two bodies inside. 
</P>
<P>
	But the FBI was far off Stayner's trail, plunging into Modesto's  
methamphetamine subculture. A federal grand jury began hearing 
evidence against a group of men with histories of violence and 
sexual assaults. 
</P>
<P>
	By June, with Yosemite's summer season in full swing, the FBI --  
without naming names -- assured the public that the key suspects 
were in custody on unrelated charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Stayner said, he found his next victim only a few  
miles from where the sightseers disappeared. Driving into a remote 
corner of the park, he encountered Ms. Armstrong alone at her cabin 
-- and felt the urge to kill again. 
</P>
<P>
	She fought back, and even escaped from his truck despite the  
duct tape that bound her. He chased her down and sliced off her 
head with ``a clean and forceful cut,'' authorities said. It was 
found the next day, submerged in a creek about 40 feet from the 
body. 
</P>
<P>
	Tire tracks and other evidence pointed to Stayner, who was  
questioned twice the day her body was found, and twice denied any 
involvement. Only after he failed to show up at work -- his first 
absence in months -- was he tracked down at a nudist colony and 
brought in to FBI headquarters. Then he began to talk -- and talk. 
</P>
<P>
	It was as if he was describing drinking a bottle of water, one  
task force member said, recalling how matter-of-fact and 
unemotional Stayner sounded. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner reenacted on videotape how he killed Ms. Armstrong and  
Juli, and led investigators to the knives he said he used. They 
still carried bloodstains and his fingerprints, authorities say. 
Agents also recovered pieces of duct tape, and the clothes he wore 
the night of the tourist killings. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner's willingness to talk about the killings disgusts the  
families of the victims and others who think he's just trying to 
get publicity. From jail, he has called television shows to talk 
about the murders. He told one reporter he hoped there would be a 
``movie of the week'' made about the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``My feeling is he's not worth talking about much,'' said Mrs.  
Sund's mother, Carole Carrington. ``I really don't want to hear 
about this guy anymore. I think he's out for notoriety, and I don't 
want to give it to him.''

<HEADLINE> Falcons Handle Life With No Jamal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUWANEE, Ga. (AP) -- The Atlanta Falcons are slowly coming to  
grips with the idea of life without Jamal Anderson. The NFC 
champions can only hope Chris Chandler won't be out much longer. 
</P>
<P>
	On the same day Anderson hobbled into the training complex,  
dragging along the injured right knee that will keep him out for 
the season, Chandler returned to the practice field with the hope 
of playing Sunday against the St. Louis Rams. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any time you miss a game, there's always pressure to get back  
in there,'' said Chandler, who didn't play in Monday night's loss 
to Dallas because of a strained hamstring. ``But yeah, it's a 
little more important now to get back on the field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Chandler returns, he won't be handing off to the guy who  
set an NFL record with 410 carries and a franchise mark with 1,846 
yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's upsetting, particularly with the way things are going for  
us as a team this season,'' Anderson said Wednesday, referring to 
an 0-2 start after leading the Falcons to an improbable Super Bowl 
last season. ``To go down like I did was terrible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Anderson finished for the year after suffering a torn  
anterior cruciate ligament on his third carry against the Cowboys, 
there is even more need for Chandler to make a hasty return to the 
lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	No. 2 quarterback Tony Graziani has yet to make it through an  
entire game during his three years in the NFL, getting pulled early 
in the third quarter at Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	``It feels a lot better than it felt last week,'' said Chandler,  
who looked a bit stiff, but took part in most of the drills. ``I'm 
very optimistic that if it continues to improve, I'll be good 
enough to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons talked bravely about carrying on without the player  
who defined their ball-control offense. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson carried an inordinate amount of the load last season,  
allowing Atlanta to lead the NFL in time of possession and keep its 
defense well rested. Counting 27 pass receptions, he had a direct 
hand in 44 percent of the Falcons' 993 plays. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jamal did some great things for this team last year, and we  
were expecting him to do great things this year,'' receiver Terance 
Mathis said. ``Now, we've got to rally together and help each other 
out. If you're not blocking, not running routes, not catching the 
ball, you're not going to be successful no matter who's running the 
ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the most part, the runner will be Byron Hanspard, a former  
2,000-yard rusher at Texas Tech who missed all of last season with 
a knee injury. He'll be supported by Ken Oxendine, a seventh-round 
draft pick in 1998 who has rushed for 50 yards in his career. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody needs an opportunity to see what they can do when a  
starter goes down,'' coach Dan Reeves said. ``I have tremendous 
confidence in Byron. I have tremendous confidence in Ken. Are they 
Jamal Anderson? No. But can they run certain plays well? Yes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest question concerning Hanspard is the state of his  
left knee. In the final exhibition game of 1998, he tore the ACL 
and patella tendon, requiring surgery and a full year to 
recuperate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still don't think he is 100 percent,'' Reeves said. ``Each  
week that he can go through and gain more confidence in that knee, 
the better football player he is going to be. We will see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After Anderson went down Monday -- crumpling to the ground after  
trying to make a cut with no one around him -- Hanspard ran a 
career-high 19 times for 76 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything is fine,'' he said. ``God has completely healed my  
knee. Yes, there's always room for it to get stronger, but I've not 
had any setbacks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hanspard won the Doak Walker Award as the nation's top college  
running back in 1996, when he had 2,084 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I need to carry the ball 33 times a game, I won't have a  
problem with that,'' Hanspard said. ``I've got to step up and be 
the man. That comes naturally for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson is expected to undergo surgery in a couple of weeks. He  
plans to be fully recovered by the start of offseason workouts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm setting a timetable to be 100 percent by December,'' he  
said. ``If not then, it won't be much longer than that. I'm already 
making bets with the trainers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, the Falcons will have to play with a weakened  
hand the rest of this season. They placed Anderson on injured 
reserve and signed 5-foot-7 Winslow Oliver, who was waived by 
Carolina at the end of training camp and won't be mistaken by 
anyone for the player he's replacing on the roster. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are the kind of things that cause the true character of  
your team to come out,'' defensive tackle Travis Hall said. ``When 
you lose one player, is that your team? I think we can rebound.''

<HEADLINE> 400 Richest in U.S. Top $1 Trillion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The soaring stock market helped land 60 new  
names on this year's list of the richest Americans, turning 35 of 
them into billionaires, according to Forbes magazine's latest 
ranking of the nation's wealthiest people. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the rookies, 19 made fortunes from Internet-related  
businesses, including Amazon.com chairman Jeffrey Bezos, ranked 
18th with a net worth of $7.8 billion. Jay Walker, founder of the 
online merchant Priceline.com, who was ranked 43rd with $4.1 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street also helped some on the list become billionaires  
almost overnight. No. 68 Gary Winnick joined the billionaires club 
just 18 months after founding Global Crossing, which is building a 
global fiber optic telecommunications network. 
</P>
<P>
	The 400 richest Americans for the first time have collectively  
amassed $1 trillion, a figure greater than the gross domestic 
product of China. 
</P>
<P>
	The total number of billionaires on the annual list increased by  
79 to 268, making 1999 the first time billionaires made up more 
than half the list, Forbes said in its issue dated Oct. 11. 
</P>
<P>
	The minimum net worth needed to qualify for the Forbes 400 rose  
to $625 million from $500 million in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Gates retained his place as the richest of them all. The  
Microsoft Corp. chairman saw his net worth saw to $85 billion, up 
from $59 billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Gates was twice as wealthy as the second richest American,  
Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, who has a net worth of $40 
billion. Warren Buffett, chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., 
ranked third with $31 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Ballmer, Microsoft's president was No. 4 with $23 billion,  
and No. 5 was Dell Computer chief executive officer Michael Dell, 
with $20 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	A college degree was not required to make the list -- at least 63  
members never graduated college and their net worth averaged was 
$4.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes said the 400 had an average net worth of $2.6 billion,  
which would give them a total worth around $1.04 trillion, up from 
$738 billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 40 percent of the list, or 149 members, got rich the easy  
way: They inherited some or all of their wealth. Their average net 
worth was $2.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The 251 members who made it rich on their own had an average net  
worth of $2.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The average age of Forbes 400 members was 60, with financier Max  
Fisher the oldest at 91 and Daniel Ziff, of Ziff Brothers 
Investments, the youngest at 27. 
</P>
<P>
	And nearly a quarter of the 400 live in California -- the state's  
98 members on the list include many Silicon Valley and other 
high-tech executives.

<HEADLINE> Badgers Kick Returner Back in Mich. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- Nick Davis comes from a town so small that  
the Michigan Wolverines couldn't see the nation's most exciting 
kick returner when he was right under their noses. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis grew up in tiny Manchester, Mich. The town of about 1,700  
residents sits 20 miles southwest of Ann Arbor, a speck in the 
shadow of Michigan Stadium, which seats more than 100,000. 
</P>
<P>
	After a spectacular high school career, he was Michigan's for  
the asking. But when the Wolverines didn't ask, he found a happy 
home at Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, a sophomore who is also the Badgers' leading receiver  
this season, admits he would love to show the Wolverines the error 
of their ways when 20th-ranked Wisconsin plays host to No. 4 
Michigan on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole town of Manchester is going to be over here,  
probably,'' he said with a bashful grin. ``It's an incentive, let's 
just say that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After three games, Davis ranks third in the nation with 19.5  
yards per punt return and fifth with 35.8 yards per kickoff return. 
He's the only player in the country in the top 10 in both 
categories, and he already has one touchdown on each type of 
return. 
</P>
<P>
	His kick returns are so drastically shortening the field for the  
Badgers that they've become a slight impediment to Ron Dayne's 
chances to break the national rushing record. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're getting great field position, and that usually means  
fewer carries for Ron,'' Wisconsin coach Barry Alvarez said. 
``That's a problem a coach doesn't mind having too much. We're very 
pleased with Nick's work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis grew up longing to play in Michigan's maize and blue. As a  
running back in high school, he amassed more than 6,900 all-purpose 
yards and 69 touchdowns. Early on, however, he suspected he had a 
talent for returning kicks, and he hoped the Wolverines would see 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was so interested in Michigan that I didn't really pay  
attention to any other Big Ten schools,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan seemed keenly interested in him at first, but Davis'  
stock fell with the Wolverines after they won a share of the 1997 
national championship. The athletic, average-sized kid from a small 
Michigan town didn't fit the mold of a typical major-college kick 
returner. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every time you have something like that in a program, you get  
your top choices of recruits, and I kept sliding down their list,'' 
he recalled. ``They told me that I'd better start looking 
elsewhere, so I did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin and Michigan State showed interest, but only the  
Badgers promised him an immediate chance to return kicks. He came 
to Madison as a running back, but converted to receiver when 
Alvarez said he'd have a better chance to play right away. 
</P>
<P>
	``We put him back there, and it was pretty obvious he was  
something special,'' Alvarez said. ``You're just happy when you see 
a kid with a knack for something like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After less than 1 1/2 seasons, Davis is emerging as the kind of  
kick returner who alters entire game plans. He grew up admiring the 
Green Bay Packers' Desmond Howard, who won the Heisman Trophy at 
Michigan and has caused similar problems for opponents throughout 
his career. 
</P>
<P>
	``Good punters know how to hang the ball up really high,'' he  
said. ``If you have a good punter, then a returner is no problem, 
but there are some circumstances when I wouldn't kick to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In three games, he also has seven catches for 147 yards. He has  
463 all-purpose yards, more than any Badgers player except Dayne. 
Davis would have even more if a beautiful 81-yard punt return for a 
touchdown last week against Cincinnati hadn't been called back on a 
penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever his fortunes, Davis will always have the support of his  
hometown. Manchester held a Nick Davis Day during his freshman 
season, when he led the Big Ten in punt returns. 
</P>
<P>
	His parents have a satellite hookup to watch Wisconsin games,  
but they'll be in attendance at Camp Randall Stadium on Saturday -- 
along with a few hundred friends.

<HEADLINE> FBI Faults Justice Over Fund Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A bitter FBI-Justice Department conflict over  
tactics in a campaign fund-raising investigation is getting aired 
publicly before a Senate committee, and the panel's chairman 
indicates there's more to come. 
</P>
<P>
	After FBI agents and the former lead prosecutor in the probe  
criticized each other at a hearing Wednesday, Sen. Fred Thompson, 
R-Tenn., threatened additional hearings to learn why 27 pages of 
notes -- focusing on the dispute -- were ripped from an agent's 
notebook. The notes remain missing. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Janet Reno said today, ``We have just got to  
check and see just what happened ... but I don't know of any basis 
for concluding there is an obstruction of justice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three agents assigned to the probe of illegal fund-raising in  
President Clinton's re-election campaign -- and a retired FBI 
supervisor -- told the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee that 
Justice Department prosecutors impeded their work in the 
investigation of presidential friend -- and Democratic donor -- Yah 
Lin ``Charlie'' Trie. 
</P>
<P>
	Countering the testimony, Laura Ingersoll, a Justice Department  
attorney who was the first lead prosecutor in the investigation, 
criticized the agents' work. She has since been replaced in the 
probe, but remains with the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI agent Roberta Parker testified that during the height of the  
dispute over tactics in the summer of 1997, she turned her personal 
notebooks over to FBI superiors because Thompson's panel and a 
House committee sought information on the rift. When the notes were 
returned, she said, the 27 pages were missing -- and could only have 
been torn the spiral-bound book. 
</P>
<P>
	The testimony spotlighted the bitter internal disagreements in  
the investigation of donations to the 1996 Clinton-Gore campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Disagreement over the investigation caused friction between Reno  
and FBI Director Louis Freeh. Reno eventually rejected the 
director's conclusion that an independent counsel should be 
appointed. 
</P>
<P>
	Disputing Reno's oft-quoted assertions of a vigorous  
investigation, FBI agent Daniel Wehr told the committee that 
Ingersoll told the agents they should ``not pursue any matter 
related to solicitation of funds for access to the president. The 
reason given was, 'That's the way the American political process 
works.' I was scandalized by that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, federal election and bribery laws make it a crime for  
officials to accept money or contributions in return for government 
decisions, but not in return for spending time in the official's 
presence. 
</P>
<P>
	Wehr, Parker and agent Kevin Sheridan are still assigned to the  
investigation and worked on the case of Trie, who pleaded guilty to 
campaign finance violations. Besides the three agents, the 
committee heard from Ivian C. Smith, the retired agent who headed 
the Little Rock, Ark., FBI office. 
</P>
<P>
	The four contended that Ms. Ingersoll prevented the FBI from  
executing search warrants to stop destruction of evidence and 
micromanaged the case beyond all reason. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ms. Ingersoll testified there was ``no smoking gun'' in  
documents the FBI discovered in the trash of Trie and a business 
associate -- records which, the agents concluded, should have been 
the basis for search warrants of the subjects' residences. 
</P>
<P>
	Explaining her rejection of the search warrant request in the  
summer of 1997, Ms. Ingersoll said, ``Nothing we saw indicated to 
us'' that there was ``anything incriminating'' in the documents. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the FBI's proposed search warrant affidavit lacked any  
description of how the records were relevant. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't know what the documents were. The agents didn't  
bring us what these documents actually were. I would have wanted 
them (the search warrant justifications) to be fuller and more 
complete. The search warrant affidavit was far from being finalized 
... to be presented to a magistrate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson, who led the committees' campaign finance inquiry in  
1997, appeared upset by Ms. Ingersoll's answers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not talking about trying to electrocute someone,''  
Thompson said. ``We're talking about getting ... to an independent 
magistrate. It does not have to be a smoking gun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parker testified that Ms. Ingersoll told the agents the  
department ``would not take into consideration'' evidence involving 
President Clinton's legal defense fund and obstruction of the 
Senate's investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, the retired FBI supervisor, told the committee he was  
``quite astounded at the type of documents being destroyed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The committee released a memo by Smith, dated Aug. 4, 1997, to  
Freeh that bitterly complained about the prosecutors. He expressed 
``a lack of confidence'' in department attorneys, adding, ``I am 
convinced the team at DOJ leading this investigation is, at best, 
simply not up to the task.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The impression left is the emphasis on how not to prosecute  
matters, not how to aggressively conduct investigations leading to 
prosecutions,'' the memo said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno said the current head of the campaign finance task force,  
David Vicinanzo, ``is phasing out'' of the job and officials are 
discussing his replacement, but she denied the task force is 
winding down. ``The investigatory mechanism is still ongoing and we 
will follow every lead,'' Reno said today.

<HEADLINE> Rite Aid To Close Utah Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Rite Aid Corp. plans to close a Utah  
distribution center in mid-2000, cutting 500 jobs, the company 
announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials for drugstore chain said they are shifting their West  
Coast distribution network to a new, 1-million-square-foot facility 
in Lancaster, Calf. The new building will serve almost 1,000 
stores, including the 450 now reached by the Ogden facility that's 
been closed. 
</P>
<P>
	Rite Aid managers met with their 500 Ogden employees Thursday to  
explain the planned shutdown and present them with severance 
packages, which include incentives for people who agree to work 
until they are released from their positions. 
</P>
<P>
	The shutdown will begin in March 2000 and continue into the  
middle of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Rite Aid, based in Camp Hill, Pa., has posted a disappointing  
financial performance in the past year, including a 39 percent drop 
in quarterly earnings reported in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts have predicted the company will sell several  
hundred of its West Coast stores, which, along with the Ogden 
distribution center, were acquired from Thrifty Payless in 1996. 
Overall, Rite Aid has 4,000 stores in 30 states.

<HEADLINE> Buchanan: McCain Told 'Vicious Lie' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Presidential candidate Pat Buchanan accused  
rival John McCain today of ``a vicious and damnable lie'' in 
suggesting the conservative commentator thought it was not a noble 
cause to defeat Germany and Japan in World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan said on NBC's ``Today'' that he never suggested it was  
not a noble cause to oppose the two countries, just that Britain 
had effectively negated Hitler as a threat to the West before the 
United States entered the war against Hitler. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is evident to me by Pat Buchanan's own rhetoric that he has  
left the Republican Party,'' McCain said in a statement Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement added: ``Defeating Hitler's Germany and Tojo's  
Japan was a very noble cause. And I wouldn't want any Republican to 
ever think otherwise -- or any American for that matter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan and McCain are among the candidates for the Republican  
presidential nomination. Buchanan says he will decide by 
mid-October whether to leave the GOP and seek the nomination of the 
Reform Party. 
</P>
<P>
	While McCain's statement did not specifically say Buchanan had  
questioned the nobility of the cause, the Arizona senator said: 
``Regardless of what the polls show, our party must stand on 
principle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan said today he was disappointed McCain did not appear to  
make charges against him face-to-face. 
</P>
<P>
	``To suggest that I think the butchers who attacked and murdered  
our men in their beds at Pearl Harbor should not have been defeated 
and crushed and that that was not a noble cause ... is a vicious 
and damnable lie,'' said Buchanan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course it was a noble cause'' to defeat Hitler, he added.  
``The point about Hitler that in late 1940 he had lost the battle 
of Britain. The English Royal Force had air superiority over the 
(English) Channel. Hitler could not invade the United States if he 
couldn't even invade England.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A third Republican presidential candidate, Elizabeth Dole, tried  
to stand clear of the verbal fireworks between McCain and Buchanan 
during an appearance today on ABC's ``Good Morning America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But she made clear she does not agree with Buchanan's views on  
World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	``I certainly do not understand those comments. I was amazed by  
that. ... I think he has to make up his mind whether or not he's 
going to stay within the party. If he stays within the party, then 
the party will determine whether or not they want him as their 
nominee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his new book, ``A Republic, Not an Empire,'' Buchanan  
contends that Hitler was not a direct threat to the United States 
after 1940. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hitler's real ambitions lay in carving out an empire in the  
East. ... He had given up the idea of global empire,'' Buchanan 
wrote. The frequent critic of U.S. intervention overseas also said 
the United States was right to fight in Europe after Germany 
declared war.

<HEADLINE>  Actor George C. Scott Dead at 71 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- George C. Scott, the forbidding-looking,  
gravel-voiced actor who turned in an Oscar-winning performance as 
the profane and patriotic Gen. George S. Patton, and then declined 
the honor, has died at 71. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott died Wednesday of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm at  
his home 40 miles northwest of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	With his imperious presence, curled lip, animated eyebrows and  
the broken-nose profile of a Roman consul, Scott seemed born to 
play the role of the legendary World War II general in ``Patton'' 
in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
	But his memorable roles also included Gen. Buck Turgidson, the  
fatuous blowhard in Stanley Kubrick's ``Dr. Strangelove''; the 
pool-hall bookie who menaces Paul Newman in ``The Hustler''; the 
high-powered ringer who worked to destroy small-town lawyer James 
Stewart in ``Anatomy of a Murder''; and the dedicated doctor 
surrounded by incompetence in ``The Hospital.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He made every actor proud to say that they were in the same  
profession,'' said actor Jack Lemmon. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott dismissed moviemaking as tedious and said he only made  
films for the money. ``I have to work in the theater to stay 
sane,'' he once said. ``You can attack the stage fresh every 
night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He made his Broadway debut in ``Comes a Day'' in 1958, quickly  
earning his first of four Tony nominations. The others were for 
``The Andersonville Trial'' in 1959, ``Uncle Vanya'' in 1974 and 
``Death of a Salesman'' in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	He also won three Emmys -- the most recent last year as a  
supporting actor in a remake of ``12 Angry Men'' -- and was 
nominated for four Oscars. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the award he wouldn't accept, the Oscar for ``Patton,''  
that cemented his reputation as a Hollywood outsider. 
</P>
<P>
	He had been nominated for ``Anatomy of a Murder'' in 1959 and  
said nothing about it. But then he tried to decline the nomination 
for ``The Hustler'' in 1962, calling the Academy Awards a 
meaningless popularity contest. 
</P>
<P>
	When he was nominated for ``Patton,'' he again tried to drop  
out, dismissing the awards as a ``meat parade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh my God!'' Oscar presenter Goldie Hawn exclaimed that night.  
``The winner is George C. Scott!'' As the film collected seven 
Academy Awards, Scott spent the evening watching hockey. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his very public snub, Scott was nominated the following  
year for ``The Hospital.'' He didn't win. 
</P>
<P>
	In private life, Scott was a bellicose drinker whose nose was  
broken five times in four barroom brawls and one mugging. He was 
married five times -- twice to the same woman, actress Colleen 
Dewhurst. 
</P>
<P>
	Interviewers told of meeting a loud, intimidating man who would  
answer his phone by shouting, ``Who the hell is it?'' He could be 
friendly one moment and dismiss a question as idiotic the next. 
</P>
<P>
	When he appeared in the play ``Plaza Suite'' in 1968, co-star  
Maureen Stapleton reportedly told director Mike Nichols at 
rehearsal: ``I'm so frightened of George, I don't know what to 
do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``My dear,'' Nichols replied, ``the whole world is frightened of  
George.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The actress, contacted Thursday, said she was too shocked by the  
news to talk about Scott. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Wise, Va., on Oct. 18, 1927, Scott was raised in  
Detroit. After joining the Marines in 1945, too late for action in 
World War II, he spent the next four years burying the dead at 
Arlington by day and boozing at night. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't look at that many widows in veils and hear that many  
taps without taking to drink,'' he once said. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Marines, he enrolled at the University of Missouri,  
intending to become a journalist. But he was captivated by acting 
after he tried out for a school play. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll never forget that day,'' he said in 1985. ``I was  
terrified when I went on, and I was certain I'd been terrible.'' 
Then, as he was leaving the stage, the head of the drama department 
approached and said, ``You're good. Where have you been?'' 
</P>
<P>
	He later came to the attention of Joseph Papp, the impresario of  
the New York Shakespeare Festival. In rapid succession in 1957-58, 
he appeared in ``Richard III,'' ``As You Like It'' and ``Children 
of Darkness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For his work in all three productions he received the  
off-Broadway best actor Obie and a Theatre World award as a 
``promising personality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Early marriages to Carolyn Hughes and Patricia Reed produced two  
daughters, Victoria and Devon, and a son, Matthew. Scott also 
acknowledged a child born out of wedlock during his school years. 
</P>
<P>
	He met Ms. Dewhurst when they appeared together in ``Children of  
Darkness'' and they were married in 1960, divorced in 1965, 
remarried in 1967 and divorced in 1972. They had two sons, 
Alexander and Campbell, himself an actor. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott then married actress Trish Van Devere in 1972.

<HEADLINE> Wolverines Must Slow 'Great Dayne' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- If Ron Dayne is serious about winning the  
Heisman Trophy, Saturday's game against Michigan would be a good 
time to start proving it. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin's senior tailback has been solid but unspectacular  
after three games, during which he moved into sixth place on the 
career rushing list but was unable last weekend to prevent the 
Badgers from suffering an embarrassing loss to Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	He has been good, but he'll have to be great at some point in  
order to win the big trophy. His first real test comes Saturday in 
the 20th-ranked Badgers' Big Ten Conference opener against No. 4 
Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm looking at it as a big game for me and for the team,''  
Dayne said. ``After losing last week, we have something to make up 
for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The stage is set for Dayne to have a breakout game. With no  
other marquee matchups on the college football schedule this week, 
the eyes of Heisman voters will be focused on Camp Randall Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	That is where Dayne will try to solve the Wolverines' solid  
defense and deflate the criticism that he doesn't perform in big 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	Dayne plays at about 252 pounds. That makes him heavier than  
seven starters on Michigan's defense but the Wolverines (3-0), 
fresh off a strong performance at Syracuse, say they can stop him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I admit, once he gets going, it's a struggle to bring him  
down,'' senior linebacker Ian Gold said. ``But the bigger they are, 
the harder they fall. We'll go for his legs. It's that simple.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last week's 17-12 loss at Cincinnati was the only reminder the  
Badgers (2-1) should ever need that Dayne cannot carry the team to 
victory alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Dayne racked up 231 yards but he also fumbled in the Bearcats'  
end zone, his first turnover in 336 carries. 
</P>
<P>
	Dayne missed several series while nursing a first-quarter  
sprained ankle. He said the injury won't limit him against 
Michigan, the team that held him to a season-worst 53 yards in 
Wisconsin's only loss last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ron's been scrutinized more than any athlete, particularly  
here,'' Wisconsin offensive coordinator Brian White said. ``Every 
game's a litmus test for the Heisman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Badgers enter the Big Ten season reeling from unforgivably  
sloppy (Dayne's fumble) and stupid (two touchdowns were negated by 
penalties) play. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Badgers say the game will jump-start the team.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think it was a good thing because it woke us up,'' kick  
returner and wide receiver Nick Davis said. ``The beast is alive. 
The sleeping giant is alive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite their undefeated record and lofty ranking, the  
Wolverines are dealing with the puzzling disappearance of their 
offense, particularly their running game. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan averaged just 155.4 rushing yards per game last season,  
the school's lowest average since 1963. The Wolverines have just 
377 rushing yards this year, including a dismal 121 on 36 attempts 
against Syracuse. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course the Badgers let Michigan accumulate a season-high 257  
yards on the ground during the Wolverines' 27-10 win over Wisconsin 
in Ann Arbor last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Tailback Anthony Thomas rushed for 102 yards against the Badgers  
last year and 97 last week against Syracuse but no solid second 
option has emerged in the Michigan backfield. 
</P>
<P>
	That lack of depth could be a problem against the Badgers, whose  
rapidly improving defense would love to make its reputation against 
Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to stop the run,'' Wisconsin defensive coordinator  
Kevin Cosgrove said. ``That's one of the things we didn't do 
against them last year. We did a poor job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan coach Lloyd Carr said his quarterback rotation will  
continue with senior Tom Brady starting and sophomore Drew Henson 
relieving. 
</P>
<P>
	The Badgers likely will continue their rotation as well, with  
senior quarterback Scott Kavanagh and freshman Brooks Bollinger, 
who was benched in Cincinnati, both seeing time.

<HEADLINE>  Sotheby's Begins Baseball Auction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Step right up, folks. The most breathtaking  
collection of baseball memorabilia imaginable, everything from Moe 
Berg's spy camera to Bill Buckner's faulty glove, is up for bid 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
	One word of caution. Bring a checkbook and be prepared to write  
a lot of zeros. Barry Halper's stuff is not cheap. The entire 
collection is estimated between $7 million and $11 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think that's a bit conservative,'' said David Goodwillie,  
who heads the sports collectibles department at Sotheby's Auction 
House. ``We wouldn't be surprised if it reaches $15 million or 
more. So much of it is unique, pieces that have never been sold 
before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Thursday night's opening session of the week-long auction was  
any indication, the figures could go even higher. The first 130 
items were sold for a total of $2,073,763, far above the high 
estimate of $1,334,700. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am thrilled with tonight's sales results -- a perfect game,''  
Halper said. ``I look forward to the next fifteen sessions with 
anticipation and delight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The item that drew the highest bid Thursday -- $107,000 -- was the  
bat used by Babe Ruth during his farewell appearance at Yankee 
Stadium on June 13, 1948. It was bought by two sports memorabilia 
dealers from Chicago, Dave Bushing and Don Knoll. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruth, who was dying of cancer, leaned on the bat for support  
during the ceremony. He died two months later. 
</P>
<P>
	A sheet of 15 autographs from every player who hit 500 homers  
except Mark McGwire was sold for $57,500 to Marty Bandier of EMI 
Music Publishing. 
</P>
<P>
	About 20 percent of Halper's collection was purchased by major  
league baseball for $6 million and is now housed at the Hall of 
Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y. The remainder is to be auctioned by 
Sotheby's over the next week. 
</P>
<P>
	More accustomed to handling estate sales of art and furniture,  
the auction house needed two floors of its Manhattan building to 
house the Halper collection. 
</P>
<P>
	The whole operation is watched over by a larger-than-life wax  
figure of Babe Ruth, listed from $3,500 to $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
	There's a framed display of canceled paychecks for the 1920  
Cincinnati Reds. Their most expensive player was Hall of Famer Edd 
Roush, who was getting a fancy $425 every two weeks. He batted 
.339, third in the National League, that season. 
</P>
<P>
	One customer, awed by the number of items on display, said of  
Halper, ``He must have a very understanding wife.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He'd have to just to accommodate the uniform jerseys that cover  
three walls at Sotheby's and rode on a dry cleaning rack in the 
basement of his home. 
</P>
<P>
	The jerseys include one from home run king Hank Aaron that's  
inscribed, ``I hit a few in this,'' and another identified as among 
those Pete Rose wore the night he broke Ty Cobb's hit record. If 
you prefer something straight from Cobb, his dentures are 
available. 
</P>
<P>
	In another corner are first baseman Buckner's glove and cleats  
from the sixth game of the 1986 World Series. Buckner's 10th inning 
error enabled the New York Mets to beat Boston and the Mets went on 
to win the Series in seven games. 
</P>
<P>
	The glove is accompanied by a card from Buckner to Halper which  
contains a misspelling. It says: ``To my pal, Barry. This glove has 
way to many holes in it. This is the glove I wore when I missed 
Mookie Wilson's ground ball in the sixth game. What a nightmare.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Berg's spy camera dates to a 1934 barnstorming trip through  
Japan when the mysterious catcher was frequently missing from the 
other players, off taking reconnaissance pictures for the United 
States government that proved helpful when World War II began. 
</P>
<P>
	The most expensive item for sale is a collection of 16 World  
Series rings from former New York Yankees owner Del Webb, a 
co-owner of the team during its dynasty years of 1947-64. They are 
listed from $100,000 to $200,000 in the two-volume Sotheby's 
catalog, which costs $80. 
</P>
<P>
	About 2,500 lots will be up for sale during the auction, which  
will continue through Sept. 29. Another 5,500 pieces, most of them 
priced under $1,000, will go on sale at Sotheby's Internet site, 
which will be launched in November. There is a 15 percent buyer's 
premium for items up to $50,000 and 10 percent after that. 
</P>
<P>
	Halper, a Livingston, N.J., businessman and minority owner of  
the Yankees, began his collection simply with player autographs. It 
just grew from there. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodwillie, who spent two years after college playing Class-A  
baseball at Newark, Ohio, said, ``Barry never asked me for my 
autograph.''

<HEADLINE>  Sotheby's Begins Baseball Auction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Step right up, folks. The most breathtaking  
collection of baseball memorabilia imaginable, everything from Moe 
Berg's spy camera to Bill Buckner's faulty glove, is up for bid 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
	One word of caution. Bring a checkbook and be prepared to write  
a lot of zeros. Barry Halper's stuff is not cheap. The entire 
collection is estimated between $7 million and $11 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think that's a bit conservative,'' said David Goodwillie,  
who heads the sports collectibles department at Sotheby's Auction 
House. ``We wouldn't be surprised if it reaches $15 million or 
more. So much of it is unique, pieces that have never been sold 
before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Thursday night's opening session of the week-long auction was  
any indication, the figures could go even higher. The first 130 
items were sold for a total of $2,073,763, far above the high 
estimate of $1,334,700. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am thrilled with tonight's sales results -- a perfect game,''  
Halper said. ``I look forward to the next fifteen sessions with 
anticipation and delight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The item that drew the highest bid Thursday -- $107,000 -- was the  
bat used by Babe Ruth during his farewell appearance at Yankee 
Stadium on June 13, 1948. It was bought by two sports memorabilia 
dealers from Chicago, Dave Bushing and Don Knoll. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruth, who was dying of cancer, leaned on the bat for support  
during the ceremony. He died two months later. 
</P>
<P>
	A sheet of 15 autographs from every player who hit 500 homers  
except Mark McGwire was sold for $57,500 to Marty Bandier of EMI 
Music Publishing. 
</P>
<P>
	About 20 percent of Halper's collection was purchased by major  
league baseball for $6 million and is now housed at the Hall of 
Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y. The remainder is to be auctioned by 
Sotheby's over the next week. 
</P>
<P>
	More accustomed to handling estate sales of art and furniture,  
the auction house needed two floors of its Manhattan building to 
house the Halper collection. 
</P>
<P>
	The whole operation is watched over by a larger-than-life wax  
figure of Babe Ruth, listed from $3,500 to $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
	There's a framed display of canceled paychecks for the 1920  
Cincinnati Reds. Their most expensive player was Hall of Famer Edd 
Roush, who was getting a fancy $425 every two weeks. He batted 
.339, third in the National League, that season.

<HEADLINE> Blissfull Hall Wins Brown Jug Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DELAWARE, Ohio (AP) -- Less than an hour after fading down the  
stretch to lose his first shot at winning, Blissfull Hall redeemed 
himself with a strong closing quarter to take the Little Brown Jug 
in a raceoff Thursday and move within a win of capturing pacing's 
triple crown. 
</P>
<P>
	Blissfull Hall, winner of the Cane Pace earlier this month at  
Freehold, N.J., shoots for the triple crown and a $250,000 bonus in 
the Messenger Stakes on Oct. 16 at The Meadows at Meadow Lands, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second year in a row Ron Pierce drove the Little  
Brown Jug winner. A year ago, he got a late gift when Mike Lachance 
elected to drive Artiscape in the second heat instead of favored 
Shady Character. Pierce was given the ride and ended up winning 
while Artiscape finished fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	Blissfull Hall coasted to victory in the first elimination in  
1:53, winning a showdown with leading money-winner The Panderosa. 
The Panderosa broke stride in the first few seconds and finished 
last. 
</P>
<P>
	In the second heat, which in the Little Brown Jug format brings  
back the top three finishers in each of the first three 
eliminations, Pierce took Blissfull Hall to the rail early and 
appeared to be in command heading into the stretch of the one-mile 
race at Delaware County Fairgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
	But Blissfull Hall faded badly and dropped to third behind upset  
winner Looking For Art, driven by Ohio native Eric Ledford in his 
Jug debut. Ledford and his wife, Tammy, are expecting their first 
child and he carried a pager with him throughout the day in case he 
was summoned back to his home in Chicago for the birth. 
</P>
<P>
	A horse must win two heats in the Jug's quirky format and  
Looking For Art's stunning victory forced the four horses who had 
won races to come back in a raceoff to decide the Jug winner. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first raceoff since Fake Left needed a third heat to  
win in 1992 and only the second in the last 21 years. There have 
been eight raceoffs in the Jug's 54 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Pierce bided his time, holding Blissfull Hall in third or fourth  
place until going wide on the last turn. The Cambest colt, who had 
lost the lead at the same spot an hour earlier in the second heat, 
pulled away down the stretch to win in 1:55 3-5 by a length over 
Looking For Art. The victory was worth $127,834 to owner Daniel 
Plouffe. Ohio Gov. Robert Taft presented the Little Brown Jug 
trophy to Plouffe, who owns a string of grocery stores in Quebec. 
</P>
<P>
	Blissfull Hall has won 10 races, with two seconds and a third in  
14 starts. 
</P>
<P>
	A victory in the Messenger would make Blissfull Hall the ninth  
winner of the triple crown for pacing 3-year-olds and the second 
since Ralph Hanover in 1983. Western Dreamer won all three legs in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jug was again a huge disappointment for owner Jeffrey S.  
Snyder. 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder had to scratch Jug favorite Cam's Card Shark moments  
before post time five years ago. He erased some of that hurt by 
sending all three of his entries to the second heat -- each with Luc 
Ouellette in the sulky -- and even had half of the four-horse field 
in the raceoff. Yet he still came up empty. 
</P>
<P>
	Ledford qualified three horses for the second heat -- one from  
each elimination -- before winning behind Looking For Art. Looking 
For Art actually won more money on the day than Blissfull Hall 
($202,904) because the second heat had the biggest purse.

<HEADLINE>  Actor George C. Scott Dead at 71 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- George C. Scott, the forbidding-looking,  
gravel-voiced actor who turned in an Oscar-winning performance as 
the profane and patriotic Gen. George S. Patton, and then declined 
the honor, has died at 71. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott died Wednesday of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm at  
his home 40 miles northwest of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	With his imperious presence, curled lip, animated eyebrows and  
the broken-nose profile of a Roman consul, Scott seemed born to 
play the role of the legendary World War II general in ``Patton'' 
in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
	But his memorable roles also included Gen. Buck Turgidson, the  
fatuous blowhard in Stanley Kubrick's ``Dr. Strangelove''; the 
pool-hall bookie who menaces Paul Newman in ``The Hustler''; the 
high-powered ringer who worked to destroy small-town lawyer James 
Stewart in ``Anatomy of a Murder''; and the dedicated doctor 
surrounded by incompetence in ``The Hospital.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He made every actor proud to say that they were in the same  
profession,'' said actor Jack Lemmon. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott dismissed moviemaking as tedious and said he only made  
films for the money. ``I have to work in the theater to stay 
sane,'' he once said. ``You can attack the stage fresh every 
night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He made his Broadway debut in ``Comes a Day'' in 1958, quickly  
earning his first of four Tony nominations. The others were for 
``The Andersonville Trial'' in 1959, ``Uncle Vanya'' in 1974 and 
``Death of a Salesman'' in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	He also won three Emmys -- the most recent last year as a  
supporting actor in a remake of ``12 Angry Men'' -- and was 
nominated for four Oscars. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the award he wouldn't accept, the Oscar for ``Patton,''  
that cemented his reputation as a Hollywood outsider. 
</P>
<P>
	He had been nominated for ``Anatomy of a Murder'' in 1959 and  
said nothing about it. But then he tried to decline the nomination 
for ``The Hustler'' in 1962, calling the Academy Awards a 
meaningless popularity contest. 
</P>
<P>
	When he was nominated for ``Patton,'' he again tried to drop  
out, dismissing the awards as a ``meat parade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh my God!'' Oscar presenter Goldie Hawn exclaimed that night.  
``The winner is George C. Scott!'' As the film collected seven 
Academy Awards, Scott spent the evening watching hockey. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his very public snub, Scott was nominated the following  
year for ``The Hospital.'' He didn't win. 
</P>
<P>
	In private life, Scott was a bellicose drinker whose nose was  
broken five times in four barroom brawls and one mugging. He was 
married five times -- twice to the same woman, actress Colleen 
Dewhurst. 
</P>
<P>
	Interviewers told of meeting a loud, intimidating man who would  
answer his phone by shouting, ``Who the hell is it?'' He could be 
friendly one moment and dismiss a question as idiotic the next. 
</P>
<P>
	When he appeared in the play ``Plaza Suite'' in 1968, co-star  
Maureen Stapleton reportedly told director Mike Nichols at 
rehearsal: ``I'm so frightened of George, I don't know what to 
do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``My dear,'' Nichols replied, ``the whole world is frightened of  
George.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The actress, contacted Thursday, said she was too shocked by the  
news to talk about Scott. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Wise, Va., on Oct. 18, 1927, Scott was raised in  
Detroit. After joining the Marines in 1945, too late for action in 
World War II, he spent the next four years burying the dead at 
Arlington by day and boozing at night. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't look at that many widows in veils and hear that many  
taps without taking to drink,'' he once said. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Marines, he enrolled at the University of Missouri,  
intending to become a journalist. But he was captivated by acting 
after he tried out for a school play. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll never forget that day,'' he said in 1985. ``I was  
terrified when I went on, and I was certain I'd been terrible.'' 
Then, as he was leaving the stage, the head of the drama department 
approached and said, ``You're good. Where have you been?'' 
</P>
<P>
	He later came to the attention of Joseph Papp, the impresario of  
the New York Shakespeare Festival. In rapid succession in 1957-58, 
he appeared in ``Richard III,'' ``As You Like It'' and ``Children 
of Darkness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For his work in all three productions he received the  
off-Broadway best actor Obie and a Theatre World award as a 
``promising personality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Early marriages to Carolyn Hughes and Patricia Reed produced two  
daughters, Victoria and Devon, and a son, Matthew. Scott also 
acknowledged a child born out of wedlock during his school years. 
</P>
<P>
	He met Ms. Dewhurst when they appeared together in ``Children of  
Darkness'' and they were married in 1960, divorced in 1965, 
remarried in 1967 and divorced in 1972. They had two sons, 
Alexander and Campbell, himself an actor. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott then married actress Trish Van Devere in 1972.

<HEADLINE> Crude Oil Price Hits 33-Month High  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Crude oil futures rocketed to a 33-month high Thursday on the  
New York Mercantile Exchange and other energy products joined the 
upward ride in continuing momentum from OPEC's decision to extend 
production cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	In other markets, soybean futures fell sharply amid good  
harvesting weather and gold continued its rally. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude came within a penny of reaching $25 a barrel for the first  
time since Feb. 1, 1997, before slipping back slightly. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said some profit-taking is likely in the near future,  
but otherwise the path is clear for the upward rise in prices to 
continue. 
</P>
<P>
	The market had factored in well ahead of time Wednesday's move  
by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to maintain 
production cuts through next March in an effort to draw down world 
supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	But bullishness remains rampant, and the market also got support  
Thursday from the previous day's news that Russia will suspend fuel 
oil exports until Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``This event was completely anticipated,'' Bill O'Grady, energy  
analyst at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in St. Louis, said of the OPEC 
decision in Vienna, Austria. ``But there's still money on the 
sidelines that wanted to buy crude oil but wanted to wait until 
that meeting was out of the way, just to be safe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rise in crude powered a sharp increase in heating oil, and  
analysts cited that in turn as igniting a takeoff in natural gas 
because it suddenly became a cheaper alternative to heating oil. 
Natural gas prices increased 10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are real bullish on natural gas,'' said O'Grady. ``They  
are convinced that we're going to have a delivery problem this 
winter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gasoline futures surged after the American Petroleum Institute  
reported an 8.9 million barrel-a-day increase in U.S. demand last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	West Texas intermediate crude oil for November delivery settled  
up 75 cents at $24.87; October heating oil rose 1.94 cents to 62.15 
cents a gallon; October unleaded regular gasoline rose 1.69 cents 
to 71.53 cents a gallon; natural gas rose 27.1 cents to $2.697 per 
1,000 cubic feet. 
</P>
<P>
	In London, North Sea Brent crude oil rose 89 cents to $23.82 on  
the International Petroleum Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Ideal harvest weather throughout the soybean belt sent soybean  
prices down by 1.5 percent to its lowest level this month. 
Investors said the trend was likely to continue Friday, with the 
harvest expected to accelerate this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders predicted the price would continue falling on Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's awfully good weather and there's good harvest progress,''  
said Gary Wilhelmi, an independent analyst and market commentator 
at the Chicago Board of Trade. ``Next week could be a little wetter 
but there's no threat'' of flooding or a widespread killer frost. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans for November delivery fell 7 1/4 cents to $4.78 a bushel;  
December corn fell 2 cents to $2.08 1/4 cents a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold jumped to a three-month high, still buoyed by Tuesday's  
auction of British gold reserves for slightly above-market prices, 
an event that started the rally. 
</P>
<P>
	The continued strength in the yen against the dollar also  
underpinned the gold market. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold futures rose $1.80 on the Comex division of the New York  
Mercantile Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Raptors Sign Muggsy Bogues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Muggsy Bogues said his decision to sign with the  
Toronto Raptors was not a difficult one. 
</P>
<P>
	Bogues signed a one-year contract Thursday with the Raptors,  
reportedly worth $1 million, the minimum for an NBA player with 10 
or more seasons of experience. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's all about winning, attitude and preparing yourself,'' the  
5-foot-3 Bogues said. ``Guys like (Charles) Oakley, Kevin Willis, 
Antonio Davis, Dell Curry, Dee Brown, Vince Carter and Tracy 
McGrady, they're all quality people. I like what the Raptors are 
doing and that was a very easy decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bogues, a 12-year NBA veteran, averaged 5.1 points and 3.7  
assists per game in 36 regular-season games last year with the 
Golden State Warriors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Muggsy has always been a very exciting player in this league  
and our fans will really enjoy watching him,'' said Raptors general 
manager Glen Grunwald. ``He brings veteran experience to the team 
at the point-guard position and we feel that he and Alvin Williams 
will make a great tandem, combining youth and experience and both 
bringing great athleticism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bogues was a first-round selection (12th overall) by the  
Washington Bullets in 1987. In his NBA career, Bogues has averaged 
8 points and 8 assists in 806 games and is the league's career 
leader in assist-to-turnover ratio (4.69).

<HEADLINE> Sampling of Clinton's Vetoes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The tax-cut veto was President Clinton's 26th. A sampling:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Nov. 13, 1995: Clinton vetoed a bill that would have  
temporarily extended the government's ability to borrow money 
beyond the debt limit. The veto led to a standoff with Congress 
over balancing the budget that resulted in a government shutdown. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Jan. 9, 1996: He vetoed a GOP welfare overhaul that would have  
replaced Aid to Families with Dependent Children with block grants 
to states. Clinton did sign a different welfare bill into law eight 
months later. 
</P>
<P>
	-- April 10, 1996: Clinton vetoed a ban on certain late-term  
abortions. In September, the House voted to override, but the 
Senate sustained the veto a week later. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Oct. 10, 1997: He vetoed another late-term abortion ban. In  
July 1998, the House voted to override, but the Senate sustained 
the veto in September. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Nov. 13, 1997: Clinton vetoed Congress' rejection of his  
decision to use his new line-item veto authority on military 
construction projects. The House voted the following February to 
override, and the Senate followed suit. 
</P>
<P>
	-- June 20, 1998: Clinton vetoed the D.C. Student Opportunity  
Scholarship Act, which would have provided vouchers for poor 
children to attend private or religious schools. ``We must 
strengthen our public schools, not abandon them,'' the president 
said. The veto stood. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Oct. 21, 1998: Clinton vetoed legislation to pay $1 billion in  
delinquent payments to the United Nations because it contained an 
unrelated provision on abortion. The veto stood.

<HEADLINE> Bill Doesn't Let Patients Sue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Small businesses would be encouraged to buy  
health insurance for employees under legislation that also would 
penalize health plans for refusing to pay for medically necessary 
treatment under a new Republican bill introduced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	But unlike two patient protection measures pending in the House,  
the bill unveiled by Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio, would not give 
patients the right to sue. 
</P>
<P>
	``Patients don't want lawsuits. They want a system that punishes  
HMOs severely if they refuse to provide the treatment physicians 
prescribe,'' he said at a news conference. ``Patients want care, 
not court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boehner said his bill would cover the 161 million Americans with  
private-sector health insurance, as well as the 43 million 
uninsured. 
</P>
<P>
	Patients would be guaranteed the right to have disputed  
decisions about HMO coverage reviewed by outside doctors whose 
findings would be legally binding. Plans that refuse to comply 
could be prosecuted and fined. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also has other protections, including the right of  
patients to continue receiving care from a doctor who has left 
their HMO and the option of choosing a doctor from outside of their 
network, Boehner said. 
</P>
<P>
	It would also would end HMOs prohibiting doctors from telling  
patients their full range of treatment options, and guarantee 
direct access to emergency care for all and to 
obstetrician-gynecologists for women. 
</P>
<P>
	Boehner opposes two other pending measures because he said both  
would expose employers to lawsuits and jeopardize employer-based 
health coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., has promised to bring the  
patient protection measures to the floor sometime next month. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Association of Health Plans issued a statement  
endorsing the Boehner plan as one that ``begins to address the real 
issues without sending costs through the roof or feathering the 
nest of trial lawyers.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Veto of Tax Cut Arrives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After weeks of partisan jockeying over taxes,  
President Clinton is carrying out his threatened veto of the $792 
billion tax cut pushed by Republicans, while expressing hope that 
Congress will approve an alternative plan by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton scheduled a veto ceremony today for the White House Rose  
Garden, in which he planned to stress the need to preserve Social 
Security and Medicare before passing out tax cuts. He delayed the 
veto by a day, due to a strained voice. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Clinton planned to  
deliver the veto in conciliatory tones, listing ``what we can do 
that will facilitate getting something done'' on taxes before 
Congress wraps up its current legislative session. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president believes this Congress can get something done  
this year,'' Lockhart said. ``The message is that the president 
hasn't given up on the Congress, even if they may have given up on 
themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But on Capitol Hill, the battle lines were clearly drawn.  
</P>
<P>
	``If he vetoes our tax bill, he will in effect have increased  
taxes on the American people by $792 billion,'' said House Ways and 
Means Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas. ``We should not be increasing 
people's taxes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tax bill would use part of a projected 10-year budget  
surplus to reduce all federal income tax rates by 1 percentage 
point, cut capital gains taxes, phase out estate taxes and the 
alternative minimum tax and ease the ``marriage penalty'' paid by 
many two-income couples. In nearly party-line votes, it passed in 
the House, 221-206, and in the Senate, 50-49, falling far short of 
the two-thirds majority needed to overturn a veto. 
</P>
<P>
	As the package coursed through the legislative process, Clinton  
traveled the country arguing that such an ambitious tax cut 
reflected misplaced priorities -- salvaging Social Security and 
Medicare should come first. He also said it would absorb so much of 
the projected budget surpluses that federal programs from national 
parks to education could suffer deep, debilitating cuts. He has 
instead proposed cutting taxes by up to $300 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	In a recent letter to Clinton, Senate Majority Leader Trent  
Lott, R-Miss., and House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., denied the 
tax cut would hurt entitlement programs and raised the prospect 
that surpluses would be used to ``pay for other Washington 
spending.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Sept. 15, the day the tax plan was delivered to the  
president, Vice President Al Gore -- who is pursuing the Democratic 
presidential nomination -- declared it ``dead on arrival at the 
White House.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Polls have consistently shown that tax cuts are not as important  
to voters as saving Social Security or strengthening Medicare. Many 
polls show that up to half of Americans believe the GOP tax cut 
would mainly benefit the wealthy. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican leaders have pushed the issue because they feel it  
matters to their core constituencies. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Charles Rangel of New York, ranking Democrat on the House  
Ways and Means Committee, said the political nature of the tax bill 
was ultimately its downfall. 
</P>
<P>
	``They never drafted a tax bill. Really, it was a political  
statement drafted to mobilize people and support for Republicans in 
the House and Senate,'' Rangel said. ``They know you have to 
negotiate a bill of that size. They never wanted to negotiate it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Internal Revenue Service is urging Republicans to  
move quickly if they plan to extend several expiring tax provisions 
so forms can be drafted for the 2000 filing season. 
</P>
<P>
	IRS Commissioner Charles Rossotti told Archer at a meeting  
Wednesday that tax law changes effective for next year should be on 
the president's desk by Oct. 7. 
</P>
<P>
	Archer said he hoped to move forward on a tax package -- possibly  
as early as Friday -- that would extend several expiring provisions 
at a one-year cost of roughly $3 billion. These ``extenders'' were 
part of the larger $792 billion tax cut, but unlike that bill they 
have broad bipartisan support. 
</P>
<P>
	They include a research and development tax credit favored by  
high-tech companies and manufacturers and a provision ensuring that 
millions of middle-class taxpayers don't fall subject to the higher 
alternative minimum tax if they take personal credits on their 
income tax returns such as the $500 per-child credit and education 
credits. 
</P>
<P>
	Other provisions include extension of credits aimed at  
encouraging businesses to hire workers from certain targeted groups 
and to provide jobs for former welfare recipients.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Golfers Wary on Ryder Cup  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROOKLINE, Mass. (AP) -- This is supposed to be a course  
Americans can't lose on. 
</P>
<P>
	Just watch them.  
</P>
<P>
	The recent history of the Ryder Cup practically guarantees it.  
</P>
<P>
	But that's not all.  
</P>
<P>
	What else?  
</P>
<P>
	At some juncture, some lout will shout something ugly at Colin  
Montgomerie. 
</P>
<P>
	At a later, more crucial juncture, a Scotsman you never heard of  
will make some putts you won't believe. 
</P>
<P>
	And at the end, those two will be line-dancing on the 18th green  
at The Country Club, joined by Swedes and Spaniards, Brits and even 
a Frenchman, all of them struggling to keep a straight face while 
swearing the game of golf was the real winner. 
</P>
<P>
	That, anyway, was the theme going into the 33rd installment of a  
competition begun in 1927, when English seed merchant Sam Ryder 
liked his countrymen's chances well enough to spring for a trophy 
to hand the winner. 
</P>
<P>
	In Thursday's opening ceremony, both U.S. captain Ben Crenshaw  
and his European counterpart, Englishman Mark James, did what they 
could to defuse, deflect and otherwise de-emphasize the 
nationalistic fervor that has grown up around -- and occasionally 
spilled over into -- the matches. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the Right Rev. Barbara C. Harris, who delivered the  
invocation, felt compelled to do her part. Even though the U.S. 
team is a heavy favorite and the history of The Country Club is 
peppered with tales of inspirational wins by underdog Americans, 
she asked the throng of thousands to show restraint, no matter the 
outcome Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``May all the bogeys, birdies and eagles remind us, contestants  
and spectators alike, that in this competition, all can be winners 
no matter the score.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, only one side is going to be hugging, mugging and  
drinking champagne from that pricey little piece of hardware after 
the last putt has been holed. 
</P>
<P>
	And against all odds, it will be the Euros.  
</P>
<P>
	Again.  
</P>
<P>
	On paper, they shouldn't even be here.  
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. side has seven of the world's top dozen rated players.  
The Europeans have two. The Europeans have seven Ryder Cup rookies. 
The U.S. team has one, and that's David Duval, who is ranked No. 2 
in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Want more? Last month at the NEC Invitiational, a tournament  
held for players who qualify for their country's Ryder Cup and 
President Cup teams, the 12 Americans finished an aggregate 80 
strokes better than their dozen European foes. Tiger Woods won it 
and four Americans joined him in the top ten. 
</P>
<P>
	But on grass, in match play, it's been a different story.  
</P>
<P>
	The Europeans have won the last two cups and held onto it  
through three of the previous five matches, either by winning or 
tying. None of it happened by accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Competition on their tour is sharper because the purses are  
smaller, which in turn makes for hungrier players. Shotmaking, too, 
is more refined on that side of the Atlantic because the weather is 
rougher and the courses not as well groomed, nor nearly as 
predictable as the cookie-cutter layouts used for tour events in 
the States. 
</P>
<P>
	And that's not all. Junior golf all over the continent is loaded  
with team events. And even when those players graduate to the 
European PGA Tour and strike out on their own, they find themselves 
in foreign lands, trying to master different languages just to land 
a decent hotel room and a courtesy car. 
</P>
<P>
	It makes for the kind of camaraderie that's hard to instill in  
players who get together for one event every two years. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Europe, you will see eight or 10 guys at a table eating  
together,'' recalled Englishman Tony Jacklin, the former captain 
who guided his side to wins in 1985 and 1987. ``But in America, 
there will be the odd group of two and lots of tables for one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All those elements have forged a squad that will once again saw  
off the heavily favored Americans at the knees. Even if it wasn't 
supposed to be that way. Especially here. 
</P>
<P>
	The Country Club was the place where a 19-year-old caddie named  
Francis Ouimet, who lived across the street from No. 17, slayed 
British giants Harry Vardon and Ted Ray in the 1913 U.S. Open. The 
singular victory is credited with igniting America's love affair 
with golf. 
</P>
<P>
	It was here that U.S. teams scored convincing wins in the 1932  
and 1973 Walker Cups, and here that American Curtis Strange held 
off Englishman Nick Faldo to win the 1988 U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``This place,'' U.S. team member Hal Sutton said, ``is dripping  
with history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But this time, come Sunday, it will be dripping with tears.  
</P>

<HEADLINE> New York Life Cuts 800 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- New York Life Insurance Co. plans to eliminate  
800 positions or 9 percent of its workforce in the next three 
years, the company said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	About 300 employees will lose their jobs in the next six months.  
The other reductions will be made through attrition, an early 
retirement incentive program and job eliminations. 
</P>
<P>
	About half of the company's 8,200 full time jobs are based in  
the New York area. The bulk of the layoffs will involve workers in 
the New York region, said spokesman Bill Werfelman. 
</P>
<P>
	The cutbacks, which will save the company $172 million, will  
help the insurer remain financially strong, Werfelman said. 
</P>
<P>
	New York Life made a $753 million profit last year on revenues  
of $19.8 billion.

<HEADLINE> Cities Plan Early 2000 Celebrations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- If you happen to be in Boston or Los Angeles on  
New Year's Eve, you might want to check your watch before joining 
their millennium celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither city is going to wait until the clock strikes midnight  
to pop open the champagne -- they're getting a jump on everyone else 
by starting their party hours before the year 2000 rolls around. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles' $1 million taxpayer-funded extravaganza is to start  
around 7 p.m., or 10 p.m. in the Eastern time zone. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's complicated, because at 12 midnight, it's 3 a.m. in New  
York, so who's going to be watching our celebration?'' Mayor 
Richard Riordan reasoned. ``So we are trying to do it so we can 
start about 4 in the afternoon, so we can get some news coverage 
throughout the country, hour by hour.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the essential nature of a competitive society, to be  
numero uno,'' said Joseph Boskin, a cultural historian at Boston 
University. 
</P>
<P>
	It seems to be dawning on officials across the country that  
making this New Year's unique is worth a lot -- be it for bluster or 
tourism dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are all sorts of little controversies over who is first  
and who deserves the title of first,'' said David Kessler, 
executive administrator of the Center for Millennial Studies, which 
itself was well ahead of the millennial curve with its 1996 
founding. ``Part of it is just the intuitive idea that the 
millennium is too perfect of a marketing ploy to pass up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boston officials say they orchestrated their 7 p.m. fireworks  
for the first time this year so children might participate in 
revels usually well past their bedtimes. (There will still be 
midnight pyrotechnics for the purists.) 
</P>
<P>
	The evening fireworks also give people who are fearful of a Y2K  
cataclysm, such as computer meltdowns and electric surges, a chance 
to party and return home by midnight, organizers said Wednesday -- 
100 days before the big night. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston's early-bird celebration will coincide with midnight in  
Greenwich, England, which is the universally accepted standard of 
world time, Mayor Thomas Menino said. An enormous television screen 
on the Boston Common will broadcast the 60-second countdown from 
6:59 p.m. live from England and other countries in the first time 
zone, including Iceland, the Ivory Coast and Portugal. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not so much bragging rights as it is an opportunity for  
us to participate with the other countries and the world that will 
be celebrating at that moment,'' said Michael Taylor, president of 
Boston 2000, the nonprofit group in charge of millennial 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
	In truth, New Year's Day actually first begins at the  
international dateline in the Pacific Ocean, 12 hours before it 
reaches Greenwich. But fireworks at 7 a.m. over Boston Harbor just 
wouldn't have the same panache. 
</P>
<P>
	In Maine, the tiny town of Lubec believes it has the lock on the  
first place in America to see the sun rise each day. Folks' dander 
was raised when the U.S. Naval Observatory declared recently that 
the summit of Cadillac Mountain, just outside Bar Harbor, would be 
the first place in the country to see the dawn on Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	After enough Lubec complaints, the Naval observatory refigured  
its calculations to find that sunlight on Jan. 1 will hit both 
Cadillac Mountain and Lubec's Porcupine Mountain at precisely the 
same time: 7:04 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	In Las Vegas, some 750,000 partygoers are expected to come to  
town for New Year's Eve. The city only has 120,000 hotel rooms, and 
many of those are going for thousands of dollars a night. 
</P>
<P>
	Caesars Palace, for example, will be charging $2,000 a night,  
with a four-night minimum. Rooms usually are between $125 and $500.

<HEADLINE> Senior PGA's Baiocchi Seeks Victory  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MASON, Ohio (AP) -- Hugh Baiocchi is still looking for his first  
victory of 1999 as he begins defense of his title in the Kroger 
Senior Classic on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a pretty good year last year with wins here and at  
Indianapolis, but since then I've been kind of out and about,'' 
said the South African, who spent his career playing the PGA 
European Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been in the final threesome on a few occasions,'' said  
Baiocchi, who is 18th on the money list. ``But last week I didn't 
hit the ball very well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He tied for 20th at Dallas, where Tom Watson won his first  
Senior Tour championship. When Baiocchi got to The Golf Center 
north of Cincinnati, he spent two hours on the practice tee with 
his caddy and a video camera. 
</P>
<P>
	``I picked up on a couple of things, and maybe that will help,''  
Baiocchi said. 
</P>
<P>
	But he figures he's a long shot to repeat as champion.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's enough pressure in the game without putting that on  
myself, although having won on the course once makes you know it's 
a course that suits your game,'' Baiocchi said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I was to repeat, it would be something that would really  
surprise me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Kroger Classic has never had a repeat winner.  
</P>
<P>
	This is the 15th consecutive week of competition for Baiocchi,  
and the grind is taking a toll. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel a little mentally tired,'' he said. ``I'm going to play  
one more week, and then I certainly will need a break. 
</P>
<P>
	``But then, all it takes is a couple of birdies early in the  
round to get the adrenalin going and the juices flowing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baiocchi is among five South Africans on the senior tour, and  
two have won the Kroger Classic. But Baiocchi doesn't travel in the 
same circle as Simon Hobday, the 1993 winner known for his drinking 
and storytelling. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a wonderful fellow -- we played golf together 30 years ago  
-- but he's a party guy,'' Baiocchi said. ``We don't have similar 
interests.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baiocchi won last year's Kroger Classic in a playoff when the  
final day was rained out and five players were tied at 133 after 
two rounds.

<HEADLINE> Victim in L.A. Attack Goes Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A 5-year-old boy rode a fire truck home from  
the hospital Thursday, six weeks after he almost died when he was 
shot in a gunman's assault at a Jewish community center. 
</P>
<P>
	Benjamin Kadish wore a helmet and a badge that said ``Junior  
Firefighter'' as he rolled up to the balloon-decorated walkway of 
his West Hills home in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
	``He gave the horn a blast and the siren to announce to the  
neighborhood that he was home,'' fire Capt. Steve Ruda said. 
</P>
<P>
	Benjamin had been hospitalized since the Aug. 10 attack that  
wounded three boys, a teen-age girl and a woman at the North Valley 
Jewish Community Center. 
</P>
<P>
	White supremacist Buford O. Furrow surrendered to the FBI in Las  
Vegas the day after the attack. He faces attempted murder charges 
in that attack and is charged with the murder of a 
Filipino-American postman the same day. 
</P>
<P>

	Although he may require additional surgery, authorities said the

<HEADLINE> J. Bush Pushes Vouchers to Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation can save failing public schools  
while giving parents the option of pulling their children out of 
them, Florida Gov. Jeb Bush told a congressional budget panel 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There should be zero tolerance for failure,'' said Bush, whose  
state is the first to provide vouchers that can be used for private 
and parochial schools. ``Parents who have their children in these 
failing schools ought to be given other options.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``And there must be meaningful and undiluted accountability. We  
should not just write off failing schools as someone else's 
problem,'' Bush told the House Budget Committee -- which was accused 
by some groups as using the hearing to float a federal voucher 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ya'll up here call them vouchers. I don't like the ``V'' word  
because the ``V'' word is used in politics,'' Bush said, touting 
his ``opportunity scholarships,'' which pay for students at some 
low-performing schools to attend private or parochial schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Though similar proposals died in the Senate, the House has  
always found a majority willing to entertain the idea of federal 
public funds for private schooling. 
</P>
<P>
	But Education Secretary Richard Riley on Thursday blasted the  
idea: 
</P>
<P>
	``There's the belief that all you have to do to fix public  
schools is to leave them behind and subsidize private education 
instead, that there is some kind of parallel universe of superior 
private schools ready to take on the job of educating 46 million 
public school students,'' Riley said in his testimony. ``Well I'm 
here to tell you that there is no such parallel universe. The only 
way to fix the public schools is to fix the public schools, not to 
abandon them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Rush Holt, a New Jersey Democrat, criticized Republican  
funding of education: ``The House leadership has had a rhetorical 
support of education, but there has been little in the way of 
actual support. You need only look at this year's flat funding for 
the education budget.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, who chairs the budget panel, said  
plans like Florida's. '' are able to rescue the public education 
system, by giving a failing school the resources -- and time -- 
necessary to right itself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the state law Bush signed in June, schools are graded on  
an A-to-F scale based mostly on students' state test results in 
reading, math and writing. Students in schools graded F for two out 
of every four years are to qualify for vouchers of up to $4,000 to 
attend qualifying public, private, or religious schools. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, 78 schools with 61,000 students, got F's. But just  
two previously troubled schools were chosen for the voucher plan. 
Bush said that the 134 children who used the vouchers had a range 
of skill levels, debunking the theory that vouchers take the best 
students from public schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reaction to our plan has been fun to watch,'' said Bush,  
adding that failing schools get funds for after-school programs, 
class-size reduction and extended-year schooling. ``You have 
dramatic reform in schools where children have not been learning as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's brother, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, a presidential  
hopeful, also created a stir in the education community when he 
proposed giving federal money for poor children directly to their 
parents. Parents unsatisfied with their schools could use the money 
for tutoring, or toward a public or private education. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeb Bush noted he also gives those schools that get an A grade  
incentives up to $100 per student to spend as they see fit, but 
some education and civic groups also blasted the plan, charging it 
violates church-state separation laws and takes needed public funds 
from public schools. 
</P>
<P>
	As for a pending lawsuit by the NAACP and the state teachers'  
union aimed at eliminating the program, Bush said, ``I'm not a 
lawyer. I'll leave that to the lawyers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the hearing Thursday, Bush also asked Congress to free states  
from he called cumbersome federal regulations attached to education 
funding. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have 7 percent of the budget coming from Washington, yet  
40 percent of the staff is trying to comply with your wishes,'' he 
said. ``That's 40 percent of staff that is not focused on making 
sure every child gets a year's worth of knowledge in a years' 
time.''

<HEADLINE> Fox Appeals Ruling on Turner Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Fox Sports Net South is appealing a lower court  
ruling that allowed Turner South, a new regional network, to 
broadcast Atlanta baseball, football and hockey games. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, Fulton County Superior Court Judge Rowland  
Barnes denied Fox Sports' request for an injunction. The network 
was attempting to prevent Turner South from including the 
Thrashers, Hawks and Braves as part of its programming lineup, 
beginning Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox filed its appeal Thursday with the Georgia Supreme Court and  
said in a statement that it ``intends to pursue all legal and 
equitable remedies available.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No date has been set for a briefing in the matter, at which the  
court would decide whether to grant Fox's appeal a hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox sued in June, claiming that the new network violates a  
12-year non-compete agreement that was part of a $65 million deal 
the companies struck in 1996.

	NASA Loses Contact With Mars Probe  
</P>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- NASA's first interplanetary weather  
satellite failed to re-establish contact with Earth early today 
after it was supposed to complete an engine procedure to place it 
in orbit around Mars. The Mars Climate Orbiter, one of two probes 
scheduled to arrive at the red planet this year to study the 
weather and search for evidence of water, should have regained 
contact with Earth at 2:26 a.m. The probe was behind the planet -- 
and out of radio contact -- during most of the 17-minute engine 
firing that should have placed it in orbit.

	China: Taiwan Must Make Concessions  
</P>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- China kept up pressure today on Taiwan to retract  
its claim to statehood, despite hopes that sympathy over the 
island's earthquake might ease the crisis between the two rivals. 
After a devastating earthquake flattened central Taiwan on Tuesday, 
Chinese President Jiang Zemin offered sympathies and assistance. 
Taiwan, while not accepting, thanked China for the offer. But 
China's Foreign Ministry said today that the source of ill-feelings 
-- a claim by Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui that China and Taiwan 
should treat each other as equal states -- remained an obstacle.

	Students Protest in Indonesia  
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Thousands of university students  
rampaged in several cities today, clashing with police in protests 
against a new law giving the military sweeping emergency powers. 
Outside parliament in the capital, Jakarta, some 6,000 students 
clashed with police outside parliament, starting early in the 
afternoon and going into the evening. Police fired tear gas into a 
sea of angry demonstrators, who set two military vehicles on fire. 
Four thousand protesters flooded into the streets in the country's 
second-largest city, Surabaya, and more than 200 rallied on the 
resort island of Bali.

</P>
<P>
	DILI, East Timor (AP) -- Gunfire rattled across the ravaged city  
of Dili today, sending international peacekeepers nervously chasing 
gunmen they believed were hostile militiamen or undisciplined 
Indonesian soldiers. No contact was made, and no one was hurt. But 
a series of shooting incidents -- the first since the multinational 
force arrived Monday -- and reports of militias gathering in West 
Timor raised tensions and dissipated the peacekeepers' warm 
welcome.

	Rescuers Battle the Clock in Taiwan  
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- As more cries for help turned to ominous  
silence, Taiwanese and foreign rescue teams battled the clock today 
to save 2,300 trapped victims of a devastating earthquake that 
already has claimed more than 2,000 lives. Hopes of finding large 
numbers of survivors diminished as fewer moans or cries for help 
were heard from within collapsed houses and high-rises, more than 
60 hours after the quake struck.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Yasser Arafat is looking for more support from  
one of his principal boosters, President Clinton, while American 
efforts to engineer a land-for-peace deal between Israel and Syria 
stumble. At 70, Arafat is determined to see a Palestinian state 
established in his lifetime, either through negotiations with 
Israel that are now under way or unilaterally, if the talks fail to 
produce his desired results. He also wants its capital in 
Jerusalem.

<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Relations between India and Pakistan  
appeared as tense as ever at the General Assembly this week, with 
diplomats from each country accusing the other of perpetrating a 
conflict that could quickly explode into nuclear war. Pakistani 
Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz warned of nuclear ``doomsday'' in 
South Asia and asked world leaders and the United Nations yesterday 
to stop India from developing an arsenal of atomic weapons.

	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The five permanent members of the U.N.  
Security Council have agreed on general principles on a policy 
toward Iraq, but could not forge a common stance that would lead to 
the resumption of arms inspections. An agreement would mark a 
modest step forward in the search for ways to resume U.N. 
inspections of Iraq's weapons programs after a halt of more than 
nine months. But the five council members -- the United States, 
Britain, France, Russia and China -- remain sharply divided on key 
issues.

<HEADLINE> A's, Orioles Split Doubleheader  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Albert Belle hit four doubles and Derrick May  
homered in a five-run fourth inning as the Baltimore Orioles beat 
the Oakland Athletics 12-4 Thursday night to gain a split of their 
doubleheader. 
</P>
<P>
	In the opener, Miguel Tejada hit the last of Oakland's four home  
runs, a tiebreaking shot in the eighth inning, and the A's ended 
the Orioles' 13-game winning streak with a 9-6 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Matt Stairs and Randy Velarde homered in the nightcap for the  
A's, who moved within 4 1/2 games of Boston in the AL wild-card race. 
Toronto beat the Red Sox 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
	Stairs, Ben Grieve and Mike Macfarlane homered in the opener for  
Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	Belle hit his 36th home run in the opener and for an encore tied  
a major league record with four doubles in a game for a second 
time. But Baltimore failed in its bid to tie the franchise record 
of 14 straight wins, set in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
	There was one bit of good news for the Orioles: Cal Ripken  
underwent back surgery in Cleveland, and general manager Frank Wren 
said he expected the third baseman to be on the field for opening 
day in April. 
</P>
<P>
	The doubleheader was a makeup of two games washed out last week  
by Hurricane Floyd. The A's traveled from Oakland and will move on 
to Texas on Friday; the Orioles, who came from Texas, left for 
Boston after the doubleheader. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles broke open the nightcap by scoring five unearned  
runs in the fourth inning after an error by third baseman Olemedo 
Saenz. Belle hit a two-run double and May followed with a three-run 
drive to right off Omar Olivares (15-11). 
</P>
<P>
	After Stairs hit his 37th homer off Matt Riley in the fifth to  
make it 7-4, Baltimore added an unearned run in its half following 
a throwing error by Jimmy Haynes. Belle doubled in a run in the 
sixth and Calvin Pickering hit a two-run homer for an 11-4 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Brady Anderson hit his 24th homer for the Orioles in the  
seventh. 
</P>
<P>
	Baltimore starter Matt Riley left with two outs in the fifth  
after issuing his seventh walk and was replaced by Doug Johns 
(6-3), who blanked the A's through the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
	Tejada led off the eighth inning of the opener by hitting the  
first pitch from Gabe Molina (1-2) into the left-field seats to put 
Oakland up 7-6. Jason Giambi then singled in a run with his third 
hit of the game and another scored on a throwing error. 
</P>
<P>
	T.J. Mathews (9-4) worked 1 2-3 innings for Oakland and Jason  
Isringhausen got three outs for his seventh save. 
</P>
<P>
	Oakland's Brett Laxton, recalled from Triple-A Vancouver before  
the game, allowed three earned runs and seven hits in 4 2-3 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Baltimore starter Sidney Ponson gave up six runs on 10 hits in 4  
2-3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Oakland finished 34-18 against the AL East and won the  
season series from Baltimore 7-5. ... Macfarlane's homer was his 
third in 213 at-bats this season. ... Ponson, who has struck out 
eight, has allowed at least one home run in 20 of 26 starts. ... In 
the first game, Stairs became the 24th player in the eight-year 
history of Camden Yards to hit a ball onto Eutaw Street beyond the 
right-field scoreboard. It was his 100th career homer. ... Belle 
also had four doubles on Aug. 29 against Detroit.

<HEADLINE> Valujet Mechanic Facing New Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A mechanic charged with allowing mislabeled oxygen  
canisters to be loaded onto a Valujet flight that crashed, killing 
110 people, is on the run and facing new charges, authorities said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	SabreTech Inc. mechanic Mauro Valenzuela has been charged with  
contempt of court for failing to comply with his conditions of 
pretrial release. 
</P>
<P>
	``Valenzuela is presently a fugitive. A warrant has been issued  
for his arrest,'' U.S. Attorney Thomas E. Scott said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Valenzuela, former SabreTech mechanic Eugene Florence and Daniel  
Gonzalez, SabreTech's former vice president of maintenance, are 
charged with conspiracy and making false statements. 
</P>
<P>
	All three were indicted in July. They have pleaded innocent.  
</P>
<P>
	Investigators allege SabreTech took oxygen canisters from  
another ValuJet plane, mislabeled them as empty, packed them up and 
delivered the carton to ValuJet's ramp, where it was loaded aboard 
the May 1996 flight. 
</P>
<P>
	The canisters ignited in the cargo hold of the DC-9,  
transforming the jet into an airborne inferno that nose-dived into 
the Everglades northwest of Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	The three men -- who could face up to 55 years in prison each and  
fines as high as $2.7 million, if convicted -- were permitted to 
remain free on bond. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no response Thursday night to a message left for  
Valenzuela's Miami attorney, Norman Moscowitz, seeking comment.

<HEADLINE> 5,500 Toy Flashlights Recalled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Toymaker Playmobil is recalling some 5,500 toy  
flashlights that came with its Coastal Search and Rescue Boats toy 
sets because the spring in the flashlight's battery compartment can 
dislodge and cause the batteries to overheat or leak. 
</P>
<P>
	The Consumer Product Safety Commission, which announced the  
recall Wednesday, said the toy sets had been sold from July through 
September for about $40 and came with a boat, raft, diver and 
captain. 
</P>
<P>
	The manufacturer, Sonca Products of Hong Kong, received two  
reports of minor property damage and two minor injuries from the 
flashlight in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Toy set owners should take the flashlight, not the entire toy,  
away from children immediately and call 800-669-6394 to receive a 
$5 refund. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission also announced a recall of more than 2,800  
Buffalo Fluorescent Work Lights, which are made by New Buffalo 
Corp. of Chesterfield, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardware and auto supply stores sold the work lights, with model  
numbers PL-16, between March 1996 and December 1998 for $13. 
Consumers should call 800-568-6657 to find out how to obtain a 
refund.

<HEADLINE> DNC Reshuffles Its Leadership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Democratic National Committee,  
reorganizing its leadership to focus on fund-raising, is expected 
to give Philadelphia Mayor Edward Rendell a top post. 
</P>
<P>
	General chairman Roy Romer is leaving to chair the Democratic  
National Convention committee, making room for Rendell. 
</P>
<P>
	The Philadelphia mayor met Wednesday night with President  
Clinton, who was expected to offer Rendell his support. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to move over to be the general chair of the  
convention committee,'' Romer said Wednesday in a telephone 
interview. ``The reason for that is this convention is going to 
become the main focus of our ability to communicate the message in 
the months ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came here to do message, to be a spokesman for the party.  
This is the most effective way to continue in that role,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A formal announcement of Romer's new position was planned for  
today, the first day of a three-day DNC meeting in Washington, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several Democrats said Romer agreed to the change after it  
became clear that Clinton and Vice President Al Gore wanted the 
general chairman to focus on fund-raising. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore is the leading Democratic candidate, though he faces a  
stiff challenge from former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Andrew, national chairman of the DNC, is in charge of  
day-to-day operations of the party and will not be affected by the 
shuffling, officials said.

<TEXT>
<P>
	Mike Shanahan is playing better defense than his defense these  
days, deflecting every question about why his two-time Super Bowl 
champion Broncos are 0-2. 
</P>
<P>
	His players are more candid.  
</P>
<P>
	``What we need to do is put our rings away, put them in the safe  
and just go out and play. What we did in the past is what we did in 
the past,'' says linebacker Glenn Cadrez. 
</P>
<P>
	What's in the immediate future is a trip to Tampa to play the  
Bucs, who just happen to lead the league in defense, albeit against 
two non-threatening offenses, the Giants and the Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
	The oddsmakers are starting to jump off the Broncos' bandwagon.  
The game opened as even, then the Bucs quickly jumped to 2 1/2-point 
favorites, even though Trent Dilfer remains their quarterback -- for 
this week at least. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Griese remains Denver's quarterback. Bubby Brister was no  
better in Kansas City off the bench than Griese was as the starter.

<HEADLINE> NASA Loses Contact With Mars Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- NASA's first interplanetary weather  
satellite failed to re-establish contact with Earth early today 
after it was supposed to complete an engine procedure to place it 
in orbit around Mars. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mars Climate Orbiter, one of two probes scheduled to arrive  
at the red planet this year to study the weather and search for 
evidence of water, should have regained contact with Earth at 2:26 
a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're ... not quite sure what's happening,'' said project  
manager Richard Cook of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a 
half-hour after the signal was to be received on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	The probe was behind the planet -- and out of radio contact --  
during most of the 17-minute engine firing that should have placed 
it in orbit. Contact should have been established by 2:30 a.m. at 
the latest. 
</P>
<P>
	Mission organizers were scrambling to regain contact and said  
several features aboard the probe were designed to reconnect it 
with Earth in case of a computer shutdown or other common 
spacecraft problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point, we're still confident we're going to see the  
spacecraft signal in the next few hours,'' Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
	The orbiter and its companion, the Mars Polar Lander, carry  
instruments designed to discover the fate of water believed to have 
once formed rivers or lakes on the planet. Mission scientists say 
water is the key to determining whether life ever existed on Mars. 
</P>
<P>
	The lander, which was launched separately, is due to arrive Dec.  
3. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1,387-pound orbiter was to have fired its main engine early  
today, slowing the spacecraft to 9,840 mph from its interplanetary 
cruising speed of 12,300 mph. Within about a half-hour, the craft 
was to signal that it was not zooming past Mars or plunging to the 
surface. 
</P>
<P>
	The signal takes 11 minutes to cross the 121.9 million miles to  
Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	The craft is supposed to establish an elliptical orbit and then,  
over 45 days, dip into the planet's thin atmosphere and use the 
drag to make its course more circular. 
</P>
<P>
	By mid-November, the probe was to be in a 262-mile-high orbit  
and ready to relay data between Earth and the Mars Polar Lander 
when it arrives a few weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
	Both probes are part of a $327.5 million mission collectively  
known as Mars Surveyor '98, NASA's latest in a series of relatively 
inexpensive robot probes. The orbiter rocketed into space last Dec. 
11 and its sibling probe was launched Jan. 3. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Mars Pathfinder and its rover, Sojourner, explored the  
geology of the planet and found some evidence that water may once 
have flowed. The Mars Global Surveyor, which arrived later that 
year, mapped the surface and found more signs of once-flowing 
water. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mars Climate Orbiter is equipped with two instruments that  
will be turned on after the probe has finished relaying data from 
the lander. Observations will continue for 687 days -- a full 
Martian year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mars Color Imager will take wide- and medium-angle snapshots  
of the planet's atmosphere similar to an Earth-based weather 
satellite. Another instrument called the Pressure Modulator 
Infrared Radiometer will measure temperatures, dust, water vapor 
and clouds from the Martian surface to above the horizon.

<HEADLINE> This Foursome Has Different Meaning  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROOKLINE, Mass. (AP) -- A man in green pants and Ryder Cup  
souvenir cap was asked what the term foursome means in golf 
competition? 
</P>
<P>
	He turned his head with a puzzled look, and said: ``It's four  
guys, four people, playing a round of golf.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What else would it mean?'' asked his companion as they watched  
a practice round Thursday on the eve of the Ryder Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Well, the foursome, according to the rules of golf, means two  
teams of two players taking alternate shots with the same ball on 
each hole. The team with the best score wins the hole. 
</P>
<P>
	Such competition was extremely popular in 19th century Britain,  
and there still are courses there where the only option is to play 
in a foursome competition or as a single. 
</P>
<P>
	When golf came to the United States, personal scores were  
preferred and the foursome lost favor, eventually coming to mean a 
group of four golfers. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the Ryder Cup it retains its official meaning and is a  
key to two of the five rounds of competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the medal competitions of total score over four rounds on  
the pro tour, the Ryder Cup is match play, figured by holes rather 
than total. 
</P>
<P>
	The foursome matches bring the added pressure of hitting a good  
shot so that your partner has a good opportunity on the next. Team 
captains must figure in personalities in setting a foursomes team 
as much as playing styles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that with the foursomes it's a little more important  
for there to be cohesion between two players,'' U.S. team member 
Justin Leonard said. 
</P>
<P>
	But one never knows if the mix is right on any day.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is one of the beauties and difficulties about trying to  
put together teams because there had been successful teams in the 
past who did not complement each other from a personality or a 
golfwise standpoint,'' Ben Crenshaw, captain of the U.S. team, 
said. ``It's a terribly hard and complex thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the basic strategic difficulties is selecting who tees  
off on the first hole, for that person will tee off on all the 
odd-numbered holes for the day, and his partner will go first on 
the even-numbered holes. One consideration is to determine which 
set of holes seems to favor a long hitter like Tiger Woods. 
</P>
<P>
	``That plays as much a part as who goes together as anything,''  
Crenshaw said. 
</P>
<P>
	European players generally have more experience at foursomes and  
match play, and this week they practiced alternate shots more than 
the Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	But they all face the same kind of tension.  
</P>
<P>
	``Motivation is not a problem,'' European team captain Mark  
James said. ``I've got to demotivate them so their heads don't 
explode.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The foursomes will be played by four teams from each side Friday  
and Saturday mornings. They will be followed in the afternoons by 
four-ball competitions, whereby two-man teams compete hole by hole; 
the person with the best score on the hole wins it for his team. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, 12 singles matches will be played.  
</P>
<P>
	Ties on any hole are discounted. Scoring for all matches are in  
terms of the number of holes won and those left to play. For 
example, saying a player won 3 and 2 means he was up three holes 
with two to play and could not be tied or beaten. A match is said 
to be ``dormie'' when a player or team is up by as many holes as 
are left to be played. 
</P>
<P>
	One point is awarded for the winning team or individual in each  
competition, with half points to each side when a tie occurs. 
</P>
<P>
	A total of 28 points is available. Europe must only get 14 to  
retain the Cup. The Americans need 14 1/2 to take it away.

<HEADLINE> Deficit Plan Spurs Fed Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's controversial 1993 deficit  
reduction program provoked extensive debate among Federal Reserve 
policymakers over what the central bank's response should be, 
according to transcripts made public for the first time Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The transcripts show that Federal Reserve Chairman Alan  
Greenspan conducted a telephone call the day after Clinton unveiled 
his $499 billion program in his maiden speech to Congress on Feb. 
17, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan, a Republican first appointed to the Fed by Ronald  
Reagan in 1987, was attacked by members of his own party at the 
time for lending valuable support to the new administration's plan 
to attack soaring budget deficits with $246 billion in tax 
increases and $253 billion in spending cuts over four years. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans called the tax increase the biggest in history and  
warned it would push the country into a recession. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Clinton's address, Greenspan had made generally favorable  
comments about the president's resolve to tackle the deficit. He 
lent more support by agreeing to sit next to first lady Hillary 
Rodham Clinton in the House gallery as the president delivered the 
speech. 
</P>
<P>
	The newly released transcripts show Greenspan was careful to  
clear the exact language he would use in discussing specifics of 
the president's program in an appearance Feb. 19 before the Senate 
Banking Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The telephone conference call went on for 16 pages in which a  
number of Fed board members and presidents of regional banks 
offered advice. 
</P>
<P>
	The transcripts show Greenspan assuring his Fed colleagues that  
he would continue to adhere to an approach where he would endorse 
Clinton's overall goal of reducing the budget deficit without 
getting into specifics of how the program should be structured 
between spending cuts and tax hikes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It strikes me that what is evolving here is something that  
could be quite politically bitter and I think it's crucially 
important that we remain basically noncommittal on these various 
issues'' of how the program is structured, Greenspan told his 
colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
	At another point in the conference call, Greenspan expressed  
doubts over whether Clinton's program would be able to pass 
Congress even though both the House and the Senate were then 
controlled by Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	While Greenspan said the program had a chance in the House, he  
said it was likely that Southern Democrats might end up voting 
against Clinton in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, the program, considered the major domestic  
achievement of Clinton's first term, passed both houses of Congress 
by a single vote, with no Republicans supporting the measure. 
</P>
<P>
	The transcript of the Feb. 18, 1993, conference call was  
released as part of hundreds of pages of transcripts that were 
released on Thursday of the closed-door discussions of the Federal 
Open Market Committee, the Fed's key policymaking group, composed 
of Fed board members in Washington and the 12 regional bank 
presidents. 
</P>
<P>
	The FOMC meets privately eight times a year for scheduled  
meetings with telephone conference calls conducted in between 
meetings. Summaries of FOMC deliberations are released about six 
weeks after each meeting. Under a reform pushed through Congress by 
a former House Banking Committee chairman, retired Rep. Henry 
Gonzalez, D-Texas, the full transcripts of the meetings are 
released after about five years.

<HEADLINE> Davis Cup Semis Set for Weekend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Lleyton Hewitt's inaugural Davis Cup year has been one surprise  
after another. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a dream,'' Hewitt said. ``In Zimbabwe (in April) I  
was the hitting partner the whole time. Then there was an injury on 
the team and in Boston I won both my singles matches, so I was 
happy to get away with that. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now there is another injury on the team and Pat (Rafter) is  
out, so I have to step up again, and take a bit of a leadership 
role.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With both Rafter and Mark Philippoussis missing with injuries,  
the 18-year-old Hewitt will lead the Australians against Russia at 
Brisbane, Australia, this weekend in the Davis Cup semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	The other semifinal, at Pau, France, will pit Belgium against  
France. The winners will meet for the Cup in late November. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Hewitt will open the best-of-5 series against  
Russia's Marat Safin, 19, in a battle of teen-agers. The second 
match will send Australia's Wayne Arthurs against Yevgeny 
Kafelnikov, who is ranked No. 2 in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Arthurs, at 29, will be one of the oldest players ever to make a  
Davis Cup debut for Australia. Until now, Arthurs never had been on 
a Davis Cup squad, even as a practice player. 
</P>
<P>
	The doubles on Saturday will send Mark Woodforde and Sandon  
Stolle against Kafelnikov and Andrei Olhovskiy, with the reverse 
singles to be played Sunday, with Hewitt facing Kafelnikov and 
Arthurs playing Safin. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not taking Safin easily,'' Hewitt said. ``It's going to be  
a very tough match. Marat is a bit of a loose cannon once he gets 
out there. If everything is working, he plays well, but he can also 
play a couple of loose games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The France-Belgium match begins Friday with Sebastien Grosjean  
of France playing 19-year-old Xavier Malisse, followed by Frenchman 
Cedric Pioline against Filip Dewulf. 
</P>
<P>
	In Saturday's doubles, Olivier Delaitre and Fabrice Santoro face  
Malisse and Christophe van Garsse, with Sunday's reverse singles to 
follow. 
</P>
<P>
	French captain Guy Forget decided to use the same hard court in  
Pau that was used for the 3-2 quarterfinal win against Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	Pioline is ranked 16th in the world and Grosjean is 30th,  
whereas Belgium's top player, Malisse, is ranked only 98th. 
</P>
<P>
	France knows that rankings don't count for much in Davis Cup  
play. Two years ago, France traveled to Belgium as the Davis Cup 
champion, only to lose 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
	And in the 100th year of the event, Belgium already has upset  
the Czech Republic and Switzerland to earn a berth in the 
semifinals for the first time ever. 
</P>
<P>
	Only the 16 nations that comprise the World Group compete for  
the prestigious cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Also being played this weekend are eight qualifying round  
matches: Czech Republic at Uzbekistan, Germany at Romania, South 
Africa at Britain, Finland at Italy, Netherlands at Ecuador, Spain 
at New Zealand, Sweden at Austria, and Zimbabwe at Chile. 
</P>
<P>
	The winners advance to the World Group for next year's  
competition.

<HEADLINE> Details of Vetoed Tax Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Details of the 10-year, $792 billion Republican tax cut package  
vetoed Thursday by President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 *INCOME TAX 
</P>
<P>
	--A reduction of 1 percentage point in all marginal income tax  
rates between 2001 and 2005. The bottom 15 percent rate would have 
fallen to 14.5 percent in 2001 and 14 percent in 2003, followed by 
a 1 percentage point reduction in all other rates in 2005. Cost: 
$283 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	--To ease the ``marriage penalty'' paid by millions of two-income  
couples, the standard deduction would have been gradually doubled 
over a five-year period, beginning in 2001, for those who do not 
itemize. Also, the income subject to the bottom tax bracket would 
have risen for couples who file jointly in 2005. Cost: $119 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 *CAPITAL GAINS 
</P>
<P>
	--Individual capital gains rates for most investments held at  
least one year would have been reduced from 20 percent to 18 
percent, or from 10 percent to 8 percent for people paying the 
bottom income tax rate, effective retroactive to Jan. 1, 1999. 
Cost: $32 billion.	
</P>
<P>
 *ESTATE TAX 
</P>
<P>
	--Would have phased out and eventually repealed the taxes on  
inheritance and gifts beginning in 2003, with full repeal in 2009. 
Cost: $65 billion.	
</P>
<P>
 *EDUCATION and HEALTH CARE 
</P>
<P>
	--Health insurance premiums would have been fully deductible  
beginning in 2002 for those who pay more than 50 percent of those 
premiums. In 2000, would have created a new personal exemption 
(worth $2,750 in 1999) for people who care for an elderly relative 
at home. Cost: $42.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	--Tax-exempt contribution limits to IRA-like education savings  
accounts would have been expanded from $500 to $2,000 and included 
elementary and secondary school expenses. Interest on prepaid 
tuition accounts for public and private schools would have been tax 
free. Cost: $15 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 *RETIREMENT 
</P>
<P>
	--Contribution limit to all individual retirement accounts would  
have risen from $2,000 to $5,000 a year, from 2001 to 2006. In 
2002, the annual income limit would have gone from $150,000 to 
$200,000 for married couples to contribute to a Roth IRA and to 
convert a traditional IRA into a Roth IRA. Cost: $15 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	--Would have allowed an unspecified deduction for the cost of  
prescription drug insurance for Medicare recipients, contingent 
upon passage of separate Medicare reform bill. No cost estimate. 
</P>
<P>
	--Contribution limits on 401(k) accounts would have increased  
from $10,000 to $15,000 and time accelerated for 100 percent 
vesting in employer-matched pension plans from 5 years to 3 years. 
Cost: $15 billion	
</P>
<P>
 *URBAN ILLS 
</P>
<P>
	--Would have created 20 ``renewal communities,'' including four  
in rural areas, where a variety of tax breaks would have applied 
for businesses that create jobs, clean up former industrial sites 
and take other actions. Cost: up to $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 *CORPORATE 
</P>
<P>
	--Research and development tax credit would have been extended  
for five years. Cost: $13.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	--Work opportunity and welfare-to-work tax credits would have  
been extended for 2.5 years. Cost: $1.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	--Wind and biomass electric credit would have been extended for  
four years and a new poultry waste credit created. Cost: $534 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	--Would have allowed tax break for transfer of money set aside by  
nuclear plants for cleanups and other costs. Cost: $1.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	--Reforestation tax break for timber industry would have been  
increased. Cost: $277 million. 
</P>
<P>
	--The 10 percent excise tax on certain fishing tackle boxes would  
have been repealed. Cost: $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
	--The 50 percent limit on corporate tax benefits for overseas  
sales of military equipment would have been repealed. Cost: $1.1 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	--Would have made a variety of international tax law changes,  
including elimination of 35 percent foreign tax credit limit for 
gas and oil extracted overseas. Cost: $1.6 billion.

<HEADLINE> Charges Dismissed in Cisneros Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LUBBOCK, Texas (AP) -- Conspiracy charges have been dismissed  
against a Texas couple being prosecuted by the independent counsel 
investigating charges against ex-Housing Secretary Henry Cisneros. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Sam Cummings dismissed charges Wednesday  
against Patsy and Allen Wooten. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wootens were accused of falsely obtaining a bank mortgage  
for Mrs. Wooten's sister, Linda Jones, Cisneros' former mistress 
who was at the center of the charges against the former Clinton 
Cabinet member. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wootens pleaded guilty in January 1998 to one count each of  
conspiracy to commit bank fraud and making false statements to a 
bank. They had never been sentenced. 
</P>
<P>
	In the motion to dismiss the charges, independent counsel David  
Barrett said the action was being done because of the Wootens' 
cooperation and good conduct since their pleas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was pleasantly surprised when all the parties agreed to a  
dismissal,'' Mrs. Wooten told the Lubbock Avalanche-Journal in a 
telephone interview Wednesday night. ``We just hope it's all behind 
us now. My husband and I run around and pinch each other just to 
ask, `Is it really over?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Cisneros was charged with lying to the FBI about payments he  
made to Ms. Jones following their highly publicized affair. He 
avoided 18 felony charges by accepting a plea agreement the day his 
trial was to begin. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisneros admitted lying to the FBI and received a misdemeanor  
conviction. He must pay a $10,000 fine but faces no jail time or 
probation. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jones pleaded guilty in 1998 to 28 charges of bank fraud,  
money laundering and lying to federal investigators and received a 
3 1/2-year prison sentence. She was released last week, after Cummings 
reduced the sentence at Barrett's request. 
</P>
<P>
	According to court documents, Ms. Jones was released early  
because of her cooperation in the Cisneros case.

<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- She is the actress formerly known as  
Courteney Cox. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Friends'' star, who wed actor David Arquette on June 12,  
has officially changed her name to Courteney Cox Arquette. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's for real. It's on my Social Security card, everything. No  
hyphen,'' she told the ``Entertainment Tonight'' television 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	``It feels like, wow, I'm changing my identity. It was scary. It  
feels good, like I'm really committed. It feels better than not 
doing it and it made him happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cox Arquette said she eventually plans to drop the Cox from her  
name. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason why is because it was really important for David,  
for me, too,'' she said.

Saturday, don't count on coach John Cooper blowing out 100 candles 
on a cake at midfield. 
</P>
<P>
	With a 99-34-4 record in 12 years with the Buckeyes, Cooper  
doesn't get misty when he thinks about what others call a 
milestone. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm proud and happy that I've lasted that long, hopefully, to  
win 100 games,'' he said. ``But I'm not here counting, let me put 
it that way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his frequently up and occasionally down tenure with the  
Buckeyes, the native Tennessean has come close to winning a couple 
of national championships -- and has also come closer to being fired 
at least that many times. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper has taken Buckeyes teams to the No. 2 spot in the final  
polls in two of the last three years, yet still hasn't captured the 
hearts of many of the fans. After the Buckeyes lost to Miami 23-12 
in the Kickoff Classic, those naysayers repeated a common refrain: 
``He can't win the big one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 62-year-old Iowa State graduate has not been forgiven for  
his 2-8-1 record against archrival Michigan and a 2-8 bowl record 
with the Buckeyes. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet his team swept both of those games last year -- the first  
time that's happened since he's been in Columbus -- and he has made 
No. 12 Ohio State a fixture in the Top 25. 
</P>
<P>
	His job was in jeopardy after several losses to Michigan and a  
couple of tough bowl defeats, including a surprise to Air Force in 
the 1990 Liberty Bowl. He flirted with leaving to take the LSU job 
a few years ago, but was lured back with a multi-year contract that 
features rollover years for victories in those ``big games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He is close to signing another contract that will pay him in  
excess of $1 million a year, including ancillary agreements that 
include TV and radio shows and other responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
	No one questions that he has rejuvenated a program that was  
declining under Earle Bruce, who was let go in a messy firing at 
the end of the 1987 season. 
</P>
<P>
	There are still occasional academic and legal problems with his  
players, but for the most part Cooper has restored the luster 
brought to Ohio State in Woody Hayes' 28 years as head coach. Only 
Hayes, with a 205-61-10 record, has won more games with the 
Buckeyes, and only Hayes and John Wilce (16 seasons) have longer 
football tenures at the school. 
</P>
<P>
	A hundred wins may not be his goal, but he is looking at another  
round number. His career record, encompassing 23 years as head 
coach at Tulsa, Arizona State and Ohio State, is 181-74-6. 
</P>
<P>
	``I look more at the big picture,'' he said. ``I know how many  
games I've won at this point in my career. I'm thinking more and 
more about trying to win 200. Part of that is it doesn't take too 
long.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he has no desire to challenge the win totals of some of  
his peers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to hunt down (Joe) Paterno or (Bobby) Bowden or  
LaVell Edwards,'' he said. ``They've been at it a lot longer than I 
have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper said he hasn't contemplated retirement.  
</P>
<P>
	``I feel good. I've got good young players in the program. So  
why not?'' Cooper said. ``If I wasn't coaching, what would I do? 
I'd have to get a job.''

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Fall in Early Trading / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar slipped against the yen early Friday as  
traders awaited the outcome of a weekend meeting of leading 
economies. Japanese stocks fell after a sharp decline on Wall 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 104.12 yen, down 0.16 yen from late Wednesday  
in Tokyo but higher than its late New York level of 103.95 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets in Tokyo were closed Thursday for a Japanese  
national holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 363.90 points,  
or 2.10 percent, to 16,961.86 in the first 30 minutes of trading. 
On Wednesday, the average closed down 607.03 points, or 3.39 
percent, its biggest one-day loss this year. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar's relative strength from its  
New York level came after bank dealers covered short, or oversold, 
dollar positions ahead of the Group of Seven meeting this weekend 
in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Some traders were bracing for a possible announcement of  
coordinated action in foreign exchange markets by Japan and its G-7 
partners to weaken the surging yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial authorities in Japan fear that if the yen gets too  
strong the country's budding economic recovery could be imperiled. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 109.80 yen early  
Friday, down from 109.57 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, Tokyo share prices started lower following  
the selloff on Wall Street that was prompted by Microsoft president 
Steve Ballmer's warning that technology stocks are overvalued. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the Dow Jones industrial average lost 205.48  
points, or 2 percent, to close at 10,318.59. The technology-heavy 
Nasdaq Composite Index fell 108.33 points to finish at 2,749.83, 
its fourth-biggest decline ever. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo shares were also weighed down by caution ahead of the  
meeting of finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of 
Seven industrialized nations, market players said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also affecting the Tokyo stock market was a decision by the Bank  
of Japan on Wednesday to keep its monetary policy unchanged. The 
BOJ's unexpected decision has promoted fears of a further 
strengthening in the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	A higher yen makes Japanese exports more expensive abroad and  
thus less competitive. It also reduces earnings of export-oriented 
Japanese companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 38.25 points, or 2.59 percent, to 1,441.03. 
The TOPIX closed down 50.05 points, or 3.27 percent, on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark Japanese government bond fell to  
1.7750 percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.7950 percent. Its price 
rose 0.17 point to 99.35.

<HEADLINE> Govt. Warns Parents of Web Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government is warning parents about a dark  
threat on the Internet: Web sites that nearly duplicate legitimate 
ones but whisk children and others into an electronic maze of 
pornography. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Trade Commission called the ploy ``page-jacking,''  
describing it Wednesday as the most pernicious example it has 
discovered in the 100 cases of Internet deception it has 
investigated. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency showed how a consumer who tried to visit an Internet  
site apparently about a popular movie, ``Saving Private Ryan,'' was 
sent with no warning to Web sites with lurid photographs 
advertising ``barely legal Asian girls.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When puzzled surfers try to close those browser windows, other  
windows that opened automatically displayed different pornographic 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
	In extreme cases, those sites also temporarily can disable a Web  
browser's ``back'' and ``forward'' navigation buttons to make it 
even more difficult to leave them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Think about what it would be like if you saw your 7-year-old  
child looking at this, and she couldn't turn if off and you 
couldn't turn it off,'' said Jodie Bernstein, director of the 
commission's Bureau of Consumer Protection. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC, alleging deception and unfair trade, said it obtained  
temporary restraining orders earlier this week in U.S. District 
Court against Carlos Pereira, believed to be living in Portugal, 
and Guiseppe Nirta of Australia and his company, WTFRC Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen Asher, deputy chairman of the Australian Competition and  
Consumer Commission, said federal police there served search 
warrants Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC said some types of Internet filtering software are  
effective in blocking these pornographic sites, especially software 
that analyzes text or images from a Web page before displaying it. 
</P>
<P>
	Here is how the scheme works:  
</P>
<P>
	--A company's popular Web site is digitally copied, including the  
hidden ``meta tags'' that help the Internet's search engines 
categorize its content, and then published on different computers 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	--A few lines of software code, called Javascript, are hidden  
within the duplicated Web site to immediately redirect visitors 
elsewhere -- often to pornographic sites that pay a few cents for 
online referrals -- and to make it difficult for a person to shut 
down the browser software or surf elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernstein recommended that parents consider disabling Javascript  
technology in their Web browsers, a procedure that can require 
about half a dozen mouse-clicks. But that also prevents legitimate 
sites from using the technology. 
</P>
<P>
	One victim compared page-jacking to opening a family restaurant,  
then finding an adult bookstore built across the street in an 
identical building and under the restaurant's own marquee. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like some sleazeball has tunneled under your front door  
and set up a trap door,'' said John G. Fischer of Irving, Texas, a 
lawyer for Adrenaline Vault, a Web site that fell victim this 
spring. Youngsters looking there for details about software games 
instead found their computer screens filled with pornography. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC said it helped uncover evidence of the scheme using its  
new Internet lab, a suite with eight modern computers and four 
investigators whose job is to click and protect. 
</P>
<P>
	Don Blumenthal, who runs the lab, said the FTC uses a private  
Internet provider as its investigators surf the Web to avoid 
tipping companies that the government, with its familiar 
``ftc.gov'' moniker, is visiting. The agency also is establishing 
secret e-mail accounts for these digital detectives to cloak their 
online identities. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC has taken a lead role among all federal agencies  
enforcing U.S. laws on the Internet, but its unclear how its 
lawyers and eight new computers will make more than a tiny dent in 
the fraud on the Web, where criminals can organize operations 
overseas to thwart U.S. laws and can vanish and reappear under 
different names in a matter of hours.

<HEADLINE> Senate Panel Probing Justice Dept. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A task force within the Senate Judiciary  
Committee will investigate how President Clinton's Justice 
Department handled inquiries into the Waco standoff, campaign 
finance abuses and nuclear espionage, Republican leaders announced 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said the task force, chaired  
by Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., would focus on ``what in the world is 
happening at the Justice Department? Why is there no justice at the 
Justice Department?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two members of the five-senator task force are Democrats. But no  
Democratic senators were present for the announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	Specter said he had talked with Charles LaBella about leading  
the panel's investigation. LaBella is a former Justice Department 
prosecutor who publicly disagreed with Attorney General Janet Reno 
on her campaign finance inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a great, great many questions that remain  
unanswered,'' Specter, R-Pa., said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Things just aren't right,'' agreed Sen. Charles Grassley,  
R-Iowa, who also will sit on the panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Specter said that at the request of former Sen. John Danforth he  
will hold off for 30 days before talking to witnesses of the 
government's siege of the Branch Davidian compound. Reno named 
Danforth to head an independent investigation of the government's 
use of force during the 1993 standoff in Waco. The siege ended in a 
fire and the deaths of about 80 Davidians. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to the Judiciary Committee last week, Danforth  
complained that Specter's investigators had already interviewed 
witnesses. ``In the interest of avoiding even the appearance of a 
turf battle,'' Specter told reporters Thursday, he agreed to hold 
off on interviews.

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Theologian Jane Redmont is striding down Fifth  
Avenue at a quick clip as the words come out: ``To get a spiritual 
life, we need to slow down and take some deep breaths.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She knows both the hectic pace of modern life and what she sees  
as a broadly felt yearning to find spirituality. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of us in the contemporary world feel assaulted by the  
speed, the economic pressures, the competition -- and the feeling 
that 'I have to pull myself up by my own bootstraps, make it on my 
own,' '' she said in an interview. ``We're feeling very fragmented, 
and there's a desire to pray with our whole selves, with our heads 
and our hearts, as well as our bodies, our senses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And how, pray tell, does one do that?  
</P>
<P>
	Planting a garden, making love, kneading bread, dancing,  
singing, or even just sitting, breathing and meditating -- all of 
these can be spiritual acts, says Redmont, whose new book, ``When 
in Doubt, Sing,'' explores myriad ways of ``praying'' in the 
angst-filled modern world. 
</P>
<P>
	Her book describes the inner adventures of hundreds of ordinary  
people she spoke with, a spiritual mosaic including mellow 
Californians, Benedictine monks, Zen practitioners, urban 
professionals and small-town Midwesterners. 
</P>
<P>
	The title celebrates music as prayer, which she says helped her  
survive depression. 
</P>
<P>
	Redmont, a 47-year-old Roman Catholic theologian, writes of  
being at a church service ``praying and crying.'' Friends sitting 
on either side noticed, ``reached out and held my hand, wrapped an 
arm around my shoulder, did not ask, simply held me and continued 
to pray, and sing. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was room in the pew for suffering and friendship, for  
praise and lament -- no need to check any part of our lives at the 
door. In this communal acknowledgment, before God, there was hope, 
inside the tears.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Redmont views America's new spiritual landscape from an eclectic  
past. She's a convert to Catholicism, born in France of American 
Jewish parents, agnostics who raised her as a Unitarian 
Universalist. Her brother Dennis is The Associated Press bureau 
chief in Rome. 
</P>
<P>
	A lay minister with a master's from Harvard Divinity School, she  
is finishing a doctorate at the Graduate Theological Union in 
Berkeley, Calif. She worships at a mostly African-American Catholic 
church in nearby Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	``Prayer in daily life'' -- the book's subtitle -- can be found,  
she says, in countless ways: in the Christian, Jewish or Muslim 
faiths, among others, or through practices like yoga, meditation 
and ritual touch. 
</P>
<P>
	But, she writes, one shouldn't reword the 23rd Psalm as, ``The  
Lord is my shrink, I shall not want.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Simple traditional rituals remain powerful. We're attached to  
``the prayers of grandmothers,'' as one woman in the book calls 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	After the school massacre in Littleton, Colo., the first large  
public gathering was an outdoor Sunday prayer service. It offered 
emotional balm for the victims' families and friends before they 
asked the tough questions about how guns get into children's hands. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need each other, whether it's a group or a large cathedral  
or a small parish or an ashram or a mosque. Find yourself a 'we,''' 
Redmont says. At the precarious edge of the 21st century, ``there's 
an incredible loneliness out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her theme finds support in others' research and practices.  
</P>
<P>
	Princeton University sociologist Robert Wuthnow, an authority on  
trends in American spirituality, says ``more people in the United 
States pray than actually believe firmly that God exists. Prayer is 
a search, an expression of faith, but also an admission of doubt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Redmont says prayer has other purposes, too. She cites a  
challenge many feel today to ``pray with the actions of our 
lives.'' The late Swiss theologian Karl Barth believed one should, 
so to speak, hold the Bible in one hand and the newspaper in the 
other, she says. 
</P>
<P>
	In Boston, she participated in this ``laying on of hands'' at an  
AIDS healing service. ``An enormous grace of this tragedy is that 
it has taught us how to love in new ways,'' she says. 
</P>
<P>
	While some seeking a spiritual life have returned to religious  
institutions, others shun them, instead finding sacred space in 
activities as simple as listening to music. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are things Mozart has done for me that no amount of  
sermonizing could do,'' Redmont says. 
</P>
<P>
	And the spiritual value of simply walking at a comfortable pace  
while quietly listening to one's thoughts evokes a Japanese 
theologian's phrase: ``There's an immense hunger for 'the 
three-mile-an-hour God.''' 
</P>
<P>
	But there's also a more tangible kind of spiritual hunger,  
according to Harvard theologian Harvey Cox. ``People are looking 
for a kind of usable tradition. And sometimes they just kind of 
give up because it seems too confusing... .'' 
</P>
<P>
	Redmont's contribution, he says, is that ``she is able to  
combine a very serious rootedness in a particular tradition, Roman 
Catholic, with a genuine openness and appreciation for a very wide 
range of styles of spirituality -- without blending them all. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think of her as being very much on the frontier as to how  
things are developing in the religious sphere of the world. She's 
really Catholic and really ecumenical, and it enriches both of 
those sides of her.''

<HEADLINE> Air Force Hero Faces Sex Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HURLBURT FIELD, Fla. (AP) -- A decorated Air Force helicopter  
pilot who led a daring rescue off the coast of Iceland five years 
ago has been charged with the attempted rape of a teen-age girl and 
other sexual offenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Col. James A. Sills, who was charged Tuesday, could face 85  
years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	His lawyer, Drew Pinkerton, said Thursday the charges are  
unfounded and ``fueled by a very bitter and acrimonious divorce.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sills, a 25-year veteran, is accused of committing indecent acts  
against two girls under 16, including sodomy and attempted rape of 
one of the girls four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	He also is charged with adultery, having an unprofessional  
relationship with a civilian Air Force employee and assaulting his 
estranged wife in a restaurant in Destin, Fla., on June 18. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinkerton said it was Alice E. Sills, not her husband, who was  
the attacker. 
</P>
<P>
	Sills was honored in 1994 for leading two helicopters through  
blinding storms and darkness to rescue six seamen from the frigid 
waters off Iceland after they abandoned their sinking ship. 
</P>
<P>
	He is the second high-ranking officer to face sexual misconduct  
charges at Hurlburt in the past three years. Then-Col. David C. 
Rauhecker was sentenced to three months in prison and reduced one 
rank in 1996 for kissing a female officer, romancing his secretary 
and dating an enlisted woman. 
</P>
<P>
	He was acquitted of more serious charges and allowed to retire.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton eulogized labor leader Lane  
Kirkland as ``a true American hero'' who challenged political 
divisions in his fight for workers' rights at home and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	``He defied the labels of liberal and conservative,'' Clinton

</P>
<P>
	Kirkland died of lung cancer last month at age 77.  
</P>
<P>
	Clinton spoke at a memorial service held at Georgetown  
University on Thursday along with Kirkland admirers from across the 
political spectrum -- from Henry Kissinger to Sen. Edward Kennedy, 
D-Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirkland was ``filled with the faith that everyday people can  
change the world,'' said current AFL-CIO president John Sweeney. 
</P>
<P>
	Polish labor reformer Lech Walesa, also in attendance, spoke of  
the importance of the material and moral support that U.S. unions, 
under Kirkland's leadership, gave to Polish workers who ultimately 
won their fight against a communist regime. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would have been impossible without Lane Kirkland,'' Walesa  
said, speaking through a translator. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirkland, who also reunited the major U.S. unions during his  
presidency of the AFL-CIO, clung to the principle that ``the role 
of the trade unions was to try to keep the big guys from kicking 
the little guys around,'' Clinton said, adding, ``Believe me, I got 
my fair share of lectures about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, Clinton awarded Kirkland the Presidential Medal of  
Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor. On Thursday, 
Kirkland's wife Irena accepted on his behalf a similar accolade 
from the Polish government: the Order of the White Eagle. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton told Kirkland's family, ``I am grateful to you for this  
giant of a man, a true American hero, a man who stood up for the 
little guy. I hope all of us can be faithful to his admonition to 
do the same.''

<HEADLINE> Rooney Explains Column </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Andy Rooney has taken steps to clear up a little  
wreck of his own. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``60 Minutes'' curmudgeon set tongues wagging with a  
newspaper column this week that suggested that the most beautiful 
woman in TV news ``looks as if she had been in a minor automobile 
accident'' because of plastic surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't name any names. That's because, Rooney said Thursday,  
he wasn't talking about anybody. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was writing metaphorically,'' he said. ``I didn't have  
anybody really in mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his column about aging, Rooney said that most people are more  
attractive if they look their age instead of synthetically trying 
to improve their appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	That's something many people in his business can't accept, he  
noted. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the most beautiful -- OK, THE most beautiful -- woman in  
television news had a job done on herself a few years ago and, 
while she doesn't look bad, she does not look the same or as good 
to me as when she had what must have seemed to her to be 
shortcomings,'' he wrote. ``She looks as if she had been in a minor 
automobile accident.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gossip columnists -- and undoubtedly a few of Rooney's female  
colleagues -- immediately began the guessing game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I suppose there must be 20 women in television who thought I  
was talking about them,'' Rooney said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some speculated Rooney meant Diane Sawyer, his former colleague  
on ``60 Minutes.'' Not so fast, the New York Post's Page Six opined 
on Thursday, tossing the names Barbara Walters, Christiane 
Amanpour, Maria Shriver, Jane Pauley, Lesley Stahl and Connie Chung 
into the mix. 
</P>
<P>
	Yikes!  
</P>
<P>
	With so many women to potentially offend, Rooney put a stop to  
it. He said he regretted writing it: ``I didn't mean to call this 
much attention to myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And he offered a verbal bouquet to Ms. Sawyer.  
</P>
<P>
	``Diane is a good friend of mine and I like her a lot,'' he  
said. ``I think she's not only one of the great people in 
television but she's one of the good people, too. She's as smart as 
she is beautiful.''

<HEADLINE> NH Reform Party Cancels Convention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- The New Hampshire Reform Party has  
postponed the convention it scheduled here this weekend, 
complaining that advisers to Patrick Buchanan are trying to take it 
over. 
</P>
<P>
	Party spokesman John Talbot said Saturday's convention in  
Manchester was put off indefinitely because Buchanan's advisers 
have been getting too much into the act. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan is said to be thinking about forsaking the GOP and  
seeking the Reform Party's presidential nomination. He won the 
Republican Primary four years ago in New Hampshire, the state with 
the earliest primary. But he has lagged in the polls this time 
around. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been working closely with representatives of the  
Buchanan camp to assure him he will be treated fairly,'' Talbot 
said. ``Unfortunately, some of Mr. Buchanan's senior advisers have 
seen this convention as an opportunity to try to put individuals of 
their choosing into state leadership positions of the Reform Party 
of New Hampshire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We think it is too soon in the nominating process for any one  
candidate's people to control state leadership positions in our 
organization. It would not be fair to other individuals who might 
seek our party's nomination,'' Talbott added. 
</P>
<P>
	The purpose of the state party is to elect candidates to state  
and local offices and build the party rather than ``seeking to 
elect a single presidential candidate,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Others mentioned as potential Reform Party presidential nominees  
are party founder, Ross Perot, real estate tycoon Donald Trump of 
New York and Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura, highest-elected official 
in the party.

<HEADLINE> Rookie Montoya Close to CART Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Jimmy Vasser is amazed by the way his teammate,  
Juan Montoya, is dealing with the CART FedEx Series championship 
chase. 
</P>
<P>
	``The kid has nerves of steel,'' Vasser, the 1996 champion,  
said. ``Maybe someone should remind him that he's 23 and on the 
brink of winning a PPG Cup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Montoya has taken the CART series by storm. The sensational  
Colombia rookie has driven to six poles and seven race wins in his 
first 17 races, building a 28-point lead over preseason favorite 
Dario Franchitti heading into the Texaco Grand Prix of Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	With two races remaining following Sunday's event on a temporary  
street circuit winding around Houston's downtown convention center, 
Montoya has the opportunity to clinch the title this week. 
</P>
<P>
	If he comes away with a 44-point lead, the Target/Chip Ganassi  
Racing team will have a record fourth consecutive series 
championship -- added to those won by Vasser and two-time champion 
Alex Zanardi, Montoya's predecessor. 
</P>
<P>
	Some youngsters might feel pressured in this situation, but  
Montoya appears totally comfortable with his situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has the right attitude,'' Vasser said. ``He hasn't changed  
a thing about how he's approaching races.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The opening of practice and qualifying Friday will be Montoya's  
first look at the 1.527-mile Houston circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like going to races where I've never driven on the course  
before,'' Montoya said. ``It's a challenge to see how quickly I can 
learn the course and improve. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had a lot of help from my team and from Jimmy. They do a  
good job letting me know what to expect at each new race, but you 
never know what it's like until you get there and race around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for the championship battle, he said, ``I've tried not to  
think about the points. I haven't checked to see exactly how far 
I'm ahead. All I know is that I have to race well in Houston, and 
that's what I plan to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Franchitti, who won last year's rain-marred and shortened  
Houston inaugural from the pole, is aware of the points difference. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're running out of time to catch Juan,'' he said. ``We have  
to have a great race in Houston again this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We also need Juan to experience some gremlins or a hiccup if  
we're going to stay in the hunt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is a total of 22 points available at each event, with one  
for winning the pole, 20 for winning the race and one for leading 
the most laps. 
</P>
<P>
	Should Franchitti falter and fail to score, Montoya could clinch  
the title by finishing third or better -- something he has done nine 
times this season. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Scotsman's chances of keeping the championship chase  
going appear good, since he has posted four of his five career 
victories on temporary street circuits. That includes wins earlier 
this year at Toronto and Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Team Kool Green seems to have a feel for this kind of track,''  
Franchitti said. ``As long as we've still got a mathematical chance 
to catch Juan, we're going to go for it.''

<HEADLINE> 1998 Immunization Rate Hits Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's immunization rates last year were  
the highest ever recorded, Health and Human Services Secretary 
Donna Shalala said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  
show that the overall immunization rate for preschool children 
increased to 80 percent for 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thanks in large part to these high immunization rates, we have  
seen a breathtaking decline in suffering and death from most 
vaccine-preventable diseases,'' Shalala said. ``This new report 
serves as a reminder that vaccines work; they are cost-effective 
tools to prevent disease.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All 50 states achieved 90 percent immunization coverage for  
three doses of diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis vaccine. For other 
vaccines, some 47 states achieved an immunization rate of 90 
percent for Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (Hib), compared 
with 40 states for poliovirus and measles. 
</P>
<P>
	Vaccination has been one of the most effective tools of this  
century for preventing disease and death, according to the CDC. 
Because childhood vaccination levels in the United States are at an 
all-time high, disease and death from diphtheria, pertussis, 
tetanus and measles are at or near record lows. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, according to the CDC, there was only one reported  
case of diptheria, 100 reported cases of measles, and no reported 
cases of wild poliovirus for 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Jeffrey Koplan, the CDC director, said while he was pleased  
with the progress, ``the data also show there are still many 
children who are not adequately immunized.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We must remember. . . the viruses and bacteria that cause  
vaccine preventable diseases still circulate in the United States -- 
they just do so at very low levels.''

<HEADLINE> Pan American Basketball Coach Fired </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDINBURG, Texas (AP) -- Delray Brooks officially became a fired  
coach when Texas-Pan American officials denied the appeal of his 
dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, James Langabeer, Texas-Pan American's vice  
president for business affairs, upheld athletic director Bill 
Weidner's decision to fire Brooks late last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Langabeer's decision came four days after a termination hearing  
was held for Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unfortunate,'' Brooks said Wednesday night. ``I haven't  
done anything wrong. Unfortunately, it has come to that. The ones 
that have suffered the most are the players. This has taken a lot 
out of me and my family. It's an unfortunate set of circumstances 
in which I haven't done anything wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A news conference was scheduled Friday during which the school  
is to hire a replacement. The (McAllen) Monitor reported Thursday 
that Bob Hoffman of Oklahoma Baptist was expected to be hired. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks was fired on Aug. 23 because school officials believe  
that he deposited a check from Southwest Missouri State for $25,000 
into his personal account and then made withdrawals from the 
account. 
</P>
<P>
	During the hearing, Brooks acknowledged that $25,000 was placed  
in his account last December, but denied that he deposited it or 
that he told someone else to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter obtained by The Monitor, Langabeer wrote to Brooks'  
lawyer saying the coach didn't produce convincing evidence as to 
who might have deposited the check and also noted that Brooks did 
not return the money. 
</P>
<P>
	Hidalgo County District Attorney Rene Guerra has said he will  
seek a grand jury indictment against Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks played at Indiana and Providence, and was an assistant  
for five years at Kentucky before being hired by Texas-Pan American 
in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Bucs' Dilfer Returns to Practice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Trent Dilfer's sore right shoulder felt  
better Thursday and the Tampa Bay quarterback returned to practice 
for this week's game against the Denver Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
	``Trent's going to be fine,'' coach Tony Dungy said. ``He was  
able to go through the whole practice and throw. He probably had a 
little discomfort, but he'll be OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dilfer, who has made 68 consecutive starts, sat most of  
Wednesday's practice because of what he said an MRI exam showed was 
swelling in the rotator cuff. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's significantly better from (Wednesday),'' Dilfer said.  
``Our trainers did a good job of treating it ... and I threw 
without a whole lot of discomfort.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Democratic National Committee's new  
designated leader has some choice words to describe his Republican 
rivals: ``Decent people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia Mayor Edward Rendell officially accepted his  
nomination as general party chairman Thursday by promising a civil 
approach to the 2000 elections. 
</P>
<P>
	``Republicans aren't bad people,'' he said. ``They're decent  
people -- good Americans -- and want the same things for this country 
as we do. We disagree how to reach those goals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton offered him the job Wednesday night and the  
full DNC is expected to sign off Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	He has good reason to sweet-talk Republicans. His city will host  
the 2000 Republican national convention, and Rendell said he will 
maintain his commitments to the GOP -- including raising money for 
their convention. 
</P>
<P>
	He called himself a good friend of GOP chairman Jim Nicholson.  
</P>
<P>
	Rendell also may seek statewide office in 2002 in Pennsylvania,  
an increasingly conservative state where voters may not appreciate 
partisan rhetoric. 
</P>
<P>
	State reporters pressed him about how he would balance his  
duties as mayor. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one in Philadelphia will be shortchanged,'' said Rendell,  
whose term expires in January 2000. And as party chairman, the 
mayor said he will be in a better position to lobby Washington on 
behalf of Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	Rendell was hired to raise money, a response to mounting  
concerns that Republican front-runner George W. Bush's fund-raising 
prowess will bury the Democratic presidential nominee. Roy Romer, 
the party's top spokesman and current general chairman, was moved 
to the 2000 convention staff to make room for Rendell. 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor said his fund-raising goal was to collect ``as much as  
we can legally raise.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Rendell said he will not take sides in the presidential  
nomination race. 
</P>
<P>
	Too late.  
</P>
<P>
	He endorsed Vice President Al Gore long before being considered  
for the party post. 
</P>
<P>
	Trying to make amends as the party boss, Rendell called former  
New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, Gore's only rival and a good friend. 
Yet he was quick to defend Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Told that Sen. Patrick Moynihan of New York not only endorsed  
Bradley on Thursday but said Gore couldn't get elected president, 
Rendell said Moynihan was ``dead wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic activists have gotten some bad news about rural  
voters. They're turning Republican. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Gersh, a leading party pollster, told DNC members that  
Democratic House candidates were backed by just 38 percent of rural 
voters in 1998, down from 52 percent in 1990 and 48 percent in 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The figure was even lower than 1994, a bad year for Democrats,  
when the party's House candidates received 43 percent of the rural 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
	If Democrats had done as well in rural America in 1998 as they  
did in 1994, Republicans would have lost control of the House, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans are appealing to rural voters' concerns about  
declining values in America, Gersh said 
</P>
<P>
	``Democrats tend to do better in rural (areas) ... when voters  
are worried about the economy as opposed to these cultural issues 
that are really vexing to the Democratic Party in rural areas,'' he 
said. ``I think we have suffered from this cultural divide that is 
occurring in this country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an afternoon-long conference on the topic, the Rev. Jesse  
Jackson said the party needs to make sure more Wall Street 
investment goes to rural America. ``Our mission is to build 
vehicles to transport capital from Wall Street to Appalachia to the 
Delta, to the Bread Basket, and to the fields of Southern 
California. Rural America has money, markets and talent -- but these 
assets are not seen by the national financial community.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	With all the emphasis on 2000, some Democrats are wondering if  
the DNC is paying attention to the handful of 1999 elections -- 
including governor's elections in Kentucky, Mississippi and 
Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Andrew, in charge of the DNC's day-to-day operations, said  
as much money will be spent on the 1999 contests as was spent in 
1995 -- the year before the last presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
	Party officials said more than $1 million was spent on the  
contests in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Though some Democrats say there is little sign yet that the DNC  
is spending as much, Andrew said, ``So far, we have spent the same 
amount as we did in 1995.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	One sign of how much Vice President Al Gore has the DNC in his  
corner: Gore supporters are circulating a party resolution slapping 
down his rival's gay-rights proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	The resolution, which party members meeting in Washington will  
vote on Saturday, essentially disapproves of former New Jersey Sen. 
Bill Bradley's proposal to expand the 1964 Civil Rights Act 
protections to gays and lesbians. Critics warn that opening that 
law to amendment now would give the Republican-led Congress a 
chance to gut its protections against racial, gender and religious 
discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley is waging an insurgent's challenge to Gore for the 2000  
presidential nomination. On gay rights, Gore supports the narrower 
-- more achievable, he says -- Employment Non-Discrimination Act, or 
ENDA, pending in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	A draft resolution pushed by Gore supporters at Thursday's DNC  
meetings read: 
</P>
<P>
	``The DNC reaffirms its support of the Civil Rights Act of 1964  
and for ENDA and would urge that the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which 
is the benchmark for all other civil rights bills, not be reopened 
for debate or amendments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley campaign spokesman Eric Hauser called it ``an  
unfortunate political tactic designed to divide the party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Bill Bradley's commitment to racial justice is absolute and  
there is nothing that he would ever allow to undermine protections 
for African-Americans,'' Hauser said.

<HEADLINE> Lawyer: Swissair Knew of Dangers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- An attorney contends both Swissair and the  
manufacturer of MD-11 aircraft knew at least seven years before the 
crash of Flight 111 that wiring aboard the plane posed a fire 
hazard. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Lee Kreindler said evidence shows the airline and the  
manufacturer, McDonnell Douglas -- which was bought by Boeing in 
1997 -- knew that insulation on the plane's wiring could wear down 
in ordinary use and pose a fire danger. 
</P>
<P>
	``That goes to the heart of why the manufacturers are liable,  
and conceivably liable for punitive damages,'' Kreindler said. The 
allegations were filed in federal court Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The exact source of a fire aboard the plane has not been  
identified. Flight 111, flying from New York to Geneva, crashed off 
Nova Scotia on Sept. 2, 1998, killing all 229 people aboard. 
</P>
<P>
	Just before Flight 111 crashed, the pilots mentioned a strange  
smell in the cabin and then complained of dense smoke. Canadian 
investigators later found heat-damaged wiring on the wrecked plane, 
prompting U.S. air safety officials in January to recommend that 
airlines inspect all MD-11 planes for electrical problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Holland, an attorney representing Swissair, Boeing and  
Delta -- which had a ticket-sharing arrangement with Swissair -- did 
not return a message seeking comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyers have argued that the Death on the High Seas Act  
applies to the case, a law that only allows for the recovery of 
compensatory damages, or real losses associated with income and 
medical costs, and not punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for the plaintiffs have rejected a settlement package  
worth about $300 million in compensatory damages for family members 
of those killed, saying they believe they can get $1 billion in 
punitive damages from a jury. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs' court documents maintain that when Swissair  
bought the plane in 1991, the dangers of the wire coating and 
insulation were well known. The products were made by DuPont Co., 
which is being sued separately.

<HEADLINE> Teachers Seek Better Tech Content </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) -- Teachers are getting more computers in  
their classrooms, but they have to wade through stacks of CD-ROMS 
and computer diskettes that do not meet their students' needs, a 
report said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	While government officials declare school technology a national  
mission and pledge to connect every classroom to the Internet, they 
are not investing enough time and money in software, the report 
concludes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Technology Counts,'' a survey of the nation's teachers and  
state education technology policies, appeared in the newspaper 
Education Week. ``Politicians wire the classrooms and think they 
are done,'' publisher Virginia Edwards said. ``But that's not the 
case at all. 
</P>
<P>
	Teachers reported that the available learning software material  
does not match state or school district standardized tests, cannot 
run on underpowered classroom computers, consumes too much 
instruction time and can cost too much. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't give many of the (software) titles a 9 or a 10,''  
says Ed Adshead, a network resource teacher who helps colleagues 
with computers at Patrick Henry Elementary School in suburban 
Washington. ``We have to hunt for it and then we find it isn't 
nearly as good as it looked like or what it was described as.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, 71 percent of the nation's 86,000 schools can reach the  
Internet from at least one classroom. On average, the report said, 
nearly six students -- there are 53.2 million nationwide -- match up 
for every one ``instructional computer,'' which includes older 
models without extras such as sound cards and video. 
</P>
<P>
	Cost is a problem in effectively using computers, 80 percent of  
the teachers surveyed said. Also, 47 percent said their computers 
were too weak for the best software. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's more expensive to fix these than to buy new ones,'' said  
Adshead, pointing to a cart of assorted outdated computer parts. 
</P>
<P>
	At Patrick Henry, which has a $4,000 annual computer software  
budget, teachers buy products with their own money and enlist the 
PTA's help in fund raising. Recently, they hauled 250 donated 
computers in their cars. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are at a distinct advantage when you look at what we do  
have,'' says fifth-grade teacher Melinda Jones. ``We all attended 
the workshops, but it's all about taking time to find what we need 
and getting the support to do it really consistently.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Software problems are not insurmountable, according to the  
Education Department, which awards grants to schools for technology 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole landscape has changed,'' said Linda G. Roberts, the  
department's director of technology. ``Publishers are very serious 
about developing content for the schools. The challenge is in 
developing high quality content and that takes money and knowledge 
about how students learn, and it takes very clear signals from the 
buyers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other findings in the report:  
</P>
<P>
	--30 percent of schools have a full-time technology coordinator,  
while 27 percent add this responsibility to a current employee's 
duties. 
</P>
<P>
	--42 states require that teacher preparation programs include  
technology, but just four require technology in teacher 
re-certification. 
</P>
<P>
	--23 states have group-purchasing plans for schools to buy  
classroom software, which can cost $600 to $1,000 per title. 
</P>
<P>
	--Four states developed some software lessons to match the  
standards they have set for learning goals by grades. Eight states 
put such content on Web sites. 
</P>
<P>
	The teachers' survey was based on 1,407 responses from a  
representative sample of 15,000 kindergarten-through 12th-grade 
teachers. The margin of error is plus or minus 3 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	The third annual report tracking state policies and funding of  
school technology was underwritten by The Milken Family Foundation 
of Santa Monica, Calif.

<HEADLINE> Senate Clash Leave Bench Vacancies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the long Senate dispute over confirmation  
of President Clinton's nominees to be federal judges, there are 
hostages on both sides now. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats blocked approval of a nominee sponsored by Sen. Orrin  
Hatch, the Republican chairman who presides over the process. They 
insisted that Republicans agree to action on two long-stalled 
appeals court nominees, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither side would yield, all three were blocked at the impasse,  
until Senate leaders can agree on a way out. 
</P>
<P>
	So the judging of judges is itself stalled.  
</P>
<P>
	That happened as a bipartisan reform panel complained about  
partisan wrangling in the selection of judges, and said ``it is 
time to lower the temperature of the debate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, it may be going up.  
</P>
<P>
	Behind it is the opposition of GOP conservatives to Clinton  
judges they deem too liberal and likely activists on the bench. 
There has been grumbling on the right that Hatch is too willing to 
lead Clinton nominees through the Judiciary Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The Constitution Project task force on judicial selection urged  
an end to partisan wrangling over judges, and said the whole 
process should be streamlined to avoid extended vacancies on the 
bench. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch said the vacancy rate is 7.6 percent, lower than the  
average. There are 64 judgeships unfilled, and 44 Clinton 
nominations awaiting Senate action. 
</P>
<P>
	They may be waiting for a while. After his nominee was blocked  
Tuesday, Hatch said he was disappointed that the Democrats ``would 
refused to avoid a filibuster of one of the nominees of its own 
administration.'' The nominee, Ted Stewart, was Hatch's choice. 
</P>
<P>
	When Clinton did not nominate him for a Salt Lake City opening,  
Hatch, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, stopped holding 
hearings on judicial nominees early this year. He resumed them on 
Clinton's assurance that Stewart, a former Hatch aide, would be 
nominated, as he was on July 27. The committee approved it three 
days later. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the Democrats will not let the Senate vote on Stewart  
without a GOP guarantee there also will be votes on Richard Paez 
and Marsha Berzon, long-held nominees to be appeals court judges in 
California. Paez, first nominated in 1996, and Berzon, named early 
in 1998, have been approved by the committee, but Senate votes are 
being blocked by the anonymous objections of some Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	On party line votes, each side blocked the other from lifting  
the threat of filibusters against the nominations. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch then said he had intended to have the committee hold more  
confirmation hearings this fall, but may not. ``We shall have to 
re-examine the best way to move forward on judicial nominees so 
that we eliminate the double standard,'' he said after the 
Democrats blocked Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democrats contend the double standard is in the opposite  
direction, that Stewart was moved ahead of 30 nominees awaiting 
confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House joined the debate on Wednesday, with Clinton's  
spokesman saying the Senate should vote people up or down without 
``preferential treatment for one candidate that they have a 
particular interest in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Press Secretary Joe Lockhart the White House wants to ``work  
through this impasse expeditiously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That is what the broader dispute is about. Clinton has  
complained at Senate delays he blames for a ``mounting vacancy 
crisis'' in federal courts. Hatch counters that his committee is 
handling nominations fairly and thoroughly. 
</P>
<P>
	Seventeen judges have been confirmed by the Senate this year.  
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the senior Democrat on the  
Judiciary Committee, says confirmation delays are dismal and 
getting worse. He said the average time from nomination to 
confirmation of 65 judges in 1998 was more than 230 days. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Constitution Project study showed Clinton delays, too,  
saying the administration has taken an average of 315 days after 
judgeships open to choose nominees to fill them. 
</P>
<P>
	That task force endorsed timetable goals: 180 days for  
presidents to choose judicial nominees, then 60 days for the Senate 
to act. 
</P>
<P>
	But reform studies come and go, with little or no impact.  
</P>
<P>
	Beyond the current snarl, there is no likelihood of a speedup in  
the Senate process in 2000, before the election that could put a 
Republican president in charge of choosing judges. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
	MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- Nick Davis is a small-town guy with a  
big-time talent for returning kicks. 
</P>
<P>
	He grew up in Manchester, Mich., a town of 1,700 about 20 miles  
southwest of Ann Arbor, a speck in the shadow of the Michigan 
Wolverines' Big House. After a spectacular high school career, he 
was Michigan's for the asking. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wolverines didn't ask, however, and he found a happy home at  
Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, a sophomore who is also the Badgers' leading receiver  
this season, would like to show the Wolverines the error of their 
ways when No. 20 Wisconsin plays host to No. 4 Michigan on 
Saturday. He had 400 supporters in the crowd last season when the 
Badgers played at Michigan, and expects even more this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole town of Manchester is going to be over here,  
probably,'' he said with a bashful grin. ``It's an incentive, let's 
just say that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other games involving the top 10, it's No. 1 Florida State at  
North Carolina, Indiana at No. 2 Penn State, No. 3 Florida at 
Kentucky, Southern Mississippi at No. 5 Texas A&AMP;M, No. 6 Nebraska 
at Missouri, Memphis at No. 7 Tennessee and No. 9 Miami at East 
Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	In the second 10, it's Central Florida at No. 11 Georgia,  
Cincinnati at No. 12 Ohio State, Northwestern at No. 13 Purdue, No. 
14 Arkansas at Alabama, No. 15 Kansas State at Iowa State, No. 16 
Southern California at Oregon, Virginia at No. 17 BYU, No. 18 UCLA 
at Stanford and No. 19 Michigan State at Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	In other ranked games, it's Temple at No. 21 Marshall, No. 22  
Texas at Baylor; South Carolina at No. 23 Mississippi State; 
Wyoming at No. 24 Air Force and No. 25 North Carolina State at Wake 
Forest. 
</P>
<P>
	After three games, Davis ranks third in the nation with 19.5  
yards per punt return and fifth with 35.8 yards per kickoff return. 
He's the only player in the country in the top 10 in both 
categories, and already has one touchdown on each type of return. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis grew up longing to play in Michigan's maize and blue. As a  
running back in high school, he amassed more than 6,900 all-purpose 
yards and 69 touchdowns. Early on, however, he suspected he had a 
talent for returning kicks, and hoped the Wolverines would see it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was so interested in Michigan that I didn't really pay  
attention to any other Big Ten schools,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan seemed keenly interested in him at first, but Davis'  
stock fell after the Wolverines won the 1997 national championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every time you have something like that in a program, you get  
your top choices of recruits, and I kept sliding down their list,'' 
he recalled. ``They told me that I'd better start looking 
elsewhere, so I did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin and Michigan State showed interest, but only the  
Badgers promised him an immediate chance to return kicks. He came 
to Madison as a running back, but converted to receiver when coach 
Barry Alvarez said he'd have a better chance to play right away. 
</P>
<P>
	``We put him back there, and it was pretty obvious he was  
something special,'' Alvarez said. ``You're just happy when you see 
a kid with a knack for something like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's a knack developed through hard work and study. Davis claims  
there's no secret to his splendid return results, but his 
discussions of the subject reveal both confidence and preparation. 
</P>
<P>
	He and the coaches study videotapes of other teams' coverage  
squads, trying to anticipate the movements of all 11 players. He 
relies on his first three steps -- unusually quick, even for a kick 
returner -- to get him past the coverage team's sprinters and into 
the second wave of tacklers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just about catching the ball first and knowing where the  
holes are most likely to be,'' he said. ``There's 10 or 11 guys 
coming straight at you, and the field is 53 yards wide. There's 
going to be some seams. You have control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In three games, he also has seven catches for 147 yards. He has  
463 all-purpose yards, more than any Badgers player except running 
back Ron Dayne. Davis would have even more if an 81-yard punt 
return for a touchdown last week against Cincinnati hadn't been 
called back by a penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever his fortunes, Davis will always have the support of his  
hometown. Manchester held Nick Davis Day during his freshman 
season, when he led the Big Ten in punt returns. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee, coming off a 23-21 loss to Florida, hasn't lost  
consecutive games since 1994. The Tigers' 1996 upset of the 
then-No. 6 Vols in Memphis still bothers Tennessee. At the time, 
coach Philip Fulmer called it ``the most disappointing game I've 
coached'' and Vols coaches still point to it as an example of why 
an opponent should never be overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas A&AMP;M (2-0) will face the stiffest test for its newfound  
offense against Southern Mississippi (2-1), which uses a scrambling 
and confusing defense that almost got the Golden Eagles an upset of 
No. 6 Nebraska last week, before falling 20-13.

<HEADLINE> Kurd Rebels To Surrender Fighters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- Heeding a call by their imprisoned leader,  
Kurdish rebels said Thursday they were sending a group of fighters 
to surrender to Turkish soldiers to prove that the group was 
sincere in its call for peace. 
</P>
<P>
	``In response to ... comrade Abdullah Ocalan's request and call,  
we are sending a group for peace and a democratic solution to 
Turkey,'' said a rebel statement faxed to news organizations from 
Brussels, Belgium. It said the rebels would carry letters to 
Turkish leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Ocalan called on fighters of his Kurdistan Workers' Party or PKK  
to give themselves up as an ``expression of goodwill'' Wednesday. 
His lawyer, Irfan Dundar, said the rebel leader was hoping that 10 
to 50 guerrillas would surrender. 
</P>
<P>
	The PKK statement did not say how many fighters would surrender  
nor when the group would arrive in Turkey. PKK officials reached in 
Brussels and in Germany said they had no information when the 
surrender would take place. 
</P>
<P>
	Ocalan made his call after the Turkish military dismissed a  
peace overture by the rebels as a tactical ploy. The PKK announced 
last month that it was pulling fighters out of Turkey to pave the 
way for peace, but the military said the rebels were merely 
retreating to spend the winter in nearby bases. 
</P>
<P>
	Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit welcomed Ocalan's call  
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the armed militants abandon their arms and surrender  
themselves to justice, then this would be a positive development,'' 
Ecevit said. 
</P>
<P>
	``All kinds of tolerance will be shown,'' he said, referring to  
a recently enacted law that allows for the pardoning of fighters 
who surrender and provide information on the guerrilla group. 
</P>
<P>
	A Turkish court sentenced Ocalan to death for treason and  
separatism in June. 
</P>
<P>
	The PKK has said that about one-fourth of an estimated 1,500  
Kurdish rebels have pulled out of Turkey. Their withdrawal 
apparently is being hampered by soldiers who have opened fire on 
the retreating fighters. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 37,000 people, mostly Kurds, have been killed as a result  
of the 15-year fight between rebels and Turkish soldiers.

<HEADLINE> Senate Blocks Oil Royalty Overhaul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A proposed increase in royalties on oil taken  
from federal land is being postponed another year, though critics 
say the current fee system is depriving the government of millions 
of dollars every month. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil-state senators were successful Thursday in inserting a  
provision into a $14 billion Interior Department spending bill that 
prohibits the department from making changes in the royalty system 
for at least another year. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, called it a victory ``for  
unfair taxation'' on an economically shellshocked industry that 
``can't afford another price shock imposed by Washington.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But opponents to Hutchison's amendment, which was approved  
51-47, said it means giant, profitable oil companies will continue 
to shortchange the taxpayer when taking oil or gas from federal 
land or from offshore wells. 
</P>
<P>
	``This allows the oil companies to continue this cozy  
arrangement where they decide what they're going to pay the federal 
government,'' complained Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., who waged a 
weeklong campaign against the amendment. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote on Hutchison's amendment cleared the way for a final  
approval of the spending bill that provides money for the Interior 
Department as well as energy conservation, forest programs and 
subsidies for the arts. The bill was passed 89-10 and now must be 
reconciled with a House-approved version. 
</P>
<P>
	For two years the Interior Department has been trying to impose  
new regulations on how oil from federal lands is valued, claiming 
that under the current system oil companies routinely undervalue 
the oil and deprive the government of as much as $5.6 million in 
royalties a month. 
</P>
<P>
	The government collects about $1.2 billion from the 12.5 percent  
oil royalty each year and millions of more dollars from natural gas 
taken from federal land. The Interior proposal would require that 
oil value be pegged to a fair market indictor instead of oil 
companies setting the value arbitrary at the wellhead. 
</P>
<P>
	But oil-state senators argued the change amounts to an  
additional tax and is so complicated that it would end up 
overcharging the oil companies. They argued a better system could 
be developed. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, the oil companies would like to adopt a barter  
system in which they would give the government oil in kind instead 
of a cash royalty. Interior officials say that's good in some 
cases, but not all. 
</P>
<P>
	Interior's proposal is ``a scheme that is unnecessarily  
complicated, unworkable and absurd,'' insisted Sen. Pete Domenici, 
R-N.M., co-sponsor of the amendment. ``It's federal government 
mooching.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchison twice before had been successful in blocking the new  
regulations -- in 1998 and again this year -- but both times it was 
done quietly during negotiations in a House-Senate conference. For 
the first time, the issue was debated openly on the Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
	And Democrats took full advantage. Boxer blocked attempts to cut  
off debate last week. Thursday morning Hutchison mustered the 60 
votes to bring the matter to a close, but not until Democrats got 
another six hours of floor time. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're out here on the floor because we want people to know ...  
these oil companies have been cheating,'' declared Sen. Paul 
Wellstone, D-Minn. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics of the current system say oil companies now undervalue  
the oil by as much as $4 to $5 a barrel -- as much as $68 million a 
year, according to Interior Department estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	Boxer maintained that the oil companies themselves have  
acknowledged manipulating the numbers when calculating the value of 
the federal oil and gas. 
</P>
<P>
	A half-dozen oil companies in a lawsuit being heard in Texas  
have settled to avoid trial, paying $230 million because they 
allegedly undervalued oil, she said.

<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- When Hootie &AMP; the Blowfish took to the stage at  
San Diego State University this week, it wasn't just to rock 'n' 
roll. 
</P>
<P>
	The musicians waxed scholarly, offering a free one-hour lecture  
titled, ``Careers in Rock Bands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite winning two Grammy Awards and selling more than 18  
million albums, the group only attracted 40 students. But they 
didn't seem to mind.

<P>
	``We don't walk around in fancy clothes and ride in limos,''  
said Mark Bryan, the group's lead guitarist. ``It's just not us. To 
sell 2 million copies of (the 1998 album) 'Musical Chairs' is still 
fantastic to us. What a place to level off.''

<HEADLINE> 2nd Supremacist Gets Death Penalty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRYAN, Texas (AP) -- A jury decided Thursday that racist  
ex-convict Lawrence Russell Brewer should pay with his life for the 
dragging death of a black man, sending him to death row to join a 
buddy who also took part in the crime. 
</P>
<P>
	After 14 hours of deliberations over two days, the jury rejected  
arguments that a life sentence would be adequate punishment for 
Brewer, 32. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not a death penalty fan, but this is a situation where if  
you don't give the death penalty to this man, he'll hurt and kill 
again,'' Jasper County District Attorney Guy James Gray said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brewer's former prison buddy, John William King, 24, is already  
on death row, convicted in February in the murder of James Byrd Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrd, 49, was chained at the ankles to a pickup truck and  
dragged to to pieces in the East Texas town of Jasper last year in 
one of the nation's grisliest crimes since the civil rights era. 
</P>
<P>
	A third man, Shawn Allen Berry, 24, goes on trial next month.  
Prosecutors will seek the death penalty in that case, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Brewer and King were organizing a white  
supremacist organization and wanted to do something dramatic to 
give their group publicity. Brewer later bragged about the crime in 
jailhouse letters. 
</P>
<P>
	Brewer showed little reaction to the verdict, pursing his lips  
slightly. His mother, Helen, who along with her husband had pleaded 
with the jury to spare his life, dabbed her face with a 
handkerchief. 
</P>
<P>
	The jurors, who convicted Brewer on Monday, told the judge they  
would not discuss the case with reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Brewer testified that he only tried to kick Byrd as Byrd and  
King fought. He said Berry slit the man's throat with a knife and 
he didn't realize Berry had chained Byrd to the bumper until they 
began driving away. 
</P>
<P>
	DNA evidence showed Byrd's blood on the shoes of all three men.  
</P>
<P>
	In jailhouse letters introduced into evidence, Brewer referred  
to the murder and boasted about ``rolling a tire,'' which 
prosecutors said was a derogatory term for assaulting a black 
person. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, I did it,'' Brewer wrote. ``And no longer am I a virgin.  
It was a rush and I'm still licking my lips for more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brewer also wrote King after their arrests, saying that they had  
become ``bigger stars'' than O.J. Simpson and that a life sentence 
would do them no justice. Brewer wrote that lethal injection would 
be ``a little old sleeping medicine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	King was tried in Jasper, but Brewer's case was moved to Bryan,  
about 150 miles west, because of intense publicity.

	With 1,742 hits so far in the 1990s and 10 games left, Grace has  
a chance to join the Hit King and the four Hall of Famers on that 
list of decade hits leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to get it. I'd like to get the most hits, the most  
doubles. That'd be nice,'' said Grace, who trailed Rafael Palmeiro 
of the Texas Rangers by one hit before Thursday's games. ``Robin 
Yount was the '80s, Pete Rose the '70s -- that's some pretty good 
company.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's certainly not a group Grace expected to join. He was the  
Chicago Cubs' 24th-round draft pick in 1985, not exactly the place 
where teams find the future of their franchises 
</P>
<P>
	But he won the Midwest League batting title in 1986, hitting  
.342. The next year, he was the Eastern League's MVP with a 
league-high 101 RBIs. On May 2, 1988, he was called up to the Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
	``They probably thought I'd help them in A ball for a couple of  
years and then send me back to San Diego or something,'' Grace 
said. ``My expectations were, `Hey, here's my opportunity and I've 
got to take advantage of it.' Twenty-fourth-rounders don't get the 
breaks that the high picks get. We've got to make our own breaks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had to make it happen and make it happen fast,'' he said.  
``I just drove myself to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grace may not have the gaudy numbers of Tony Gwynn, and he  
doesn't have the talent of Ken Griffey Jr. What he does have is 
amazing consistency and a work ethic that constantly drives him. 
</P>
<P>
	He got his 2,000th hit on Aug. 2. He's hitting .300 for the  
ninth time in 11 seasons. He has 1,232 singles and 360 doubles in 
the 1990s, both second-highest in the decade. He's won four Gold 
Gloves. He's only the second Cub to be the opening-day starter at 
the same position for an entire decade. 
</P>
<P>
	On the mornings after a night game, he's one of the first Cubs  
to make the trek across the field to the batting cages. He's 
usually one of the last to leave the clubhouse, sitting around with 
a few teammates to rehash the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing I'm doing that other guys probably aren't  
doing. I just love to play,'' Grace said. ``What drives me is 
competing. The best players in the world, you get to play against 
them every day and that's what drives me. I want to be one of the 
best of the best. That's it, pretty much, in a nutshell.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So what does make Grace such a good hitter? He's got a natural  
swing, teammate Gary Gaetti said. And like Gwynn and Wade Boggs, 
who both reached 3,000 hits this season, Grace watches the ball 
longer than most players, Cubs manager Jim Riggleman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They stay inside the ball a long time to evaluate ball and  
strike,'' Riggleman said. ``They make good decisions about what to 
swing at and what not to swing at.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Riggleman calls the decade hits record as significant as  
the home run or batting titles, Grace's run at the '90s mark has 
been overshadowed by The Great Home Run Race, Part II. With the 
Cubs so far down in the standings it's not even worth talking 
about, most fans go to games just to see if Sammy Sosa will hit 
another home run. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mark is tied for the most hits in the decade and people aren't  
sticking around to see if he's getting that hit,'' Riggleman said. 
``I don't think that they're quite aware of the magnitude of this 
feat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added teammate Glenallen Hill, ``I can't put it into words. To  
actually get a major league hit is tough. To put together the most 
hits in the 1990s is just incredible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Equally incredible is that Grace has managed to do it all in one  
uniform. While Sosa may be the heart of the Cubs these days, Grace 
is their soul. He's Mr. Cub of the '90s, right down to the Wrigley 
Field ivy painted on his Harley-Davidson. 
</P>
<P>
	He's played for six managers and watched dozens of teammates  
come and go. He played with Greg Maddux, Rick Sutcliffe, Andre 
Dawson, Shawon Dunston and Ryne Sandberg. Only equipment manager 
Yosh Kawano has been with the Cubs longer. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a little, small fraternity that I'm in, and there's  
some awfully, awfully good players in that fraternity: Gwynn, (Cal) 
Ripken, (Barry) Larkin, Chuck Finley, (Craig) Biggio,'' Grace said. 
``It's not so much one team, it's this team. This is my home. This 
is where I belong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And maybe soon, he'll belong with Boudreau, Ashburn, Clemente,  
Rose and Yount.

<HEADLINE> IMF Head Says Relief for Poor Near </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The head of the International Monetary Fund  
said today the 182-nation lending agency is ``within striking 
distance'' of agreement on expanding debt relief to the world's 
poorest countries. 
</P>
<P>
	In a wide-ranging news conference, IMF Managing Director Michel  
Camdessus also defended his agency's handling of billions of 
dollars of loans for Russia, saying that ``nothing has been 
discovered which justifies these allegations'' of Russian 
corruption and money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
	Camdessus met with reporters as his agency and its sister  
lending institution, the World Bank, prepare for their annual 
meetings next week. In advance of those discussions, Treasury 
Secretary Lawrence Summers and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan 
Greenspan will be hosts for a gathering Saturday of finance 
ministers and central bank presidents of the world's seven largest 
economies -- the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, 
Italy and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF-World Bank annual meetings are taking place in a vastly  
different environment than a year ago when the sudden collapse of 
the Russian ruble and the near failure of a large U.S. hedge fund 
threatened to trigger a global recession. 
</P>
<P>
	But with the IMF boosting its forecasts for economic growth,  
Camdessus said a major goal of this year's discussions will be to 
continue fighting to implement global financial reforms aimed at 
making future crises less likely. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no room for complacency. This is a time for pushing  
ahead with structural changes,'' Camdessus said. 
</P>
<P>
	Camdessus said he hopes the IMF and major donor countries will  
agree on increasing to $90 billion the debt relief made available 
to 41 of the world's poorest nations, many of them in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	The complex financing arrangement would involve revaluation of  
14 million ounces of the IMF's huge gold reserves from $47 per 
ounce, the current value on the IMF's books, to world market 
prices, currently more than $250. The extra money would be invested 
and the proceeds of that would be used to finance the IMF's 
contribution to the $90 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are within striking distance'' of an agreement which could  
be announced at the conclusion of discussions on Monday, Camdessus 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	As to allegations of widespread money laundering and corruption  
in Russia, Camdessus said the IMF's own review of its loan program 
with Russia had uncovered no irregularities. 
</P>
<P>
	While the IMF is continuing its review, he indicated the agency  
is prepared to extend the next installment of $4.5 billion in loans 
to Russia this year, since the country is currently exceeding the 
economic requirements the IMF imposed as a condition for getting 
the money. ``Russia is a program that works,'' Camdessus said. 
</P>
<P>
	Camdessus was more critical of another big borrower, Indonesia,  
sayng the IMF program with that country will remain suspended until 
the situation in East Timor stabilizes and the Indonesian 
government produces a report answering allegations of corruption at 
the Bank of Bali. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope the authorities will soon release the documents (on  
the Bank of Bali) and allow us to continue with our work,'' 
Camdessus said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said that the  
United States had won approval from other nations for creation of a 
new Group of 20 -- consisting of rich nations and developing 
countries who will meet regularly to review economic reform 
proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to creation of the new group, the G-7 officials are  
expected to review a recent sharp drop in the value of the dollar 
in relation to the Japanese yen, including a discussion of whether 
the G-7 countries should intervene jointly in currency markets to 
bolster the U.S. currency. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF, issuing an updated economic forecast, predicted the  
global economy will expand by 3 percent this year and 3.5 percent 
in 2000, but it cautioned that a sudden plunge in either the U.S. 
stock market or the dollar could derail this forecast. 
</P>
<P>
	World Bank President James Wolfensohn told reporters Wednesday  
that IMF and World Bank officials have already launched an effort 
to coordinate their activities more closely to respond to criticism 
during the past two years when the lending institutions worked to 
assemble more than $100 billion in support during the global 
currency crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a major step forward and our contribution to reforming  
the international financial architecture,'' Wolfensohn said. ``It's 
also an answer to people who say we should be merged or fired or 
closed down.''

<HEADLINE> Oil Price Stabilization Proposed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Costa Rican President Miguel Angel Rodriguez  
urged steps to stabilize oil prices Thursday, saying wide 
fluctuations serve the interests of neither producers nor 
consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech to the Organization of American States' permanent  
council, Rodriguez suggested that the OAS take a lead role in 
achieving this goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez spoke in the presence of other leaders from Central  
America and the Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is necessary that the major oil producers adjust their oil  
production quotas to avoid the possibility that prices become 
prohibitively high for many countries without provoking an 
unreasonable price decrease.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He recommended creation of a system of ``bands'' within which  
prices could fluctuate. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the price closed in on the upper limit, the producers would  
automatically increase production, and it would be cut back if the 
price neared the lower limit,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez expressed concern that price increases resulting from  
production cuts by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting 
Countries seriously damaging the economies of small, poor 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``These countries should unite to work for the common good and  
offer help to those which are most needy and not accumulate 
fleeting fortunes at the cost of misery for many,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Group Sues To Protect Nine Species </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- An environmental group has sued the U.S.  
Fish and Wildlife Service to protect the California tiger 
salamander and nine other species in the West. 
</P>
<P>
	The Center for Biological Diversity wants to compel the agency  
to list the animals under the federal Endangered Species Act. The 
lawsuit was filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	The center claims the agency has delayed protecting the animals  
even though they are on the brink of extinction and the act 
requires the agency to determine what action is warranted within 
two years of being petitioned. 
</P>
<P>
	The center says the delay has reached nearly 15 years for some  
species. 
</P>
<P>
	Jane Hendron, spokeswoman for the Fish and Wildlife office in  
Ventura, Calif., said the agency had not seen the lawsuit, and she 
could not comment on the specifics of the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Fish and Wildlife Service gets these petitions every day,  
nationwide,'' she said. ``We try to go through these things as 
quickly as we can, but we still need to employ good science.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the tiger salamander, which lives in California,  
the lawsuit includes the Columbia spotted frog in Idaho, Nevada and 
Oregon; the Oregon spotted frog in California, Oregon and 
Washington; Cagle's map turtle in Texas and six species of spring 
snails in New Mexico.

<HEADLINE> Deion Sanders Says He'll Play Oct. 3 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Deion Sanders has told Dallas Cowboys owner  
Jerry Jones that he plans to play in an Oct. 3 game at home against 
Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pro Bowl cornerback and kick returner did not play in the  
first two games or the exhibitions while nursing a damaged left big 
toe. He's been practicing the last few weeks after missing all of 
training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cowboys (2-0) have a bye this week.  
</P>
<P>
	``Deion is definitely playing against Arizona,'' Jones said.  
``He told me he was ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's only fitting Sanders is coming back to play the Cardinals  
since he was injured against them Nov. 15, and his first full game 
back was a January playoff loss against Arizona. He also played in 
the Pro Bowl before undergoing surgery in April. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones said he spoke with Sanders in the locker room following  
Monday night's victory over Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said, `Take a good look. You see me dressed in these street  
clothes? You won't see me in them any more. The next time you see 
me in here, I'll be uniform,''' Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders can earn a $1.5 million bonus if he plays in 70 percent  
of Dallas' defensive plays and makes the Pro Bowl. He's already the 
NFL's highest-paid defensive player this year at $6.5 million.

<HEADLINE> Dragging Defendant Sentenced To Die </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRYAN, Texas (AP) -- A white supremacist was sentenced today to  
die by lethal injection for dragging a black man to his death on a 
rural road. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawrence Russell Brewer is the second man to get the death  
penalty for the June 7, 1998, killing of James Byrd Jr., who was 
chained to the bumper of a pickup truck and dragged for three miles 
along a bumpy country road northeast of Jasper. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrd's sister, Mary Verrett, said her family was relieved.  
</P>
<P>
	``He had his day in court,'' she said. ``The jurors said what we  
want to say to him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brewer, 32, joins John William King, convicted in February, on  
death row. A third white supremacist, 24-year-old Shawn Allen 
Berry, will be tried next month. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brazos County jury that convicted Brewer on Monday  
deliberated for 14 hours Wednesday and today before deciding on a 
punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	State District Judge Monte Lawlis pronounced the sentence as  
Brewer's mother, seated behind her son in the courtroom, dabbed her 
eye with a tissue. 
</P>
<P>
	Brewer's attorney, Doug Barlow, said his client ``had resigned  
himself to this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He said to me, 'I'll be all right,''' Barlow said.  
</P>
<P>
	About an hour into their talks today, jurors asked to see photos  
of Brewer's tattoos, which include a burning cross, SS lightning 
bolts and Ku Klux Klan symbols. They also wanted a photo of Brewer 
with his family. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury on Wednesday reviewed some of Brewer's letters and a  
portion of his testimony that described events immediately 
preceding Byrd's death. 
</P>
<P>
	In his closing argument Wednesday, Jasper County District  
Attorney Guy James Gray said the facts of the slaying showed Brewer 
is a continuing danger and should be condemned. 
</P>
<P>
	``The degree of pain they were willing to inflict on this man is  
an indication of the degree of racial commitment,'' Gray said. 
</P>
<P>
	A defense attorney argued that Brewer, a convicted burglar, had  
no history of violence in prison and should get a life term. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecution contended Brewer was the racist ideologue who  
taught King and Berry his views, and that his position as ``Exalted 
Cyclops'' in a racist group showed the depth of his commitment to 
racism. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrd, a former vacuum cleaner salesman, was abducted early on  
June 7, 1998, and taken to a remote area northeast of Jasper. 
</P>
<P>
	His ankles were harnessed with a 24 1/2-foot logging chain to the  
bumper of a pickup truck and he was dragged for three miles. 
</P>
<P>
	His battered torso, minus his head, neck and an arm, was dumped  
between a black church and cemetery where it was found a few hours 
after daylight. 
</P>
<P>
	The circumstances of the crime provoked national outrage. In a  
jailhouse note to King last year while both were under arrest, 
Brewer appeared proud of what they had done. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do believe we are bigger stars, or should I say hero of the  
day, than what we ever expected,'' Brewer wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The case was moved to Bryan, about 150 miles west of Jasper,  
because of pretrial publicity.

<HEADLINE> A&AMP;M Was Right Choice for Receiver </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLLEGE STATION, Texas (AP) -- Chris Taylor had a choice: he  
could go to Rice and continue playing quarterback, or he could go 
to Texas A&AMP;M and switch to wide receiver, a position hardly 
prominent at a school known for defense and running backs. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he chose the Aggies and spectacular results followed.  
</P>
<P>
	He's been on a tear since catching an 81-yard touchdown pass  
that helped the Aggies beat Nebraska last season and he's off to a 
dramatic start this season as a key figure in No. 5 A&AMP;M's sudden 
passing success. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot to be said about confidence,'' offensive  
coordinator Steve Kragthorpe said. ``He made that big play at 
Nebraska and his confidence level took off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor has caught nine passes for 235 yards in two games this  
season. He has two TD catches, including a school record 96-yarder 
last week against Tulsa. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since that game at Nebraska, my confidence has skyrocketed,''  
Taylor said. ``Before, I had doubts that I was cut out to be a 
receiver. After that, the confidence took off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Aggies' (2-0) newfound offensive weapon will get its biggest  
test Saturday against Southern Mississippi (2-1), which uses a 
scrambling and confusing defense that almost got the Golden Eagles 
an upset of No. 6 Nebraska last week before losing 20-13. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know that Southern Mississippi is good,'' Taylor said.  
``Any team that can hold Nebraska within seven points in Lincoln 
has to be good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor was an all-around athlete at Madisonville High School. He  
played defensive back, quarterback, running back and kicker. He 
lettered in football, baseball, basketball and track and was a 
state qualifier in the 100-meter dash. 
</P>
<P>
	The Aggies were most attracted to his combination of speed and  
pass-catching ability. 
</P>
<P>
	``The big thing in me coming to A&AMP;M was being close to home with  
Madisonville just 40 minutes away,'' Taylor said. ``I could have 
stayed at quarterback and gone to Rice but I came to A&AMP;M. I don't 
get hit as much now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quarterback Randy McCown has benefited from the Aggies'  
bolstered passing attack and the addition of receivers like Taylor, 
Chris Cole and Bethel Johnson. Even 265-pound fullback Ja'Mar 
Toombs has two catches this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chris is a deep threat for us,'' McCown said. ``Our receiving  
corps as a whole has improved. They all want to be the best of that 
group so they're really competing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Aggies offense is ranked second in the nation, a big  
improvement over last season and their improved receiving has been 
a major factor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd give us a B-minus for last week,'' McCown said. ``It  
sounds goofy with us being ranked No. 2, but I'm not going to say 
we've arrived. We are still not where we need to be on offense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Southern Mississippi's defense has allowed only 40 points in  
three games and held Nebraska to 185 total yards.

<HEADLINE> Report: Trade Sanctions Affect U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- American companies are getting a reputation as  
unreliable exporters as a result of trade sanctions that were 
imposed on India and Pakistan after they tested nuclear devices, 
according to a government report. 
</P>
<P>
	The sanctions were triggered in May 1998 after both countries  
conducted underground nuclear tests in violation of international 
agreements. 
</P>
<P>
	The sanctions have had relatively little impact on either  
country or American exports, the U.S. International Trade 
Commission said in a report to be released today by the House Ways 
and Means Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has temporarily waived restrictions on the use  
of various federal aid, including credits and guarantees for the 
sale of agricultural products. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, according to the trade commission's report, the  
sanctions still ``have contributed to an increased perception of 
U.S. companies as unreliable international suppliers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Embassy in New Delhi reported that the sanctions  
``continue to have a negative impact on U.S. business in India as 
U.S. companies are reluctant to pursue business opportunities 
because of uncertainty over sanctions,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is more proof that unilateral sanctions aimed at other  
countries often have a boomerang effect on U.S. workers and our 
economy,'' said Rep. Phil Crane, R-Ill., ``In this case it was the 
Farm Belt, but who knows what U.S. industry will be next?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sanctions have cost India $320 million, Pakistan $57 million  
and the United States $161 million, the commission said. 
</P>
<P>
	The study is being released at the same time House and Senate  
negotiators have been debating legislation that would allow the 
sale of food and medicine to Cuba for the first time in four 
decades and make it harder for a president to impose future 
embargoes. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of trade sanctions say they represent the only weapon  
that the United States has to influence rogue nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart, R-Fla., is fighting the trade  
liberalization, saying it would signal a ``basic lack of commitment 
to fight terrorism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There is more to America than the drive to make money at any  
cost,'' said Diaz-Balart.

	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Calvary Lutheran Church offers worship  
services for the mentally disabled. 
</P>
<P>
	The nondenominational services called Faith and Light are  
conducted one Sunday afternoon each month at the church in the 
city's Bustleton section. They consist of Bible readings, prayer 
and music. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want disabled folks to feel like part of our community,''  
Pastor John Stabb said. ``Nobody thinks about their spiritual 
needs. We want them to feel comfortable praying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dolores Hoffman and her daughter Lynn have been attending the  
special services for six months. Lynn Hoffman, who suffers from 
Down syndrome, often leads others in song. 
</P>
<P>
	``She loves coming to the morning church service, but this  
service is for her,'' Delores Hoffman said of her daughter. ``She 
looks forward to it. Here she is with her friends.''

 *Methodists back Boy Scouts' appeal    	
</P>
<P>
	NASHVILLE (AP) -- The Commission on United Methodist Men is  
supporting an appeal to the Supreme Court of a New Jersey ruling in 
August that the Boy Scouts of America must allow openly homosexual 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission is the liaison with scouting for the United  
Methodist Church, the nation's second-largest Protestant 
denomination. It sponsors 11,738 scout troops, packs and crews. 
</P>
<P>
	The Methodist commission contends that the scouts should have  
the right to choose leaders without government interference.

 *Orthdox launch independent Web site    	
</P>
<P>
	MARTINEZ, Calif. (AP) -- Inspired by an independent Web site that  
helped topple Archbishop Spyridon as America's Greek Orthodox 
leader, members of various Eastern Orthodox churches have launched 
a similar news and commentary site. 
</P>
<P>
	The site, www.orthodoxnews.com, is edited by D.J. King, a layman  
of the Orthodox Church in America who operates a computer 
programming business in Martinez. The publisher is Stephen 
Angelides, an administative law judge in California who was 
involved with the independent Web site. It shut down after Spyridon 
was replaced by Archbishop Demetrios. 
</P>
<P>
	Orthodox News has been incorporated in Nevada as a for-profit  
business to run the Web site, Angelides said.

 *Mistake could mean deportation    	
</P>
<P>
	CORYDON, Ind. (AP) -- When Frank Audia was a student at a  
Minnesota Bible college, faculty members urged everyone to vote at 
election time. So Audia registered and voted twice in 1994 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
	But he was not a U.S. citizen.  
</P>
<P>
	Now, the 27-year-old youth pastor at Trinity Assembly of God  
Church in Corydon could be returned to his native El Salvador. 
Under federal law, Audia committed a crime worthy of deportation 
even though he says he did not know he was acting illegally. 
</P>
<P>
	Audia came to the United States at age 10 with his mother, went  
to school and attended college at North Central University in 
Minnesota. He was classified as a permanent resident before 
applying for citizenship in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview for citizenship with an Immigration and  
Naturalization Service examiner in Indianapolis, Audia said he had 
voted. Last October, two years after he applied for citizenship, 
the INS told him his request was being denied and, under a 1996 
law, he would face deportation.

 *Baltimore gets two Lutheran agencies    	
</P>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Two worldwide Lutheran agencies are now  
headquartered in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	Lutheran World Relief and Lutheran Immigration and Relief  
Service, which employ about 70 people, moved into new quarters from 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Catholic Relief Services, one of the largest nongovernmental  
agencies providing food and emergency help, moved its world 
headquarters to Baltimore from New York several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Lutheran World Relief grew out of a church movement in 1945 to  
help Lutherans left homeless by World War II. The agency now works 
in 50 countries each year, with local partners training people to 
produce food, dig wells and restore the environment. It also has a 
continuing effort to rid the world of land mines. 
</P>
<P>
	Jonathan Frerichs, a spokesman for Lutheran World Relief, said  
the agency hopes to launch joint projects with Catholic Relief 
Services. The two agencies already have worked together in North 
Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service helps people seeking  
asylum, former refugees and children unaccompanied by their 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
	Both agencies are supported by the Evangelical Lutheran Church  
in America and by the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod.

 *Pastor's suspension upheld    	
</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A Methodist pastor suspended for one year for  
performing same-sex marriages says he will continue to officiate at 
the unions in defiance of church law. 
</P>
<P>
	``My ordination requires me to be in ministry to all persons  
without discrimination,'' the Rev. Gregory Dell said in a statement 
after a denomination committee upheld the verdict that he violated 
church law by presiding over the ``holy union'' of two men last 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell's one-year suspension, which began in July, could be lifted  
early if he would agree to comply with the church law banning 
same-sex ceremonies, or if the law is changed. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell refused, calling the prohibition unjust and ``grounded in  
bigotry.''

 *Concealed weapon or religious icon?    	
</P>
<P>
	MENTOR, Ohio (AP) -- When he was baptized a Sikh in India,  
Gurbachan Singh Bhatia, now 69, vowed to always wear a kirpan, a 
6-inch knife symbolizing his willingness to defend the faith. 
</P>
<P>
	But during investigation of a minor traffic mishap in this  
Cleveland suburb, Bhatia was arrested for carrying a concealed 
weapon. At the time, he was returning home from a religious 
ceremony blessing the new home of a Sikh family. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Chief Richard Amiott said his officers acted properly in  
enforcing the law banning concealed weapons. ``How can you describe 
for me the difference between a ceremonial knife and any knife?'' 
he asked. 
</P>
<P>
	Bhatia must appear for a pretrial hearing Oct. 4. If convicted,  
he could face up to six months in jail and a $1,000 fine. But Ron 
Graham, city prosecutor, said he may be willing to drop the charges 
if the Sikh priest can demonstrate that he is required by his 
religion to carry the kirpan. 
</P>
<P>
	Although state law does not allow for exceptions, Graham said,  
``We don't want to prosecute anyone for exercising religious 
freedom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a similar case in Cincinnati in 1996, the 1st Ohio District  
Court of Appeals overturned a municipal court conviction of a Sikh 
man for carrying a concealed weapon. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be a Sikh is to wear a kirpan -- it is that simple. It is a  
religious symbol and in no way a weapon,'' Judge Mark Painter 
wrote.

 *Seminary president fired; anger cited    	
</P>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- The president of Midwestern Baptist  
Theological Seminary has been fired for what the school's board 
chairman called problems with anger control. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Coppenger was asked to leave after a two-month  
investigation by the board's executive committee into allegations 
that he had acted inappropriately toward others, including members 
of the seminary staff. Coppenger, 51, had been president for four 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	A prepared statement by the Rev. Carl Weiser of Lynchburg, Va.,  
the board's chairman, said in part: ``... a majority of the board 
concluded that the expressions of anger admitted to by Dr. 
Coppenger had irreparably damaged his ability to lead the 
seminary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Whitehead, vice president of business affairs and  
assistant professor of church and law, was named interim president. 
</P>
<P>
	Midwestern, with about 700 students, is one of six seminaries  
owned and operated by the Southern Baptist Convention, the largest 
Protestant denomination in the United States.

<HEADLINE> Beef Blamed for Ill. E. Coli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- An E. coli outbreak that sickened more  
than 300 people has been traced to beef served at a party that all 
the victims attended. 
</P>
<P>
	Genetic testing revealed the same E. coli bacteria was present  
in the people, the beef and the herd from which the steer was 
taken, state health officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Absolutely, it was the beef,'' Dr. John Lumpkin, head of the  
state Public Health Department, said Wednesday. ``The most likely 
scenario is that the meat was not cooked completely through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lumpkin said E. coli from the steer's intestines -- cattle often  
carry the bacteria -- probably contaminated the meat when the animal 
was slaughtered and butchered. 
</P>
<P>
	The beef was served at a party held Labor Day weekend near  
Petersburg, about 25 miles northwest of Springfield. Of the more 
than 300 people who were sickened, 22 required hospitalization. 
</P>
<P>
	The E. coli strain can lead to intense cramps and bloody  
diarrhea. In severe cases, it can destroy red blood cells and 
interfere with kidney function.

<HEADLINE> Yankees 5, White Sox 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Roger Clemens won consecutive starts for the  
first time in nearly three months and Tino Martinez hit a two-run 
homer as the New York Yankees clinched no worse than a tie for a 
playoff berth with a 5-2 win Thursday night over the Chicago White 
Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees, who have won eight of nine since a four-game losing  
streak, need one more win or an Oakland loss to make the postseason 
for the fifth straight year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees took a five-game lead in the AL East over Boston,  
which lost 7-5 to Toronto. New York's magic number to win the 
division for the third time in four years is six. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens (14-9), who has struggled with inconsistency in his  
first season in New York, put together his third straight quality 
start (six or more innings, with three or fewer earned runs) for 
the first time this season. 
</P>
<P>
	He followed up a two-run, seven-inning performance against  
Cleveland by allowing two runs and six hits in 6 1-3 innings. It 
was the first time since June 23-29 that he won back-to-back 
starts. 
</P>
<P>
	Mariano Rivera pitched the ninth for his 43rd save in 47  
chances. Rivera has not allowed a run in his last 24 appearances 
(25 2-3 innings) and has converted 20 straight save opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernie Williams had four hits and Derek Jeter went 2-for-4 to  
raise his average to .351 as the Yankees swept a three-game series 
at home against the White Sox for the first time since May 28-30, 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees jumped out to a 4-0 lead against Jim Parque (9-14),  
who lost his eighth straight decision. Parque allowed four runs and 
seven hits in five innings and hasn't won in 13 starts since July 7 
against Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeter doubled with one out in the first and scored on Williams'  
single. Paul O'Neill added an RBI single in the second and Martinez 
hit his 26th homer in the third. 
</P>
<P>
	The White Sox scored two in the fifth on RBI singles by Brian  
Simmons and Greg Norton to make it 4-2. With runners on second and 
third and one out, Clemens came back to strike out Ray Durham and 
Darrin Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Brosius, starting for the first time since leaving the  
Yankees on Sept. 13 for his father's funeral, went 2-for-3 with an 
RBI single in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Clemens won his 247th game, tying Joe McGinnity and Jack  
Powell for 40th place on the career list. ... O'Neill has 22 RBIs 
in his last 11 games. ... Williams tied a career high with his 
108th run. ... The White Sox turned an odd double play in the 
fourth inning. O'Neill hit a hard shot up the middle that deflected 
off shortstop Mike Caruso's glove and rolled to second baseman Ray 
Durham, who touched second and threw to first for the double play. 
... Chicago's Magglio Ordonez played DH instead of outfield because 
of stiffness in his back and was replaced by a pinch-hitter in the 
fifth inning. ... The Yankees won the season series 7-5.

<HEADLINE> Farm Aid Tied Up Over Cuba, Dairy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Farmers counting on cash from Congress to  
balance their books this year may have to wait awhile. Their 
insistence on trading with Cuba and a squabble among dairy 
producers has tied up work on a multibillion dollar package of farm 
aid. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican leaders had agreed to provide $8 billion in  
farm-income assistance and disaster relief, with the money to be 
included in a must-pass agricultural appropriations bill. 
</P>
<P>
	But a House-Senate conference committee writing the final  
version of the legislation abruptly ended their discussions 
Wednesday and did not resume work Thursday because of a stalemate 
over the Cuba and dairy issues. 
</P>
<P>
	House GOP leaders have told the budget negotiators they do not  
want the dairy issue in the bill and will not let the legislation 
out of the House if it weakens the 40-year-old trade embargo on 
Cuba. On Thursday, they offered to add $700 million to the farm 
bailout if the Cuba and dairy matters were omitted, according to a 
congressional source who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're both big (issues). They're both difficult,'' said Rep.  
Bill Young, R-Fla., chairman of the House Appropriations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The farm bailout would include $5.5 billion in direct payments  
to growers as compensation for a second year of depressed commodity 
prices and additional money for special crops and weather-related 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are waiting for Congress to get some hands on cash so  
they can pay their bills,'' said Tom Giessel, a Kansas wheat 
farmer. ``Farmers spend a tremendous amount of money. These local 
economies depend upon that flow and right now there's a real 
bottleneck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Farm groups are pushing Congress to allow the sale of food and  
medicine to Cuba, but some conservatives and Florida lawmakers say 
they secured a commitment from GOP leaders to block it. 
</P>
<P>
	The dairy dispute involves an Agriculture Department overhaul of  
milk pricing set to take effect Oct. 1. Lawmakers in the South and 
East want to use the spending bill to block the new system and get 
congressional authority for regional price-setting agreements. 
</P>
<P>
	The negotiations on the spending bill were suspended Tuesday  
after farm-state members of the conference committee won a series 
of preliminary votes that indicated they might prevail on the Cuba 
sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	Young denied rumors being circulated among lawmakers that House  
leaders were threatening Thursday to replace members of the 
conference committee or else add anti-Cuba lawmakers. ``That might 
have been thrown out by somebody as an option but there was no 
serious thought given to that,'' Young said. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither side on either issue gave any sign of giving ground  
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously what we have is a stalemate,'' said Jose Cardenas,  
Washington director for the Cuban American National Foundation, 
which backs the trade embargo. Farm groups ``are holding the whole 
thing hostage to some very dubious economic potential.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Jo Ann Emerson, a Missouri Republican pushing the Cuba  
trade measure, said ``the issue of sanctions is critical. ... We 
desperately have to have every market open to our producers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The deadlock killed any chance, however slim, that Congress  
could get the farm aid spent before the 1999 fiscal year ends next 
Thursday. That would have made it easier to balance the 2000 budget 
without dipping into the Social Security surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	This was not the first time the spending bill has been delayed.  
Work on the bill was halted in late June when Senate Democrats 
tried to attach some controls on HMOs. 
</P>
<P>
	Midwest Democrats are blaming Republicans for the latest holdup.  
They downplayed the importance of the dairy issue -- milk producers 
in their states generally support the USDA's new pricing system -- 
and insisted the main problem was on Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have a few right-wing ideologues in the House aiming at  
Castro and hitting our farmers,'' said Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa.

<HEADLINE> IOC Defending Anti-Drug Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Under fire from the White House and key  
international sports officials, the International Olympic Committee 
is fighting to uphold its latest initiatives in the fight against 
performance-enhancing drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven months after holding an international conference on the  
escalating drug crisis in sports, the IOC is facing scathing 
criticism of its plans for a world anti-doping agency and new 
anti-doping code. 
</P>
<P>
	White House drug czar Barry McCaffrey said Wednesday the IOC's  
drug agency project is unacceptable, claiming it lacked 
transparency, accountability and independence, and maintained ``the 
Byzantine elements of the current IOC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's not the first time McCaffrey and the IOC have locked horns.  
At the anti-drug summit in February, IOC officials responded to 
McCaffrey's criticism by telling him to solve the serious doping 
problem in American sports before lecturing the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	Dick Pound, an IOC vice president who is among those  
spearheading the anti-doping agency project, said he would write to 
McCaffrey to contest his latest remarks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a little disappointed with his approach,'' Pound said in a  
telephone interview. ``It ignores a lot of good work that has been 
done leading to an international consensus for the agency. That's 
what we promised at the world conference and that's what we've 
delivered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jacques Rogge, an IOC executive board official, accused  
McCaffrey of ignoring that the agency plans have been backed by 
European governments, the United Nations, World Health Organization 
and other bodies. 
</P>
<P>
	``If that's not a strong political agreement, I don't know what  
is,'' he said. ``If Gen. McCaffrey is not happy, he better consult 
with the other governments who have given their approval. He should 
not point the finger at the IOC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The drug agency is designed to coordinate drug testing around  
the world, including unannounced out-of-competition controls. The 
IOC, which is putting up $25 million to get the agency started, has 
promised it will be established by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC director general Francois Carrard said a Swiss foundation,  
run by a board of directors consisting of government and sports 
officials, would be set up shortly to manage the agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Several contentious issues remain to be decided -- namely where  
the agency will be located and who will run it. Critics, like 
McCaffrey, say the agency should be completely independent of the 
IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	Lausanne, Switzerland, where the IOC is based, is one of the  
possible sites being considered for the agency's headquarters. 
Other cities which have expressed interest include Vienna, Austria; 
Madrid, Spain; Lisbon, Portugal, and Stockholm, Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the agency's tasks will be to apply the IOC's  
controversial new ``Olympic Movement Anti-Doping Code.'' The 
95-page document sets out guidelines on drug testing, sanctions, 
rules and procedures for all Olympic sports. 
</P>
<P>
	The code, approved by the IOC at its session in Seoul, South  
Korea, in June, is scheduled to go into effect Jan. 1. But it has 
come under attack from several leading Olympic officials. 
</P>
<P>
	John Coates, president of the Australian Olympic Committee,  
recently sent a 12-page letter to IOC president Juan Antonio 
Samaranch criticizing the code as ``unworkable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coates, a lawyer, found numerous holes in the document,  
including flaws in the definitions of doping and trafficking and 
failure to fully address the issue of out-of-competition testing. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound, who drafted the document along with fellow IOC vice  
president Keba Mbaye of Senegal, said the code is a ``work in 
progress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not perfect,'' Pound said. ``No document in this field  
will ever be perfect. If any changes should or will be made, they 
ought to be made at the behest of the agency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senior officials of two major Olympic sports, track and field  
and swimming, have expressed serious reservations about the code. 
</P>
<P>
	Gunnar Werner, honorary secretary of the international swimming  
federation, said he agreed with many of Coates' complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope (the document) will be delayed or reconsidered,'' he  
said. ``The main problem is it completely changes the whole system 
of sanctions. It conflicts with our rules. At the moment, we would 
not be able to apply it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arne Ljungqvist, chairman of the International Amateur Athletic  
Federation's medical commission, said his federation would also 
need to change its rules, noting that the next IAAF congress won't 
be held until 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	The code lists a scale of sanctions for drug offenses, including  
``intentional doping.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For example, recommended penalties for a first offense for use  
of stimulants or other minor substances are: a warning, a ban from 
one or several competitions, a fine of up to $100,000, and a 
suspension of one one to six months. 
</P>
<P>
	For intentional doping with steroids, the listed penalties are:  
life ban from participation in any sports event, fine of up to $1 
million, suspension of four years to life from all sports 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Werner and Ljungqvist questioned how sports officials will be  
able to prove intentional doping. According to the document, 
intentional doping can be proved ``by any means whatsoever, 
including presumption.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pound, a lawyer, said the sanctions were drafted in a way so  
they can withstand legal scrutiny.

	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- A bicyclist knocked off a highway overpass  
by a hit-and-run driver was repeatedly struck on the road below by 
other cars that scattered parts of his body for hundreds of feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Only one motorist stopped, after getting a flat tire due to  
debris, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The cyclist was riding on an overpass early Wednesday when he  
was struck by a vehicle and thrown 20 feet onto the Florida 
Turnpike, which has a 70-mph speed limit. 
</P>
<P>
	Police estimate the man was struck by at least six vehicles.  
</P>
<P>
	His remains were spread along 375 feet of highway, police said.  
He was not immediately identified. 
</P>
<P>
	``They just kept going,'' said police Detective Norris Butler.  
``The first two or three had to have known it was a body because of 
the clothing.''

<HEADLINE> Microsoft: Tech Stocks `Overvalued' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- The president of Microsoft Corp. warned Thursday  
that technology stocks are overvalued, including those of his own 
company, in public remarks that helped accelerate a sharp selloff 
on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq composite index, which is dominated by technology  
bellwethers such as Microsoft and Dell Computer fell 108.33 to 
2,749.83, its fourth-biggest decline ever. Microsoft shares fell 
$4.87 1/2 to $91.18 3/4 while Dell fell $3.06 1/4 to $43. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft president Steven Ballmer was speaking during a  
question and answer session at a conference of the Society of 
American Business Editors and Writers. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked what story business writers are not covering these  
days, Ballmer said he doesn't think there's much emphasis on 
writing about the overvaluation of tech stocks in general. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is such an overvaluation of tech stocks that it's  
absurd,'' he said. ``I would put our company and I would put most 
companies in that category,'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ballmer blamed a ``gold rush'' mentality for the stock rises,  
saying that the profits being earned by the tech companies don't 
justify the high prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's bad for the long-term health of the economy,'' he said.  
Ballmer explained that since many technology companies pay their 
employees with stock options, the industry is essentially 
delegating employee compensation to Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	Any major market decline could render those options worthless,  
substantially cutting the income of tech sector workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite Ballmer's strong remarks, his company moved on Thursday  
to exploit the market's high prices. It announced plans for an 
initial public offering for its Expedia travel reservations site, a 
move that will give investors the opportunity to focus on just one 
aspect of the company's business and bring in as much as $75 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Expedia stock offering is the latest in a series of  
maneuvers Microsoft has made recently to help its more promising 
online ventures flourish. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballmer's comments echoed those of Internet analyst Lise Buyer  
of Credit Suisse First Boston, who told the writers that tech 
companies' stock prices are generally overvalued. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballmer and other Microsoft officials regularly play down the  
company's profit expectations amid criticism that the world's most 
powerful technology company wields too much dominance in the 
software industry. 
</P>
<P>
	But as the No. 2 Microsoft executive behind chairman Bill Gates,  
Ballmer's public statements are closely watched by Wall Street for 
signs of where the technology business is headed. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, a Microsoft spokeswoman downplayed Ballmer's remarks.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing new here,'' said the spokeswoman, Caroline  
Boren. ``Microsoft has always been cautious in its outlook.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-Conn. Treasurer Guilty in Scheme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- A former state treasurer pleaded guilty  
Thursday to accepting an estimated $106,000 in kickbacks -- some of 
which turned up in his failed election campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Silvester was paid ``finders fees'' by the financial firms  
that he selected to invest the state's pension funds. 
</P>
<P>
	``He used his authority as state treasurer to invest money not  
solely in the best interest of the funds, but to guarantee wealth 
for himself, his friends and his colleagues,'' U.S. Attorney 
Stephen Robinson said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Silvester, 37, who lost a November election 17 months after  
being appointed to the post, pleaded guilty to racketeering and 
money laundering charges and faces up to 40 years in prison and a 
$750,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	His brother Mark Silvester, 50, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to  
solicit and accept corrupt payments and could get five years. His 
brother-in-law, Peter Hirschl, 43, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to 
launder money and faces up to 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	All three were released on $10,000 bond. Sentencing was  
scheduled for March 20. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Silvester admitted he had his brother divvy up some of the  
money and dole it out to political supporters. Those supporters 
then used the money to write $1,500 campaign contribution checks, 
prosecutors said. Prosecutors said Mark Silvester used his share of 
the kickbacks to buy a powerboat and paint his home. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Silvester's attorneys said he would have no comment.  
</P>
<P>
	``He has betrayed the public trust, he has betrayed the  
Republican party and he has betrayed people that have run on the 
ticket with him,'' said Gov. John G. Rowland, who appointed 
Silvester to his position after the previous treasurer resigned. 
</P>
<P>
	The financial firms involved were not named in the indictment  
because the investigation is ongoing, Robinson said. He would not 
comment further.

<HEADLINE> Pirates Call Up Brown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The Pittsburgh Pirates recalled outfielder Emil  
Brown from Triple-A Nashville on Thursday to replace Brian Giles, 
who is out for the rest of the season with a broken finger. 
</P>
<P>
	Giles developed into one of the NL's best power hitters, batting  
.315 with 39 homers and 115 RBIs. But he broke the middle finger on 
his right hand sliding into second base Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown hit .307 with 20 doubles, 18 home runs and 60 RBIs in 110  
games at Nashville. He also stole 16 bases. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pirates also activated left-hander Jason Christiansen from  
the 15-day disabled list. Christiansen has been suffering from neck 
and back pain and hasn't played since July 28, though he did pitch 
two scoreless innings in two rehab outings at Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
	He is 2-3 with three saves and a 4.46 ERA in 34 1-3 innings of  
relief.

<HEADLINE> Mutual Funds Assets Rise / Money Market Funds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Assets of the nation's money market funds rose  
overall in the past week, lifted by growth among institutional 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Assets of retail money market mutual funds fell by $1.83 billion  
to $898.62 billion, the Investment Company Institute said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Assets of taxable money market funds in the retail category fell  
by $204.8 million to $744.12 billion for the week ended Wednesday, 
the Washington-based mutual fund trade group said. Tax-exempt fund 
assets fell by $1.63 billion to $154.50 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Assets of institutional money market funds rose by $4.41 billion  
to $604.54 billion for the same period. Among institutional funds, 
taxable money market fund assets rose by $5.17 billion to $558.00 
billion; assets of tax-exempt funds fell by $755.9 million to 
$46.54 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Total money market assets stood at $1.503 trillion for the week.  
</P>
<P>
	Assets for the previous week were revised to $1.501 trillion to  
reflect reporting errors and a change in the number of funds 
reporting. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose in  
the week ended Tuesday to 4.69 percent from 4.68 percent the 
previous week, said IBC's Money Fund Report, a trade journal 
published in Ashland, Mass., by IBC Financial Data Inc. The 30-day 
average yield rose to 4.66 percent from 4.63 percent, IBC Financial 
Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-day compounded yield rose to 4.80 percent from 4.79  
percent the previous week, and the 30-day compounded yield rose to 
4.77 percent from 4.73 percent, IBC Financial Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was  
57 days, up from 56 days, IBC Financial Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The online service bankrate.com said its survey of 100 leading  
commercial banks, savings and loan associations and savings banks 
in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the annual percentage 
yield available on money market accounts was 2.08 percent as of 
Wednesday, unchanged from a week earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based unit of Intelligent Life Corp.  
said the annual percentage yield available on interest-bearing 
checking accounts held at the previous week's 0.84 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Bankrate.com said the annual percentage yield was 4.35 percent  
on six-month certificates of deposit, up from 4.34 percent the 
previous week. Yields were 4.73 percent on 1-year CDs, up from 4.72 
percent; 5.01 percent on 2 1/2-year CDs, up from 4.99 percent; and 
5.25 percent on 5-year CDs, up from 5.23 percent.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Democratic National Committee's new  
designated leader has some choice words to describe his Republican 
rivals: ``Decent people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia Mayor Edward Rendell officially accepted his  
nomination as general party chairman Thursday by promising a civil 
approach to the 2000 elections. 
</P>
<P>
	``Republicans aren't bad people,'' he said. ``They're decent  
people -- good Americans -- and want the same things for this country 
as we do. We disagree how to reach those goals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton offered him the job Wednesday night and the  
full DNC is expected to sign off Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	He has good reason to sweet-talk Republicans. His city will host  
the 2000 Republican national convention, and Rendell said he will 
maintain his commitments to the GOP -- including raising money for 
their convention. 
</P>
<P>
	He called himself a good friend of GOP chairman Jim Nicholson.  
</P>
<P>
	Rendell also may seek statewide office in 2002 in Pennsylvania,  
an increasingly conservative state where voters may not appreciate 
partisan rhetoric. 
</P>
<P>
	State reporters pressed him about how he would balance his  
duties as mayor. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one in Philadelphia will be shortchanged,'' said Rendell,  
whose term expires in January 2000. And as party chairman, the 
mayor said he will be in a better position to lobby Washington on 
behalf of Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	Rendell was hired to raise money, a response to mounting  
concerns that Republican front-runner George W. Bush's fund-raising 
prowess will bury the Democratic presidential nominee. Roy Romer, 
the party's top spokesman and current general chairman, was moved 
to the 2000 convention staff to make room for Rendell. 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor said his fund-raising goal was to collect ``as much as  
we can legally raise.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Rendell said he will not take sides in the presidential  
nomination race. 
</P>
<P>
	Too late.  
</P>
<P>
	He endorsed Vice President Al Gore long before being considered  
for the party post. 
</P>
<P>
	Trying to make amends as the party boss, Rendell called former  
New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, Gore's only rival and a good friend. 
Yet he was quick to defend Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Told that Sen. Patrick Moynihan of New York not only endorsed  
Bradley on Thursday but said Gore couldn't get elected president, 
Rendell said Moynihan was ``dead wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic activists have gotten some bad news about rural  
voters. They're turning Republican. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Gersh, a leading party pollster, told DNC members that  
Democratic House candidates were backed by just 38 percent of rural 
voters in 1998, down from 52 percent in 1990 and 48 percent in 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The figure was even lower than 1994, a bad year for Democrats,  
when the party's House candidates received 43 percent of the rural 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
	If Democrats had done as well in rural American in 1998 as they  
did in 1994, Republicans would have lost control of the House, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans are appealing to rural voters' concerns about  
declining values in America, Gersh said 
</P>
<P>
	``Democrats tend to do better in rural (areas) ... when voters  
are worried about the economy as opposed to these cultural issues 
that are really vexing to the Democratic Party in rural areas,'' he 
said. ``I think we have suffered from this cultural divide that is 
occurring in this country.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	With all the emphasis on 2000, some Democrats are wondering if  
the DNC is paying attention to the handful of 1999 elections -- 
including governor's elections in Kentucky, Mississippi and 
Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Andrew, in charge of the DNC's day-to-day operations, said  
as much money will be spent on the 1999 contests as was spent in 
1995 -- the year before the last presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
	Party officials said more than $1 million was spent on the  
contests in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Though some Democrats say there is little sign yet that the DNC  
is spending as much, Andrew said, ``So far, we have spent the same 
amount as we did in 1995.''

<HEADLINE> Will St. Louis Now Get an NBA Team? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The St. Louis Grizzlies?  
</P>
<P>
	Billionaire Bill Laurie's announcement Thursday that he was  
buying the NBA's Vancouver Grizzlies quickly led to speculation 
that he would move the franchise to St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	Laurie was coy about his plans, saying only that his focus is on  
improving a team that went 8-42 during the lockout-shortened 
1998-99 season. There's no hurry to announce a move -- the NBA 
requires expansion teams to stay in their original cities at least 
five seasons, and this coming season will be the Grizzlies' fifth 
in Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the relocation speculation seems well-founded.  
</P>
<P>
	Laurie and his family live in Columbia, Mo., just 120 miles west  
of St. Louis. His wife, Nancy Walton Laurie, is the daughter of the 
late Bud Walton, who with his late brother Sam co-founded Wal-Mart. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, the Lauries bought both the St. Louis Blues  
and their too-often-unused arena, the Kiel Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``It all fits, doesn't it?'' St. Louis Rams coach Dick Vermeil  
said. ``It's great for St. Louis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Clarence Harmon even offered to help the team move.  
</P>
<P>
	``Although we know that there are no immediate plans to move the  
team, I can assure the players, staff, and the new owners that the 
people of St. Louis would welcome the Grizzlies to the city with a 
big bear hug,'' Harmon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the reason the Blues and Kiel were for sale was because,  
without a second major tenant in the building, the group of local 
businessmen who owned the team was losing money each year. 
</P>
<P>
	An NBA franchise would mean 41 more regular-season home dates,  
plus preseason and playoff games, though for the Grizzlies, the 
playoffs don't exactly appear to be right around the corner. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, St. Louis hasn't had an NBA team since the Hawks left for  
Atlanta in 1968. And sports fans are ready for the Grizzlies. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've got to do it,'' said Mike Redmond, 27, who manages a  
sports clothing store near Kiel. ``They own their own arena. There 
isn't any reason why not to bring them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Craig Towns, 29, said the city needs an NBA team.  
</P>
<P>
	``It would be a great addition,'' he said. ``The only thing  
we're missing as fans in a big city is a professional (basketball) 
team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the NFL's St. Louis Cardinals left for Arizona after the  
1987 season, St. Louis was down to two major professional teams -- 
the baseball Cardinals and the Blues -- until 1995, when the NFL's 
Rams were lured from Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
	Stan Kroenke, also of Columbia and brother-in-law of Bill  
Laurie, is minority owner of the Rams. It is widely believed he'll 
become majority owner if Georgia Frontiere sells her share of the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrival of the Grizzlies -- or whatever they'd be called if  
they moved here -- could spell trouble for some of Kiel Center's 
secondary clients. They include the St. Louis Ambush indoor soccer 
team, the St. Louis Vipers roller hockey team, and, most notably, 
the Saint Louis University basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
	The Billikens play 15-17 home games at Kiel each year, often to  
sellout crowds. The only basketball arena on campus, the West Pine 
Gym, holds only a few thousand fans. 
</P>
<P>
	The only other viable option would be the new Family Arena,  
opening next month in St. Charles, about 20 miles west of St. 
Louis. The Family Arena holds 11,200, though it already has three 
tenants -- a minor-league hockey team, the St. Louis Swarm 
International Basketball League team, and another indoor soccer 
team, the St. Louis Steamers, who begin play this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Saint Louis University athletic director Doug Woolard said it  
was too early to speculate. But he noted that other college teams 
in cities with both NHL and NBA teams -- Miami, Seton Hall (New 
Jersey), Georgetown (Washington) -- are able to share facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly if that becomes reality it's something we're going  
to need to work through,'' Woolard said. ``So far, Kiel has worked 
really hard to try to accommodate our needs. We've been able to get 
the dates that have been beneficial to us, for both our fans and 
TV.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Woodcock, vice president of marketing for the Blues and Kiel  
Center, said, ``There's nothing really to talk about. That's just 
pure speculation right now. For the next fiscal year ahead, it's 
just business as usual.''

<HEADLINE> Sen. Faces Harassment Allegations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HELENA, Mont. (AP) -- In 1994, as the sexual harassment scandal  
that forced Bob Packwood from the Senate heated up, Sen. Max Baucus 
stepped forward to endorse a bill that would make Congress subject 
to the same workplace laws as businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is high time for Congress to play by the same rules it sets  
for other Americans,'' the Montana Democrat said in support of what 
would become the Congressional Accountability Act. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, five years later, his former top aide is about to use that  
law to accuse Baucus himself of sexual harassment. 
</P>
<P>
	Christine Niedermeier is expected to file a grievance with  
Congress this week alleging the four-term senator fired her as 
chief of staff for shunning more than a year of sexual advances. 
Baucus has vehemently denied any sexual harassment. 
</P>
<P>
	A grievance could lead to Ms. Niedermeier's receiving damages  
for lost wages and getting her job back. If the case goes to court, 
she could also demand punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
	The allegations came out after Baucus fired Ms. Niedermeier in  
August for what he said was a brutal management style that made 
work intolerable for his staff. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Niedermeier, 47 and single, said Baucus never touched her  
improperly. But she said the 57-year-old married man began hitting 
on her shortly after she went to work for him in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Baucus would comment frequently on her appearance in front of  
others, and quiz her about her boyfriends and her dates, she said. 
He asked her to take weekend trips together and compared her with 
his wife, Wanda, Ms. Niedermeier said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last October, she said, the senator asked her to accompany him  
on a trip to San Diego around her birthday. She refused and he was 
disappointed, later questioning her about her personal life, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was expressing a form of jealousy that I spent my birthday  
with someone else,'' she said. ``I was first embarrassed and 
blushed, then I tried to make light of it. I gave him every 
possible signal I could to let him know I wasn't interested.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baucus has refused to comment on the particulars of  
Niedermeier's allegations but said: ``Let me state, unequivocally, 
that I have never, under any circumstances, sexually harassed 
Christine Niedermeier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baucus said he fired Ms. Niedermeier after being confronted with  
a revolt by staff members fed up with her belittling and abusive 
treatment. He said 36 of 39 staffers signed a petition complaining 
about her. Several employees threatened to resign. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason I let her go was basically because of the way she  
was mistreating my staff,'' Baucus said. ``I'm angry that she has 
abused my staff for such a long period of time and in such a 
harmful and hurtful way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former Baucus employees flooded reporters with horror stories  
about working for Ms. Niedermeier and praise for Baucus. And 38 
female former employees signed a letter defending Baucus as a ``man 
of highest integrity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I resigned because of Ms. Niedermeier,'' said Jan Metzmaker,  
former field director for one of Baucus' offices in Montana. ``It 
was way too stressful. It was too difficult to work for her and be 
sane and have a family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Baucus, an anthropologist, painter and writer who is the  
senator's second wife, has been married to him for 16 years. She 
has dismissed Ms. Niedermeier's accusations and stood by her 
husband. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there was any doubt in my mind at all, it would be creating  
problems, but it's not,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The law Ms. Niedermeier is expected to invoke was passed in  
early 1995 in the middle of the scandal over allegations that 
Packwood had sexually harassed more than two dozen women, many of 
whom had worked in his Senate office. The Oregon Republican 
resigned in late 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Baucus apparently never commented publicly on the  
scandal, he did vote for public hearings by the Senate Ethics 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, he said he supports the complaint process  
created by the law and dared Ms. Niedermeier to use it. ``If she 
believes that I sexually harassed her, then she should lay her case 
out on the table -- and under oath,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Niedermeier, a two-time congressional candidate in  
Connecticut, said she is willing to do that to salvage her 
reputation. She said her delay in filing a complaint is due to 
reservations about the confidential nature of the Senate process, 
not a reluctance to speak under oath. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one would ever want to lie about this,'' she said. ``Why  
would I want to lie about something that would damage, if not 
destroy, my career?''

<HEADLINE> Kohler Settles Labor Dept. Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KOHLER, Wis. (AP) -- Kohler Co. has agreed to pay $886,500 to  
more than 2,000 women who were refused jobs because they were too 
short. 
</P>
<P>
	The plumbing fixture company agreed to settle a Labor Department  
lawsuit accusing Kohler of gender discrimination for a company 
practice of hiring only workers who were at least 5 feet 4 inches 
tall. 
</P>
<P>
	The rule was intended to make sure employees could handle  
physical labor, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The height restriction was not gender-specific; it's just that  
women tend to be shorter,'' Kohler spokesman Ed Allmann said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the effect was to keep women out of higher-paying jobs and  
thus qualified as discrimination, said Bernard E. Anderson, 
assistant labor secretary and head of the Employment Standards 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	The $886,500 in back pay, benefits and interest covers more than  
2,000 women who applied for machine operator positions and other 
jobs at Kohler between January 1994 and December 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, Kohler will hire 111 of the applicants and  
fund a three-year study on making jobs safer and eliminating 
barriers to women. 
</P>
<P>
	``The company did not have a policy on height requirements,  
however remnants of outdated past practices at one plant 
unfortunately had remained in place pertaining to heavy 
manufacturing areas,'' said Laura Kohler, a vice president at the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	``Improvements in manufacturing processes lessened the need for  
minimum height considerations,'' she said.

	Clinton Vetoes GOP Tax Cut  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After weeks of partisan jockeying over taxes,  
President Clinton today vetoed the $792 billion tax cut pushed by 
Republicans and called on Congress to approve ``tax relief we can 
afford'' by year's end. Clinton said he rejected the tax bill 
because it would ``turn us back to the failed policies of the 
past'' at a time when the nation is enjoying economic prosperity. 
He said he will seek to work with GOP leaders on an alternative tax 
plan ``that reflects the priorities of both parties and the values 
of the American people.''

former New Jersey senator's only opponent, Vice President Al Gore, 
``can't be elected.'' An appreciative Bradley acknowledged that his 
campaign is ``up against an establishment,'' but he said that 
Moynihan's endorsement was important. ``I think people will take 
notice.'' Moynihan, a New York Democrat who is retiring from the 
Senate, and Bradley have been friends for more than two decades. 
Bradley served three terms as a New Jersey senator, and spent time 
with Moynihan on the Senate Finance Committee.

<HEADLINE> Reagan Bio Mixes Fiction, History </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ronald Reagan's authorized biography, 14 years  
in the making, doesn't know what to make of his role in the 
Iran-Contra scandal that soiled his remarkable imprint on the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
	But it is more surefooted in saying that Reagan, in his final  
years as president, was practicing ``conservation of mental 
resources'' and struggling as if by sheer will to stay focused on 
the things he really cared about. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dutch: A Memoir of Ronald Reagan'' is being released by Random  
House in a week. It was written by Edmund Morris, a 
Pulitzer-winning author who was granted extraordinary access to the 
Reagan White House and the president himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Excerpts were obtained by The Associated Press.  
</P>
<P>
	In the book, Morris writes that George Bush complained to him --  
in his jovial way -- of the indifferent treatment he and his wife 
got from the Reagans. Morris also recounts another side of Reagan, 
a burst of loyalty when he angrily dismissed advice by aides to 
fire chief of staff Don Regan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Listen, I'm not going to sacrifice anybody's ass to save my  
ass,'' Morris quotes the president as saying in February 1987, 
shortly before Regan resigned anyway in a dispute with Nancy 
Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris writes glowingly of Reagan's impact and asserts, ``He  
retained a useful intelligence throughout two terms as president, 
and for three years thereafter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, he found Reagan to be ``an apparent airhead'' and said he  
was ``distressed by the relentless banality, not to say 
incoherence, of the president's replies in interviews.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some of Morris' conclusions, and especially his technique of  
inserting himself into the narrative as a sometimes-fictional 
character, have unnerved several Reagan associates and historians 
while others have said they won't rush to judgment until they read 
the book. 
</P>
<P>
	University of Wisconsin historian Stanley Kutler, who read and  
is reviewing the book, said it cast little light on the Reagan 
administration except, perhaps, in detailing ``chapter and verse'' 
Reagan's failings of the mind. 
</P>
<P>
	The book serves mainly as a reminder of Reagan's gifts as a  
``great practitioner of symbolic politics'' and is otherwise 
clouded by the fictitious elements used by the author, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Reagan's disengagement at times was true to his  
hands-off style, aides were concerned about his fogginess during 
his second term. Morris has said he believed Reagan started 
declining mentally and physically early, when he was shot and 
seriously wounded in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	Reagan was diagnosed five years ago with Alzheimer's disease,  
well after he left office in 1989. Mrs. Reagan said this week she 
had not seen the book; her office did not return a phone call 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The book cites as evidence of his ``useful intelligence''  
Reagan's ``perfectly paced jokes, the easy, apt quips scribbled on 
the bottoms of thousands of photographs, and above all the clarity 
of his diaries and letters and speech drafts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morris tells of a conversation he said he had with George and  
Barbara Bush on Christmas Eve in 1988, shortly before Bush became 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really love that guy, he's such a terrific fellow,'' Bush is  
quoted as saying, before going on to comment about the Reagans: ``I 
kinda wished they'd shown -- 'y'know, a little appreciation. Didn't 
seem to want us upstairs in the White House.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We would always thank them for their gifts,'' Mrs. Bush added.  
The president-elect then complained about not getting ``a word of 
thanks'' for a gift they had made for the Reagans -- an odd seat 
supported by legs patterned after Reagan's own cowboy boots, 
complete with spurs. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said Reagan ``never seemed to need anybody.'' Mrs. Bush  
added: ``Except Nancy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked to comment, Bush's office in Houston asked to see the  
excerpt and did not immediately respond. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris, who won a Pulitzer Prize for a Theodore Roosevelt  
biography, comes to no firm conclusion about Reagan's role in the 
diversion of money to the Nicaraguan Contras from illicit missile 
sales to Iran. 
</P>
<P>
	``My suspicion, for what it's worth, is that Dutch (Reagan) did  
authorize the transfer, not having the smallest comprehension of 
the laws he was subverting,'' Morris writes. 
</P>
<P>
	More broadly, Reagan began conserving his mental resources after  
second-term cancer surgery for the things that mattered, he said: 
``rescue of the hostages in Lebanon, Contra aid, strategic defense, 
abolition of nuclear weapons, moral warfare against communism and 
continued restoration of the national spirit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Purged from his mind were issues like Third World initiatives,  
the environment and support for the arts. 
</P>
<P>
	Like an overloaded computer, Morris said, Reagan ``deleted all  
data that threatened to encumber him,'' refusing after surgery to 
believe he had ever had cancer -- only the excised polyp did. Reagan 
underwent surgeries for colon and skin cancer and for an enlarged 
prostate in his second term. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris was granted frequent interviews with Reagan, traveled  
with him, attended some inner-circle meetings and befriended close 
aides. But he says he was excluded from national security and other 
vital policy meetings.

<HEADLINE> Defendant Cleared in Agent Slaying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- The first of three Mexican nationals  
charged in the slaying of a U.S. Border Patrol agent was acquitted 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	On the second day of deliberations, jurors cleared Manuel Gamez  
in the death of Alexander Kirpnick, who was shot to death in a 
remote canyon area near Nogales on June 3, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Gamez, 28, could have gotten the death penalty if convicted.  
</P>
<P>
	The jury did find Gamez guilty of four charges related to  
marijuana smuggling. He faces up to 30 years in prison at 
sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other suspects -- Bernardo Velarde Lopez and Luis Enrique  
Arenas Hernandez -- await trial on the same seven charges as Gamez, 
which include murdering a federal officer, murdering an officer 
during a drug crime and conspiracy to import marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
	Velarde and Arenas will not face execution because the Mexican  
government extradited them on the condition they be spared the 
death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirpnick, 27, was shot through the temple and died hours later  
at a hospital after he and his patrol partner tried to chase down a 
group of suspected drug smugglers. 
</P>
<P>
	Gamez was arrested the same day while walking along a trail. He  
told authorities he was paid $400 to smuggle a marijuana-filled 
duffle bag across the border and ran when he saw someone he thought 
was an immigration agent. 
</P>
<P>
	Gamez said he heard a shot about 40 seconds after he started  
running and he was not the shooter. 
</P>
<P>
	``We felt all along he was innocent,'' said Victoria Brambl,  
Gamez's attorney.

	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- The Buffalo Sabres signed center Stu Barnes  
on Thursday, leaving five players unsigned as the regular season 
approaches. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms were not disclosed. Barnes, acquired from Pittsburgh in  
March, scored seven playoff goals as the Sabres advanced to the 
Stanley Cup finals. Barnes came to training camp without a contract 
and has one goal in three preseason games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every move for me has been a positive thing,'' he said.  
``Hopefully we can get back to the Stanley Cup finals.''

	The Sabres are still missing Miroslav Satan, last season's  
leading scorer, center Curtis Brown, right wing Vaclav Varada and 
defensemen Rhett Warrener and Jay McKee. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Prices Fall Further in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Consumer prices fell 6.1 percent in August,  
compared with the same month a year earlier, but spurred a sorely 
needed spurt in consumer demand, the government said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong's prices have dropped for 10 consecutive months as the  
territory seeks ways to boost its economy, which slumped in the 
Asian crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices fell 5.5 percent in July. The government attributed much  
of the latest decline to a fall in private housing rents. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong consumers also paid less for eating out and for  
supermarket goods. Clothing and shoe prices fell a dramatic 25.6 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Lower prices contributed to an 8 percent decline in the value of  
retail sales in July, compared with July 1998, to $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	But cheaper prices boosted consumer demand, with retail volume  
rising 1 percent. It was the first increase since September 1997, 
before the Asian crisis hit the territory, the Census and 
Statistics Department said in a statement.

<HEADLINE> NY Man on Trial for Punching Horse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A man has gone on trial for allegedly punching a  
police horse during a protest rally. 
</P>
<P>
	James Hornacek, 35, of Hazlet, N.J., denies that he hit the  
horse Daily News One during a June 1998 protest rally. The 
electrician claims the 19-year-old gelding came at him while he was 
marching and that he merely put his hands up to protect himself. 
</P>
<P>
	He is charged with obstructing government administration,  
disorderly conduct and attempting to injure a police animal. The 
charges carry a maximum one year in jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Hornacek was among thousands of construction workers trying to  
march to a construction site where non-union workers reportedly 
were on the job. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said that when mounted police moved in to stop the  
demonstrators from impeding traffic, Hornacek refused to move. 
Instead, Hornacek punched the horse in the nose and repeatedly hit 
it in its hindquarters.

<HEADLINE> Commuters May Never Overcome Delays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Construction aimed at easing traffic  
congestion can create such delays that it takes years afterward -- 
if at all -- for commuters to recoup the time they lost, according 
to a study by an environmental group. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, Virginia is spending $350 million over eight years  
to rebuild the interchange of Interstate 95, I-495 and I-395, 
southwest of Washington. During that time, commuters are expected 
to spend at least an extra 30 minutes each way heading through the 
work zone. When the work is finished, those same commuters will 
save 30 seconds going through the interchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The Surface Transportation Policy Project, which favors less  
road construction and increased use of alternatives such as 
flexible work schedules, calculated that a commuter who endures the 
delays never will recover the lost time through faster drives 
afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	The group also said commuters enduring work on I-15 in Salt Lake  
City, Route 29 in Trenton, N.J., and Interstate 24 in Nashville, 
Tenn., will take from nearly three years to 10 years to recoup the 
time spent traveling through the construction zones. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our transportation officials should first try fighting  
congestion in ways that are less expensive, just as effective and 
help drivers right now,'' said Roy Kienitz, executive director of 
the transportation project. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials involved in the projects and roadbuilders said the  
analysis was faulty and shortsighted. 
</P>
<P>
	It does not take into account, among other things, safety  
improvements, reduced air pollution and better mobility from road 
construction, said Matthew Jeanneret, spokesman for the American 
Road and Transportation Builders Association, a trade group 
representing builders. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Fox, spokesman for the I-15 project in Utah, said: ``If  
the construction had not been done at all, by 2010 can you imagine 
the delays there would be? It could be two hours delay at the time 
because it's so totally congested because the whole system is 
broken down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Surface Transportation Policy Project based its analysis on  
public documents and information from the Transportation Department 
and state transportation authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	The interchange project outside Washington is in Springfield,  
Va., at a site called the ``mixing bowl'' because of its tangle of 
on- and off-ramps. 
</P>
<P>
	The work on Route 29 in Trenton covers 1.7 miles and entails  
replacing a two-lane road with a four-lane highway. The group said 
commuters will endure 10-minute delays for three years to save 
three minutes afterward, a disparity that won't be offset for eight 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The I-24 project in Nashville involves widening a section south  
of downtown from four to eight lanes. Commutes are expected to take 
an extra 15 minutes for 14 months to save seven minutes afterward, 
an amount that will not be offset for nearly three years.

	The I-15 project, meanwhile, costs $1.6 billion and entails  
widening the interstate from six to 10 lanes for 16.5 miles. 
Traffic is expected to be delayed 15 minutes for four years to 
achieve a savings of seven minutes. The extra time will not be 
recovered until 2010, eight years after the projected is completed. 
</P>
<P>
	The group concluded that transportation officials should do a  
better job of explaining how delays will affect commuters and find 
ways to reduce congestion without highway construction, such as 
through mass transit.

<HEADLINE> Rooney Explains Column </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Relax, all you starlets of television news. Andy  
Rooney says he wasn't talking about you. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``60 Minutes'' curmudgeon set tongues wagging with a  
newspaper column this week that suggested that the most beautiful 
woman in TV news ``looks as if she had been in a minor automobile 
accident'' because of plastic surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't name any names. That's because, Rooney said Thursday,  
he wasn't talking about anybody. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was writing metaphorically,'' he said. ``I didn't have  
anybody really in mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his column about aging, Rooney said that most people are more  
attractive if they look their age instead of synthetically trying 
to improve their appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	That's something many people in his business can't accept, he  
noted. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the most beautiful -- OK, THE most beautiful -- woman in  
television news had a job done on herself a few years ago and, 
while she doesn't look bad, she does not look the same or as good 
to me as when she had what must have seemed to her to be 
shortcomings,'' he wrote. ``She looks as if she had been in a minor 
automobile accident.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gossip columnists -- and undoubtedly a few of Rooney's female  
colleagues -- immediately began the guessing game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I suppose there must be 20 women in television who thought I  
was talking about them,'' Rooney said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some speculated Rooney meant Diane Sawyer, his former colleague  
on ``60 Minutes.'' Not so fast, the New York Post's Page Six opined 
on Thursday, tossing the names Barbara Walters, Christiane 
Amanpour, Maria Shriver, Jane Pauley, Lesley Stahl and Connie Chung 
into the mix. 
</P>
<P>
	Yikes!  
</P>
<P>
	With so many women to potentially offend, Rooney put a stop to  
it. He said he regretted writing it: ``I didn't mean to call this 
much attention to myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And he offered a verbal bouquet to Ms. Sawyer.  
</P>
<P>
	``Diane is a good friend of mine and I like her a lot,'' he  
said. ``I think she's not only one of the great people in 
television but she's one of the good people, too. She's as smart as 
she is beautiful.''

<HEADLINE> Tire Co. Settles Suit for $17.7M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SARASOTA, Fla. (AP) -- A judge has approved a tire manufacturing  
company's agreement to pay $17.7 million to a boy who survived a 
van crash that killed his parents. 
</P>
<P>
	Pirelli Armstrong Tire Corp. will pay the money to Matthew  
Jensen, who was 4 when his parents died in a 1993 accident that 
happened after a tire on their van fell apart. 
</P>
<P>
	Ginny Jensen, 47, was a copy editor at the Sarasota  
Herald-Tribune and her husband, 45-year-old Al Jensen, had once 
worked as a copy editor there. 
</P>
<P>
	Matthew was not seriously injured in the crash that followed a  
day at Walt Disney World one week before Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
	Pirelli made the spare tire that Jensen installed on the van  
three days before the accident. The tread on the tire separated, 
and Jensen lost control of the van, which flipped over and was 
rammed by another car. 
</P>
<P>
	Pirelli agreed in July to settle the lawsuit filed by Mrs.  
Jensen's sister. A federal judge signed the settlement order last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal jury in Tampa awarded $5.4 million to Matthew in 1995  
in another lawsuit filed by the estate of his father. Matthew, now 
10, was adopted by his father's niece and her husband. He lives 
with them in New York.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft To Spin Off Expedia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	REDMOND, Wash. (AP) -- Microsoft announced Thursday that it is  
spinning off its Internet travel reservation service, Expedia, as a 
separate company, and that it had filed with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission for an initial public offering of stock. 
</P>
<P>
	The spinoff is the latest move by the software giant to  
capitalize on the Internet. It will give investors a chance to 
focus on just one aspect of Microsoft's business and could bring in 
as much as $75 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, Microsoft announced a joint venture with Ford  
that will upgrade Microsoft's CarPoint automobile sales site on the 
Web to allow consumers to order specific new Ford cars and trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	Expedia is one of the leading travel sites on the Internet,  
allowing customers to book airline tickets, hotel rooms and other 
travel needs. 
</P>
<P>
	Since going online in October 1996, Expedia has had gross  
bookings of more than $700 million by more than 860,000 customers, 
the SEC filing said. 
</P>
<P>
	Expedia Inc. said in the filing that the worldwide travel  
industry ``is especially well-suited to benefit from increased 
Internet and electronic commerce adoption.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It cited a Forrester Research finding that travel has already  
become the largest online retail category with estimated 
transactions of $7.8 billion in 1999, and growth forecast to reach 
$32 billion in 2004. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the stock offering, Expedia will become a separate  
company but will have a contractual relationship with Microsoft, 
which will be its majority owner. Money raised in the stock 
offering will be used for working capital and general purposes, the 
SEC filing said. 
</P>
<P>
	Analyst Scott McAdams, president of McAdams Wright Ragen in  
Seattle, said the stock offering could be another way to reward -- 
and retain -- employees who might be tempted by huge stock gains at 
other Internet companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think one of the challenges for Microsoft has been to keep  
the talent from being hired away by other dot-com companies in the 
Northwest and elsewhere,'' McAdams said. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft stock is valuable, but ``it's not in the stratosphere  
like a lot of Internet companies are,'' McAdams said. 
</P>
<P>
	Expedia had revenues of $38.7 million and losses of $19.6  
million for the fiscal year ended in June. Such losses are common 
for Internet startups, which still attract investors convinced they 
are buying a stake in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Microsoft can spin off Expedia and get a very fat  
evaluation on it, it'll be cheap currency to grow their business 
with,'' McAdams said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the Expedia spinoff, Microsoft on Thursday  
released details of how it plans to revamp MSN.com Web gateway with 
a new online shopping service and a Web site to help small 
businesses use the Internet to attract new customers. 
</P>
<P>
	MSN, which began life in the mid-1990s as the Microsoft Network,  
has been frequently modified as technology and competition changed 
business on the Web. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft shares fell $4.87 1/2 to $91.18 3/4 Thursday as part of a  
sharp selloff on Wall Street, fueled in part by a warning from 
Microsoft President Steven Ballmer that technology stocks are 
overvalued, including those of his own company.

<HEADLINE> Aug. Federal Deficit $2.51 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal government recorded a budget  
deficit of $2.51 billion in August but the government is still on 
track for posting a big surplus this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Treasury Department said Wednesday that last month's budget  
deficit was smaller than the $11.17 billion deficit reported in 
August 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	In August, government outlays totaled $128.8 billion, while  
receipts totaled $126.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Government receipts from individual income tax payments in  
August came to $60.7 billion, following $59.9 billion the month 
before. Corporate income tax payments totaled $3.7 billion last 
month, compared with $3.4 billion in July. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first 11 months of fiscal 1999, which began Oct. 1,  
1998, the government has posted a surplus totaling $66.60 billion, 
up from the $31.82 billion surplus for the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration, in its midyear economic forecast,  
projected that the surplus, which totaled $69.2 billion in 1998, 
will climb to $98.8 billion in the current fiscal year, which ends 
Sept. 30, and $142.5 billion in 2000. Congressional accountants had 
predicted a surplus of about $120 billion for all of 1999, but 
recently said it would fall ``a few billion short'' of that 
estimate. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the government enjoyed its first budget surplus since  
1969. Assuming administration projections for this year come 
through, this will be the first back-to-back surpluses since Dwight 
Eisenhower was president in 1956 and 1957. 
</P>
<P>
	The July surplus of $25.16 billion was not revised by the  
government, the Treasury Department said.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia, Northwest Airlines Agree </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- Malaysia and Northwest Airlines  
have struck a deal to share frequent flyer programs and other 
flight arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the first such arrangement between an American and  
Malaysian carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal will allow members of each carrier's frequent-flyer  
program to earn travel credits and redeem awards on both airlines 
as of Nov. 1, the airlines said in a joint statement on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The carriers have also entered a code-sharing deal on their  
Kuala Lumpur-Los Angeles and Kuala Lumpur-Detroit routes. The 
companies said they plan to expand their code-sharing plan to 
include domestic routes in Malaysia and the United States in the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
	Airlines that agree to share their flight codes can exchange  
seat allocations on each other's flights and market them using 
their own flight numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	The partnership between Malaysian and Northwest Airlines may  
also include code-share services on select Malaysia-Asia routes and 
Malaysia-U.S. services operated via the Middle East and Europe, the 
carriers said. 
</P>
<P>
	That part of the agreement is expected to be filed with the  
respective government agencies next week for implementation of the 
code-sharing agreement around January 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Northwest Airlines is the only U.S. passenger airline to fly to  
Malaysia, with three weekly flights from the United States to Kuala 
Lumpur with a stop in Osaka, Japan.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft: Tech Stocks `Overvalued' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- The president of Microsoft Corp. roiled U.S.  
financial markets by warning that technology stocks are overvalued, 
including those of his own company. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is such an overvaluation of tech stocks that it's  
absurd,'' Steven Ballmer said Thursday. ``I would put our company 
and I would put most companies in that category,'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ballmer was speaking during a question and answer session at a  
conference of the Society of American Business Editors and Writers. 
He was asked what story business writers are not covering these 
days. 
</P>
<P>
	His public remarks helped accelerate a sharp selloff on Wall  
Street. The Nasdaq composite index, which is dominated by 
technology bellwethers such as Microsoft and Dell Computer fell 
108.33 points, to 2,749.83, its fourth-biggest decline ever. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballmer blamed a ``gold rush'' mentality for the stock rises,  
saying that the profits being earned by the tech companies don't 
justify the high prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's bad for the long-term health of the economy,'' he said.  
Ballmer explained that since many technology companies pay their 
employees with stock options, the industry is essentially 
delegating employee compensation to Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	Any major market decline could render those options worthless,  
substantially cutting the income of tech sector workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite Ballmer's strong remarks, his company moved on Thursday  
to exploit the market's high prices. It announced plans for an 
initial public offering for its Expedia travel reservations site, a 
move that will give investors the opportunity to focus on just one 
aspect of the company's business and bring in as much as $75 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Expedia stock offering is the latest in a series of  
maneuvers Microsoft has made recently to help its more promising 
online ventures flourish. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballmer's comments echoed those of Internet analyst Lise Buyer  
of Credit Suisse First Boston, who told the writers that tech 
companies' stock prices are generally overvalued. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballmer and other Microsoft officials regularly play down the  
company's profit expectations amid criticism that the world's most 
powerful technology company wields too much dominance in the 
software industry. 
</P>
<P>
	But as the No. 2 Microsoft executive behind chairman Bill Gates,  
Ballmer's public statements are closely watched by Wall Street for 
signs of where the technology business is headed. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, a Microsoft spokeswoman downplayed Ballmer's remarks.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing new here,'' said the spokeswoman, Caroline  
Boren. ``Microsoft has always been cautious in its outlook.''

<HEADLINE> NY Mayor Nixes Money for Exhibit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Brooklyn Museum of Art may lose $7 million  
in city funding unless it cancels an upcoming exhibit featuring 
mutilated pigs, a dung-splattered painting of the Virgin Mary and a 
portrait of a child killer. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Rudolph Giuliani vowed Wednesday to cut off annual support  
for the museum if it goes ahead with October's exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
	``If somebody wants to do that privately and pay for it  
privately, well, that's what the First Amendment is all about,'' 
said Giuliani, a Republican who is considered a potential U.S. 
Senate candidate for 2000. ``But to have the government subsidize 
something like that is outrageous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor is the latest -- and loudest -- voice in a a  
wide-ranging crowd opposing the upcoming ``Sensation: Young British 
Artists From the Saatchi Collection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The collection -- 90 pieces by 42 different artists -- was already  
under fire from Catholic groups and animal rights activists. 
</P>
<P>
	The Catholic League was incensed by Chris Ofili's ``The Holy  
Virgin Mary,'' a painting of the religious icon splattered with 
elephant dung. The People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals were 
upset by the exhibit ``This Little Piggy Went to Market, This 
Little Piggy Stayed Home,'' which features a dissected pig floating 
in formaldehyde. 
</P>
<P>
	Likely to anger others was Marcus Harvey's painting ``Myra,'' a  
13-foot rendering of a British child killer created from children's 
hand prints. 
</P>
<P>
	The museum has acknowledged that ``Sensation'' is R-rated, and  
said no one under 16 will be admitted unless accompanied by a 
parent. The exhibit is scheduled to open Oct. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	The much-hyped collection drew 300,000 visitors when it debuted  
at London's Royal Academy in 1997; three academy members resigned 
in protest when it opened. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to cutting off monthly funding, the city also  
suspended talks on a proposed $20 million capital expansion project 
for the museum. 
</P>
<P>
	Last June, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the federal  
government can opt not to subsidize art it considers indecent. That 
flap, involving the National Endowment for the Arts, began over 
funding of homoerotic images by photographer Robert Mapplethorpe 
and Andres Serrano's photograph of a crucifix immersed in urine. 
</P>
<P>
	Museum director Arnold Lehman, in today's New York Times, said  
``it is the museum's job to support the right of artists to express 
themselves freely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York Civil Liberties Union head Norman Siegel sided with the  
museum, calling Giuliani's threat to yank funding ``heavy-handed 
and inappropriate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Once the government, using public funds, punishes artists to  
suppress unpopular views, we are heading down a dangerous First 
Amendment road,'' Siegel said.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Sink; Dow Ends Down 205.48 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks plummeted Thursday as investors sold  
heavily amid continued worries about higher interest rates and the 
strength of the dollar. A Microsoft executive's warning that 
technology stocks are overvalued robbed the market of a big source 
of strength. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average fell 205.48, or 2 percent, to  
close at 10,318.59. That brought the Dow's decline over the past 
three sessions to 505.31 points, or 4.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	This week's selloff has left the Dow more than 1,000 points  
below its Aug. 25 closing record of 11,326.04. That's a drop of 8.9 
percent -- just shy of the 10 percent drop analysts use to define a 
market correction. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also fell steeply. The Standard &AMP;  
Poor's 500 fell 30.10 to 1,280.41, and the Nasdaq composite index 
fell 108.33 to 2,749.83, its fourth-biggest decline ever. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market is under the weight of so many threats right now,''  
said Scott Bleier, chief investment strategist at Prime Charter 
Ltd., citing rising interest rates and the tumbling dollar among 
the most pressing problems. ``It has deteriorated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's decline was broad-based, even as blue-chip stocks  
made some short-lived attempts to reverse their decline. In early 
afternoon, the Dow abandoned a brief rally that pushed it as much 
as 48 points above Wednesday's close. The quick erosion of the 
buying spree reinforced concerns about the market's condition. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no new fundamental reason for the weak market, but  
there's a great deal of nervousness,'' said William Meehan, chief 
market analyst for Cantor Fitzgerald. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock investors brushed aside any news that could have supported  
stocks. Bond yields plummeted, to 5.99 percent on the 30-year 
Treasury bond from 6.08 percent late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The market also discounted a modest rise in the dollar against  
the Japanese yen. In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted 
at 103.95 yen, up from 103.93 late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the U.S. currency is lingering near its lowest levels  
against the yen since 1996. The dollar's weakness has contributed 
to a sharp decline in U.S. stocks this week. A lowerr dollar makes 
imports more expensive, setting the stage for inflation, and it 
also makes foreign investments more attractive. 
</P>
<P>
	The market was unnerved by a Labor Department report that showed  
the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits 
fell unexpectedly last week to the lowest level in 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The extremely low U.S. jobless rate has fostered fears that  
companies will have to increase wages and benefits in order to 
attract skilled workers. That, too, could set the stage for a 
revival of inflation, and for an increase in interest rates when 
the Federal Reserve meets Oct. 5. 
</P>
<P>
	While the weaker dollar and interest rate fears have frozen many  
stocks in recent weeks, strength in leading technology companies 
has brought the Nasdaq to new records, and kept the broader market 
from falling into a swoon. 
</P>
<P>
	But that strength evaporated Thursday after Microsoft president  
Steve Ballmer said at a conference that technology stocks -- 
including Microsoft -- are too highly priced. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is such an overvaluation of tech stocks that it's  
absurd,'' he said. ``I would put our company and I would put most 
companies in that category.'' Microsoft investors heeded his 
warning, sending its shares down 4 7/8 to 91 3/16. Dell fell 3 1/16 to 
43, and Yahoo! dropped 5 3/4 to 173 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow's technology components plummeted as well. IBM lost 3  
3/16 to 122, and Hewlett Packard lost 4 5/16 to 94 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Semiconductor companies added to the weakness amid concerns that  
the earthquake that hit Taiwan earlier this week will hurt 
production and may force price increases. Intel plunged 5 5/16 to 
77 1/2 and Texas Instruments fell 2 3/4 to 83 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Taiwan's semiconductor sector accounts for about 10 percent of  
the world's chipmaking capacity and about 80 percent of the 
``motherboards'' used to run personal computers, according to the 
Semiconductor Industry Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 5-to-2 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where composite volume totaled 1.06 
billion shares, compared with 977.22 million in the previous 
session. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 7.32 to 420.21.  
</P>
<P>
	With Thursday's decline, both the Dow and the S&AMP;P 500 tumbled  
below so-called technical support levels. Traders said the Dow's 
drop below 10,500 and the S&AMP;P's drop below 1,300 prompted 
additional selling, due partially to computer-driven trading and 
partially to a heightened sense of the market's troubles. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's stock market was closed for a national  
holiday. European indexes rose after the European Central Bank left 
interest rates unchanged. Germany's DAX index gained 1.2 percent, 
Britain's FT-SE 100 rose 0.9 percent, and France's CAC-40 rose 0.7 
percent.

<HEADLINE> House OKs Lawsuit Rule Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House took aim Thursday at what  
Republicans called abuses in class action lawsuits, passing 
legislation that would move most such suits into federal courts. 
</P>
<P>
	Most Democrats and the White House opposed the measure, saying  
it would make it harder for individuals to seek grievances from a 
wrongdoing company. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure, passed 222-207, would grant federal courts  
jurisdiction in cases where any member of the proposed class is a 
citizen of a state different from any defendant. 
</P>
<P>
	Shifting many class action lawsuits away from state courts would  
prevent such practices as ``forum shopping,'' in which attorneys 
file suits in states where they are more likely to get a favorable 
ruling, supporters said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hundreds of frivolous lawsuits are filed in favorable state  
courts and used as high-stakes court-endorsed blackmail devices 
against companies that usually settle rather than face a long and 
arduous court battle,'' said Rep. John Linder, R-Ga. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation is backed by business groups and industries that  
have been the target of class action lawsuits, including the 
tobacco, gun and auto industries. But its prospects are uncertain 
in the Senate, and the administration said in a statement that it 
would recommend a presidential veto if the bill ever wins final 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Many state residents would be denied access to their own state  
courts, and the legislation coincides with ``a time when the chief 
justice, among others, has repeatedly expressed serious concerns 
about the increasingly burdensome workload of the federal courts,'' 
the administration said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is really the camel's nose under the tent,'' said Frank  
Clemente, director of Public Citizen's Congress Watch. He said 
passage would be a victory for corporate interests pressing their 
Republican allies to pass legislation giving them more protection 
from what they regard as predatory liability lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this legislation is enacted, it will provide the tobacco  
industry with unprecedented legal protection,'' said Rep. Henry 
Waxman, D-Calif. ``It is nothing less than a backdoor immunity from 
class action lawsuits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats proposed amendments to exempt lawsuits involving  
firearms or tobacco from the legislation, but they were defeated. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Robert Goodlatte, R-Va., the chief sponsor of the  
legislation, argued that legislation was necessary because 
different certification standards for class actions in the states 
have opened the way for abuse. Attorneys, he said, shop around 
until they find the one judge in the one state ``who thinks 
anything goes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said his bill would keep purely local matters in state  
courts. Cases would not go to federal courts when a substantial 
majority of the class members and defendants are citizens of the 
same states and the claims governed primarily by that state's law. 
</P>
<P>
	Cases where the primary defendants are states or state  
officials, or where the class has fewer than 100 members and the 
amount in controversy is less than $1 million would also stay in 
the state court. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation was opposed by the Judicial Conference of the  
United States, which represents federal judges, on the grounds that 
it would upset principles of federalism and add to the burdens of 
federal courts. With the addition of more class action suits, it 
said, ``substantial backlogs and attendant delays can be 
expected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	----	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.R. 1875.

<HEADLINE> Blind Robbery Suspect Arraigned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MUSKEGON, Mich. (AP) -- A blind man is accused of robbing two  
stores while carrying his white cane. 
</P>
<P>
	Leon Grigsby Martin, 33, of Muskegon Heights, was arraigned  
Wednesday on an armed robbery charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said they believe the suspect had two accomplices when  
robbing the Roosevelt Park Rite-Aid store Tuesday and the Meijer 
store in Norton Shores on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The holdups got a $20 bill from the drugstore and $320 from  
Meijer, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	When arrested, Martin admitted he had been smoking crack that  
night with a man and a woman and told police he had been forced to 
commit the robberies. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said they do not believe was forced to commit the  
robberies, since he was alone several times during the thefts and 
could have asked for help.

<HEADLINE> CEO Arrested in Vietnam Sex Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- An electronics executive was arrested on  
charges he paid the family of a 13-year-old Vietnamese girl more 
than $150,000 to have sex with her in Vietnam, federal authorities 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael David Rostoker, 41, of Boulder Creek, was taken into  
custody at San Francisco International Airport on Wednesday as he 
was about to board a flight for Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
	Rostoker, an engineer and patent attorney, is president and CEO  
of Microelectronics Research Inc., of San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
	Also arrested was Tri Roy Cole, 40, of San Jose. He was being  
held for investigation of aiding and abetting Rostoker. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities allege Cole, originally from Vietnam, arranged the  
liaison between Rostoker and the girl in exchange for an 
undetermined amount of money. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Rostoker traveled on ``numerous occasions'' to  
Vietnam this year to have sex with the minor. Rostoker was in the 
process of arranging false papers for the girl so he could bring 
her into the country to live with him, authorities said.

<HEADLINE> Iowa State's Davis Follows Brother </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMES, Iowa (AP) -- By the end of the season, a Davis will still  
sit atop Iowa State's career rushing list. 
</P>
<P>
	The question is, which Davis?  
</P>
<P>
	Troy Davis, now with the New Orleans Saints, is the current  
leader with 4,382 yards. But little brother Darren is quickly 
gaining ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Darren Davis, a senior with the Cyclones, has 2,930 yards, and  
while he once thought Troy's mark was unattainable, he's thinking 
differently after leading Iowa State (3-0) to its best start since 
1981. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now I feel it's in reach,'' Davis said. ``And my guys up front  
have had a few words about it. Now I can look at it and reach it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If he keeps running at his current pace, he will. Davis is  
second nationally in rushing with an average of 185 yards a game. 
He needs to average just over 181.5 yards in the final eight games 
to pass Troy. 
</P>
<P>
	But it won't be easy. Iowa State is entering the toughest part  
of its schedule, starting with Saturday's visit by No. 15 Kansas 
State, which has given up only 94 yards rushing in two games. Five 
more teams that went to bowls last season follow on Iowa State's 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	But a guy can dream, can't he? Besides, Iowa State leads the  
nation in rushing at 354.3 yards a game and is playing with the 
confidence that comes from winning. The Cyclones feel they can run 
the ball on anyone. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the mentality we have as an offensive line,'' tackle  
Marcel Howard said. ``You put anybody in front of us, we're going 
to do our best to block for Darren. We're not going to back down 
from anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Troy Davis played at Iowa State from 1994-96 and is the only  
back in NCAA Division I with two 2,000-yard seasons. Darren hasn't 
reached 2,000 in a season yet, but he's well on his way to becoming 
the first Iowa State back with three 1,000-yard seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	He has 555 already, including 235 against Iowa and 208 against  
UNLV. Davis might have had 200 yards in the opener with Indiana 
State if he hadn't been sidelined by a cramp early in the second 
half after gaining 112 yards on just 13 carries. 
</P>
<P>
	``Through the first three games, he has just been fantastic,''  
Iowa State coach Dan McCarney said. ``Darren is running the 
football like he's possessed. He's turned it up. As good as he's 
been the last couple of years, he's a better running back right 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis said he's not the one who's better. It's his linemen who  
are making the difference. 
</P>
<P>
	``The line just got outstanding over the past year,'' he said.  
``They went at it in the summer and two-a-days and got much better 
than last year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever the reason, Iowa State's running game definitely is  
better. Despite Davis' 1,000-yard seasons, Iowa State finished 81st 
nationally in rushing last year and 103rd in 1997. The Cyclones' 
1,063 yards rushing yards this year are more than they had in the 
entire '97 season (1,028). 
</P>
<P>
	Can they keep it up?  
</P>
<P>
	``It's not up to me,'' Davis said. ``It's up to the guys up  
front. Obviously, the first three games we went at it pretty good, 
put some pretty good numbers up. It's all going to be those guys up 
front.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Iowa State's fast start hasn't prompted any bowl talk just yet,  
though McCarney was reminded the other day that his team might be 
only one victory from the Top 25. And not since Troy Davis was 
racking up yards has there been such excitement over Iowa State 
football. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cyclones have been among the early surprises, along with the  
likes of Illinois, Maryland and Oregon State, all 3-0 after losing 
seasons a year ago. Iowa State hasn't won more than three games 
since going 4-7 in 1992, and had its last winning season in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the kind of thing we dream about,'' McCarney said,  
``that people would have some real genuine excitement and it 
wouldn't be just to come watch Troy Davis run the ball, but this is 
a team that's fun to watch and we do have a good defense and we do 
have a good, solid offense ... and there is a good relationship 
between football and our fans. I think we sure have that now.''

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Vetoes GOP Tax Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After weeks of partisan jockeying over taxes,  
President Clinton today vetoed the $792 billion tax cut pushed by 
Republicans and called on Congress to approve ``tax relief we can 
afford'' by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
	But GOP leaders said later it was highly unlikely a compromise  
on broad tax cuts could be reached this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The president vetoed the bill at a wooden desk on a stage in the  
White House Rose Garden, before a small audience of Cabinet 
members, advocates for the elderly and others. It was the 26th veto 
of his presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he rejected the tax bill because it would ``turn us  
back to the failed policies of the past'' at a time when the nation 
is enjoying economic prosperity. He said he will seek to work with 
GOP leaders on an alternative tax plan ``that reflects the 
priorities of both parties and the values of the American people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter accompanying the signed veto, Clinton told Congress  
he refused to sign ``because it ignores the principles that have 
led us to the sound economy we enjoy today and emphasizes tax 
reduction for those who need it the least.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But on Capitol Hill, the battle lines were clearly drawn. House  
Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said lawmakers are open to 
compromise, ``but we will not work with the president to raise 
taxes, raid the Social Security trust fund or pile on more debt on 
the American people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., told  
reporters they would concentrate on passing annual government 
spending bills, reducing federal debt, protecting Social Security 
funds and preventing tax increases during the rest of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Other than a limited measure renewing expiring tax provisions,  
they said compromise with Clinton on tax cuts would probably not 
happen and would be left as an issue when Congress reconvenes in 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see it as practical this year,'' Lott said. ``The  
president says he wants to work with us, but he has not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Clinton is ``willing to  
look at what we can afford'' in a tax cut, on the condition that 
Social Security and Medicare are shored up first. But any potential 
tax cut, Lockhart said, would have to be in the range of Clinton's 
$300 billion proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't afford more than that. We're willing to talk about  
it,'' Lockhart said. ``Every Republican leader on Capitol Hill 
understands that the president's door is open.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways and Means  
Committee, said that by vetoing the bill, Clinton ``has given 
himself a license to spend, and spend he will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``President Clinton has once again put the needs of Washington  
above the needs of the American people, and that's too bad,'' 
Archer asserted. ``Americans should know that the big blank check 
in Washington is drawn on their checkbook, and they will get stuck 
with the bill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tax bill would have used part of a projected 10-year budget  
surplus to reduce all federal income tax rates by 1 percentage 
point, cut capital-gains taxes, phase out estate taxes and the 
alternative minimum tax and ease the ``marriage penalty'' paid by 
many two-income couples. On nearly party-line votes, it passed in 
the House, 221-206, and in the Senate, 50-49, falling far short of 
the two-thirds majority needed to overturn a veto. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said such an ambitious tax cut reflected misplaced  
priorities -- salvaging Social Security and Medicare should come 
first, he insisted. He also said it would absorb so much of the 
projected budget surpluses that federal programs from national 
parks to education could suffer deep, debilitating cuts. He has 
instead proposed cutting taxes by up to $300 billion, and called on 
Congress to work with him on a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bill is too big, too bloated, places too big a burden on  
America's economy,'' Clinton said. ``I ask Congress not to go home 
until we have worked together once again. We can work together to 
pass tax relief we can afford.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a recent letter to Clinton, Lott and Hastert denied the tax  
cut would hurt entitlement programs and raised the prospect that 
surpluses would be used to ``pay for other Washington spending.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Sept. 15, the day the tax plan was delivered to the  
president, Vice President Al Gore -- who is pursuing the Democratic 
presidential nomination -- dlared it ``dead on arrival at the White 
House.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Polls have consistently shown that tax cuts are not as important  
to voters as saving Social Security or strengthening Medicare. Many 
polls show that up to half of Americans believe the GOP tax cut 
would mainly benefit the wealthy. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Charles Rangel of New York, ranking Democrat on the House  
Ways and Means Committee, said the political nature of the tax bill 
was ultimately its downfall. 
</P>
<P>
	``They never drafted a tax bill. Really, it was a political  
statement drafted to mobilize people and support for Republicans in 
the House and Senate,'' Rangel said. ``They know you have to 
negotiate a bill of that size. They never wanted to negotiate it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Internal Revenue Service is urging Republicans to  
move quickly if they plan to extend several expiring tax provisions 
so forms can be drafted for the 2000 filing season. 
</P>
<P>
	IRS Commissioner Charles Rossotti told Archer at a meeting  
Wednesday that tax law changes effective for next year should be on 
the president's desk by Oct. 7. 
</P>
<P>
	Archer said he hoped to move forward on a tax package -- possibly  
as early as Friday -- that would extend several expiring provisions 
at a one-year cost of roughly $3 billion. These extensions were 
part of the larger $792 billion tax cut, but unlike that bill they 
have broad bipartisan support.

<HEADLINE> Russian Police Defuse Large Bomb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Police discovered an explosive device set to blow  
up in the basement of a 12-story apartment building in western 
Russia, averting what could have been another in a string of deadly 
bombings that have terrorized Russia in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Police did not say whether there was a link between the device,  
found Wednesday night in the city of Ryazan, and four apartment 
bomb blasts that killed some 300 people in Moscow and two other 
Russian cities this month. The device found in Ryazan and the 
location were similar to the earlier attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	The apartment bombings have been blamed on Islamic militants  
from breakaway Chechnya, who have twice invaded the neighboring 
region of Dagestan in southern Russia since the beginning of 
August. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities in Ryazan were alerted by a resident of the building  
who claimed to have seen people hauling large sacks from a car 
whose license plates were covered up, the ITAR-Tass news agency 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Emergency Situations Ministry, the sacks  
contained sugar mixed with the explosive hexogen -- the material 
that police say was used in the previous blasts. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities found the explosives, with a timer set to go off at  
around dawn, and evacuated everyone from building. The device was 
safely defused, the ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
	Security has been stepped up around the country following the  
apartment bombings. People have been asked to alert authorities if 
they spot any unusual activities, unattended bags or other 
suspicious objects. 
</P>
<P>
	Police also have been raiding warehouses, apartment building  
basements and other nonresidential property, searching for 
explosives. 
</P>
<P>
	Police have found two stockpiles of explosives during raids in  
recent days in the restive southern region of Stavropol, near 
breakaway Chechnya, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported. Three more 
caches of explosives were found earlier in the region, the report 
said. It didn't say where the explosives were found, or specify the 
type. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a small explosion hit an elevator in an apartment  
building in northwest St. Petersburg on Wednesday. No one was hurt 
and no damage was reported, Emergencies Ministry spokesman Oleg 
Semionog said. Officials said it was likely a prank. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no reason to qualify it as a terrorist act,'' Semionog  
said. ``No one would have noticed except that people's tensions are 
very high.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A poll conducted before the latest discoveries showed that 49  
percent of Russians believe the government hasn't done enough to 
prevent new bombings, and an overwhelming 86 percent of Russians 
said they expected more terrorist bombings. 
</P>
<P>
	Only four percent believed the bombings were over, according to  
the poll by the independent Regional Political Research Center. The 
survey had a margin of error of 2 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	The Islamic militants, who have been blamed for the bombings,  
were driven out of Dagestan by Russian troops in heavy fighting, 
but smaller cross-border clashes have continued. Government troops 
were digging in along the border with Chechnya to prevent possible 
new attacks, and Russian jets bombed suspected militant bases 
inside the breakaway region. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty-nine percent of Russians approved of the air raids, while  
36 percent objected, according to the poll.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Seeks Support From Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Yasser Arafat is looking for more support from  
one of his principal boosters, President Clinton, while American 
efforts to engineer a land-for-peace deal between Israel and Syria 
stumble. 
</P>
<P>
	At 70, Arafat is determined to see a Palestinian state  
established in his lifetime, either through negotiations with 
Israel that are now under way or unilaterally, if the talks fail to 
produce his desired results. 
</P>
<P>
	He also wants its capital in Jerusalem.  
</P>
<P>
	Clinton already has publicly endorsed Palestinian  
``aspirations,'' a thinly coded allusion to statehood, has declared 
that Palestinian refugees have the right to live wherever they 
wish, and blocked transfer of the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to 
Jerusalem, which would have strengthened Israel's claim to the city 
as its eternal capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Arafat wants assurances Clinton will intervene if negotiations  
with Israel falter, and he wants promises of U.S. financial support 
and the kind of ties the United States usually reserves for 
established governments. 
</P>
<P>
	Arafat warmed up for his session today at the White House with  
Clinton with a meeting Wednesday night in New York with Secretary 
of State Madeleine Albright, who helped pull off a new agreement 
this month with Israel that gives the Palestinian Authority more 
land on the West Bank where Arafat intends to establish a state. 
</P>
<P>
	Arafat and the Clinton administration are pleased that Israel's  
promise to pull back is being implemented ``to the letter,'' 
Albright said, ``and I think he wants to give his assessment to the 
president about where things are going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that he has obviously assessed the possibilities that  
are open,'' Albright told reporters in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, looking to his legacy, is hoping to preside at an  
overall Israeli-Palestinian accord and also one on the Syrian 
track. 
</P>
<P>
	Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa told Albright on  
Wednesday that his country remained interested in peace talks with 
Israel, but only on its terms for regaining control of the 
strategic Golan Heights. 
</P>
<P>
	He informed reporters that U.S. mediators had not found a  
formula to reopen negotiations. There is no breakthrough, he said. 
``I think progress has not been achieved yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Albright said ``no one meeting is pivotal'' and that she would  
see al-Sharaa again while he is in New York attending the special 
session of the U.N. General Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is an intention to move forward on both sides. There is  
a seriousness of purpose that gives us a reason to push on with 
this,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Syria wants Israel to acknowledge that negotiations broken off  
three years ago should resume with an Israeli promise to relinquish 
all the land Syria lost in the 1967 Mideast War, along with a 
three-mile stretch that was once part of British-mandated 
Palestine. 
</P>
<P>
	That would advance Syria to within reach of the Sea of Galilee  
and its treasured water supply. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright, neither endorsing nor rejecting Syria's demands, said  
Damascus had taken this position ``over and over again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Syrian minister said the United States was serving as a  
go-between, holding talks with both sides in an attempt to narrow 
differences before negotiations could be reopened. 
</P>
<P>
	Al-Sharaa said the late Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin had  
agreed to relinquish the territory, and that his successor, Shimon 
Peres, had concurred. The moment Israel acknowledges that 
commitment, Syria is ready to negotiate peace and security terms, 
al-Sharaa said. 
</P>
<P>
	Syria has taken this position consistently. It is not clear  
where Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak stands, although he has 
spoken of a desire to retain certain areas on the lower slopes of 
the Golan, where some of Israel's water sources lie. 
</P>
<P>
	When he was Israel's top general, Barak said retaining the Golan  
Heights was essential for Israel's security. But as a minister in 
the Rabin and Peres governments, he supported their overtures to 
swap the high ground overlooking northeastern Israel for a solid 
peace treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	After his election in May, Barak said Israel was ready for  
``painful compromises,'' suggesting a willingness to pull back 
without saying specifically from all of the Golan Heights, 
especially near the shores of Galilee. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright subscribes to the idea that Israel should give up land  
for peace on the Syrian front as well as with the Palestinians. But 
she has not taken a position on how much. 
</P>
<P>
	Al-Sharaa said the United States was completely aware of  
Israel's commitment, and ``they can try to bridge the gap between 
the two sides.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Albright is due to meet with the Israeli foreign minister, David  
Levy, in New York on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	She also met Wednesday with the Egyptian foreign minister, Amr  
Moussa, and urged his government to lend support to cooperation on 
water supplies, economic development, curbs on weapons and on other 
topics between Israel and the Arab countries. 
</P>
<P>
	On the golf course, at the Camp David presidential retreat in  
Maryland, even after a funeral procession in Morocco, Clinton has 
made more than a dozen private contacts with Middle East leaders in 
recent months to push the peace process along, aides say. 
</P>
<P>
	The aides, reconstructing conversations that have been kept  
private, say the president made 10 telephone calls to Barak and 
Arafat as they worked out their revised West Bank agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton counseled both sides ``to try to get them to understand  
each other and to deal with one another in a way that overcame the 
years of distrust,'' said a White House official familiar with the 
conversations.

<HEADLINE> 2nd Supremacist Gets Death Penalty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRYAN, Texas (AP) -- White supremacist Lawrence Russell Brewer  
once told his prison cohort that a life sentence for a vicious hate 
killing would do ``no justice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A jury agreed Thursday, sentencing the 32-year-old career  
criminal to death for the June 7, 1998, dragging death of James 
Byrd Jr., 49. 
</P>
<P>
	Brewer's former prison pal, John William King, 24, is already on  
death row, convicted and condemned in February for murdering the 
black man, who was chained by his ankles to a pickup truck and 
dragged to his death 15 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	A third man, Shawn Allen Berry, also 24, awaits a capital murder  
trial next month in his hometown of Jasper, where the killing took 
place. 
</P>
<P>
	Brewer wrote in a jailhouse letter to King that the two of them  
had become stars and that he was a ``hero of the day.'' In the same 
note, introduced as evidence and written after the two were 
arrested for Byrd's murder, Brewer mused that a lethal injection 
would be a ``little old sleeping medicine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both met in prison where they joined the Confederate Knights of  
America, a racist group, and adorned themselves with racist 
tattoos. 
</P>
<P>
	The death sentence for Brewer came as a relief to prosecutors,  
who weathered two days of deliberations and what appeared to be a 
near-miss for the punishment they sought. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not a death penalty fan,'' Jasper County District Attorney  
Guy James Gray said. ``But this is a situation where if you don't 
give the death penalty to this man, he'll hurt and kill again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A life sentence seemed close for Brewer, when the jury sent a  
note in their 13th hour of deliberations indicating they were 
unable to reach a conclusion for the third and final question they 
were tasked with answering: whether there were any mitigating 
circumstances to spare Brewer's life. 
</P>
<P>
	To reach that point, the jury had already answered affirmatively  
that Brewer planned to kill Byrd and was a future danger to 
society. State District Judge Monte Lawlis instructed the jurors to 
continue deliberating unless they were ``unequivocally'' certain 
they could not reach a unanimous decision, which is required to 
hand down the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than an hour later, they had.  
</P>
<P>
	``They took their time looking for some mitigating  
circumstances, but they weren't going to find it,'' said Byrd's 
sister, Mary Verrett, as she hugged police and prosecutors just 
after the verdict. ``They dug for it. But there are no mitigating 
circumstances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The jury's answer was not a shock to Brewer, his lead attorney  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Russell had resigned himself to this,'' said Doug Barlow.  
</P>
<P>
	Brewer's family, speaking before the verdict came down, had also  
prepared for the worst. 
</P>
<P>
	``My son has been convicted of a horrible, horrible crime. I  
don't excuse his actions, though I honestly believe that when he 
took the stand he told the truth,'' Lawrence Russell Brewer Sr., 
Brewer's father, wrote in a statement. ``If he gets the death 
penalty, I can accept it. I know it would be God's will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two hours after the punishment verdict, Brewer, in shackles and  
wearing an orange jail jumpsuit, was in the backseat of a silver 
police car for the 50-mile trip east to death row in Huntsville. 
</P>
<P>
	With a second death penalty secured, Gray said he is looking  
forward to trying Berry's case in late October. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a lot of work to do on Shawn Berry's case. We're not  
exactly sure where it's going right now. He doesn't have the racist 
background King and Brewer did, none of the tattoos.''

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Vetoes GOP Tax Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After weeks of partisan jockeying over taxes,  
President Clinton today vetoed the $792 billion tax cut pushed by 
Republicans and called on Congress to approve ``tax relief we can 
afford'' by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
	But GOP leaders said later it was highly unlikely a compromise  
on broad tax cuts could be reached this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The president vetoed the bill at a wooden desk on a stage in the  
White House Rose Garden, before a small audience of Cabinet 
members, advocates for the elderly and others. It was the 26th veto 
of his presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he rejected the tax bill because it would ``turn us  
back to the failed policies of the past'' at a time when the nation 
is enjoying economic prosperity. He said he will seek to work with 
GOP leaders on an alternative tax plan ``that reflects the 
priorities of both parties and the values of the American people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter accompanying the signed veto, Clinton told Congress  
he refused to sign ``because it ignores the principles that have 
led us to the sound economy we enjoy today and emphasizes tax 
reduction for those who need it the least.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But on Capitol Hill, the battle lines were clearly drawn. House  
Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said lawmakers are open to 
compromise, ``but we will not work with the president to raise 
taxes, raid the Social Security trust fund or pile on more debt on 
the American people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., told  
reporters they would concentrate on passing annual government 
spending bills, reducing federal debt, protecting Social Security 
funds and preventing tax increases during the rest of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Other than a limited measure renewing expiring tax provisions,  
they said compromise with Clinton on tax cuts would probably not 
happen and would be left as an issue when Congress reconvenes in 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see it as practical this year,'' Lott said. ``The  
president says he wants to work with us, but he has not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Clinton is ``willing to  
look at what we can afford'' in a tax cut, on the condition that 
Social Security and Medicare are shored up first. But any potential 
tax cut, Lockhart said, would have to be in the range of Clinton's 
$300 billion proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't afford more than that. We're willing to talk about  
it,'' Lockhart said. ``Every Republican leader on Capitol Hill 
understands that the president's door is open.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways and Means  
Committee, said that by vetoing the bill, Clinton ``has given 
himself a license to spend, and spend he will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``President Clinton has once again put the needs of Washington  
above the needs of the American people, and that's too bad,'' 
Archer asserted. ``Americans should know that the big blank check 
in Washington is drawn on their checkbook, and they will get stuck 
with the bill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tax bill would have used part of a projected 10-year budget  
surplus to reduce all federal income tax rates by 1 percentage 
point, cut capital-gains taxes, phase out estate taxes and the 
alternative minimum tax and ease the ``marriage penalty'' paid by 
many two-income couples. On nearly party-line votes, it passed in 
the House, 221-206, and in the Senate, 50-49, falling far short of 
the two-thirds majority needed to overturn a veto. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said such an ambitious tax cut reflected misplaced  
priorities -- salvaging Social Security and Medicare should come 
first, he insisted. He also said it would absorb so much of the 
projected budget surpluses that federal programs from national 
parks to education could suffer deep, debilitating cuts. He has 
instead proposed cutting taxes by up to $300 billion, and called on 
Congress to work with him on a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bill is too big, too bloated, places too big a burden on  
America's economy,'' Clinton said. ``I ask Congress not to go home 
until we have worked together once again. We can work together to 
pass tax relief we can afford.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a recent letter to Clinton, Lott and Hastert denied the tax  
cut would hurt entitlement programs and raised the prospect that 
surpluses would be used to ``pay for other Washington spending.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Sept. 15, the day the tax plan was delivered to the  
president, Vice President Al Gore -- who is pursuing the Democratic 
presidential nomination -- dlared it ``dead on arrival at the White 
House.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Polls have consistently shown that tax cuts are not as important  
to voters as saving Social Security or strengthening Medicare. Many 
polls show that up to half of Americans believe the GOP tax cut 
would mainly benefit the wealthy. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Charles Rangel of New York, ranking Democrat on the House  
Ways and Means Committee, said the political nature of the tax bill 
was ultimately its downfall. 
</P>
<P>
	``They never drafted a tax bill. Really, it was a political  
statement drafted to mobilize people and support for Republicans in 
the House and Senate,'' Rangel said. ``They know you have to 
negotiate a bill of that size. They never wanted to negotiate it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Internal Revenue Service is urging Republicans to  
move quickly if they plan to extend several expiring tax provisions 
so forms can be drafted for the 2000 filing season. 
</P>
<P>
	IRS Commissioner Charles Rossotti told Archer at a meeting  
Wednesday that tax law changes effective for next year should be on 
the president's desk by Oct. 7. 
</P>
<P>
	Archer said he hoped to move forward on a tax package -- possibly  
as early as Friday -- that would extend several expiring provisions 
at a one-year cost of roughly $3 billion. These extensions were 
part of the larger $792 billion tax cut, but unlike that bill they 
have broad bipartisan support.

<HEADLINE> Gene That Controls Cell Size Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The laboratory fruit flies are shaped right  
and have perfectly formed cells, but they are about half the size 
of normal flies because of gene manipulation. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers at the Friedrich Miescher Institute in Basel  
Switzerland report in the journal Science that fruit flies missing 
a single gene, called dS6K, develop more slowly and grow to adults 
that are only about 46 percent the size of normal fruit flies. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, to be published Friday, shows that the dS6K gene  
controls the size of cells in the body. Flies that lack the gene 
had the normal number of cells, but each cell was about a third the 
size of similar cells in normal flies. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers also found that the loss of dS6K function caused  
cells to reproduce more slowly and that it took several days longer 
for mutant flies to grow from larvae to adults. 
</P>
<P>
	The research is an effort to learn how specific genes affect  
development. Fruit flies are studied because they share many of the 
same fundamental genes as human beings.

<HEADLINE> Sergio Gets Tiger in Ryder Pairings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROOKLINE, Mass. (AP) -- The Ryder Cup captains unwittingly gave  
everyone the pairing they wanted to see -- Tiger Woods and Sergio 
Garcia -- even though the two youngest and brightest stars in golf 
will have some company. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods will be paired with Tom Lehman and the 19-year-old Spanish  
sensation will be joined by Jesper Parnevik in the second of four 
alternate-shot matches that kick off the 33rd Ryder Cup on Friday 
morning at The Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
	The pairings were publicly announced during the opening ceremony  
Thursday afternoon, and drew the loudest cheer of all. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods, who held off Garcia by one stroke to win the PGA  
Championship, shrugged it off. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not 1-on-1. It's alternate shot, and you only hit half  
the shots,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The buzz that pairing will bring wasn't lost on Lehman or U.S.  
captain Ben Crenshaw. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even though it's a team format, Sergio and Tiger going at is a  
golf fan's dream,'' said Lehman, who was surprised to be paired 
with Woods since they had not played together all week. 
</P>
<P>
	The pairings process is a blind draw, with Crenshaw and Mark  
James separately submitting, in order, their four groups for each 
set of matches. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mark James and I met down by the skating pond on No. 3 and  
worked this out for you all,'' Crenshaw cracked. ``The pairing came 
out and everybody just kind of shook their head a little bit. That 
adds so much excitement, obviously. It's something that people want 
to see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That wasn't the only surprise.  
</P>
<P>
	Davis Love III thought he might be paired with Justin Leonard.  
Instead, Crenshaw benched Leonard for the morning matches and put 
Love with U.S. Open champion Payne Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	Crenshaw said leaving Leonard out of the morning matches was  
simply a case of having too many players on top of their game. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's an impossibility to try to look at four names and say,  
`Well, who am I going to leave out?' I've driven myself nuts,'' he 
said. ``You've got to push the button somewhere. I mean, the whole 
lineup is playing well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest surprise for Europe was who won't be playing right  
away -- Masters champion Jose Maria Olazabal, the most experienced 
player for Europe who has never missed a Ryder Cup match. 
</P>
<P>
	Olazabal has been wild off the tee and is quick to degrade  
himself. After a 75 in the first round of the U.S. Open, he slammed 
his fist into a hotel wall and broke his hand. Since then, he has 
missed the cut three times and not finished better than 40th. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wasn't ready,'' assistant captain Sam Torrance said. ``I  
think that's awesome he would do that. That's being honest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Accuracy off the tee is crucial in alternate-shot matches, but  
Olazabal conceded even on Tuesday that the fairways of The Country 
Club are ``not wide enough for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miguel Angel Jimenez instead will be paired with Irishman  
Padraig Harrington, who made his first Ryder Cup team by finishing 
second in the final tournament to qualify. They will be in the 
third match against Love and Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	James put Olazabal and Harrington together for a final practice  
round Thursday morning ``so that Jose Maria could see that if he 
actually didn't play, someone who is playing very well was going to 
take his place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	James is leading off with his best player. Colin Montgomerie and  
British Open champion Paul Lawrie will play against Phil Mickelson 
and David Duval, the only Ryder Cup rookie for the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The final match puts Lee Westwood and Darren Clarke,  
affectionately known as ``The Spice Boys'' in Europe for their love 
of fast cars and nightlife. They will be matched against two of the 
straightest players for the United States, Hal Sutton and Jeff 
Maggert. 
</P>
<P>
	The pairing with Woods and Garcia could really be a wash if one  
winds up hitting tee shots from the odd-numbered holes, and the 
other tees off on the even-numbered holes. And as much as Crenshaw 
was fascinated that the pairing worked out that way, he wasn't 
locked in on the two young stars. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tiger has a got a very solid horse right there with him,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States is hoping to get off to a fast start,  
particularly since Europe has won or retained the Ryder Cup five of 
the past seven times. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be an interesting start,'' Love said. ``If we  
can get ahead, we can do real well. We just don't want to get 
behind. Hopefully, those first couple of matches we can get out 
there and get off to a good start.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the first set of matches hardly determines the outcome.  
The last time Europe led after round one was in 1973.

<HEADLINE> Texas Church Holds Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Members of a church that lost seven  
parishoners to a gunman returned to their scarred sanctuary for the 
second service since the shooting last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Church member Chip Gillette, the first police officer on the  
scene after the shooting, displayed a hymnbook that stopped a 
bullet. 
</P>
<P>
	He said at the gathering Wednesday that the slug stopped at the  
words: ``He shall reign forever and ever, that he is Lord of Lords 
and King of Kings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Chills went up my spine 'cause I said, 'Lord, show me  
something out of that,''' Gillette said, ``and he said, 'I am Lord 
of Lords and King of Kings and I will reign forever; I will have 
this victory out of that, Chip.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The gunman, Larry Gene Ashbrook, killed himself after opening  
fire on Sept. 15 during a service at Wedgwood Baptist Church. 
</P>
<P>
	The church is still being repaired. Bloodstained carpet was  
pulled up, leaving bare floors, and blood-splattered pew cushions 
were carried away. 
</P>
<P>
	Medical examiners released test results Wednesday that showed  
Ashbrook, 47, had not been drinking or taking drugs. Police 
initially said Ashbrook might have taken anti-depressants but later 
said they were mistaken.

<HEADLINE> Couple Arrested in Minister's Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADISONVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Nancy Petty remembers her brother,  
the Rev. William Petty Jr., warning her not to pick up hitchhikers. 
But she said the man who strived to help others failed to follow 
his own advice. 
</P>
<P>
	It may have cost him his life, investigators say.  
</P>
<P>
	Nathan Hass, 30, was hitchhiking near Chattanooga when he  
accepted a ride from Petty, clubbed the 56-year-old minister with a 
piece of wood, set his body on fire and fled, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hass and his wife, Denise, 29, were arrested outside of St.  
Louis, Mo., early Wednesday and charged in the slaying. 
Investigators believe robbery was the motive. They also believe 
Mrs. Hass didn't participate in the murder. 
</P>
<P>
	``I truly hope they will be put away,'' Nancy Petty said. ``I am  
working on forgiveness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The couple were arrested after they called one of their  
relatives in North Carolina and the relative contacted police, 
Monroe County Sheriff Doug Watson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The (Hass) family members were concerned that they were  
involved in this atrocious murder,'' said Tennessee Bureau of 
Investigation Agent Richard Brogan. ``They didn't want to see them 
running.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hass has been charged with first-degree murder, car theft and  
felony murder. Mrs. Hass is charged with accessory to arson. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel the minister just picked up this guy,'' Watson said.  
``We have no evidence of premeditation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Petty's body was discovered Saturday night burned beyond  
recognition on his property in the foothills of the East Tennessee 
mountains near the North Carolina line. 
</P>
<P>
	The weapon and clothing had been piled on top of him then set on  
fire. His car was found burned two days later about 30 miles away 
near Andrews, N.C., where the Hasses lived. 
</P>
<P>
	Hass is accused of using the stolen car to pick up his wife. The  
two then fled in her car, investigators say. 
</P>
<P>
	Hass has served prison sentences in North Carolina on several  
drunken driving and other motor vehicle charges, Brogan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Petty, who lived in Ooltewah, was a lawyer in Chattanooga for 30  
years, then left his practice to become a United Methodist 
minister, leading five small, struggling congregations in the Meigs 
County area. 
</P>
<P>
	``My brother was the type who would help out anyone,'' Nancy  
Petty said. ``We are very devastated.''

	CHICAGO (AP) -- Though Michael Jordan retired his Bulls jersey  
just eight months ago, his restaurant is being remade to honor 
Chicago's newest sports star: Sammy Sosa. 
</P>
<P>
	The popularity of Michael Jordan's Restaurant is slipping,  
though it remains profitable, said H. Gene Silverberg, a 
controlling partner. He complained that Jordan seldom eats at the 
restaurant, located just north of downtown Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	In its place will be Sammy Sosa's Restaurant, and Jordan's spot  
will be moved to a smaller location, Silverberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	Silverberg said he envisions a ``Cubs restaurant starring Sammy  
Sosa, the best show in town with the No. 1 star possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Apparently the switch is being made without Jordan's approval --  
Silverberg said he doesn't need it. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa's restaurant will take over Jordan's spot by the opening of  
next baseball season, Silverberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	And Sosa, unlike Jordan, will be required to make appearances at  
the restaurant, he said.

<HEADLINE> Kathie Lee Line Faulted on Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former football star Frank Gifford defended  
his wife, Kathie Lee Gifford, during a heated Capitol Hill news 
conference Wednesday where labor activists said her clothing line 
is still produced in foreign sweatshops. 
</P>
<P>
	Gifford told members of the National Labor Committee that his  
wife was working hard to improve conditions at the factories and 
said he was unhappy the group released its findings before 
discussing them with her. 
</P>
<P>
	``Frank got kind of personal,'' Bob Adler, chairman of the  
Kellwood Co. division that licenses the Kathie Lee line, said after 
the confrontation. ``Frankly, she's the only celebrity who's 
stepped up to the plate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Kernaghan, head of the National Labor Committee, said he  
told Gifford he was sorry Mrs. Gifford had become the brunt of talk 
show jokes and other criticism. But that discomfort cannot be 
likened to the plight of the sweatshop workers who earn as little 
as 50 cents an hour, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is nothing in comparison to the lives of the hundreds of  
thousands of young women locked in factories throughout the world, 
behind barbed wire and armed guards, who are stripped of their 
rights and paid starvation wages and who go home to one-room hovels 
without running water and raise their children on coffee because 
they can't afford milk,'' Kernaghan said after the news conference. 
``That is a real problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gifford said his children are sometimes driven to tears by  
people who criticize their mother even though she has devoted her 
life to standing up for human rights and the rights of children. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not nice to have people make fun of you,'' Kernaghan  
said. ``But she still comes home to a mansion in Connecticut and 
they're doing just fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three years after Kathie Lee Gifford pledged to help end labor  
abuse in the apparel industry, her own inspectors are looking into 
claims that thousands of Salvadoran women still endure brutal 
conditions to produce clothing for her line, sold through Wal-Mart, 
the National Labor Committee said. 
</P>
<P>
	Committee officials brought to Washington two employees who said  
they were fired after speaking up for workers' rights at a factory 
producing Kathie Lee clothing in Santa Ana, El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
	The women described 11-hour, six-day work weeks in sweltering  
conditions for a base wage of 60 cents an hour. Workers were 
subjected to physical and verbal abuse and forced to work overtime 
and undergo unwanted pregnancy tests, Kernaghan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need the jobs,'' said Blanca Ruth Palacios, 43. ``We are  
willing to work hard, but we want them to respect our rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adler said monitors sent to the Caribbean Apparel factory in  
Santa Ana could not immediately substantiate the accusations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're still trying to get to the bottom of these very serious  
allegations,'' Adler said. ``The controversy continues, but we are 
making progress. We want to get this thing solved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Mrs. Gifford released a statement expressing concern  
over the allegations. If they prove to be true, she said, ``we will 
not allow that facility to continue manufacturing goods bearing my 
name.''

<HEADLINE> Earthlink, Mindspring To Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- EarthLink Network Inc. and MindSpring  
Enterprises Inc., two fast-growing providers of dial-up access to 
the Internet, are merging in a $1.4 billion stock swap to create a 
tough new rival to America Online Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The marriage of close competitors, each founded just 5 years  
ago, speeds the consolidation of a highly fragmented industry 
brimming with thousands of small Web access providers. 
</P>
<P>
	The entity created by Thursday's transaction would have 3  
million subscribers when the deal closes early next year, eclipsing 
the 2.5 million users of AT&AMP;T online services, and the 1.8 million 
who connect to the Web through Microsoft's MSN service. But it 
would still be far less than AOL's total of 20 million subscribers, 
which includes about 2 million accounts at its CompuServe unit. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, EarthLink and MindSpring intend to use their  
combined market heft to launch a $300 million advertising campaign 
next year in a bid to steal business from AOL. The aim is to have a 
total of 5 million customers by the end of 2000 and 8 million in 
2001. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to be in hot pursuit,'' said MindSpring president  
Mike McQuary, who will hold the same title at the new company. 
``The message (to AOL) is that objects in the rear view mirror are 
a lot closer than they may appear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AOL, through a spokesman, declined to comment.  
</P>
<P>
	EarthLink and MindSpring are acting on an important industry  
tenet: Additional subscribers are needed to convince companies to 
buy advertisements on the start-up Web pages set up by Internet 
access providers. The revenues gained from access fees alone, 
typically set at $19.95 a month, aren't enough to fuel company 
growth. Fees, moreover, are dropping with a recent flurry of 
promotional deals by computer companies that offer free Internet 
access to buyers of PCs. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you don't have critical mass within your user base, it's  
hard to drive up your advertising revenues,'' said Zia Daniell 
Wigder, an analyst at the Jupiter Communications research firm. 
``It's going to be increasingly hard for the tiny players to 
compete.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite their combined weight, EarthLink and MindSpring plan to  
keep portraying themselves as the hippest Web service around 
compared with industry behemoths AOL, AT&AMP;T and Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	Both companies distinguish themselves by claiming to provide  
more reliable service, with fewer busy signals for people trying to 
log on and fewer instances of kicking off online customers. AOL, by 
contrast, has succeeded by appealing to newcomers to the Internet, 
offering a colorful, easy-to-use menu of online choices. 
</P>
<P>
	Both relative newcomers to the Internet access business,  
EarthLink and MindSpring have quickly made their mark in the shadow 
of far larger competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	EarthLink, a young Pasadena, Calif.-based company, grew from  
30,000 subscribers in late 1995 to more than 1.3 million today and 
is projected to rapidly add subscribers by the deal's close in the 
first quarter of next year. Sprint Corp., the nation's third 
largest long-distance telephone company, sold its Internet access 
service to EarthLink last year in a $180 million deal and now owns 
28 percent of EarthLink. If it doesn't change its investment, it 
will own about 14 percent in the combined company. EarthLink's 
alliance and contractual arrangements with Sprint will all remain 
intact. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta-based MindSpring, with 1.2 million subscribers,  
leapfrogged to the top tier of U.S. Internet access providers 
through a string of acquisitions. While dial-up access comprises 85 
percent of its sales, it also hosts Web sites and sells dedicated 
online access to business customers. 
</P>
<P>
	In Thursday's transaction, EarthLink stockholders will receive  
the equivalent of 1.615 MindSpring shares for each of their 32 
million outstanding shares. In Thursday trading, MindSpring stock 
fell 17 percent, or $5.50 a share, to $27.37 1/2, on the Nasdaq Stock 
Market. 
</P>
<P>
	EarthLink was up as much as 11 percent immediately after the  
deal's announcement but retreated by day's end, down 3 percent, or 
$1.12 1/2 at $42.37 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	The merged company would be based at MindSpring's current  
headquarters in Atlanta and carry the EarthLink name. It would have 
$650 million in sales and nearly 4,000 employees. The companies 
said they don't plan any layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	MindSpring chief executive and chairman Charles Brewer will be  
chairman of the new company and EarthLink chief executive Charles 
``Garry'' Betty will hold his same position at the new company.

<HEADLINE> N.C. Utility Workers Called Heroes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- When flooding from Hurricane Floyd  
covered a Greenville Utilities substation last Friday and blacked 
out all 56,000 people in town, Malcolm A. Green and his crew took a 
risk. 
</P>
<P>
	Green, the general manager, decided to use a circuit breaker  
outside the station. That put the power back on, but everything 
would have been shot if the rising Tar River, which runs through 
the middle of the city, reached the main cables. 
</P>
<P>
	A utility worker stationed in a boat provided constant reports  
on the water level. Flood waters came within 2 inches Wednesday but 
then went down. 
</P>
<P>
	So even though the substation was still under about 9 feet of  
water Thursday, Greenville had electricity. The waterlogged and 
weary utility workers who made it happen during the worst flooding 
ever to hit the state are being called heroes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The key thing I would say is that our customers had power all  
this time,'' Green said. ``We had people here doing work, basically 
untested, stuff that most people would say, `You can't do that.' 
But we found a way to make it work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wachovia Bank had prepared for Floyd by bringing in generators.  
It never needed them, thanks to the hard work of the utility crew. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've done an outstanding job, especially taking a  
significant amount of risk to keep everybody going as best they 
could,'' said Richard Jones, a bank executive. ``We're mighty proud 
of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Utility employees also worked all weekend to protect the city's  
water and sewage plants. 
</P>
<P>
	They joined with volunteers and jail inmates to frantically  
stack 25,000 sandbags and formed a 6-foot wall around crucial 
equipment outside. They also stacked sandbags around indoor 
equipment and pumped water back outside, using hoses through the 
windows. 
</P>
<P>
	The city never had to shut off its water system, although  
clogged filters led to low pressure that caused thousands to be 
without water. But by Thursday, the system was close to normal 
after the utility finished cleaning the pipes. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents were still being urged to boil water before drinking  
it due to river contamination from raw sewage, chemical spills and 
dead animals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been here 29 years, and that's my water system right  
there. Those pipes are mine,'' said Wayne Bryant, Greenville 
Utilities superintendent of water and sewer, who worked 100 hours 
in seven days. ``I'm not losing my pipes.''

<HEADLINE> Warrant Issued in Art Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- A federal magistrate has blocked the Museum  
of Modern Art from sending a painting back to Austria because of 
claims that Nazis stole it from its Jewish owner. 
</P>
<P>
	The move came hours after a state court said the painting could  
go back. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Magistrate Judge James Francis issued a seizure warrant  
late Tuesday for Expressionist artist Egon Schiele's painting 
``Portrait of Wally'' after finding probable cause that it was 
stolen property. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is an important policy of the United States and other  
countries to return Holocaust-era looted property,'' said a release 
from U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White, who sought the warrant. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not known whether a seizure warrant would be sought for  
``Dead City III,'' a second Schiele painting involved in the 
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Tuesday, the state's highest court cleared the way for  
the paintings to be returned to the Leopold Foundation of Vienna, 
Austria. The New York Court of Appeals threw out a subpoena for the 
works, saying museum art was immune from seizure in criminal or 
civil proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	The paintings were among more than 100 loaned to the museum.  
Three days after the exhibit ended last year, Henry Bondi of 
Princeton, N.J., Kathleen Rief of Vancouver, British Columbia, and 
Rita Rief of New York City filed claims saying the paintings had 
been taken from their relatives when Germany annexed Austria in 
1938. 
</P>
<P>
	The museum argued that it was contractually obligated to return  
the paintings. 
</P>
<P>
	Leopold Foundation board member Elisabeth Leopold said the board  
was positive that both paintings were legitimate acquisitions and 
that both had to be returned. 
</P>
<P>
	``That will also emerge in the current investigation because it  
is evident that the picture was not stolen,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bondi said ``Portrait of Wally'' was taken from his late aunt,  
Lea Bondi, a Jewish-Viennese art dealer who was pressed by a Nazi 
art dealer to leave the work behind when she fled to London in 
1938. 
</P>
<P>
	The Riefs said ``Dead City'' was taken from Fritz Grunbaum, who  
died in a concentration camp. 
</P>
<P>
	The paintings were collected by Rudolf Leopold, who sold them to  
the Austrian government in 1993 and has argued that they were 
legally acquired. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Museum of Modern Art successfully fought the state, it  
will take a back seat this time. ``The Leopold Foundation must now 
take the lead in ownership issues,'' museum officials said in a 
statement.

	Republican $792B Tax Cut Vetoed  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton vetoed the Republicans' $792  
billion tax cut bill today, saying the measure ``would force 
drastic cuts'' in education and health care and would ``cripple'' 
the government's ability to pay down the national debt. In a remark 
echoed by GOP colleagues, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, 
R-Miss., said, ``I regret the president has stolen this tax cut 
from working American families.'' It appeared highly unlikely that 
Republicans would accept Clinton's suggestion to send him a smaller 
tax bill, in the $300 billion range that he had proposed.

	Dow Falls 205.48 on Interest Rate Fears

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks plummeted today as investors sold heavily  
amid continued worries about higher interest rates and the strength 
of the dollar. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 205.48 to 
close at 10,318.59, marking a 4.5 percent decline for the Dow over 
the past three sessions. Leading technology stocks took hits today 
after Microsoft president Steve Ballmer said at a conference that 
technology stocks -- including Microsoft -- are too highly priced. 
The Nasdaq composite index fell 108.33 to 2,749.83, its 
fourth-biggest decline ever.

	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- For the second time in six years, a NASA  
spaceship was lost just as it reached Mars. The $125 million Mars 
Climate Orbiter, which was on a mission to study the planet's 
weather and look for signs of water, traveled 416 million miles 
before vanishing today as it was about to go into orbit around the 
Red Planet. The spacecraft apparently flew too close to the Martian 
atmosphere and broke apart or burned up, the space agency said. The 
$1 billion Mars Observer probe disappeared in 1993.

accomplice in the crime. James Byrd Jr., 49, was chained at the 
ankles to a pickup truck and dragged to pieces in the East Texas 
town of Jasper last year. John William King, 24, is already on

terms as a New Jersey senator, working with Moynihan -- who was 
first elected in 1976 -- on the Senate Finance Committee. At Gore's

Moynihan's imprimatur would make little difference: ``I'm sure

	CHICAGO (AP) -- Michael Jordan's Restaurant will become Sammy  
Sosa's Restaurant, a move prompted by declining sales at the 
basketball star's eatery just north of downtown Chicago, said H. 
Gene Silverberg, a controlling partner in both restaurant ventures. 
Jordan apparently stopped eating at the restaurant after the owners 
rejected his ideas for making it more upscale, Silverberg said. 
Sosa donned a chef's hat at a news conference today to announce the 
restaurant and even swung a 4-foot-long red fork.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Fall; Dow Down 20.26 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell today as investors found little  
reason to step back into a market battered by the dollar's weakness 
against the yen and continued fears of higher interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	In midday trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial  
average was down 20.26 at 10,503.81. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's  
500 index was down 5.91 at 1,304.60, and the Nasdaq composite index 
was down 18.81 at 2,839.35. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no new fundamental reason for the weak market, but  
there's a great deal of nervousness,'' said William Meehan, chief 
market analyst for Cantor Fitzgerald. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors remained unwilling to snap up stocks even as the  
dollar inched higher against the yen in New York. In late morning, 
the dollar was quoted at 104.01 yen, up from 103.93 yen late 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the U.S. currency is lingering near its lowest levels  
against the yen since 1996. The dollar's weakness has contributed 
to a sharp decline in U.S. stocks this week, pushing the Dow down 
nearly 300 points in the past two sessions. A weaker dollar makes 
imports more expensive, setting the stage for inflation. It also 
makes foreign investments more alluring. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks were also held back by a Labor Department report that  
showed the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment 
benefits fell unexpectedly last week to the lowest level in 25 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The extremely low U.S. jobless rate has fostered fears that  
companies will have to increase wages and benefits in order to 
attract skilled workers. That, too, could set the stage for a 
revival of inflation. Some economists believe any evidence of wage 
pressures will persuade the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates 
when its Open Market Committee meets Oct. 5. 
</P>
<P>
	United Technologies held the Dow lower, falling 1 1/16 to 57  
9/16, after announcing plans to eliminate 14,500 jobs -- or 10 
percent of its worldwide work force -- over the next three years 
because of a downturn in the aerospace industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading in technology stocks was stimulated by the merger of two  
Internet service providers, EarthLink and MindSpring. Earthlink 
rose 2 1/2 to 46 and MindSpring fell 3 5/8 to 29 1/4 after the companies 
said they will combine in an effort to compete better with industry 
leader America Online. 
</P>
<P>
	Meehan said the merger, combined with growing optimism over  
Internet companies' prospects during the holiday shopping season, 
boosted the Internet sector today. 
</P>
<P>
	``Strange as it seems, these stocks are coming to be viewed as  
safe havens,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by an 8-to-5 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 381.17 million 
shares, slightly ahead of Wednesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index fell 1.48 to 426.05.

<HEADLINE> DaimlerChrysler Shakeup Reported </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The president of DaimlerChrysler AG's Chrysler  
division will resign as part of a shakeup that would mark a shift 
in the balance of power within the automaking company, published 
reports said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Detroit News reported Thursday that Thomas Stallkamp, 53,  
will leave as the head of DaimlerChrysler's North American unit and 
be replaced by James Holden, executive vice president for sales and 
marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	The move would come as DaimlerChrysler trims the size of its  
management board. Germany's Handelsblatt business daily said the 
merged group's supervisory board will decide on the management 
board's new makeup Friday. It said four members will leave the 
17-seat management board Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler declined comment Thursday on the various  
reports. 
</P>
<P>
	The News said DaimlerChrysler co-chairman Robert Eaton will  
retain his seat on the management board. Of the seven former 
Chrysler Corp. executives on the DaimlerChrysler management board, 
five will reportedly remain. Eight board members would be former 
Daimler-Benz AG executives. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said Stallkamp would leave the company, and  
Theodor R. Cunningham will relinquish his seat on the board but 
stay in charge of sales and marketing in North America. 
</P>
<P>
	Two Daimler executives, commercial truck head Kurt Lauk and  
human resources manager Heiner Tropitzsch, are also reportedly 
expected to step down from the board. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler's stock hit a new low in trading Thursday  
afternoon falling $3.50 to $66.68 3/4 in dealings on the New York 
Stock Exchange. Shares closed up $3.31 1/4 to $66.25. 
</P>
<P>
	Auto industry analysts said the reports on Stallkamp's future  
could be playing a role in the stock price decline, along with 
concern that DaimlerChrysler might miss its financial goals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there are a lot of folks who still see this Chrysler  
dream team and all it's done to turn Chrysler around,'' said 
Lincoln Merrihew, an analyst with DRI/McGraw-Hill in Lexington, 
Mass. ``Stallkamp was part of that ... It may be that Chrysler is 
moving from a known team to an unknown team. Not good or bad, just 
unknown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stallkamp had taken over as Chrysler Corp. president in January  
1998, just a week before Eaton, then the chairman of the U.S. 
automaker, began merger negotiations with Daimler-Benz AG. A 
Chrysler executive since 1980, Stallkamp had been credited with 
leading a drive to cut billions in costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Gregory L. Kagey, an analyst with Arnhold and S. Bleichroeder  
Inc. in New York, said Chrysler's cost-cutting expertise was billed 
as one of the major benefits to the DaimlerChrysler merger. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any cost cutting really goes to the bottom line,'' Kagey said.  
``To get rid of the father of Chrysler's supplier relationship is 
mystifying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several key executives, including co-chairman Juergen Schrempp,  
last month said the company was planning to reorganize and reduce 
the size of the company's board of management. 
</P>
<P>
	Eaton, the merged company's co-chairman with Schrempp, is  
scheduled to leave in two years. Merrihew said that Stallkamp's 
departure and the move to reduce the management board could move 
the company away from the ``merger of equals'' that Eaton billed 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's another sign that Chrysler is being blended into a  
Daimler-based company,'' Merrihew said.

<HEADLINE> Illinois, Pa. Utilities To Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The corporate parent of Chicago's  
Commonweath Edison is merging with PECO Energy Co. of Philadelphia 
in an $8.2 billion deal that would create the nation's largest 
electric utility. 
</P>
<P>
	Together, Chicago's Unicom Corp. and PECO control almost 20  
percent of the country's nuclear generating capacity. They have 
about 5 million customers, more than any other U.S. electric 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger is the latest in a wave of consolidations since  
federal deregulation has increased competition for electricity 
sales. PECO, for example, lost 16 percent of its electricity 
customers to competitors since deregulation began in Pennsylvania 
on Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Utility analysts say the merger is a sign of more to come, and  
Unicom's chairman said the combined company, which has yet to 
select a name, plans on becoming even bigger. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that success in the future in the generation  
business requires very substantial scale,'' said John W. Rowe, 
Unicom's chairman, president and chief executive. ``We also believe 
by putting two companies of this size together and making them work 
efficiently, we will have the economic base to be an attractive 
acquirer of other companies in other metropolitan areas in the 
region.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The combined company will have total revenue of $12.4 billion  
and serve metropolitan areas including Chicago, the nation's 
third-largest city, where it will be based, and No. 5 Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	``These fairly large companies could have survived out there on  
their own,'' said Linda Byus, a Chicago-based analyst of Dresdner 
Kleinwort Benson. ``With these two good-size companies coming 
together ... it gives me a little more sense that there will be 
fewer energy companies out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The companies said they expect the deal to be approved by the  
end of next year, although it still needs approval from 
shareholders and from Pennsylvania and federal regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials said the merger could result in the loss of  
about 1,100 jobs, or about 5 percent of the combined work force, 
mostly administrative positions. 
</P>
<P>
	Unicom's and PECO's electric and gas utility operations will  
remain separate subsidiaries of the holding company, continuing to 
operate under the names Commonwealth Edison Co. and PECO Energy Co. 
Those companies will maintain their local headquarters, as well, 
Unicom and PECO said. 
</P>
<P>
	Commonweath Edison had a string of power outages over the summer  
that shut down the Chicago Board of Trade for a half a day, nearly 
spoiled frozen plant and animal tissue at the Field Museum of 
Natural History, and left about 100,000 customers without power for 
three days when the temperature was over 100. 
</P>
<P>
	The utility promised to spend more than $1.5 billion over the  
next two years to improve its distribution system. 
</P>
<P>
	Unicom's Rowe promised a management shakeup if necessary.  
</P>
<P>
	Corbin McNeill Jr., the chairman, president and CEO of PECO,  
said customers are not expected to see much change in electricity 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago-based Unicom provides electric service across northern  
Illinois, serving about 3.4 million customers. It also has 10 
nuclear generating units at five sites. 
</P>
<P>
	PECO, based in Philadelphia, serves 1.5 million electric  
customers and 400,000 gas customers in the five-county Philadelphia 
region. 
</P>
<P>
	``They can save a lot of money with an operation on a larger  
scale,'' said Barbara Puklin, an analyst at Arnhold &AMP; S. 
Bleichroeder in New York. ``They can offer electricity at a lower 
price, provide a more efficient way of getting it and nuclear power 
looks good because it has lower costs and a low pollution factor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1997, PECO has turned its focus on increasing its nuclear  
power plants through a joint venture with British Energy Co. and 
purchasing the undamaged Unit 1 reactor at the Three Mile Island 
plant for $100 million in cash. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors were disappointed with terms of the cash-and-stock  
merger that valued Unicom at $42.75 a share and PECO at $45. 
</P>
<P>
	PECO fell 4.4 percent, or by $1.68 3/4, to close at $36.43 3/4 a share  
on the New York Stock Exchange, where Unicom fell 2.2 percent, or 
by 81 1/4 cents, to $36.25. 
</P>
<P>
	After a transition period during which they will share control  
of the new company, Rowe will become CEO of the new company and 
McNeill will serve on the board of directors and is expected to 
retire in four years.

<HEADLINE> Ryder Cup Takes Off on TV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Ten years ago, hardly anyone cared about the Ryder Cup. The  
major TV networks passed, USA Network won the rights for a paltry 
$200,000 and then hired a public relations firm to explain the 
event. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC has no trouble explaining its success these days. They will  
have 16 1/2 hours of coverage this weekend and pay around $13 million. 
That's twice as many hours as the network showed in 1991 and 1993 
and that's not even counting USA's 10 1/2-hour Friday marathon. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really taken on a life of its own,'' said CBS' Rob  
Correa, who made the deal to bring the Ryder Cup to USA in 1989. 
``We saw the potential back then and it's been incredible. There 
hasn't been a disappointing Ryder Cup since.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The entire complexion of the event has changed now that the  
Europeans are on top. 
</P>
<P>
	``The event has gotten so big that they want to show every  
hour,'' said NBC executive producer Tom Roy. ``From a ratings 
standpoint, we're probably shooting ourselves in the foot, ... but 
it's worth it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans won 21 of the first 25 events, and tied one other.  
In the last seven Ryder Cup matches, the United States has just two 
victories. 
</P>
<P>
	Roy has produced the Super Bowl, World Series, NBA Finals and  
the Olympics. But he expects this weekend to be the most difficult 
of his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Not just because of the abundance of coverage.  
</P>
<P>
	There are no breaks, or timeouts, in golf. The play never stops  
-- even during commercials. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every 20 seconds you have to decide where you're going next,''  
Roy said. 
</P>
<P>
	And even with so much air time, don't necessarily expect to see  
all of Tiger Woods' matches live. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way we typically show golf is to follow the leaders, but  
here we'll show the matches that are closest to ending or closest 
in competition,'' Roy said. ``If Tiger is blowing out his opponent 
in a match, you won't see much of him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, NBC will show mostly taped highlights.  
</P>
<P>
	Ratings for the Ryder Cup may not be quite to the level of the  
majors. However, the emotion displayed by the players surpasses all 
of them. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's certainly exploded inside of its sport unlike anything in  
the past 10 years,'' said CBS golf commentator Jim Nantz. ``It's 
huge, but it's still the fifth biggest event in golf.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *BEN'S BACK:* Ben Wright returned to TV in a golf role for the  
first time in four years Thursday and to no one's surprise, it 
wasn't with CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	The Golf Channel brought Wright on board for a series of  
90-second taped historical essays during its Ryder Cup coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright made derogatory comments about women golfers in 1995 and  
was banned from CBS for the past four years. 
</P>
<P>
	``My contention is that Ben served his sentence,'' said Golf  
Channel host Peter Kessler. ``He is a serious historian whose whole 
career was harpooned by stupid things he said at the wrong time. 
It's time to move forward and give him another chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kessler said that after filming the spots, Wright began crying  
because he was overwhelmed with emotion. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said he had no idea how much he missed and loved his  
work,'' Kessler said. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *ICE TIME:* Hockey begins in one week, and ABC still hasn't  
announced its announcers for its debut NHL season. But expect Bill 
Clement and John Davidson to be involved. 
</P>
<P>
	Clement, the lead analyst for ESPN's hockey coverage, said he  
signed a five-year deal Saturday for the same position at ABC. 
</P>
<P>
	Davidson, who was the top game analyst for Fox until the  
network's deal ran out after last season, is expected to be the 
studio analyst. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Clement and Davidson favor the NHL's rule changes, which  
include a four-on-four overtime and give the loser one point. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *TUBE BITS:* CBS' Tennessee-Florida game posted a 7.5 rating and  
a 15 share, 32 percent higher than last year's game between the 
teams. ... San Antonio Spurs forward Sean Elliott, who had a kidney 
transplant last month, will be an analyst for the Spurs exhibition 
games while recovering. ... ESPN's Sunday night win by the Bills 
over the Jets had a 10.74 rating. ... ABC's ``Monday Night 
Football'' had a 15.2 national mark, up 20 percent from last 
season. ... Fishermen Terry Bradshaw and Bob Brenly will host the 
$3.5 million Ranger Millennium M1 Bass Fishing Tournament Nov. 7 on 
Fox.

<HEADLINE> Teachers Seek Better Software </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) -- The nation's classrooms are full of wired  
boxes, but little attention is being paid to the quality of the 
software on classroom computers or how they're used, says a report 
released today. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't give many of the (software) titles a 9 or a 10,''  
says Ed Adshead, a network resource teacher who helps fellow 
teachers understand and use computers at Patrick Henry Elementary 
School just outside Washington. ``We have to hunt for it and then 
we find it isn't nearly as good as it looked like or what it was 
described as.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Teachers wade through thousands of CD-ROMS and computer  
diskettes just to find that the material doesn't match state or 
school district standardized tests, can't run on weak classroom 
computers, takes up too much classroom time to use or could cost 
too much, says the report, ``Technology Counts,'' a survey of the 
nation's teachers and state education technology policies published 
today by the newspaper Education Week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Politicians wire the classrooms and think they are done,''  
said Education Week publisher Virginia Edwards. ``But that's not 
the case at all. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're just looking at actual hardware and that is not going  
make a difference in what students learn,'' she said. ``When you 
get into the question of whether technology is effective, the 
research shows that it motivates kids when it is used well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report, underwritten by The Milken Family Foundation of  
Santa Monica, Calif., is in its third year of tracking state 
policies and funding of school technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Armed with federal and state funds, many of the nation's 86,000  
schools have steadily brought in more computers. Now, 71 percent of 
schools can reach the Internet from at least one classroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Though all 53.2 million students aren't sitting in front of  
their very own terminals, on average, there are nearly six students 
for every ``instructional computer,'' which includes older models 
without extras such as sound cards and video, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, researchers cite a range of commitment to the other  
resources that make technology work: 
</P>
<P>
	--Less than a third of schools have a full-time technology  
coordinator. Another 27 percent just assign the task to a teacher 
or other staff member as part of his or her formal duties. 
</P>
<P>
	--Forty-two states require teacher preparation programs to  
include technology, but just four require technology in teacher 
re-certification. 
</P>
<P>
	--Twenty-three states have group-purchasing plans for schools to  
buy classroom software, which can cost $600 to $1,000 per title. 
</P>
<P>
	--Four states developed some software lessons to match the  
standards they've set for what children should know in certain 
subjects in grades. Eight states put such content on Web sites. 
</P>
<P>
	On the federal level, officials such as Vice President Al Gore  
have declared school technology a national mission, vowing to wire 
every classroom to the Internet. Software issues are not 
insurmountable, according to the Education Department, which awards 
grants to schools for technology projects. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole landscape has changed,'' said Linda G. Roberts, the  
department's director of technology. ``Publishers are very serious 
about developing content for the schools. The challenge is in 
developing high quality content and that takes money and knowledge 
about how students learn, and it takes very clear signals from the 
buyers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This year, the Technology Counts report included the teacher  
survey, based on 1,407 responses from a representative sample of 
15,000 kindergarten-through 12th-grade teachers. The margin of 
error is plus or minus 3 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	Teachers who do use computer software regularly found that  
expense is the largest barrier to using it even more: 48 percent 
say software costs are a ``big'' problem; 34 percent say expense is 
a ``moderate'' problem. 
</P>
<P>
	At Patrick Henry, which has a $4,000 annual computer software  
budget, teachers do everything from buying their own individual 
titles out of pocket to hitting the PTA up for ``bowlathons'' and 
bake sales to hauling 250 recently donated computers in their cars. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are at a distinct advantage when you look at what we do  
have,'' says fifth grade teacher Melinda Jones. ``We all attended 
the workshops, but it's all about taking time to find what we need 
and getting the support to do it really consistently.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the survey, 47 percent of teachers said their computers were  
too weak for the best software: ``It's more expensive to fix these 
than to buy new ones,'' says Adshead, pointing to a cart of 
assorted ancient computer parts.

<HEADLINE> Shania Twain Wins Top CMA Honor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- She's been honored at the Grammys and  
she's been on MTV. Yet for years, Shania Twain's sexy brand of 
country music didn't get much recognition from her peers. 
</P>
<P>
	Until now.  
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Twain received long-overdue recognition as the  
Country Music Association honored her as its Entertainer of the 
Year. It was the first time the top-selling Twain had ever been 
honored by the 6,000 industry leaders who cast ballots for the 
winners. 
</P>
<P>
	Twain, who won two Grammys earlier this year, was in tears after  
receiving the CMA honor. Backstage, the Canadian singer 
acknowledged the controversy her midriff-baring image and 
pop-leaning music has caused in Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, I'm not just a lap dancer after all,'' she said,  
referring to one of the more unkind jabs. 
</P>
<P>
	The award for Twain, whose crossover appeal has landed her on  
and the cover of magazines like Rolling Stone and People, comes at 
a time when country music's popularity has dipped. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales have flattened since peaking in 1995 at about $2 billion.  
After an uptick of 2.7 percent last year, sales were down about 3 
percent for the first half of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Country music's market share of sales has declined to 14.1  
percent, according to the Recording Industry Association of 
America's 1998 Consumer Profile. That's still second -- rock is 
first at 25.7 percent -- but country's share has declined each year 
since peaking at 18.7 percent in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	One country music veteran noticeably absent from the awards show  
was George Jones. He was angry that he was asked, along with other 
nominees, to perform a shortened version of ``Choices,'' which was 
up for best single. The CMA routinely makes such requests due to 
time constraints. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones was watching the show from home when Alan Jackson brought  
the audience at the Grand Ole Opry to its feet when he sang a few 
lines from ``Choices'' at the end of his own performance. 
</P>
<P>
	``He cried,'' said Evelyn Shriver, president of Asylum Records,  
Jones' record company. ``He said it was the greatest honor ever 
bestowed on him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Jackson spokeswoman, Kay West, said the singer was inspired by  
a visit to Jones earlier this year in the hospital. Jones nearly 
died because of a car wreck. 
</P>
<P>
	``Alan said that had George Jones died there, there would have  
been a 10 minute tribute to him on the show,'' West said. ``But he 
lived, and they wouldn't give him three minutes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ed Benson, head of the CMA, said he took no offense at Jackson's  
actions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Alan is a great traditional country artist, and he paid  
tribute to another great traditional country artist,'' Benson said. 
``That's fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other awards, the Dixie Chicks won their second straight  
award for best vocal group and their ``Wide Open Spaces'' was named 
best single and video. Tim McGraw won best male vocalist and best 
album for ``A Place in the Sun.'' He picked up a second award for 
producing the album. 
</P>
<P>
	Martina McBride was named best female vocalist, and Brooks &AMP;  
Dunn won their eighth straight trophy for best vocal duo.

<HEADLINE> Fenway Listed As Endangered Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- With plans afoot to build a new Fenway Park, the  
fabled ballfield received a boost Thursday from a historic 
preservation group trying to save it from destruction. 
</P>
<P>
	Historic Massachusetts put Fenway at the top of its annual ``Top  
Ten'' list of landmarks it says are endangered by neglect, 
inappropriate development or insensitive public policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Margaret Dyson, director of the small nonprofit group, said the  
choice of a high-profile, politically charged monument for its list 
was unusual, because the group typically works to protect 
little-known local landmarks. 
</P>
<P>
	But she said Fenway's importance to the state and nation  
compelled the group to act. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every once and awhile there's something of significance to the  
country and Fenway is of that caliber,'' she said. ``People here 
were saying, `How could we not list it?''' 
</P>
<P>
	With 33,871 seats, Fenway Park is the smallest ballpark in the  
major leagues. It is also one of the oldest, having opened on April 
20, 1912. 
</P>
<P>
	Developers and the Red Sox want to demolish most of Fenway and  
build a new, $560 million, 44,000-seat stadium on adjacent land. 
They say home plate will shift 206 yards to the southwest, but the 
``Green Monster'' wall in left field would be preserved as a 
monument. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighborhood activists are bitterly fighting the plan, and want  
to see the historic ballpark renovated or left alone. The new park 
proposal, which would likely involve millions in public funds, is 
expected to remain under consideration by the state legislature for 
the next several months. 
</P>
<P>
	Dyson cited the recent memory of a wrecking ball crashing  
through the Boston Garden building as inspiration for her group's 
stand on Fenway. 
</P>
<P>
	Historic Massachusetts did not become involved in the fight to  
save the former home of the Boston Celtics and Boston Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now I wonder if we could have made a difference,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Kathryn St. John, a spokeswoman for the Red Sox, said that the  
park's inclusion on the list was not an insult to supporters of a 
new Fenway. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a tribute to how important Fenway is,'' she said. ``The  
team worked with a number of preservationists, and we are very 
comfortable that our plan honors the history of the ballpark.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit's Tiger Stadium, which opened the same day as Fenway,  
has been slated to shut its doors later this month, despite a 
National Register of Historic Places designation and efforts by 
preservationists to save it. The property could become a mall or 
condominiums, Detroit officials have said.

<HEADLINE> Bauer Calls for Flat Tax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Entering the debate over tax reform,  
Republican presidential candidate Gary Bauer proposed today to end 
most deductions and credits for businesses and individuals, taxing 
most income at a flat 16 percent rate. ``My party must stand for 
the working American, blue collar and white collar, not just for 
the big corporate interests,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer, who announced his ``family-friendly'' plan during a  
speech at the National Press Club, called for ending all deductions 
except those for home mortgage interest and charitable 
contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	He proposed a 20 percent reduction in the Social Security  
payroll tax. His plan would not require workers to invest in 
private retirement accounts but would cut projected increases in 
Social Security benefits for future retirees. 
</P>
<P>
	And Bauer proposed taxing capital gains -- the profits on the  
sale of stocks and other investments -- at the same 16 percent rate 
as wages and profits. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our current tax code is needlessly complex and deeply  
unfair,'' Bauer said. ``It has been written by lobbyists and 
special interests who could care less about average Americans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By coming out with his own flat-tax plan, Bauer focuses on an  
issue that has been identified with another Republican in the race, 
publisher Steve Forbes. Forbes, in turn, has tried to reach out to 
the social conservatives who form the base of Bauer's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, Bauer campaign chairman Charles Jarvis  
defected to the Forbes camp, saying the publisher was the only 
conservative with a chance of defeating GOP front-runner George W. 
Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to have a debate not only about social issues and  
foreign policy, we want to have a debate on his economic vision and 
our economic vision,'' said Jeffrey Bell, a senior adviser to the 
Bauer campaign and national campaign coordinator for former Rep. 
Jack Kemp's unsuccessful 1988 presidential run. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes campaign manager Bill Dal Col said he welcomed Bauer's  
support of a flat tax. 
</P>
<P>
	``This proves that Steve Forbes can unite the economic and  
social conservatives of the party,'' Dal Col said. ``Gary has come 
on board and acknowledged that Steve is the leader on the tax 
discussions in this campaign as he was in '96.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer's plan gives taxpayers a credit of $1,400 per person that  
could be used to offset both income and payroll taxes, unlike 
current credits that apply only to income taxes. This new credit 
would replace the current personal exemption, child care tax 
credit, and other tax credits. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, businesses no longer could deduct the cost of  
investments in machinery and equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you want to buy a machine that will make you money, that's  
great, but you do it after you pay your taxes on this year's 
profits,'' Bell said. ``The greatest inequity is there is a shelter 
for huge companies because anything they invest they can wind up 
writing off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But businesses, like individuals, would see their payroll taxes  
cut by 20 percent, Bell said. In addition, Bauer would eliminate 
the estate tax, a top priority of the business community.

<HEADLINE> Cellist Makes Rare TV Appearance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Mstislav Rostropovich will be playing more than  
the cello when he makes a rare television appearance on PBS' ``Live 
from Lincoln Center.'' The acclaimed musician will be playing mind 
games as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hate TV!'' Rostropovich exclaims. ``It's only because of  
this occasion I'm doing it. When I see the camera, I immediately 
think how I look. Automatically. I lose the music. 
</P>
<P>
	``I must hypnotize myself for this particular concert.''  
</P>
<P>
	He's making the effort for the New York Philharmonic's opening  
night performance, which will air at 8 p.m. EDT Thursday on PBS 
stations. Kurt Masur conducts. 
</P>
<P>
	Rostropovich, a passionate performer who prefers bear hugs and  
kissing hands to handshakes with fellow musicians, will play 
Dvorak's ``Cello Concerto,'' which he first recorded in 1952. 
</P>
<P>
	His conductor then was Vaclav Talich, who had known Dvorak and  
gave the 25-year-old cellist pointers about how the composer wanted 
it played. Rostropovich, now 72, has been following Talich's 
guidelines for 47 years. Rostropovich has performed the premieres 
of 117 cello concertos which were written for him. 
</P>
<P>
	While he plays a concerto, he says, he feels it's the best  
possible music. ``I dedicate all my heart and spirit to it. If I 
criticize a concerto a little bit, I must stop playing this 
concerto. Some I play only once in my life. Some maybe twice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The other half of the Philharmonic's opening night program is  
Tchaikovsky's ``Fifth Symphony.'' Rostropovich considers 
Tchaikovsky a great composer but says his music can be made 
sentimental -- something he's confident will not happen in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in the Soviet republic of Azerbaijan, Rostropovich angered  
Soviet rulers when he helped dissident writer Alexander 
Solzhenitsyn. 
</P>
<P>
	``He lived five years in my home in Moscow,'' he said. ``That's  
why the government threw me out of the country. I was told, `You 
must put him out.' No. That's a human feeling; it's not about 
politics. He was my friend; he had no place to live.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The couple and their two daughters were given exit visas in 1974  
and left for the West. Their citizenship was revoked in 1978, later 
to be reinstated by Mikhail Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
	Rostropovich was amazed when the Berlin Wall came down.  
</P>
<P>
	``Until I was 47, I was in the Soviet Union, on one side of the  
Berlin Wall. I was sent out of my country without any hope I was 
ever coming back. When the Berlin Wall was crushed, I think maybe 
my two lives will come together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They have. After giving a master class at the Curtis Institute  
in Philadelphia Oct. 1, Rostropovich will return to Paris only long 
enough to change suitcases and go to Russia to be a godfather at a 
christening, to receive an award and to hear some students. 
</P>
<P>
	Last March, after a Moscow concert was panned by a critic, he  
said he wouldn't perform in Russia any more. ``I'm still of that 
opinion,'' he says now. ``Of course, I'll still go there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His professional engagement calendar is full until 2003, about  
half playing cello, about half conducting. 
</P>
<P>
	Rostropovich plays a Stradivarius cello that has a scratch made  
by Napoleon's spur when he was looking at the instrument. ``It 
doesn't hurt the sound; it only makes the cello more famous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Was Napoleon a music lover? Rostropovich's eyes twinkle as he  
answers: ``I never spoke to him on this subject.'' 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Clinton Vetoes GOP Tax Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton vetoed the Republicans' $792  
billion tax cut bill Thursday as ``too big, too bloated'' -- 
apparently dooming chances for any sweeping tax reduction this 
year. Republicans fumed that Clinton ``has stolen this tax cut from 
working American families.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With his signature in a Rose Garden ceremony, Clinton guaranteed  
an election year tax argument between Republicans and Democrats as 
they fight for control of the White House and Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``At a time when America is moving in the right direction,'' the  
president said, ``this bill would turn us back to the failed 
policies of the past.'' Republicans shot back that taxes are too 
high and that Americans deserve a break. House Speaker Dennis 
Hastert, R-Ill., said it was ``kind of a sad day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton signed the veto message on a wooden desk on a warm,  
sunny autumn morning, before an audience of Cabinet members, White 
House staff and Democratic allies from health and minority groups. 
The Marine Band's brass quintet entertained the crowd with George 
Gershwin's ``Summertime'' and other melodies. 
</P>
<P>
	After months of White House warnings, there was no suspense  
about Clinton's veto, the 26th of his presidency. With Congress 
struggling to adjourn by Oct. 29, it appeared highly unlikely that 
Republicans would accept Clinton's suggestion to send him a smaller 
tax bill, in the $300 billion range that he had proposed. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said Congress would  
look at another tax package next year. Hastert said the GOP would 
not give up on tax relief but ``it may be later and not sooner'' -- 
suggesting that Republicans would rather take the issue to the 
voters in next year's elections than compromise with the president. 
The White House said GOP presidential candidates -- Republican 
front-runner George W. Bush, in particular -- should say whether 
they agree with their leaders in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republicans' bill, over 10 years, would reduce all income  
tax rates by 1 percentage point, ease the marriage penalty on many 
two-income couples, eliminate estate taxes and the alternative 
minimum income tax, reduce capital gains taxes, expand pension and 
401(k) laws and provide numerous business tax breaks. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the GOP measure would undermine efforts to shore up  
the Social Security and Medicare programs, to reduce the national 
debt and to improve education. ``The bill is too big, too bloated, 
places too great a burden on America's economy,'' the president 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would force drastic cuts in education, health care and  
other vital areas,'' Clinton added. ``It would cripple our ability 
to pay down the debt. It would not add a day to the Social Security 
trust fund, it would not add a day to the Medicare trust fund or 
modernize Medicare with prescription drug coverage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans disputed the president and said he had killed tax  
relief for families, for education and for low-income Americans. 
``I regret the president has stolen this tax cut from working 
American families,'' Lott said in a remark echoed by GOP 
colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP leaders said they would now concentrate on fixing Social  
Security, preventing $248 billion in tax increases urged by the 
administration over 10 years, restraining the growth of government 
and reducing the debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Although prospects for broad tax cuts are dim, House Republicans  
plan to begin moving a measure Friday that would renew several 
expiring tax credits, including a research and development credit 
popular with high-tech industry and manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP package, which carries a one-year cost of about $3  
billion, also would extend a provision preventing personal credits, 
such as the $500 per-child tax credit, from counting toward a 
taxpayer's eligibility for the alternative minimum tax -- a tax that 
often is higher for middle-class people. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's veto ceremony was the final act in a months-long  
political drama. The Republican-controlled Congress completed 
action on the tax bill Aug. 5 but did not send it to Clinton for 
his promised veto, using the time to try to rally support. But with 
Americans enjoying economic prosperity, the GOP publicity blitz 
failed to produce a groundswell of voter support. 
</P>
<P>
	Chiding Republicans, Clinton said that ``many in Congress seem  
ready to throw in the towel'' after his veto. ``That would be a 
disservice to the American people. They sent us all here to get 
things done.'' He challenged Congress not to go home until it 
reaches agreements with the White House on Social Security, 
Medicare, debt reduction and education. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we can work together to meet these objectives,'' he said,  
``we can also work together to pass tax relief we can afford.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore, seeking the Democratic nomination for  
president, passed up the White House ceremony for a meeting in New 
York with South African President Thabo Mbeki. Democratic 
congressional leaders also did not participate.

<HEADLINE> Ryder Cup Notebook  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROOKLINE, Mass. (AP) -- Now that the suspense of which golfers  
will be paired up in the Friday morning round of the Ryder Cup is 
over, another mystery cropped up. Who will play in the afternoon 
round? 
</P>
<P>
	The format calls for two-member teams of Americans to play  
against two-member teams of Europeans in each match. Each team uses 
one ball and its members take turns hitting it. There are four such 
matches. 
</P>
<P>
	The marquee matchup is Tiger Woods and Tom Lehman against Sergio  
Garcia and Jesper Parnevik. 
</P>
<P>
	In the afternoon, there also are four matches involving  
two-member teams, but all four golfers play their own ball on each 
hole. The team of the golfer with the best score wins the hole. 
Captains Ben Crenshaw of the United States and Mark James of Europe 
can wait until the morning matches have ended to turn in their 
afternoon pairings. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we do succeed in these morning pairings, you might see a  
lot of them in the afternoon, as well. But not per se,'' Crenshaw 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	James was more direct in deflecting the question of how he would  
set up his pairings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I should give any information about tomorrow  
afternoon's pairings,'' he said. ``Sorry. You're trying to catch me 
in a weak moment while I was thinking of something else.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION:* The customer pulled out his gold  
American Express Card. The register showed his purchase cost $436. 
He smiled as he signed the receipt. 
</P>
<P>
	Pretty steep for buying five items of souvenir clothing at the  
Ryder Cup merchandise tent? Not steep enough that it would keep him 
from waiting in line 20 minutes to get into the tent, then spending 
five minutes inching toward one of the 40 cash registers set up to 
accommodate the customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was worth it,'' his companion said of the wait.  
</P>
<P>
	While golfers were practicing for Friday's opening matches,  
patrons crowded into the tent to take home a remembrance of their 
attendance at golf's prestigious event. 
</P>
<P>
	A Brookline police officer was asked if the number of people in  
the tent met the town's fire code. 
</P>
<P>
	``Probably not,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *QUIET, PLEASE:* Silence plays a major role in golf. Spectators  
are expected to remain quiet while players hover over the ball, 
then hit it. In fact, fans attending the Ryder Cup are not allowed 
to carry cell phones and beepers. 
</P>
<P>
	But an unintended hush fell over Thursday's opening ceremony  
when the microphone of master of ceremonies Dan Hicks went on the 
blink. 
</P>
<P>
	A stagehand brought him another microphone. That didn't work.  
Neither did a second replacement. 
</P>
<P>
	While Hicks remained silent, conductor James Orent waved his  
baton and members of the Boston Pops Orchestra, slated to perform 
next, began playing. When they were finished, Hicks spoke into a 
microphone that actually worked. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know it's not your day when the backup to the backup goes  
down,'' Hicks said. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *WARM WEEKEND:* Temperatures should be comfortable throughout  
the three days of competition. Wind, though, could play a role in 
the matches. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a little more windy'' during Thursday's practice, Tiger  
Woods said. ``If the wind continues and if it persists the way it 
has been, the greens will start to pick up. The green speeds have 
been starting to get faster and faster as the week went along.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The forecast for Friday called for a breezy day with partly  
sunny skies and a high temperature of 78. On Saturday, 
early-morning clouds with the possibility of a shower should give 
way to sunny and windy conditions with a high of 74. Mostly sunny 
skies with a high of 70 to 76 were predicted for Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
                              	----	 
</P>
<P>
	 *ALL BUSINESS:* Funnyman Mark James wore the look of a European  
captain who is ready for matches to begin -- and ready for his team 
to start earning points. 
</P>
<P>
	While Crenshaw cracked jokes about the second alternate-shot  
match featuring Woods and Garcia, his counterpart was all business. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're concentrating on our side of the pairings and looking  
after our own games, sending our guys out to play as well as they 
can and not worrying too much about how the opposition are doing 
their pairings,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he was surprised by any of Crenshaw's pairings, James  
flatly replied, ``No.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, one British reporter pointed out that The Country Club  
was buzzing over the prospect of Woods and Garcia in the same 
match, and did he not share any of that excitement? 
</P>
<P>
	``And don't say no,'' the reporter said.  
</P>
<P>
	James stared back and said with as much enthusiasm as a fence  
post, ``Yes, I think it's extremely exciting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, James did not totally abandon his dry sense of humor.  
Asked how he informed Padraig Harrington that he, and not Jose 
Maria Olazabal, would be paired with Miguel Angel Jimenez, the 
captain shrugged. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, `Padraig, you're playing tomorrow with Miguel.'''  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *FIRST SHOT:* Paul Lawrie, the unlikely British Open champion  
playing in his first Ryder Cup, will hit the first shot of the 33rd 
matches. 
</P>
<P>
	The visiting team traditionally has honors on the first tee, and  
Lawrie and Colin Montgomerie are in the first alternate-shot match. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure it will be nerve-wracking,'' Lawrie said. ``I know  
I'll be nervous, but I've dreamed of this for a long time and can't 
wait to get started.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe he'll change his mind Friday morning. After all,  
Montgomerie had the honor of hitting the first shot at Oak Hill in 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's as nervous as I want to be, thank you very much,'' he  
said. ``I don't want to feel that bad ever again.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DIVOTS:* At the opening ceremonies, Crenshaw introduced past  
captains Byron Nelson (1965), Dow Finsterwald (1977), Billy Casper 
(1979), Raymond Floyd (1989), Dave Stockton (1991) and Tom Kite 
(1997). Kite led the only losing team in that group. ... Europe 
assistant captain Sam Torrance minimized the inexperience of a team 
with seven Ryder Cup rookies among its 12 members: ``They have 
played a lot of golf. They know what they're doing.''

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks plummeted today as investors sold heavily  
amid continued worries about higher interest rates and the strength 
of the dollar. A Microsoft executive's warning that technology 
stocks are overvalued robbed the market of a big source of 
strength. The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 205.48 at 
10,318.59. That brought the Dow's decline over the past three 
sessions to 505.31 points. Broader stock indicators also fell 
steeply. The Nasdaq composite index suffered one of its worst 
declines in its history. It fell 107.66 to 2,750.50. ``The market 
is under the weight of so many threats right now,'' said Scott 
Bleier, chief investment strategist at Prime Charter Ltd., citing 
rising interest rates, the tumbling dollar as the most pressing 
problems. ``It has deteriorated.''

	Jobless Claims at 25-Year Low  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- New claims for unemployment benefits dropped  
unexpectedly last week to the lowest level in a quarter of a 
century. But economists chalked up much of the decline to Hurricane 
Floyd, suggesting that the storm could have prevented some jobless 
people from getting to claims offices. Government officials 
acknowledged that Floyd could have had an influence on the figures. 
A total of 272,000 Americans filed new claims for jobless benefits 
for the week that ended Saturday, down 17,000 from the previous 
week, the Labor Department said today. Many economists had forecast 
a rise in last week's claims to 290,000.

	Earthlink, Mindspring To Merge

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- EarthLink Network Inc. and MindSpring  
Enterprises Inc., two fast-growing providers of dial-up access to 
the Internet, are merging in a $1.4 billion stock swap to create a 
tough new rival to America Online Inc. The marriage of close 
competitors, each founded just 5 years ago, speeds the 
consolidation of a highly fragmented industry brimming with 
thousands of small Web access providers. The entity created by 
Thursday's transaction would have 3 million subscribers. MindSpring 
stock fell 17 percent, or $5.50 a share, to $27.37 1/2. EarthLink was 
up as much as 11 percent immediately after the deal's announcement 
but retreated by day's end, down 3 percent, or $1.12 1/2 at $42.37 1/2.

	IMF Head Says Relief for Poor Near  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers and the  
head of the International Monetary Fund both expressed optimism 
today that agreement will soon be reached on how to finance greatly 
expanded debt relief for the world's poorest countries. Michel 
Camdessus, the IMF managing director, said finance officials were 
``within striking distance'' of a deal. One of the key elements of 
the revamped proposal is the sale of 14 million ounces of the IMF's 
gold reserves to IMF member countries, rather than on the open 
market. The sale will pay for the IMF's contribution to a program 
intended to forgive $90 billion in debt held by the world's 41 
poorest nations.

	Clinton Fights Money-Laundering  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration today unveiled its  
first national money-laundering strategy, aimed at stanching the 
flow of billions of criminal dollars through the U.S. financial 
system. The package of proposed new laws and rules comes as federal 
investigators examine allegations of a huge money-laundering scheme 
involving Russians and the Bank of New York. The new strategy 
includes a requirement that storefront check cashiers, brokerage 
firms and casinos notify authorities of suspicious activities the 
way banks must do. The government would designate new 
high-intensity money-laundering zones.

from June through August identified no ``significant'' 
vulnerabilities to the Y2K problem in state health department 
systems. Some experts fear the arrival of the year 2000 could 
result in shutdowns or other malfunctions by causing some older

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. today reported  
profits of $290 million for its fiscal third quarter, a 92 percent 
increase from last year's figure and well above analysts' 
predictions. Lehman attributed the strong earnings numbers to the 
company's increased focus on its highly profitable investment 
banking and stock trading units. Lehman earned $2.20 a share, 19 
cents more than analysts' expectations of $2.01 a share. The 
previous high was $2.12 a share, posted in the second quarter of 
1998. Shares of Lehman were at 53 3/8, down 1 7/8.

information company. The selloff continued even after the company 
denied it had disclosed any profit warnings. Reuters ended a 
volatile session down the equivalent of $2.09 to close at $11.90 a 
share. With more than 55 million shares changing hands, it was the 
most active issue on the London Stock Exchange. Reuters U.S. shares 
were down nearly 11 percent Thursday on the Nasdaq Stock Market,

	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Chiquita Brands International Inc. plans to

save at least $15 million a year in operating costs, management 
said today. The jobs are to be cut in corporate and staff ranks in 
the United States and Latin America, as well as banana operations 
in North America and Europe. The reductions will cost the company 
$6 million before taxes in the third quarter to cover severance 
expenses, benefits extensions and job placement services, the 
Cincinnati-based company said. Chiquita shares were at 5 5/8, up 1/8.

today it plans to split its fast-growing telecommunications 
business from its engineering and automotive divisions in a bid to 
boost profits. The announcement sent Mannesmann shares soaring on 
the Frankfurt stock exchange. Mannesmann's board of directors made 
the proposal to the supervisory board today, the company said. A 
decision was expected early next year. Mannesmann said it also aims 
to list the two companies separately on European capital markets in 
2001 and wants both companies to be components of Germany's DAX 30

DaimlerChrysler's North American unit and be replaced by James 
Holden, executive vice president for sales and marketing. Germany's

four members will leave the 17-seat management board Oct. 1.

	Clinton Eulogizes Labor's Kirkland

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton eulogized labor leader Lane  
Kirkland as a towering figure who defied political labels and 
fought tenaciously for ``the things he knew to be right.'' Clinton 
and well-wishers including Henry Kissinger and Polish labor 
reformer Lech Walesa attended a memorial service today at 
Georgetown University for Kirkland, who died of lung cancer month 
at 77. Kirkland, who reunited the major U.S. unions during his 
presidency of the AFL-CIO from 1979 to 1995, clung to the principle 
that ``the role of the trade unions was to try to keep the big guys 
from kicking the little guys around,'' Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> China Turning Over US Airmen Remains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. officials in China are taking possession  
of two sets of human remains believed to be crew members of an 
American bomber that crashed in southern China during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	The remains were to be turned over at a repatriation ceremony  
today in the city of Guilin and then flown to Hawaii for 
examination by the Army's Central Identification Laboratory, 
Pentagon spokesman Larry Greer said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Jones, the Pentagon's top official on matters of American  
missing servicemen, is attending the ceremony, Greer said. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sets of remains were found this summer during an  
unpublicized joint U.S.-China recovery operation in a rugged ravine 
on Mao'er Mountain in Guangxi province, Greer said. U.S. and 
Chinese officials have made multiple trips to the site since 
recovering bone fragments there in January 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	All 10 airmen died when their B-24 bomber crashed during a  
return flight to Guangxi after bombing Japanese ships near Taiwan 
on Aug. 31, 1944. Greer said forensic scientists believe they now 
have most, if not all, of the 10 sets of remains and are ``very 
close'' to positive identifications of most of them. 
</P>
<P>
	According to U.S. military records, the crew members were pilot  
2nd Lt. George H. Pierpont; co-pilot 2nd Lt. Franklin A. 
Tomenendale; navigator 2nd Lt. Robert L. Deming; bombardier 2nd Lt. 
George A. Ward; engineer Staff Sgt. Anthony W. DeLucia; radio 
operator Sgt. Ellsworth V. Kelley; radar observer Pfc. Fred P. 
Buckley; and gunners Staff Sgt. William A. Drager, Sgt. Robert L. 
Kearsey, and Pvt. Vincent J. Netherwood. 
</P>
<P>
	The Department of Defense has not provided the men's hometowns.  
</P>
<P>
	The bomber crash site lay undisturbed for 52 years until two  
Chinese farmers hunting for wild herbs found it on Oct. 2, 1996, 
Chinese officials said. The discovery was made public in November 
1996 when Chinese President Jiang Zemin turned over photographs of 
five dog tags taken from the aircraft, as well as a videotape of 
the crash site, to President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States poured aid and bomber crews into China during  
World War II to fight the Japanese, who had invaded much of the 
country. About 1,000 U.S. planes went down over China during the 
war, and about 100 remain missing. The Pentagon has cited China's 
cooperation on the B-24 recovery operation as an example of ways in 
which better military relations can yield practical results. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon also wants to use the goodwill created by the B-24  
recovery operation to encourage the Chinese to cooperate in 
research on unsolved cases of American servicemen missing from the 
Korean War. China ran many of the prisoner of war camps in North 
Korea during the war. The Chinese government has been reluctant to 
discuss POW issues, saying all were settled after the war.

<HEADLINE> Webb Hopes To Regain LPGA Momentum  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Karrie Webb is rested, rejuvenated and  
ready to atone for one of her few mistakes of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Webb is the top money winner on the LPGA Tour with $1.4 million  
and six victories. But she let one slip away two weeks ago in the 
World Championship of Women's Golf in Minnesota. She led by three 
strokes after 14 holes, but double-bogeyed twice down the stretch 
as Se Ri Pak won by a stroke. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was hard for me to understand what happened,'' Webb said.  
``I have another 15 years to go on the tour, and can't sit and 
dwell on weeks like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 24-year-old Australian skipped last week's tournament at  
Kent, Wash., and is back for the three-day Safeway LPGA Golf 
Championship, one of the most popular tournaments on the tour. The 
beautiful par-72, 6,307-yard course at Columbia-Edgewater Country 
Club, squeezed between the Columbia River and industrial Portland, 
is in terrific shape. 
</P>
<P>
	``It always has been one of my favorites,'' said Danielle  
Ammaccapane, who won last year's tournament by one shot over Emilee 
Klein. ``There are a lot of different kinds of holes, it's pretty 
and it has great greens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Temperatures approaching 90 baked those greens earlier this  
week, and after a slight rain Thursday, conditions should be cool 
but comfortable for Friday's first round. 
</P>
<P>
	The tournament also is among the tour's most lucrative. The  
purse this year is $800,000, up $200,000 from 1998. The winner gets 
$129,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Juli Inkster is within one point of making the LPGA Hall of  
Fame, and a victory in the Safeway would qualify her. Inkster, 39, 
has four victories this season, including two majors -- the U.S. 
Women's Open and the LPGA Championship -- and is second to Webb on 
the money list with $1,143,703. 
</P>
<P>
	Webb could battle Inkster for player of the year for the rest of  
the tour circuit, which has six official events left after this 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I play well the rest of the year, she might not catch me,''  
Webb said. ``If I'm meant to win the player of the year and Vare 
Trophy (for best scoring average), then I'm meant to win. It's up 
to fate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ammaccapane's winning score of 12-under last year was three  
strokes better than her sister, Dina, who was third. It was the 
best combined finish ever for the sisters. Danielle is struggling 
this season, having missed 11 cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	But she couldn't be happier. She and her husband are expecting a  
baby -- ultrasound says it's almost certainly a girl -- on Feb. 29. 
</P>
<P>
	``Golf is not going all that great,'' Ammaccapane said.  
``Everything else is going real well.''

<HEADLINE> $125M Mars Orbiter Feared Destroyed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- A $125 million NASA spacecraft that had  
traveled 416 million miles to Mars vanished Thursday as it was 
about to go into orbit around the Red Planet and was feared 
destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second time in six years that a NASA spaceship was  
lost just as it reached Mars. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mars Climate Orbiter, which was on a mission to study the  
planet's weather and look for signs of water, apparently flew too 
close to the Martian atmosphere and broke apart or burned up, the 
space agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	Human or software error was probably to blame. NASA said  
mechanical problems were ruled out. 
</P>
<P>
	The apparent loss, after the $1 billion Mars Observer probe  
disappeared in 1993, comes as Congress is threatening to cut a 
large portion of NASA's space exploration budget and the agency is 
trying to show that it can design ``faster, cheaper and better'' 
missions. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA officials said failures are to be expected, since probes  
are now being launched every 26 months. They also pointed to their 
successes, such as the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft and the Mars 
Pathfinder, which landed on the planet with a little rover to much 
acclaim in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're launching missions at such a such a vast and rapid  
a rate, there is simply statistically a greater trend that you're 
going to have a loss,'' said Carl Pilcher of NASA's Office of Space 
Exploration. 
</P>
<P>
	``We went into this with our eyes open, and we understood that  
that greater rate could mean a loss. We're going to persevere,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Climate Orbiter was last heard from about 2:06 a.m. PDT,  
five minutes after its main engine had fired to slow down the 
spacecraft so that it would be captured in the planet's orbit. 
Controllers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory cheered at the 
news. 
</P>
<P>
	As the probe flew behind Mars, controllers expected to lose its  
signal briefly, then regain it at 2:26 a.m., as it came back into 
view. 
</P>
<P>
	But controllers quickly learned that the probe's closest  
approach was about 12 1/2 miles under the lowest survivable altitude. 
</P>
<P>
	As the minutes ticked past, worry spread across the controllers'  
faces. One man twisted his wedding ring; another sat on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orbiter carried instruments designed to study the atmosphere  
and the fate of water that was believed to have once pooled in huge 
oceans on the planet. The information is key to understanding 
whether life ever existed or can exist there. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the instruments was to measure temperatures, dust, water  
vapor and clouds. The craft also had a camera that was to take 
wide- and medium-angle snapshots of the planet's atmosphere, 
similar to an Earth-based weather satellite. 
</P>
<P>
	The Climate Orbiter, launched in December, was the first of two  
probes arriving at the Red Planet this year in a $327.5 million 
exploration program. 
</P>
<P>
	Because Mars and Earth orbit the sun at different speeds, the  
distance between the planets changes. Consequently, the orbiter had 
to travel 416 million miles to get to Mars, although the two 
planets are 122 million miles apart now. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orbiter's companion, the Mars Polar Lander, was launched  
separately and is due to arrive Dec. 3. NASA said that mission will 
not be compromised by the destruction of the Climate Orbiter. 
</P>
<P>
	The Polar Lander has equipment to study the soil and to look for  
ice beneath the surface. Just before the craft enters the Martian 
atmosphere, it will release two penetrating probes that will punch 
beneath the soil. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, the Mars Observer vanished as its fuel lines were being  
pressurized before the craft's descent into orbit. An investigating 
panel concluded that a fuel line had probably broken during the 
long journey through space.

<HEADLINE> Seattle Interviews Gillick for GM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Pat Gillick, general manager for Toronto's world  
champion teams in 1992-93 and two Baltimore playoff clubs, has met 
with Seattle Mariners president Chuck Armstrong to discuss the 
Mariners' general manager job. 
</P>
<P>
	Gillick, 62, joins former New York Yankees and Houston Astros GM  
Bob Watson in the hunt for the job being vacated Oct. 31 by Woody 
Woodward, whose 11-year tenure was the longest of any current GM in 
the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	Woodward oversaw the Mariners' transformation from mediocrity to  
playoff team in 1995-96, then back to mediocrity this year, when 
they have been at or below .500 much of the season. His tenure also 
included the Mariners' move in July from the Kingdome to a 
retractable-roof, baseball-only stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Gillick arranged his Wednesday meeting with Armstrong, who  
confirmed the meeting but declined to provide details. 
</P>
<P>
	Gillick is now an official with Team USA Baseball.  
</P>
<P>
	Gillick became Toronto GM in 1984, eight years after joining the  
organization. He also was the Baltimore GM from 1996-98. The 
Orioles made the playoffs in two of those three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Watson, 53, was general manager of the Astros from 1993-95 and  
the Yankees in 1996-97.

<HEADLINE> GOP Unveils Social Spending Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republicans unveiled a $316 billion  
measure today financing labor, health and education programs that 
is already being attacked by Democrats and the nation's governors. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation -- the biggest spending bill for the upcoming  
fiscal year -- proposes more money than President Clinton has 
proposed for biomedical research, the Job Corps, and special 
education for handicapped students. 
</P>
<P>
	But it would kill Clinton's proposal for hiring 100,000 new  
teachers and cut job training and the Occupational Safety and 
Health Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, as part of the GOP effort to pay for spending bills  
without using Social Security funds, the bill would reclaim $3 
billion in federal welfare payments the states have not yet spent. 
</P>
<P>
	Such proposals make it unsure that the bill could pass the  
House, and a virtually certain candidate for a White House veto 
threat. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, Rep. John Porter, R-Ill., chief author of the measure,  
said it was important to start moving the bill through Congress. To 
do so would give lawmakers a starting point for inevitable 
negotiations with the administration over the bill's final shape. 
</P>
<P>
	Failure to do so, Porter said, would let the White House ``sit  
at the table and effectively write every line-item of the bill. To 
me, that is no choice at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Porter is chairman of the House Appropriations Committee  
subcommittee that plans to vote on the legislation today. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress has sent Clinton just four of the 13 spending bills for  
the coming fiscal year, and the White House has threatened vetoes 
of six of the measures. 
</P>
<P>
	With a certainty that some of the measures will be incomplete by  
Oct. 1, GOP leaders said they would send Clinton a stopgap bill 
keeping agencies functioning through Oct. 21 at this year's 
spending levels. House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, said 
the bill will be as ``non-vetoable as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Governors strongly oppose the GOP plan to capture the $3 billion  
in welfare funds. The decision to use the money over governors' 
objections underlines the tough time Republicans are having paying 
for spending measures without tapping into the Social Security 
surplus, which they have vowed to protect. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the plan, the federal government would reclaim the welfare  
money only temporarily, and return it to the states in full for 
fiscal 2001, said a GOP official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity. The official said the idea was a bookkeeping device to 
help Republicans avoid raiding Social Security funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, governors' representatives said they strongly opposed  
the idea, just as they did when a similar plan was floated several 
weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``That would be a huge mistake, and we would be very  
disappointed in any elected official who did not feel a sense of 
commitment once the leadership has given their word,'' said Clinton 
Key, executive director of the Republican Governors' Association. 
</P>
<P>
	He and others said governors agreed to the 1996 welfare overhaul  
on condition they be allowed to bank unused money for future 
economic downturns. Thirty-eight states and the District of 
Columbia have a total of $4.2 billion in unspent federal welfare 
funds, according to the most recent statistics. 
</P>
<P>
	Terrell Halaska, spokeswoman at the National Governors'  
Association, said, ``As they have done all year, the governors are 
opposed to any attempt by Congress to break the deal with the 
governors'' on welfare. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional Democrats were also critical.  
</P>
<P>
	``The Republican leaders apparently think that it's OK to steal  
billions of dollars in funding for needy families to get themselves 
out of their budget jam,'' Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., said in a 
written statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The savings would help pay for the year's biggest spending bill  
covering the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and 
Education. Its price tag will exceed $300 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	To help pay for the bill, Republicans also plan to declare the  
$1.4 billion program that helps poor people pay heating bills a 
budget ``emergency.'' That declaration means the money can exceed 
spending limits enacted two years ago, and that GOP leaders 
recently conceded they will break. 
</P>
<P>
	In other action, the Senate voted by voice to boost spending for  
veterans by $600 million next year. 
</P>
<P>
	In what has become a bidding war over a popular program, the  
Senate voted to increase veterans' healthcare spending next year to 
$19 billion. That would match the House's figure and exceed both 
this year's total and President Clinton's original request by $1.7 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	But by 63-36, senators rejected a proposal by Sen. Paul  
Wellstone, D-Minn., to add the $1.3 billion for veterans health, 
paid for out of budget surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	Minutes later, senators voted 61-38 to kill a plan by Sen.  
Robert Smith, I-N.H., that would have provided $225 million for 
veterans, this time paid for by killing Clinton's AmeriCorps 
national service program. 
</P>
<P>
	That vote was significant because it signaled that the Senate  
would refuse to go along with the House, which voted to kill the 
AmeriCorps community service program entirely.

<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Doris Allen, a maverick Orange County  
Republican who became the California Assembly's first female 
speaker, died Wednesday of colon cancer. She was 63. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Allen lived in Westminster and spent 12 years in the  
Assembly. She sparked a ferocious GOP fight by using the Democratic 
backing of former Speaker Willie Brown, who was being pushed out by 
term limits, to gain enough votes to become speaker. 
</P>

campaign, believed she never received credit for what she had

<HEADLINE> House Crafting Minimun Wage Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bipartisan legislation is bubbling to the  
surface in the House to raise the minimum wage by $1.30 an hour 
over four years and grant several tax breaks and other sweeteners 
for small businesses and the self-employed. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional officials, speaking on condition of anonymity,  
said Wednesday that a group of moderate Republicans and 
business-oriented Democrats hoped to unveil the measure formally by 
week's end. 
</P>
<P>
	The principals involved in the discussions, who include  
Republican Rick Lazio of New York and Democrat Gary Condit of 
California, declined to comment on the substance of the measure. 
</P>
<P>
	Numerous officials provided these details, while cautioning that  
no final decisions had been made and stressing that the prospects 
for passage in the narrowly divided House were uncertain: 
</P>
<P>
	-- The current $5.15 federal minimum wage would rise by 35 cents  
an hour in each of the next two years, followed by two annual 
increases of 30 cents an hour. That is more than the $1 an hour 
increase over four years that the GOP leadership had been 
discussing, but less than the $1 over two years that the White 
House and organized labor's allies in the House favor and are 
expected to press for beginning in the next day or two. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The cost of health care would be made fully deductible for the  
self-employed. 
</P>
<P>
	-- There would be an increase in the deductibility of the cost of  
business meals, a provision backed by the restaurant industry that 
would apply to small businesses and the self-employed. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Reduction in the unemployment tax surtax.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Extension of the Work Opportunity Tax Credit, which offsets  
the first $6,000 in wages paid to certain workers. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Increased asset depreciation for small business.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Pension changes, which are part of House-passed legislation  
co-sponsored by Reps. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, and Ben Cardin, D-Md., 
and favored by the life insurance industry. These include increased 
permissible contributions for 401(k) plans, and a provision 
allowing workers over 50 to save additional funds for retirements. 
Other pension changes include greater portability for pensions and 
faster vesting rights. 
</P>
<P>
	The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that a $1 increase  
in the minimum wage over two years would cost business roughly $16 
billion over five years. The tax breaks are designed to more than 
offset that, although no formal estimates were available. 
</P>
<P>
	Efforts to pass a minimum wage increase are stalled in the  
Senate, where Democrats want to attach the issue to a bill 
overhauling bankruptcy laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The political currents are tricky in the House, as well.  
</P>
<P>
	Many Republicans traditionally have opposed increases in the  
minimum wage, but the leadership is under pressure from the 
Democratic minority as well as a pivotal group of GOP lawmakers 
from swing districts who court union support. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, while many Democrats favor a $1 minimum wage  
increase over two years, conservative members of the rank and file 
want measures to assist businesses likely to feel the effects of an 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
	House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, told reporters  
earlier in the week that a vote would be allowed if moderate 
Republicans asked for it. 
</P>
<P>
	At a GOP leadership meeting Wednesday, Rep. Roy Blunt of  
Missouri, the chief deputy whip, was assigned to oversee the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a general sense that if we are going to have this vote  
in the next couple of years, we might as well have it now,'' he 
said. He added that business groups also have a chance to win tax 
relief they would otherwise lose because of President Clinton's 
pending veto of a broader GOP tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Democrats, Rep. David Bonior of Michigan, the party whip,  
is spearheading an effort to force a vote on the costlier White 
House-backed bill that calls for a $1 an hour increase over two 
years. Through a spokesman, he called the bipartisan bill ``a good 
start.''

<HEADLINE>  Blissfull Hall Wins Brown Jug Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DELAWARE, Ohio (AP) -- Less than an hour after fading down the  
stretch to lose his first shot at winning, Blissfull Hall redeemed 
himself with a strong closing quarter to take the Little Brown Jug 
in a raceoff Thursday and move within a win of capturing pacing's 
triple crown. 
</P>
<P>
	Blissfull Hall, winner of the Cane Pace earlier this month at  
Freehold, N.J., shoots for the triple crown and a $250,000 bonus in 
the Messenger Stakes on Oct. 16 at The Meadows at Meadow Lands, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second year in a row Ron Pierce drove the Little  
Brown Jug winner. A year ago, he got a late gift when Mike Lachance 
elected to drive Artiscape in the second heat instead of favored 
Shady Character. Pierce was given the ride and ended up winning 
while Artiscape finished fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	Blissfull Hall coasted to victory in the first elimination in  
1:53, winning a showdown with leading money-winner The Panderosa. 
The Panderosa broke stride in the first few seconds and finished 
last. 
</P>
<P>
	In the second heat, which in the Little Brown Jug format brings  
back the top three finishers in each of the first three 
eliminations, Pierce took Blissfull Hall to the rail early and 
appeared to be in command heading into the stretch of the one-mile 
race at Delaware County Fairgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
	But Blissfull Hall faded badly and dropped to third behind upset  
winner Looking For Art, driven by Ohio native Eric Ledford in his 
Jug debut. Ledford and his wife, Tammy, are expecting their first 
child and he carried a pager with him throughout the day in case he 
was summoned back to his home in Chicago for the birth. 
</P>
<P>
	A horse must win two heats in the Jug's quirky format and  
Looking For Art's stunning victory forced the four horses who had 
won races to come back in a raceoff to decide the Jug winner. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first raceoff since Fake Left needed a third heat to  
win in 1992 and only the second in the last 21 years. There have 
been eight raceoffs in the Jug's 54 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Pierce bided his time, holding Blissfull Hall in third or fourth  
place until going wide on the last turn. The Cambest colt, who had 
lost the lead at the same spot an hour earlier in the second heat, 
pulled away down the stretch to win in 1:55 3-5 by a length over 
Looking For Art. The victory was worth $127,834 to owner Daniel 
Plouffe. Ohio Gov. Robert Taft presented the Little Brown Jug 
trophy to Plouffe, who owns a string of grocery stores in Quebec. 
</P>
<P>
	Blissfull Hall has won 10 races, with two seconds and a third in  
14 starts. 
</P>
<P>
	A victory in the Messenger would make Blissfull Hall the ninth  
winner of the triple crown for pacing 3-year-olds and the second 
since Ralph Hanover in 1983. Western Dreamer won all three legs in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jug was again a huge disappointment for owner Jeffrey S.  
Snyder. 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder had to scratch Jug favorite Cam's Card Shark moments  
before post time five years ago. He erased some of that hurt by 
sending all three of his entries to the second heat -- each with Luc 
Ouellette in the sulky -- and even had half of the four-horse field 
in the raceoff. Yet he still came up empty. 
</P>
<P>
	Ledford qualified three horses for the second heat -- one from  
each elimination -- before winning behind Looking For Art. Looking 
For Art actually won more money on the day than Blissfull Hall 
($202,904) because the second heat had the biggest purse.

<HEADLINE> Gene Mutation, Disease Linked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A gene mutation already linked to cancer has  
been shown in laboratory studies to also cause the immune system to 
attack the kidneys and other organs. 
</P>
<P>
	In mouse studies, researchers at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer  
Center found that a single mutation in a gene called PTEN is enough 
to trigger cancer and autoimmune diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Pier Paolo Pandolfi of Memorial Sloan-Kettering, senior  
author of a study appearing Friday in the journal Science, said 
PTEN is normally present in pairs in each cell and its function is 
to kill abnormal cells that could develop into cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	But Pandolfi said his team found in the mouse studies that a  
mutation of a single PTEN gene is enough to start a disease 
process. PTEN mutation has been linked to cancers of the breast, 
prostate, ovary, colon, skin and lymph system. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our study shows that the loss of just one PTEN gene is enough  
to ... begin the process of uncontrolled cell growth (cancer),'' 
Pandolfi. 
</P>
<P>
	PTEN is one of a number of gene pairs that help to eliminate  
cells that are at risk of converting to cancerous growths. The 
genes work by causing flawed cells to kill themselves, a process 
called apoptosis. For most gene pairs, both copies must be lost or 
mutated for the apoptosis process to be eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
	Pandolfi said, however, that apoptosis is lost or restricted in  
a cell when only one PTEN gene is mutated. 
</P>
<P>
	The study in mice showed that a single PTEN mutation also allows  
white blood cells, or lymphocytes, to accumulate in tissue and to 
eventually start attacking organs in the body, a process called 
autoimmune disease. 
</P>
<P>
	In mice bred with the PTEN mutation, the lungs, kidneys, spleen  
and other organs became enlarged and inflamed from attack by the 
lymphocytes. Eventually, the mice died from a disease process 
similar to lupus, an autoimmune disease often fatal in humans, said 
Pandolfi. 
</P>
<P>
	Although PTEN mutation has been linked to a number of human  
cancers, it has not been determined if the mutation is also present 
in patients with lupus. Pandolfi said he and his team are now 
looking for the PTEN mutation in DNA samples from lupus patients. 
</P>
<P>
	If it is shown the mutation is present in lupus, he said, it  
might then be possible to develop a drug that blocks the effects of 
the gene mutation.

<HEADLINE>  U.S. Feeling Ryder Cup Pressure  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROOKLINE, Mass. (AP) -- Imagine facing a 3-2 pitch in the bottom  
of the ninth in the World Series. Standing at the free throw line 
with the score tied and one second left in the NBA Finals. Staring 
at a 6-foot putt to win the Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	Pressure in the Ryder Cup is every bit of that.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's like playing golf in the middle of the Super Bowl,''  
Sweden's Jesper Parnevik said of the biennial matches between the 
United States and Europe, which start Friday at The Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
	The pulse quickens, legs turn to mush, palms get clammy -- and  
that's just when flags are raised and anthems are played during the 
opening ceremony. Walk to the first tee to hit the first shot in 
the first match, and the pressure gets insufferable. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing that stands still is the shaft of the club, and  
that's before you take the club out of the bag,'' two-time Masters 
champion Jose Maria Olazabal said. ``Everything shakes -- hands, 
legs, everything. There's nothing you can do to avoid that. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what makes it so special.''  
</P>
<P>
	Tom Lehman played his first Ryder Cup in 1995 and was called  
upon to hit the first shot of the matches. He used a 3-wood, which 
goes about 250 yards under normal circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
	``It went 320,'' Lehman said. ``So, where was my blood pressure?  
You figure it out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a most complicated game, played this week in the most  
unpredictable format, understanding what is at stake for the U.S. 
team in the next three days is simple. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to win,'' Lehman said.  
</P>
<P>
	Never mind that the British invented the game, or that an  
English seed merchant named Samuel Ryder dreamed up this concept in 
1927 of matching the best players on both sides of the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans come to the Ryder Cup with better credentials, a  
cast that includes Tiger Woods, David Duval, Davis Love III, Payne 
Stewart -- no player lower than 28th in the world rankings. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got the 12 best players in the world,'' Jeff Maggert  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	What they don't have is the cup. Europe has won or retained the  
Ryder Cup five times in the past seven matches. Still, it returns 
every year as the underdog. And even though it owns the cup, 
another victory would be considered another major upset. 
</P>
<P>
	That's just what Europe wants to hear.  
</P>
<P>
	``They must be under pressure, being the 12 best players in the  
world, according to themselves,'' England's Lee Westwood said. 
</P>
<P>
	``People at home are all hoping we're going to win, not  
expecting us to win,'' Darren Clarke of Northern Ireland said. 
``And that's a huge difference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to the pressure for the United States is the rift over  
Ryder Cup revenue, estimated at $63 million with a net profit of 
$23 million for the PGA of America. Woods and Duval led a faction 
of U.S. players who want some of that money, at least for charities 
of their choice. 
</P>
<P>
	The PGA says it will have such a plan in place by the end of the  
year, but the damage has been done. Another loss, and the Americans 
will look like greedy millionaires who have everything but a 
17-inch gold chalice that money can't buy. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the Americans can find the passion to win from captain  
Ben Crenshaw, who goes by the nickname ``Gentle Ben'' but who also 
broke his putter during a fit of rage during the 1987 Ryder Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's terribly important for us,'' Crenshaw said. ``I think  
everyone knows that for our side, not having success in the last 
few occasions. We've felt that sting twice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another loss surely is possible.  
</P>
<P>
	After all, this is match play, the most fickle format in golf,  
especially over 18 holes. The match is decided by who wins the most 
holes, not who shoots the lowest score. All it takes is one player 
to make a couple of long putts, or hole a shot from the bunker, for 
momentum to shift and the lead to become insurmountable. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we can beat anybody,'' Westwood said. ``This format  
leads to shocks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With 28 matches worth one point each over three days, no team  
has won by more than two points since 1987. In the past five Ryder 
Cups, the United States has won 70 1/2 points, compared with 69 1/2 for 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	``A few rolls of the ball here, a rub of the green there, a bit  
of luck in the middle, and the match can go either way,'' European 
captain Mark James said. ``There's an element of luck, and I think 
you have to be aware of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woods is regarded as one of the best in match play, particularly  
since he became the first man to win the U.S. Amateur three 
straight times. But as great as he is, Woods lost a crucial singles 
match to Costantino Rocca, a former factory worker in Italy, in the 
Ryder Cup at Valderrama, Spain, two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``In match play in 18 holes, all it takes is just one shot here  
and there, especially on the back nine,'' Woods said. ``If we can 
make those putts at the crucial times, who knows? We could turn it 
around and get the cup back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If not, the pressure will build with every shot on every hole.  
The teams are decided over a two-year process (one year for 
Europe), so some may not be playing at their best. Mark O'Meara, 
the Masters and British Open champion of 1998, hasn't won this year 
and has offered to sit out some of the matches. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can show up this week and play very bad, and that's when  
the pressure turns into fear and panic,'' Parnevik said. ``And you 
don't want to be here.''

Ryder Cup at Valderrama, Spain, two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``In match play in 18 holes, all it takes is just one shot here  
and there, especially on the back nine,'' Woods said. ``If we can 
make those putts at the crucial times, who knows? We could turn it 
around and get the cup back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If not, the pressure will build with every shot on every hole.  
The teams are decided over a two-year process (one year for 
Europe), so some may not be playing at their best. Mark O'Meara, 
the Masters and British Open champion of 1998, hasn't won this year 
and has offered to sit out some of the matches. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can show up this week and play very bad, and that's when  
the pressure turns into fear and panic,'' Parnevik said. ``And you 
don't want to be here.''

<HEADLINE> Soccer Referee's Call Angers Crowd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- An exhibiton between the Miami  
Fusion and the Haitian national team was suspended abruptly after a 
referee's call against Haiti angered many fans, who trashed the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday night's game at Lockhart Stadium was stopped in the  
60th minute with the Fusion leading 1-0 after referee Greg Watson 
disallowed an apparent Haitian goal by Eddy Cesar. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the crowd of 12,400, mostly fans of the Haitian team,  
reacted by throwing plastic water bottles and garbage cans onto the 
field. Many also rushed the fences that separated them from the 
field, breaking a 40-foot section. 
</P>
<P>
	The referees quickly left, as did players from both teams.  
Fusion and Haitian officials decided to call the game nearly an 
hour after the outburst began. There were no arrests or injuries, 
police said Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Daly Admits to Drinking, Gambling  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- John Daly is drinking and gambling again, not  
sure where it will lead but offering no regrets for losing an 
endorsement with Callaway Golf that had been his primary source of 
income. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's sad, but I think it's great to be free,'' Daly told Golf  
World magazine in this week's issue. ``Granted, I could go out and 
lose everything (by) gambling and drinking, but there's no sense in 
denying it. It's in my blood.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daly, a recovering alcoholic who has twice been in  
rehabilitation clinics since his surprising victory in the 1991 PGA 
Championship, said he ended 26 months of sobriety June 11 after 
missing the cut in the St. Jude Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just feeling down,'' he told the magazine. ``I got in my  
Jeep, went in a store, bought a 12-pack of Miller Lite, and drank 
it all by the time I got to Dardanelle (Ark.). That's when I 
relapsed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daly's five-year deal with Callaway, signed after he left rehab  
in April 1997, included a provision that he not drink or gamble. 
Chairman Ely Callaway offered to send Daly to an addictions 
specialist nearly two weeks ago. Daly got to the undisclosed clinic 
and left. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people were nice,'' Daly told Golf World. ``But it just  
wasn't for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Callaway said he had no choice but to drop Daly, who stood to  
earn about $3 million over the final two years of the contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, Daly was working with Callaway officials in  
Palm Springs when he disappeared. He later said he went to Las 
Vegas, where ``I gambled, had a few pops and had a great time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daly's gambling has been as notorious as his drinking. Callaway  
cleaned up about $1.7 million in gambling debts when it signed Daly 
to a contract. Golf World reported that Daly lost about $500,000 
during his gambling spree in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	After his split with Callaway, Daly said he gambled in a  
riverboat casino in Tunica, Miss., although he says he didn't drink 
alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked by the magazine why he continued to gamble even though he  
lost an estimated $12 million from 1993 to 1996, Daly said, ``I 
love the action. I just love it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daly first went through alcohol rehab at the end of 1992. He won  
the British Open while sober in 1995, but resumed drinking a year 
later. He went on a drinking spree again during The Players 
Championship in 1997, trashed his hotel room and ultimately split 
with his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	Can he avoid that kind of situation this time?  
</P>
<P>
	``Honestly? Probably not,'' Daly told Golf World. ``I want to  
gamble and I want to have a few drinks now and then. Basically, it 
(trying to stay sober) had taken over my life, and I was miserable. 
It's like I've said before, there's no way I'd never drink again.''

<HEADLINE> Hearing Date Set for Boxer Vargas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP) -- A preliminary hearing date of Nov.  
3 was set Thursday for unbeaten International Boxing Federation 
junior middleweight champion Fernando Vargas and four others who 
face assault charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Vargas, 21, and the others are charged with assault with a  
deadly weapon and conspiracy to commit a crime stemming from a July 
25 altercation at a home in Summerland, located just outside Santa 
Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
	Conviction could carry a prison term of almost eight years.  
</P>
<P>
	``Basically, everyone appeared in court today -- all the lawyers,  
all the defendants -- and the hearing date was set,'' deputy 
district attorney Hilary Dozer said. 
</P>
<P>
	The hearing will be held in Superior Court before judge Joseph  
Lodge. 
</P>
<P>
	The men are accused of beating Doug Rossi, 23, who broke up a  
fight between Vargas and a woman's ex-boyfriend at her apartment. 
Vargas claimed he was out of the room when the alleged assault took 
place. 
</P>
<P>
	Vargas, from Oxnard, Calif., has maintained his innocence.  
</P>
<P>
	``On Nov. 3, the judge will be able to evaluate the evidence  
which will be presented to support the charges, and if he feels 
there is enough evidence, the matter will be shortly thereafter set 
for trial,'' Dozer said. ``I believe the evidence which will be 
heard at the hearing will generate a sufficient reason for the case 
to eventually be tried by a jury here in Santa Barbara.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Charged along with Vargas are his cousin, Ernesto Vargas, 27;  
Carlos Lopez, 28; Freddie Flores, 21, and Vincent Arenas, 20. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight days before the incident, Vargas improved his record to  
17-0, with 17 knockouts, by successfully defending his title 
against Raul Marquez.

<HEADLINE> Hornets Owner Won't Be Charged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YORK, S.C. (AP) -- Charlotte Hornets owner George Shinn, accused  
by a woman of sexual assault at his suburban home, no longer risks 
criminal charges after a grand jury chose not to indict him 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel as comfortable with this decision that it wasn't a  
whitewash, wasn't a railroad one way or another,'' prosecutor Tommy 
Pope said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pope originally said in November 1997 that there was not enough  
evidence to charge Shinn. Since then, however, there have been new 
revelations, including a former Hornets cheerleader who said Shinn 
coerced her into a two-year sexual relationship by threatening her 
job, so Pope sent the case to the grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
	He said it took an investigator 3 1/2 hours to present the case and  
about an hour for the grand jury, which meets in secret, to decide 
against indicting Shinn. 
</P>
<P>
	After the announcement, Leslie Price, who accused Shinn of the  
assault at his Tega Cay home, said she was disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I fought for two years and I may not have done the smartest  
things, but I did the right things,'' she said. She would not 
answer questions. Her North Carolina lawyer, David Bland, did not 
return phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
	Her South Carolina lawyer, Dick Harpootlian, said he had  
withdrawn from the case, but wouldn't say why. 
</P>
<P>
	Price thanked her supporters and said ``I pray, justice is going  
to be served at some point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pope wouldn't say why grand jurors didn't indict Shinn. Maybe  
``the same factors that gave me so much trouble were the same that 
kept this so nebulous'' for them, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Pope said he thought that ``something did in fact  
transpire'' between Shinn and Price at the lakeside Tega Cay house, 
but there wasn't enough evidence to make a case. 
</P>
<P>
	Price still has a lawsuit pending in Columbia scheduled for a  
Dec. 6 retrial. The first trial last week was disrupted by 
Hurricane Floyd. Shinn was focusing on that and on the upcoming NBA 
season, his lawyer, Bill Diehl, said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're delighted that once and for all, it's behind us,'' Diehl  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking forward to trying the civil case unencumbered by  
the previous threat that she constantly pounded us with,'' that 
Shinn could face criminal charges, the lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pope said he wanted to get the case to the grand jurors so they  
could rule without a civil trial to influence them. 
</P>
<P>
	Price, who was in a drug- and alcohol-treatment center outside  
Charlotte, N.C., at the time, said she met Shinn in September 1997 
through a man who identified himself as Shinn's nephew. 
</P>
<P>
	She alleged that Shinn lured her to his suburban lake home on  
the premise of meeting Diehl to discuss her legal problems, but 
Diehl was not there and once at the house Shinn forced her to give 
him oral sex. Shinn has denied that and has a slander lawsuit 
against her pending in North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	He has since been divorced by his wife, has moved to Florida and  
has made a deal to sell as much as half of the Hornets to Atlanta 
businessman Ray Wooldridge.

<HEADLINE> Firefighters Battle Calif. Fires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BIG SUR, Calif. (AP) -- Firefighters battling lightning-sparked  
wildfires near the scenic Big Sur coast are taking pains to 
minimize ecological damage from blazes that have consumed 33,000 
acres. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there's an area that has one of the few native plants left,  
they're going to try to go around it,'' Tony Akin of the California 
Department of Forestry said Wednesday. ``It's the same thing with 
animals. If there's any way we can possibly not disturb them, we 
try that way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters credited scattered thunderstorms with helping them  
battle two clusters of Big Sur-area fires Wednesday. Dozens of 
people, including a band of monks, have been forced to flee areas 
near the fires in the remote Los Padres National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
	Fires burning in canyons still threatened to climb over a ridge  
and onto the New Camaldoli Monastery, where three caretakers defied 
an evacuation order. Fires in the area were 20 percent contained 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Clear skies and light winds were predicted today. A high  
pressure system was expected to bring drier conditions over the 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	About 200 miles north of San Francisco in Trinity County,  
firefighters battling wildfires that have consumed 51,707 acres 
also were aided by weather conditions. Although it remained hot and 
dry, much of the smoke had cleared out. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Gray Davis has declared a State of Emergency for the county  
because of the fires, touched off by lightning in August.

<HEADLINE> Hurricanes Get Scheduling Breather </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Miami is one top 10 team that can't be  
accused of a soft early schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	The ninth-ranked Hurricanes (2-1) have already played No. 2 Penn  
State and No. 13 Ohio State, with top-ranked Florida State waiting 
in the wings next weekend before heading into Big East Conference 
play. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami's breather between playing the nation's top two teams is  
East Carolina on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Some breather.  
</P>
<P>
	The Pirates, who play in Conference USA, are off to a 3-0 start  
and have given the Hurricanes trouble in the past. In fact, East 
Carolina rolled over Miami 31-6 in the Orange Bowl in 1996 -- a 
season in which the Hurricanes finished 9-3 and 14th in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	``They lost to Penn State in a heartbreaker, then they got  
Florida State after us, so I don't think they're going to worry too 
much about us,'' East Carolina running back Jamie Wilson said. 
``They know we're 3-0, but they really don't respect the way we 
play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miami coach Butch Davis is hoping his team doesn't underestimate  
the Pirates, who have allowed a total of 12 points in their last 
two wins over Duke and South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have got to minimize both the Ohio State game and the Penn  
State game,'' Davis said. ``We've had way too many turnovers 
offensively and the big picture for this season for us, unless we 
expect to have an awful lot of frustrating Saturdays, we've got to 
minimize the mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of times the best teams don't necessarily win and the  
team that generally makes the fewest amount of mistakes has a great 
opportunity to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis doesn't favor this year's schedule of five non-conference  
games to open the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``The big picture is that we hopefully will be a better football  
team for having played a team like Penn State and help the football 
program continue to grow and get better,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't necessarily like playing five non-conference games and  
then playing all your conference games at the end of the season. 
It's the way the schedule turns out and we'll just have to deal 
with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At least Miami caught one break this weekend. The game has been  
moved 80 miles west to Raleigh from the East Carolina campus in 
Greenville because of flooding from Hurricane Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't help,'' East Carolina coach Steve Logan said when  
asked about the game being moved to N.C. State's Carter-Finley 
Stadium. ``We're going to be on the road. We lost a home game, so 
to speak. But I'm really glad we're playing the game, I didn't want 
to lose the game, that would have been a disaster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pirates have also been stuck in Columbia, S.C., all week,  
meaning practice time and space has been limited. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't get on schedule, we have to condense everything  
inside that small facility,'' (South Carolina's indoor practice 
field), Logan said. ``We just really can't punt and our kicking 
game is really suffering. There's not enough room to get their 
individual drill work done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Logan also noticed another trend with his team this week.  
</P>
<P>
	``For some strange reason everyone's tired. I guess because we  
have to move around, move around, move around, get on the bus, I 
guess it takes a bit of a toll,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Angry Cruise Passengers Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PALMETTO, Fla. (AP) -- No running water, raw sewage floating in  
the halls and a fire on the ship. It's hardly the dream vacation 
passengers expected when they boarded a Carnival Cruise Line ship. 
</P>
<P>
	Passengers on Carnival's 660-foot Tropicale say they endured a  
weeklong nightmare after an engine fire left the vessel stranded in 
the Gulf of Mexico as Tropical Storm Harvey swept through. 
</P>
<P>
	As they finally disembarked from the ship Wednesday, some  
accused Carnival of trying to cover up what happened. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right before the Coast Guard got on board, (cruise officials)  
opened all the bars, they started all the music, they filled all 
the pools, they started replacing the carpet, fixing the toilets 
and they were putting up brand new fire extinguishers that never 
existed,'' said Beth Haynie of Clinton, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
	A Carnival executive, however, denied the allegations and said  
the cruise line tried its best to accommodate passengers during the 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``We understand that a lot of our guests were very frustrated by  
this,'' spokesman Tim Gallagher said. ``Once that fire occurred, 
our objective was to return our guests to Tampa in a safe and 
secure way with a minimum of inconvenience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 1,700 passengers and crew left Tampa a week ago on what  
was supposed to be a four-day cruise with stops in Key West and 
Cozumel, Mexico. The fire on Sunday was extinguished quickly but 
temporarily left the ship without power. 
</P>
<P>
	Passengers reported panic during the fire and complained they  
received little direction from the crew and were confused about 
where to assemble. 
</P>
<P>
	``People were running around like maniacs,'' said David Rizzo, a  
U.S. Airways employee from Clearwater. 
</P>
<P>
	Gallagher said despite the fire, cabins had drinking water, air  
conditioning and electricity, and most had working toilets. But 
passengers painted a different picture. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Haynie was one of many who complained of scarce drinking  
water, and taps either without water or spewing dark gray fluid. 
Plumbing problems were said to have started even before the fire. 
Some passengers videotaped their troubles. 
</P>
<P>
	Rizzo said there was no running water in toilets and sinks for  
some time, and raw sewage overflowed into hallways. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was horrible,'' Rizzo said. ``I've never seen stuff like  
that in my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The cruise line has promised all passengers a full refund, a  
free ticket for a future cruise and paid for new flights home.

<HEADLINE> Ripken To Undergo Back Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- In a year in which Cal Ripken went on the  
disabled list for the first time in his career, back surgery will 
end his season early and delay his pursuit of 3,000 hits. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken, nine hits shy of 3,000, was scheduled for back surgery  
today at University Hospitals in Cleveland and will miss the final 
12 games for the Baltimore Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel bad that Cal's hurt because I wanted him to get 3,000,  
but he'll get it next year,'' Baltimore Orioles manager Ray Miller 
said Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	University Hospitals of Cleveland spokeswoman Eileen Korey  
confirmed that Ripken was being prepared for surgery this morning 
at about 10 a.m., and she said the surgery would likely last two to 
three hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken visited specialist Dr. Henry Bohlman on Wednesday after  
experiencing back spasms overnight. The surgery will relieve 
pressure on a nerve that has been causing him pain. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is in a lot of discomfort and felt that it was time to get  
it done,'' general manager Frank Wren said. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball's Iron Man, who played in 2,632 straight games before  
voluntarily ending the streak a year ago, twice was placed on the 
DL this season because of back pain. 
</P>
<P>
	``You expect him to come back and play well because of who he  
is,'' teammate Mike Timlin said. ``It says a lot about the guy that 
he went this long without surgery. You see a guy in pain and yet 
continue to play at the level he was, you admire that. He's an iron 
guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 39-year-old Ripken, whose career began in 1981, went on the  
disabled list on April 20 because of a bad back, missing three 
weeks. He was again forced out of action after experiencing more 
back pain Aug. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``To have it reoccur was disappointing and frustrating. I was  
down for a long time,'' he said recently. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken returned on Sept. 1 and hit his 400th career homer the  
next day. He has since been on a binge at the plate, upping his 
batting average to a career-high .340. 
</P>
<P>
	He appeared on his way to joining Tony Gwynn and Wade Boggs this  
year as members of the 3,000-hit club. It would have been the first 
time three players reached the milestone in the same season. 
</P>
<P>
	Getting there this year was not a priority for Ripken, who has  
always put team goals ahead of personal accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
	``If 3,000 hits happen, it happens. But it hasn't been a goal to  
do it in a certain period of time and it hasn't been a goal to do 
it in a certain year,'' he said the night he hit his 400th homer. 
``You just play, and things happen when they happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But because the Orioles long ago fell out of playoff contention,  
Ripken didn't have much to play for except personal goals --

<HEADLINE> Las Vegas Y2K Celebration Will Cost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Talk about no room at the inn.  
</P>
<P>
	Some 750,000 partygoers are expected to pour into Las Vegas this  
New Year's Eve to ring in the new millennium. Problem is, the city 
only has 120,000 hotel rooms, and many of those are going for 
thousands of dollars a night -- rates unimaginable other times of 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, nearly everything in Vegas that night -- from concerts  
to air fare -- might require a lot of luck at the gambling tables. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's all accelerated because of the demand. That's kind of the  
American way,'' said Mark Paris, president of the Fremont Street 
Experience, a downtown attraction. 
</P>
<P>
	Caesars Palace will be charging $2,000 a night, with a  
four-night minimum, or $3,500 a night with a three-night minimum. 
Rooms there usually are between $125 and $500. Bellagio, one of the 
newer hotels, will charge $2,000 a night, with a three-night 
minimum -- up from the $129 a night some rooms go for on less 
festive nights. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the family-oriented, usually affordable Circus Circus is  
bumping its room rates from about $39 a night to $450 with a 
four-night minimum. 
</P>
<P>
	Many hotels are already sold out for New Year's Eve, but that  
isn't likely to deter tourists from spending the holiday in this 
gambling mecca. This year's crowd estimate is almost double the 
number of people who came here to ring in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who don't get a hotel room probably won't sleep at all.  
</P>
<P>
	Las Vegas isn't alone in its outrageous prices. Hotels in other  
millennial hot spots such as New York, Los Angeles, New Orleans and 
Honolulu are also upping their rates. 
</P>
<P>
	At the New York Hilton and Towers, on Sixth Avenue, a standard  
room for Dec. 31 is $550 per night, with a three-night minimum 
stay. A standard room is usually half that. At the Plaza 50 on 50th 
Street, a studio suite that normally rents for $299 a night is $448 
on New Year's Eve, with a four-night minimum stay required. 
</P>
<P>
	``The large urban hotels are offering New Year's Eve revelers  
packages that are commensurable with the kind of entertainment that 
is being offered,'' said Jim Gallagher, spokesman for Starwood 
Hotels and Resorts, which operates the Sheraton and Westin chains. 
``We certainly think that any of Starwood's properties are giving 
their guests real value for their money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The prices for rooms in major cities usually include tickets to  
a concert or some other type of entertainment for New Year's Eve, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Marc Grossman, spokesman for Hilton Hotels Corp., said demand  
for lodging in prime locales is driving prices higher. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rooms are going fast,'' he said. ``The places that you would  
imagine that are New Year's headquarters are going to get premium 
pricing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Back in Las Vegas, just about every concert, party and even the  
airlines are following the hotels' lead. 
</P>
<P>
	The price tag to party downtown under the canopy of the Fremont  
Street Experience block party is $100 -- 10 times what it cost last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``New Year's can get a little bit rowdy. The thinking is that  
the cover charge would keep out some people that may be a little 
bit more rowdy and try to make it a little bit more controllable,'' 
said Dawn Christensen, a city spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	Bally's Las Vegas is offering a ``Time Tunnel'' party for a mere  
$300 ($250 for hotel guests). Pricey yes, but it does include a 
buffet, party hat and a horn. 
</P>
<P>
	Tickets to New Year's Eve concerts with the likes of Elton John,  
Tina Turner, Bette Midler and Rod Stewart cost upwards of $100 and 
most of those shows are already sold out. 
</P>
<P>
	Just getting to the party is costing travelers from the East  
Coast big bucks. They are paying $2,500 to $3,000 for airfare and a 
four-night stay at less ritzy hotels, said Mary Baltodano, a travel 
agent with Creative Travel in Las Vegas. These package trips 
normally cost only several hundred dollars a person. 
</P>
<P>
	Baltodano books them -- with a hint of disgust.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is outrageous. I can't believe people are purchasing  
them,'' Ms. Baltodano said. 
</P>
<P>
	While clearly some don't mind paying inflated prices to revel in  
happening places, to others it seems a bit frivolous. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't make enough money to blow it like that,'' Janis  
Anderson, 43, of San Antonio, Texas, said as she dropped quarters 
into a slot machine at the Las Vegas Hilton.

<HEADLINE> `George' Cover Marks JFK Jr. Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The latest George magazine -- a tribute to  
founder John F. Kennedy Jr. -- is without a celebrity cover for the 
first time. 
</P>
<P>
	The October issue, which comes two months after Kennedy's death,  
has a blurry image of the American flag. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue contains several interviews Kennedy did, including  
Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrahkan, Fidel Castro and President 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The magazine quotes Kennedy as saying: ``In the most challenging  
of times, men and women of courage and conviction make a 
difference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy, his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and sister-in-law  
Lauren Bessette died in July when the plane he was piloting crashed 
off the shore of Martha's Vineyard.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Ryder Cup Team Wants Cheers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROOKLINE, Mass. (AP) -- On the eve of the last Ryder Cup in  
Spain, Tom Kite gathered his team together and urged them to keep 
things quiet. 
</P>
<P>
	Let the crowd into the matches, he warned, and the cup is lost.  
</P>
<P>
	``If it starts going their way and they start feeding off their  
fans roaring all over the golf course, it's going to kill us,'' 
Kite said. 
</P>
<P>
	Just the opposite holds true beginning Friday at The Country  
Club, where it will be the Europeans trying to keep the noise down 
and the U.S. team hoping to ride the cheers of the crowd to 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Ryder Cup, momentum is important, and the reaction of the  
approximately 35,000 spectators who line the fairways this week 
could spell the difference in who wins the cup Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``If things get quiet, we're going to be in trouble,'' Davis  
Love III said. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike most golf tournaments, the crowd plays a big part in the  
Ryder Cup, where national pride can be at stake outside the ropes 
just as much as it is inside. 
</P>
<P>
	The roaring throngs can't make putts or hit long drives, but  
they can help change the momentum of the matches. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's all the crowds out there that are just going bananas  
for one team or another, and you feel their desire and you feel the 
desire of your teammates,'' Tom Lehman said. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton is expected to be part of that crowd Sunday,  
and the king and queen of Spain will be on hand to cheer for the 
Europeans. 
</P>
<P>
	The noises that roll across the hilly fairways of The Country  
Club will be so unmistakable that players won't need a scoreboard 
to figure out what is going on. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's going to be cheers for the Europeans, but the cheers  
for the Americans are going to be a lot louder,'' Payne Stewart 
said. ``So, if you're playing in a match and you hear a big cheer 
behind you, you're going to know who it's for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Justin Leonard found that out at Valderrama where he hit a poor  
shot on the first tee, and heard the crowd cheer. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's something you don't hear too much on a golf course,''  
Leonard said. ``It can be intimidating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Europeans discovered that in 1991 at Kiawah Island, S.C.,  
where boisterous fans chanted ``USA, USA'' and acted so badly that 
even some of the American players were embarrassed. 
</P>
<P>
	Scotland's Colin Montgomerie, a Ryder Cup rookie that year,  
might have had that in mind at the U.S. Open last year, when fans 
heckled him briefly. 
</P>
<P>
	``Save it for the Ryder Cup,'' Montgomerie said.  
</P>
<P>
	Montgomerie is a player Americans love to hate, though he played  
the 1995 Ryder Cup at Oak Hill in Rochester, N.Y., without problems 
and expects the same this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't foresee any problems this week,'' Montgomerie said.  
</P>
<P>
	Teammate Darren Clarke agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``What hostile crowd?'' Clarke said. ``Who said the crowd was  
going to be hostile?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Europeans might want to heed the words of 1997 team member  
Scott Hoch, who was paired with Jeff Maggert against Nick Faldo and 
Lee Westwood at Valderrama. 
</P>
<P>
	On the first tee, the crowd was cheering the European team and  
heckling the Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said, `You guys aren't used to this, but I'm used to people  
rooting against me every week on the PGA Tour,' '' Maggert said. 
``It took the nerves out of the day and we had a great day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Tiger Woods, having a home crowd is long overdue.  
</P>
<P>
	Woods played on his first Ryder Cup team in Spain, and has  
played the Presidents Cup in Australia, the Eisenhower Cup in 
France and the Walker Cup in Wales. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nice to have some fans cheering for us for some good  
shots,'' Woods said. ``I don't have to hear boos all day.''

<HEADLINE> Ryder Cup Ceremony Unique for Golf  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROOKLINE, Mass. (AP) -- They don't have opening ceremonies for  
the Masters or the U.S. Open. They may call them ``majors,'' but 
they are major only in comparison to other golf tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
	No, they save the pomp and ceremony for the international events  
of Olympic proportions. And when the bagpipes and brass bands come 
out to play, spectators and contestants alike know that they're in 
for something special. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is unlikely that Samuel Ryder could have envisioned that  
his endowment of a gold chalice could grow into what we have here 
this week,'' PGA of America president Will Mann said as the Ryder 
Cup opened Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	With bagpipes and brass, classic rock and a crooner, flybys and  
flag-raisings and six national anthems -- for competitors from 
France, Ireland, Spain, Sweden, Britain and the United States -- the 
33rd Ryder Cup matches opened with the extravagance befitting an 
event that has become the biggest in golf. 
</P>
<P>
	After playing their final practice round in the morning, the  
golfers left the course in the hands of Glenn Frey -- the first 
Eagle of the tournament -- who started things with a concert spiced 
with songs by his former band. 
</P>
<P>
	With an hour-long concert, Frey entertained the throngs that  
filled three sets of bleachers and crowded the practice range 
fairway under sunny, blue skies that rescued the third day of 
practice from Wednesday's rain. If The Country Club has ever rocked 
before -- and it's quite possible that the staid and stodgy site 
never has -- it has certainly never rocked like this. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, it seemed more fitting with the club's tradition-bound  
image when a video montage of Ryder Cups past, as well as clips 
from the current players' careers, played on the giant video 
screen, accompanied by Frank Sinatra's ``Here's to the Winners.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like the rest of those who came to the podium, the PGA president  
stressed the tradition of sportsmanship in golf's biggest event, 
rather than the stress of the competition that has been known to 
make the players' knees buckle from tee to green. 
</P>
<P>
	In her invocation, The Right Rev. Barbara Harris noted that  
victory was a secondary goal. 
</P>
<P>
	``May all bogeys, birdies and eagles remind us, contestants and  
spectators alike, that in this competition ... all can be winners, 
no matter the score,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a procession worthy of any of the ivy-covered colleges that  
dot New England, the teams marched in side by side, wearing 
matching suits -- navy blue for the Europeans and gray for the 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	After European captain Mark James introduced his squad, U.S.  
captain Ben Crenshaw did the same, deviating from the program only 
to introduce five past U.S. Ryder Cup captains in the crowd, from 
1965 leader Byron Nelson to Tom Kite, who led the Americans to a 
surprising defeat in '97. 
</P>
<P>
	Crenshaw then turned to the visitors, who are looking to win  
their third consecutive Cup, and welcomed them ``in the spirit of 
what Samuel Ryder started.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``And I hope that spirit never dies,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> European Bank Leaves Rates Unchanged </HEADLINE>

	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- The European Central Bank left its key  
lending rate unchanged at 2.5 percent on Thursday.

only change since taking over monetary policy for the euro bloc.

<HEADLINE> Croatian Telecom Receives Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) -- A Scandinavian company, Telia-Telenor,  
appeared to be the sole bidder Thursday for a 35 percent stake in 
Croatia's Telecom, the country's only telecommunications firm and 
its most important privatization target yet. 
</P>
<P>
	Deutsche Telekom, the only other company that had been expected  
to make an offer, failed to submit its bid by Thursday's deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	The government now has seven days to accept or reject the bid by  
Telia-Telenor, which offered $611 million for the stake. 
</P>
<P>
	The government will make further consultations before reaching a  
decision, said Igor Mrduljas, a government spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	According to independent newspaper reports, Deutsche Telekom had  
unsuccessfully requested an extension of the deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	Media reports had speculated the government would change the  
deadline to accomodate the Germans, who have close ties with the 
Croats. 
</P>
<P>
	Telia-Telenor's bid came in well below reports earlier this year  
that the whole company might be worth up to $3 billion. More 
recently, there was speculation that Deutsche Telekom considered 
offering about $800 million for the stake.

<HEADLINE> Senate Limits Oil-Royalties Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) Republicans and a handful of Democrats broke a  
logjam today on a proposal that would block the Interior Department 
from revamping the way it collects royalties on oil and gas taken 
from federal land. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate voted 60-39 to limit debate, clearing the way for a  
vote on an amendment by Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, that 
would prevent the rule change for another year. 
</P>
<P>
	With debate concluded, Hutchison said she was certain of the  
majority needed to put the provision into a $14 billion Interior 
spending bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil-state senators argued that Interior's proposal would force  
the oil companies to pay millions of dollars more in royalty fees 
for oil pumped from federal land or offshore at a time when the 
industry already is facing economic problems. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., had blocked consideration of  
the Hutchison proposal for more than a week, threatening to 
filibuster the bill unless the amendment was withdrawn. Under 
Senate rules it takes 60 votes to limit debate. 
</P>
<P>
	Boxer had argued that oil companies have for years engaged ``in  
a scheme to essentially rob the treasury of millions upon millions 
of dollars'' by undervaluing the federal oil. 
</P>
<P>
	``This allows the oil companies to continue this cozy  
arrangement where they decide what they're going to pay the federal 
government,'' said Boxer. 
</P>
<P>
	The government collects about $1.2 billion a year from the 12.5  
percent royalty fee. The Interior Department has estimated that oil 
companies are underpaying by as much as $68 million a year because 
of the way the companies value the oil they pump. 
</P>
<P>
	The Interior proposal, which would peg the oil to the market  
price, has been in limbo for two years because Congress barred the 
department from implementing the new rules in 1998 and again this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchison said the proposed changes will harm independent oil  
companies already reeling from economic hard times. She has 
characterized the higher fees as a tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John Breaux, D-La., said the yearlong moratorium would give  
Interior and the industry time to continue negotiations and ``find 
out what the fair market value (of oil) really is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to all 55 Republicans, five Democrats voted to shut  
off debate and consider the amendment. They were Sens. Jeff 
Bingaman of New Mexico, Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, Blanche Lincoln 
of Arkansas, Daniel Inouye of Hawaii and Breaux.

<HEADLINE> CDC: Immunization Rates Reach High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The immunization rate among America's toddlers  
climbed to an all-time high of 80.6 percent last year, the 
government said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The rate is the percentage of youngsters 19 months to 35 months  
old who have had the complete series of recommended vaccinations 
for diphtheria/tetanus, polio and measles. The diphtheria/tetanus 
vaccine is given in four shots, while polio vaccine is administered 
in three doses. 
</P>
<P>
	The immunization rate has been steadily climbing since 1995,  
when it was 76.2 percent, according to the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is wonderful news, and we've seen with that a record or  
near-record lows in vaccine-preventable diseases,'' said Dr. Walter 
A. Orenstein, director of the CDC's National Immunization Program. 
</P>
<P>
	``But each day, we start at zero with 11,000 babies born that  
have to complete the series of immunizations. We have to keep this 
message out because we are tested every day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Orenstein said that the 20 percent of children not immunized are

<HEADLINE>  Rescuers Battle Clock in Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- As cries for help increasingly turned to  
ominous silence, rescue teams battled the clock today to save 
nearly 2,000 trapped and missing victims of Taiwan's devastating 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 60 hours after the earthquake struck, at least 2,103  
people were known dead, 7,800 injured and 1,844 still unaccounted 
for -- the vast majority of whom were believed buried under rubble 
and landslides, the Disaster Management Center said. 
</P>
<P>
	The center said 2,268 people had been rescued, many of them  
extracted from some 6,000 completely destroyed housing units across 
the island. 
</P>
<P>
	Local newspapers said several hundred thousand people were  
homeless but this could not be officially confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tuesday temblor had a preliminary magnitude of 7.6 -- about  
the same strength as the devastating tremor that killed more than 
15,000 people in Turkey last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Although many people were still trapped in buildings,  
Wednesday's rescue efforts yielded only nine who were safely 
brought out, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	And in some isolated, mountain villages of central Taiwan, the  
worst-hit region of the island, rescue efforts have just begun. 
</P>
<P>
	Rescuers had to walk for hours through rugged terrain Wednesday  
to reach the village of Kuoshin, where a massive flow of mud and 
rock off three hillsides killed 60 villagers and buried 40 others, 
the China Times reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 50 people, a third of the population, are known to have  
survived as the hills virtually collapsed and filled up a valley, 
the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	One mother, identified as Mrs. Chang, said she and her two  
daughters were carried along on the slide for a half-mile ``as if 
sitting on a magic carpet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The village is located in Nantou County, where 830 people were  
killed, while more than 970 died in neighboring Taichung County. 
</P>
<P>
	These two hardest-hit counties are to receive the bulk of $90  
million the government says it has allocated for immediate disaster 
relief. 
</P>
<P>
	The Taiwanese government said today it will spend $32 million to  
build 2,000 temporary homes to shelter homeless earthquake victims 
-- with an ambitious deadline of three weeks to get the job done. 
</P>
<P>
	Many people have complained that not enough was done to rescue  
trapped relatives. Some people have stood outside wrecked 
buildings, listening in vain to cries from trapped friends and 
family. In many cases, the screams have faded into silence. 
</P>
<P>
	Inspecting damage in the town of Touliu, President Lee Teng-hui  
was confronted by an angry woman who asked for a full investigation 
into why the building where her elderly in-laws were trapped had 
collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
	``My parents are in there. They are dead,'' she told Lee. ``If  
we don't pay attention to these problems, it's going to happen 
again and again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The woman, who gave her name only as Liao, said her family  
rushed back from Los Angeles, where they reside, as soon as the 
earthquake struck to be with her in-laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Many high-rises were left partially toppled in the quake,  
leaning over in bizarre angles against other structures -- perhaps 
the result of stout construction on top of a weak foundation, 
rescue teams said. 
</P>
<P>
	Engineers and seismologists from around the world are flying to  
Taiwan to find out why some buildings failed while others survived 
the quake. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Geller, a professor of geophysics at Tokyo University,  
said that weak, wide open spaces on the ground floor can leave an 
entire building very vulnerable to the kind of potent, sideways 
motion generated by earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
	The ground floor of many collapsed buildings may have been very  
weak structurally because of the presence of a garage or a shop, 
Geller said. 
</P>
<P>
	A contractor was arrested Wednesday in connection with the  
collapse of three buildings he built in Touliu, a prosecutor said. 
In Taipei county the assets of a building company were reported 
frozen on similar grounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The Health Department warned of possible epidemics from lack of  
water and improper care of corpses. With morgues overflowing, 
medics have been forced to lay bodies on the floors of hospitals 
and community centers. 
</P>
<P>
	Water shortages were predicted for the island's third-largest  
city, Taichung, after the quake ruptured a section of the Shihkang 
Reservoir. Water was streaming through the opening in the dam, said 
the United Daily News. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are just trying to bring peace and calm back into these  
people's lives,'' said Miao Yun, leading a group of Buddhist nuns 
and monks through Taichung's largest hospital where 100 people were 
being treated. 
</P>
<P>
	The group, dressed in yellow and gray robes, gave out  
wooden-beaded prayer bracelets and prayed over bodies of battered 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Rescue efforts were hampered Wednesday when three strong  
aftershocks rocked the island, forcing emergency workers to move 
back from collapsed structures where they were trying to save as 
many lives as possible. 
</P>
<P>
	Assisting hard-pressed local teams were more than 500  
specialists from 14 countries, the United Nations and the 
International Red Cross. Fifty sniffer dogs accompanied some of the 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
	China, which has not wavered from its goal of annexing Taiwan,  
offered condolences and aid to quake victims. 
</P>
<P>
	The fresh jolts triggered massive mudslides and cracked Sun Moon  
Lake Reservoir, one of Taiwan's largest dams and a prime tourist 
attraction. Restaurants and temples set amid mountains were 
reportedly destroyed or severely damaged.

<HEADLINE> Historic Casino Faces Demolition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RENO, Nev. (AP) -- The National Trust for Historic Preservation  
has not lost a major fight for a structure since it started listing 
the most endangered buildings and places in America in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	But a demolition date for one of the most historic casinos, the  
Mapes Hotel in Reno, and fading hopes for Tiger Stadium in Detroit, 
one of the oldest major league ballparks, have the nonprofit 
group's leaders fearing the worst. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've never lost one on our list and now we have two that are  
at very great risk,'' said Richard Moe, president of the 
50-year-old national trust based in Washington, D.C. ``I suppose it 
was inevitable we'd lose one at some point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mapes, a 12-story brick building built in 1947 on the banks  
of the Truckee River, was the first in the nation to house a hotel, 
a casino and other entertainment under one roof. Its art deco style 
earned it a listing on the National Register of Historic Places in 
1984. 
</P>
<P>
	During its heyday in the '50s and '60s, entertainers such as  
Sammy Davis Jr., Mae West and the Marx Brothers headlined there. 
But since 1982, the Mapes has sat boarded up and vacant, much to 
the chagrin of city officials who view the property as key to the 
city's downtown redevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
	Local preservationists have fought three years to save the  
Mapes. They suffered their biggest setback earlier this month when 
the City Council approved a $1 million contract to demolish the 
building in February. 
</P>
<P>
	``This would be a tragic loss not just for Reno but to the  
country. It is a very significant building,'' Moe said. 
</P>
<P>
	Like the Mapes, Tiger Stadium is on the National Register of  
Historic Places. Its future is less certain. 
</P>
<P>
	The last Tigers game will be played there Sept. 27. They move to  
a new stadium next season. The city government will maintain 
control of Tiger Stadium for at least another year. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaders had hoped to pick a developer by now but extended the  
deadline this week after getting only three partial bids. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is being floated with the understanding it is never going  
to happen,'' Dave Malhalab, a Detroit police officer who has been 
active in the fight to save the stadium, said Wednesday. ``It is 
nothing but a camouflage to the end of Tiger Stadium.''

<HEADLINE>  Sosa Taking Over M.J.'s Restaurant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Move aside, M.J. In this city's gastronomy game,  
Slammin' Sammy is stepping up to the plate. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Jordan's Restaurant will become Sammy Sosa's Restaurant,  
a move prompted by declining sales at the basketball star's eatery 
just north of downtown Chicago, said H. Gene Silverberg, a 
controlling partner in both restaurant ventures. 
</P>
<P>
	But he acknowledged the switch also is related to a rift between  
Jordan and the restaurant's owners. Jordan apparently stopped 
eating at the restaurant after the owners rejected his ideas for 
making it more upscale, Silverberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan's restaurant will be moved to a smaller location early  
next year, Silverberg said. He said sales at Jordan's have slipped 
about 20 percent in the last couple of years, although it remained 
profitable. 
</P>
<P>
	The switch apparently is being made without Jordan's approval;  
Silverberg said he doesn't need it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Michael will respond in court, not through the media,'' Jordan  
attorney Fred Sperling said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan's absence at the restaurant could account for some of the  
decline, Silverberg said. Unlike Jordan, Sosa will be required to 
make appearances when his restaurant opens by the start of next 
baseball season. 
</P>
<P>
	And by all accounts, Sosa is ready to play ball. He donned a  
chef's hat at a news conference Thursday to announce the restaurant 
and even swung a 4-foot-long red fork. Sosa swinging a fork is the 
restaurant's logo. 
</P>
<P>
	``No way would (Jordan) put on that hat,'' Silverberg said  
later. ``Sammy is still playful ... and we need that to make this 
work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For his part, Sosa said he's going to consult with the chefs on  
the Spanish and American menu and has no problem appearing at the 
eatery. 
</P>
<P>
	``One reason I want to do this restaurant is to (thank) people  
from all over the world,'' said Sosa, who admits he can't cook. 
``I've never had a restaurant before. ... People will see me there 
quite often.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa said he had nothing to do with the decision to move  
Jordan's restaurant and called him ``my hero.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He's still the man in my heart,'' Sosa said. ``I love  
Michael.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It is unclear whether it was the food, atmosphere or Jordan's  
departure from basketball that led to the restaurant's decline. 
</P>
<P>
	Food critics said the cuisine, basic ``American comfort food,''  
was nothing to write home about. The decor -- a shrine to Jordan -- 
and gift shop were reminiscent of Planet Hollywood, another 
celebrity-heavy theme restaurant that fell on hard times, said 
Penny Pollack, dining editor at Chicago Magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there is ever a reason to go back unless you had  
an out-of-town guest who really needed to go there,'' Pollack said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lunchtime customers had mixed opinions.  
</P>
<P>
	``I love the Cubs and Sammy, but Michael's an icon in this  
city,'' said former Chicagoan Scott Neururer, 38, who was visiting 
from Los Angeles with his wife and baby. ``It's sad to see anything 
related to Michael go away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But others said Jordan's absence definitely dampened business.  
</P>
<P>
	Johnny ``Red'' Kerr, the Bulls' first coach and a team announcer  
for the past 25 years, said people would crowd the restaurant if 
Jordan ate there. 
</P>
<P>
	``People packed the place when he was there,'' said Kerr, who  
also owned a restaurant for about five years. ``I don't think the 
Jordan mystique is gone.''

<HEADLINE> Merging ComEd Has System Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Plans by Commonwealth Edison's parent company to  
merge with a Pennsylvania utility left some of ComEd's critics 
skeptical that management could both navigate a merger and rebuild 
its teetering electric utility. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is enormous public concern about Commonwealth Edison's  
ability to deliver reliable and effective service in the Chicago 
metro area,'' Howard Learner, executive director of the 
Chicago-based Environmental Law and Policy Center, said Thursday. 
``Clearly this merger will distract management's attention from 
that task.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed merger of Unicom Corp., which owns ComEd, with  
Philadelphia-based PECO Energy Co. would create a company with 5 
million customers in two states, a huge fleet of nuclear reactors 
and a raft of reliability problems in northern Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	``Edison has a big task ahead of it right now to fix all the  
problems with its distribution system, and anything that might 
divert the attention and focus of management away from that is 
cause for concern,'' said Pat Clark, associate director of the 
Citizens Utility Board. 
</P>
<P>
	Unicom's chief executive, John Rowe, has vowed to attack ComEd's  
problems with transmission and distribution ``root and branch.'' He 
said Thursday that a merger would not distract ComEd from that 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will not let that happen,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	About 100,000 customers in Chicago lost electricity during a  
July heat wave. Twice during the summer power went out in the Loop; 
another blackout imperiled the Field Museum of Natural History's 
collection of rare plant and tissue samples. 
</P>
<P>
	These and other scattered blackouts across the city and suburbs  
had many of the utility's 3.4 million customers in northern 
Illinois seething, and politicians clamoring for the company to 
start over from ground zero. 
</P>
<P>
	ComEd has removed two key executives -- its vice president of  
transmission and distribution, and the vice president of 
engineering, construction and maintenance. It also brought in 
transmission and distribution experts from other utilities and 
hired a contractor to help check all the cables and transformers in 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	ComEd earlier promised to pump $3 billion into upgrading the  
system by 2004 -- $1 billion of that in the city of Chicago. That 
promise came as an admission that it had let its transmission 
infrastructure go at the expense of bringing its problem-plagued 
nuclear plants up to speed. 
</P>
<P>
	Learner said he believed the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission  
would ``take a hard look'' at the merger. ComEd is the nation's 
largest nuclear utility and PECO has been buying and refurbishing 
nuclear plants through AmerGen Energy Co., which is purchasing 
Illinois Power's Clinton nuclear plant, the only non-ComEd 
commercial nuclear plant in Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	Jan Strasma, spokesman for the NRC in Lisle, Ill., said the  
commission is required to look at the financial and technical 
qualifications of the new company, but ``since it's really a 
restructuring of two old companies, much of that will not be 
significantly different.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Vetoes GOP Tax Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After weeks of partisan jockeying over taxes,  
President Clinton today vetoed the $792 billion tax cut pushed by 
Republicans and called on Congress to approve ``tax relief we can 
afford'' by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
	The president vetoed the bill at a wooden desk on a stage in the  
White House Rose Garden, before a small audience of Cabinet 
members, advocates for the elderly and others. It was the 26th veto 
of his presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he rejected the tax bill because it would ``turn us  
back to the failed policies of the past'' at a time when the nation 
is enjoying economic prosperity. He said he will seek to work with 
GOP leaders on an alternative tax plan ``that reflects the 
priorities of both parties and the values of the American people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``That would be a good bill I would happily sign,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	But on Capitol Hill, the battle lines were clearly drawn. Rep.  
Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways and Means 
Committee, said that by vetoing the bill, Clinton ``has given 
himself a license to spend, and spend he will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``President Clinton has once again put the needs of Washington  
above the needs of the American people, and that's too bad,'' 
Archer asserted. ``Americans should know that the big blank check 
in Washington is drawn on their checkbook, and they will get stuck 
with the bill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tax bill would have used part of a projected 10-year budget  
surplus to reduce all federal income tax rates by 1 percentage 
point, cut capital-gains taxes, phase out estate taxes and the 
alternative minimum tax and ease the ``marriage penalty'' paid by 
many two-income couples. On nearly party-line votes, it passed in 
the House, 221-206, and in the Senate, 50-49, falling far short of 
the two-thirds majority needed to overturn a veto. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said such an ambitious tax cut reflected misplaced  
priorities -- salvaging Social Security and Medicare should come 
first, he insisted. He also said it would absorb so much of the 
projected budget surpluses that federal programs from national 
parks to education could suffer deep, debilitating cuts. He has 
instead proposed cutting taxes by up to $300 billion, and called on 
Congress to work with him on a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bill is too big, too bloated, places too big a burden on  
America's economy,'' Clinton said. ``I ask Congress not to go home 
until we have worked together once again. We can work together to 
pass tax relief we can afford.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a recent letter to Clinton, Senate Majority Leader Trent  
Lott, R-Miss., and House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., denied the 
tax cut would hurt entitlement programs and raised the prospect 
that surpluses would be used to ``pay for other Washington 
spending.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Sept. 15, the day the tax plan was delivered to the  
president, Vice President Al Gore -- who is pursuing the Democratic 
presidential nomination -- declared it ``dead on arrival at the 
White House.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Polls have consistently shown that tax cuts are not as important  
to voters as saving Social Security or strengthening Medicare. Many 
polls show that up to half of Americans believe the GOP tax cut 
would mainly benefit the wealthy. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Charles Rangel of New York, ranking Democrat on the House  
Ways and Means Committee, said the political nature of the tax bill 
was ultimately its downfall. 
</P>
<P>
	``They never drafted a tax bill. Really, it was a political  
statement drafted to mobilize people and support for Republicans in 
the House and Senate,'' Rangel said. ``They know you have to 
negotiate a bill of that size. They never wanted to negotiate it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Internal Revenue Service is urging Republicans to  
move quickly if they plan to extend several expiring tax provisions 
so forms can be drafted for the 2000 filing season. 
</P>
<P>
	IRS Commissioner Charles Rossotti told Archer at a meeting  
Wednesday that tax law changes effective for next year should be on 
the president's desk by Oct. 7. 
</P>
<P>
	Archer said he hoped to move forward on a tax package -- possibly  
as early as Friday -- that would extend several expiring provisions 
at a one-year cost of roughly $3 billion. These ``extenders'' were 
part of the larger $792 billion tax cut, but unlike that bill they 
have broad bipartisan support.

<HEADLINE>  Misery in N.C.After Floyd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINDSOR, N.C. (AP) -- The soggy devastation left by Hurricane  
Floyd hit hard for Robin Ray as she realized it was her son Joey's 
15th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He doesn't have anything,'' she said. ``It just doesn't seem  
right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Their home was destroyed when the Cashie River spilled over its  
banks after 20 inches of rain fell during last week's storm. 
Furniture and carpets were ruined and have been hauled off to the 
dump. 
</P>
<P>
	State Sen. Marc Basnight gave Ms. Ray a hug Wednesday and  
promised: ``It's going to be better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Basnight was among a group of legislators touring eastern North  
Carolina, where Floyd has created the worst disaster in state 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	The misery includes rivers fouled by human waste, hog waste and  
debris of all kinds; a wrecked shrimp harvest; farm losses expected 
to exceed $1 billion; and millions in uninsured home and car 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 42 people in North Carolina have been killed. The  
latest victim was a National Guardsman killed when his vehicle 
overturned late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Altogether, the storm killed at least 70 people from the Bahamas  
to New England -- and that toll is expected to rise once floodwaters 
recede. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no doubt there are individuals out there who were  
swept off roadways and whose bodies have not been recovered,'' said 
Dr. John Butts, the state's chief medical examiner. 
</P>
<P>
	About 3,100 people remain in shelters, though some in Rocky  
Mount and Greenville have moved into camping trailers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We lost everything we had, but we've still got our health and  
now we've got a place to stay,'' said Carolyn Whitehead of 
Greenville, who moved into one of the trailers with her husband and 
four children. ``I just want to take a hot bath.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But for many others, the problems continue. Statewide, officials  
estimate at least 100,000 hogs, 2.4 million chickens and 500,000 
turkeys drowned. Early estimates of crop and farm structure losses 
totaled $333 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The threat of disease from rotting carcasses led state officials  
to send portable incinerators into counties with the most extensive 
livestock deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd wiped out the prized breeding operation that Allen McCoy,  
57, and his cousin Phillip, 65, built from the ground up, killing 
more than 3,000 hogs. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is sweat and blood you're talking about,'' said McCoy,  
who estimated his losses at more than $500,000 from flooding on the 
Trent River. ``I've lost basically what I've worked for the last 40 
years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, volunteers from the Emergency Animal Rescue Service  
continued their efforts to save hundreds of pets left behind as 
their owners evacuated. Volunteers have rescued 260 animals, mostly 
dogs, says Terri Crisp, director of EARS, part of the nonprofit 
United Animal Network advocacy group. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've seen dogs swimming out to boats, almost literally jumping  
into the boats,'' said Crisp, who has responded to about 40 
disasters, including fires, earthquakes and tornadoes. ``One almost 
licked me to death, he was so happy just to have human 
companionship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Damage from Floyd is expected to surpass the $6 billion cost  
caused by Hurricane Fran in 1996. Gov. Jim Hunt scheduled a trip to 
Washington today to lobby for more federal money. 
</P>
<P>
	Farther south, in Conway, S.C., officials say rising floodwaters  
are threatening to wipe out parts of Highway 90, cutting off 
thousands of people between Conway and North Myrtle Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	``If these three places flood, we will have islands of people  
out there,'' said acting Horry County administrator Danny Knight. 
</P>
<P>
	The Waccamaw River was expected to crest close at about 17 feet  
-- about 10 feet above flood stage -- this week. State transportation 
officials said they expect to complete work on a dike by Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In hard-hit New Jersey, about 6,000 people had applied for  
relief grants to the Federal Emergency Management Agency by 
Wednesday, said agency spokeswoman Carol Hector-Harris. 
</P>
<P>
	A total damage estimate for the state will not be available for  
at least a week, State Police spokesman John Hagerty said, but the 
town of Manville already has claimed $500 million in damages for 
home, businesses and cleanup costs. More than 200 homes were 
condemned and 1,200 were damaged, Mayor Angelo Corradino said. 
</P>
<P>
	``My knees shake when I think about it,'' Corradino said.

<HEADLINE> Stations Turn to Web Broadcasts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- This past summer, if you were a baseball fan in  
search of Florida Marlins' highlights, you might tune in to WPEC's 
11 p.m. newscast -- or log on to its Web site to watch a simulcast. 
</P>
<P>
	Not anymore. Major League Baseball has cried ``Foul!'' -- and  
copyright infringement -- forcing the station in West Palm Beach, 
Fla., and others around the country to stop broadcasting on the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Disputes over Internet programming rights, though still rare,  
are on the rise as more radio and TV stations run their 
over-the-air feeds on the Web as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem is technology is always way ahead of the law,''  
said Kathleen Kirby, a lawyer for the Radio-Television News 
Directors Association, a Washington-based industry group. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet broadcasts generally mirror those sent over the  
airwaves, so some stations do not see the need for additional 
rights. But distributors of sports and entertainment programming 
say their contracts spell out permitted uses and automatically 
prohibit everything else. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball contracts go a step further and include a clause that  
specifically bans Internet broadcasts, even Internet broadcasts of 
highlights. The baseball league found several violators, and 
lawyers stopped the Web broadcasts. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's starting to come up this season,'' said Michael Mellis,  
new media counsel for Major League Baseball Enterprises, the 
licensing division. ``Our game footage is copyrighted, and our 
intellectual property is valuable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	WPEC, which started Web simulcasts of local news shows on June  
21, has since eliminated its entire sports segment from the Web 
version. The station also disabled the Internet archives of past 
news shows because they contain baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``To me, it's no different than re-broadcasting your news on  
cable,'' said Doreen Wade, WPEC's general manager. ``I don't see 
what the big deal is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A sister station, WWMT in Kalamazoo, Mich., initially stopped  
running baseball highlights on its over-the-air newscasts after 
learning of the Internet restriction. The station has since 
restored baseball to regular broadcast but keeps footage off the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really surprised that it became an issue because it's not  
a revenue-driven thing at all here,'' said Al Forist, the station's 
operations manager. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Web service costs more money than it generates, so  
WWMT does not want to pay for separate rights. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Football League currently permits Web simulcasts of  
highlights for one-time usage but prohibits video broadcasts of 
entire games on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Pro basketball officials found a few radio stations that carried  
live feeds of games over the Internet but the stations stopped 
after they were contacted by the National Basketball Association. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Adam Silver, president of NBA Entertainment, said given  
the scope of the Internet, ``it's so difficult to police.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Restrictions extend to non-sports programming as well.  
</P>
<P>
	Premiere Radio Networks, a syndicator of radio programming,  
allows Web simulcasts for some shows, but not for lucrative 
holdings such as Rush Limbaugh and Dr. Laura Schlessinger. Premiere 
worked out a licensing agreement with broadcast.com, a site through 
which stations offer simulcasts. 
</P>
<P>
	Radio feeds through broadcast.com began in 1995. The site now  
has programming from 500 radio and 65 TV stations. Yahoo! Inc., 
which runs the site, expects continued growth as better technology 
makes quality feeds possible. 
</P>
<P>
	The company routinely checks with stations to make sure they  
have the proper rights. Difficulties primarily arise, Yahoo! Vice 
President Kevin Parke said, when the contract says nothing on the 
scope of the rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there's a question, we try to go ahead and work with the  
rights holder,'' Parke said. ``The last thing we want to do is 
violate anyone's copyright.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis Wharton, spokesman for the Washington-based National  
Association of Broadcasters, said broadcasters are sorting through 
the legal ramifications. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a brave new world we're entering.''

<HEADLINE> Independent Counsel Law Reviewed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Four people who were put on trial by  
independent counsels appeared before Congress Thursday to mark the 
death of the law that gave prosecutors almost unlimited power of 
pursuit. They did not mourn. 
</P>
<P>
	``I went from a Cabinet secretary to basically an unemployed  
person,'' said Mike Espy, a former agriculture secretary to 
President Clinton who was the subject of a four-year $17 million 
investigation. In the end, Espy was acquitted of all 30 corruption 
charges brought against him. 
</P>
<P>
	At a House subcommittee hearing long sought by Democrats,  
Whitewater figure Susan McDougal accused Kenneth Starr and the 
``right-wing judge'' who appointed him of turning the just-expired 
independent counsel statute into a ``political hammer'' against 
President and Mrs. Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington lawyer Robert Bennett said if you give a prosecutor  
only one case, a reporter one story or a congressman one piece of 
legislation, ``it's a formula for trouble.'' Bennett represented 
Clinton in the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit and former 
Reagan administration Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger in the 
Iran-Contra scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr himself opposed renewal of the independent counsel law,  
which Congress allowed to expire June 30, saying it violates the 
constitutional separation of powers between the branches of 
government and leaves the investigator vulnerable to political 
attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	The law was written after the Watergate scandal to establish a  
fully independent prosecutor outside the Justice Department, which 
is led by presidential appointees, to investigate high-level 
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal said the statute ``can be effective ... but only  
if operated as envisioned and not as a political hammer. Redefine 
the selection criteria and the oversight process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said Starr's office was ``out of control'' in a desire to  
``get the Clintons'' and that the three-judge panel that appointed 
independent counsels is ``led by a noted right-wing judge, David 
Sentelle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate response to her testimony from Starr or  
Sentelle. 
</P>
<P>
	The subcommittee chairman, Rep. George Gekas, R-Pa., pointed to  
Mrs. McDougal's four felony convictions regarding a fraudulent 
$300,000 federally backed loan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I sit here a convicted felon due to Mr. Starr,'' declared Mrs.  
McDougal, who said she was prosecuted because she would not tell 
``lies'' to implicate the Clintons in wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	A Virginia woman unsuccessfully prosecuted by Starr's office,  
Julie Hiatt Steele, said she was indicted for failure ``to endorse 
Starr's version of the truth.'' Ms. Steele disputed the account of 
presidential accuser Kathleen Willey who said she had confided to 
her friend Ms. Steele an unwanted sexual advance by Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele said Starr's office gave her ``several choices.'' She  
could say that Clinton's alleged sexual advance ``was consensual or 
that it was nonconsensual; or I could choose my own day, week, 
month and year to claim that I had been told about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Espy said that after just nine hours of jury deliberations, he  
was called in by jurors who told him that he was as innocent ``as 
anyone they had ever seen.'' He said one juror told him, ``Don't 
feel bad that we took nine hours. We're frequent smokers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lyn Nofziger, White House political director during President  
Reagan's first term, said he was ``the target of an independent 
counsel who had nothing better to do with nearly three years of his 
time -- and mine -- than to try to put me in prison.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The process ``cost me more than $1.5 million. It also destroyed  
my business,'' he said. Nofziger was convicted of committing ethics 
violations in lobbying. His conviction was overturned on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington attorney Robert Plotkin, who represented Reagan-era  
HUD Secretary Samuel Pierce, said Pierce ``was ruined and his 
retirement funds sapped by legal fees, not because he did anything 
wrong, but because he was in the political bulls-eye of the 
Independent Counsel Act.''

<HEADLINE> Paducah Worries About Radiation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PADUCAH, Ky. (AP) -- The way the employees tell it, the Paducah  
Gaseous Diffusion Plant sometimes operated as if Homer Simpson were 
running the place. Except that what happened there wasn't funny. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers used to wipe ``green salt'' off the plant lunch tables,  
fully aware it was a radioactive byproduct of the plant's main task 
-- enriching uranium for use as fuel in nuclear reactors. 
</P>
<P>
	They would bury truckloads of uranium shavings that ignited and  
burned upon being exposed to the air. They would dump thousands of 
barrels filled with radioactive contaminants into ponds and bury 
them in the ground. All the while, they were told they were working 
with materials that were ``safe enough to eat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now the employees and many other people in Paducah fear they are  
dying because of what happened at the 47-year-old plant, McCracken 
County's biggest source of jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Naas, a heavy-equipment operator who has worked at the  
plant for 25 years, told Senate investigators this week that he was 
taken off a job in 1974 after being told he was ``hot'' -- meaning, 
he assumed, that he had been exposed to too much radiation. 
</P>
<P>
	Naas said his father turned up ``hot'' on several occasions  
during the 20 years he worked at the plant. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today, he has a form of terminal cancer -- lymphoma. We will  
never know what was the cause,'' Naas said. ``My question is: Will 
I turn up the same, and what recourse will I have?'' 
</P>
<P>
	In June, three plant employees filed a federal lawsuit alleging  
that workers unwittingly were exposed to plutonium and other highly 
toxic substances from 1953 to 1976. The lawsuit is sealed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Energy Department, which owns the plant and is overseeing a  
$1 billion cleanup, later acknowledged that 103,000 tons of 
recycled uranium containing a total of 12 ounces of plutonium were 
handled in Paducah during the period. 
</P>
<P>
	Plutonium is much more potent than uranium -- it can cause cancer  
if ingested in quantities as small as one-millionth of an ounce. 
The Energy Department is investigating why workers were exposed to 
plutonium and whether contractors who operated the plant covered it 
up. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were told that the uranium substances we were working with  
were safe and posed no threat to our health, or to the health of 
our families,'' Garland ``Bud'' Jenkins, who worked there for 30 
years, told a House committee Wednesday in Washington. ``We were 
even told the materials were safe enough to eat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The plant site, with its combined enrichment and cleanup  
operations, is the county's largest employer with 2,000 workers. 
</P>
<P>
	But plant workers are not the only people in this rural area in  
western Kentucky who are questioning whether their health has been 
compromised. 
</P>
<P>
	Ronald Lamb's family has lived and worked for years down the  
road from the Gaseous Diffusion Plant. His father, William, who 
opened the family's auto repair shop in 1961, died five years ago 
after being diagnosed with prostate and bone cancer. Lamb said the 
well at the family's house was found to have a trace of plutonium 
in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Lamb, 47, sued the contractor that operated the plant at the  
time, but a federal judge dismissed the case, saying there was no 
evidence the well was contaminated. The Energy Department told Lamb 
that the positive test for plutonium in the well water was 
erroneous, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Lamb isn't convinced. He said he suspects contaminated well  
water is responsible for a long series of illnesses he has endured 
for 10 years, including nerve damage, an ulcer and intestinal 
problems. But he can't prove that, either. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just my own belief,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Energy Secretary Bill Richardson apologized for the government's  
secrecy about the plutonium during a recent town hall meeting in 
Paducah, and has proposed $20 million in compensation for plant 
workers with certain radiation-related cancers. 
</P>
<P>
	Some in Paducah are skeptical the secretary's plan will ever  
adequately reimburse them, both for the contamination and the 
cover-up. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he does it, OK. It's been a long time coming,'' said Nita  
Bean Rose, whose father, Charles Arvil Bean, retired from the plant 
with anemia and heart trouble in February 1977. 
</P>
<P>
	That April, he was found to have acute leukemia. He died the  
following year, at 65. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilma Kelley runs a T-shirt and sports clothing shop a half-mile  
up the road from the school. Her husband worked at the plant for 31 
years before retiring in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Kelley said she remains optimistic the government will do  
the right thing. 
</P>
<P>
	``If bad stuff is here, then they will clean it up,'' she said.  
``That's all we can hope.''

Carolina, where Floyd has created the worst disaster in state 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	The misery includes rivers fouled by human waste, hog waste and  
debris of all kinds; a wrecked shrimp harvest; farm losses expected 
to exceed $1 billion; and millions in uninsured home and car 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 42 people in North Carolina have been killed. The  
latest victim was a National Guardsman killed when his vehicle 
overturned late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Altogether, the storm killed at least 70 people from the Bahamas  
to New England -- and that toll is expected to rise once floodwaters 
recede. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no doubt there are individuals out there who were  
swept off roadways and whose bodies have not been recovered,'' said 
Dr. John Butts, the state's chief medical examiner. 
</P>
<P>
	About 3,100 people remain in shelters, though some in Rocky  
Mount and Greenville have moved into camping trailers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We lost everything we had, but we've still got our health and  
now we've got a place to stay,'' said Carolyn Whitehead of 
Greenville, who moved into one of the trailers with her husband and 
four children. ``I just want to take a hot bath.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But for many others, the problems continue. Statewide, officials  
estimate at least 100,000 hogs, 2.4 million chickens and 500,000 
turkeys drowned. Early estimates of crop and farm structure losses 
totaled $333 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The threat of disease from rotting carcasses led state officials  
to send portable incinerators into counties with the most extensive 
livestock deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd wiped out the prized breeding operation that Allen McCoy,  
57, and his cousin Phillip, 65, built from the ground up, killing 
more than 3,000 hogs. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is sweat and blood you're talking about,'' said McCoy,  
who estimated his losses at more than $500,000 from flooding on the 
Trent River. ``I've lost basically what I've worked for the last 40 
years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, volunteers from the Emergency Animal Rescue Service  
continued their efforts to save hundreds of pets left behind as 
their owners evacuated. Volunteers have rescued 260 animals, mostly 
dogs, says Terri Crisp, director of EARS, part of the nonprofit 
United Animal Network advocacy group. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've seen dogs swimming out to boats, almost literally jumping  
into the boats,'' said Crisp, who has responded to about 40 
disasters, including fires, earthquakes and tornadoes. ``One almost 
licked me to death, he was so happy just to have human 
companionship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Damage from Floyd is expected to surpass the $6 billion cost  
caused by Hurricane Fran in 1996. Gov. Jim Hunt scheduled a trip to 
Washington today to lobby for more federal money. 
</P>
<P>
	Farther south, in Conway, S.C., officials say rising floodwaters  
are threatening to wipe out parts of Highway 90, cutting off 
thousands of people between Conway and North Myrtle Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	``If these three places flood, we will have islands of people  
out there,'' said acting Horry County administrator Danny Knight. 
</P>
<P>
	The Waccamaw River was expected to crest close at about 17 feet  
-- about 10 feet above flood stage -- this week. State transportation 
officials said they expect to complete work on a dike by Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In hard-hit New Jersey, about 6,000 people had applied for  
relief grants to the Federal Emergency Management Agency by 
Wednesday, said agency spokeswoman Carol Hector-Harris. 
</P>
<P>
	A total damage estimate for the state will not be available for  
at least a week, State Police spokesman John Hagerty said, but the 
town of Manville already has claimed $500 million in damages for 
home, businesses and cleanup costs. More than 200 homes were 
condemned and 1,200 were damaged, Mayor Angelo Corradino said. 
</P>
<P>
	``My knees shake when I think about it,'' Corradino said.

<P>
	PARADISE VALLEY, Ariz. (AP) -- Family Circus creator Bil Keane is  
worried about a less-than-wholesome parody of his kid-friendly 
comic on the Web. 
</P>
<P>
	Keane said Wednesday he was mildly amused by the ``Dysfunctional  
Family Circus'' when it began five years ago, but then his readers 
started to complain. 
</P>
<P>
	The Web site -- SpinnWebe, maintained by Greg Galcik -- uses  
Keane's cartoons while allowing site visitors to make up the 
captions.he results are often sarcastic or dark humor, and 
sometimes obscene and pornographic, Keane said. 
</P>
<P>
	King Features, which syndicates Keane's comic, and Keane's  
attorney sent Galcik a letter last week threatening legal action 
unless he removed references to Keane's work, including 500 of his 
drawings.

<HEADLINE> F-22 Compromise Still Elusive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Under heavy lobbying by the Pentagon and a  
defense contractor, congressional negotiators inched toward a 
compromise expected to keep alive the F-22 stealth fighter program. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Air Force may have to accept a production delay or fewer  
of the prized new $200 million-apiece aircraft in exchange for the 
reprieve. 
</P>
<P>
	Talks were going on behind the scenes Thursday after  
House-Senate negotiators worked until midnight Wednesday without 
reaching agreement on the fate of the most expensive aircraft ever. 
</P>
<P>
	Still a compromise appeared to be taking shape under which  
Senate negotiators were retreating from their insistence that the 
aircraft, manufactured by Lockheed Martin Corp., be fully funded. 
</P>
<P>
	And House negotiators were prepared to accept something less  
than the suspension of production voted by the House in July, aides 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	One proposal on the table, offered by Senate negotiators, called  
for putting much of the $1.8 billion that had been earmarked by the 
Pentagon for buying the first six F-22s into more testing and 
research. 
</P>
<P>
	That could delay production by a year.  
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Jerry Lewis, R-Calif., the leading congressional advocate  
for cutting the program, suggested conferees were close to an 
agreement that would result in ``a pause'' in production. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis is chairman of the House Appropriations defense  
subcommittee. The panel's decision in July to halt work on the Air 
Force's prized $65 billion next-generation fighter jet stunned the 
Pentagon and Lockheed. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, said Thursday that an agreement  
had not yet jelled. Stevens is chairman of the Senate 
Appropriations Committee and head of the Senate negotiating team. 
</P>
<P>
	The House-Senate conference committee is working on a $267  
billion military spending bill for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 
1. Congressional leaders had hoped to have the measure completed by 
week's end. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the House voted to halt the program in July as too costly,  
both the Pentagon and Lockheed have waged a furious lobbying 
campaign to save it. 
</P>
<P>
	But at the same time, ``the opposition has toughened in many  
ways,'' said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., one of the negotiators. 
</P>
<P>
	Leahy said he expects the final compromise to at least save part  
of the program, which he likens to ``that second mortage you never 
can quite get rid of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House leaders have urged Lewis to restore at least some of the  
$1.8 billion for the F-22. House negotiators earlier this week 
offered to put back enough money to buy two of the aircraft in the 
upcoming fiscal year, aides said. 
</P>
<P>
	But support in the Senate for the jet is strong, and senators  
rejected the notion of building only two. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm confident the appropriators will work out some compromise  
that will keep the program alive,'' said Sen. John Warner, R-Va., 
chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. ``It is essential 
that we keep the program alive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While not formally on the negotiating team -- made up of members  
of the House and Senate Appropriations committees -- Warner, a 
strong supporter of the F-22, is influential in the process. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force already has spent $25 billion to develop the F-22  
and plans to spend an additional $40 billion to build 339 of them. 
That would have a price tag of nearly $200 million per plane, the 
most expensive fighter ever built. 
</P>
<P>
	The debate is taking place in negotiations over a compromise  
$267 billion defense bill for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1.

<HEADLINE> Ky. Workers Told Uranium Was Safe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Managers at a federal uranium plant in  
Paducah, Ky., for years withheld information from employees that 
they were being exposed to highly dangerous plutonium, workers told 
a congressional hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	A union representing the workers on Wednesday provided the House  
Commerce subcommittee documents -- one as early as 1952 and another 
from 1985 -- suggesting special precautions might have to be taken 
because of exposure to ``transuranic'' materials, including 
plutonium. 
</P>
<P>
	``What is clear is that (government) contractors knew of the  
need to protect workers from plutonium and other transuranics with 
special safeguards as early as 1952,'' Jim Key, an official of the 
union representing atomic workers, told the lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said no additional precautions were taken until much more  
recently. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Tom Cochran of the Natural Resources Defense Council,  
said documents obtained as part of a lawsuit on behalf of Paducah 
workers shows that managers of the plant also were aware for years 
that radioactive material was being buried on land outside the 
plant fences in violation of the law. 
</P>
<P>
	Cochran produced a memo from a Kentucky state police  
investigator in 1991 complaining that radioactive and toxic 
material was being buried outside the plant fence, including at a 
state police firing range. Plant workers were directed to dump the 
wastes outside plant property or be fired, the memo said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not known what action, if any, resulted from the  
investigator's memo to a superior. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just stunned,'' Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., the  
subcommittee's chairman, said after hearing several employees 
describe working conditions at the Paducah plant in western 
Kentucky during much of the Cold War years. 
</P>
<P>
	A recent Energy Department investigation concluded that while  
some improvements still need to be made, there is no imminent 
danger to plant workers today. 
</P>
<P>
		   However, a draft report from the Centers For Disease Control and  
Prevention obtained by The Courier-Journal in Louisville, Ky., says 
a host of chemicals and radioactive materials -- reflected in 
groundwater samples containing trichloroethylene and lead -- ``posed 
a public health hazard for children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wells near the Department of Energy plant are not being used,  
but the CDC summary states that parents who believe their children 
may have ingested significant levels of lead in drinking water 
should alert their pediatricians. 
</P>
<P>
	The CDC's Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry is to  
release its full report on Paducah soon. 
</P>
<P>
	The draft says people who live near the plant do not face any  
health hazards from current operations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Based on the data reviewed and under normal site operating  
conditions, the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant does not currently 
pose a health hazard to offsite populations,'' the draft said. 
</P>
<P>
	James Miller, executive vice president of the United Enrichment  
Corp., which took over operation of the plant in 1993, said the 
government paid $220 million for nuclear safety upgrades at the 
time of the ownership transfer. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the improvements have ``significantly reduced workers'  
potential exposure to radioactive material'' and that ``procedures 
and training are in place to ensure proper protection of 
individuals entering radiological areas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In graphic testimony, Garland ``Bud'' Jenkins described how he  
had worked at the uranium dust-filled plant for 30 years under 
private contractors and was never told some of the uranium had been 
laced with highly dangerous plutonium. 
</P>
<P>
	``We constantly inhaled the dust and fumes. There were no  
devices to measure radioactivity in the air,'' said Jenkins. He 
said workers would wear contaminated clothing home and even after 
taking showers some mornings their bed linens ``would be green or 
black from the black oxide and greensalt'' of the uranium powder. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were told that the uranium substances we were working with  
were safe and posed no threat to our health, or to the health of 
our families,'' continued Jenkins. ``We were even told the 
materials were safe enough to eat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ronald Fowler, who was hired in 1991 as a health physicist at  
the plant, told lawmakers he repeatedly was rebuffed when he raised 
concern about workers' contamination and even today has been 
targeted for harassment and intimidation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Energy Department plans to ask Congress for money to  
compensate Paducah workers who have become ill because of radiation 
exposure. 
</P>
<P>
	Built in 1952 to produce enriched uranium, the Paducah plant has  
been managed by a number of private contractors over the years, 
including Union Carbide and Martin Marietta Energy Systems.

<HEADLINE> Lukas, Baffert Battle for Supremacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FLORENCE, Ky. (AP) -- With two victories apiece, trainers D.  
Wayne Lukas and Bob Baffert battle Saturday for supremacy in the 
Kentucky Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert's Horse, Classic Cat, is the favorite at 7-5 over Lukas'  
Cat Thief, 9-5, in the $500,000 Kentucky Cup Classic at Turfway 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are two marquee horses, and I just gave the edge to  
Classic Cat because of his age and experience,'' Mike Battaglia, 
who makes the morning line at Turfway Park, said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both horses have been on the fringe of stardom.  
</P>
<P>
	Classic Cat, a 4-year-old, finished third in the Preakness last  
year when Baffert won with Real Quiet. Cat Thief, a 3-year-old, was 
third in the Kentucky Derby this year when Lukas won with 
Charismatic. 
</P>
<P>
	Classic Cat's last win was in the San Bernardino Handicap at  
Santa Anita in April. He has won nearly $1.2 million in 16 starts. 
</P>
<P>
	Cat Thief last won in the Swaps at Hollywood Park in July. His  
earnings total $1.3 million in 17 starts. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kentucky Cup Classic is part of Turfway Park's $1.15 million  
Kentucky Cup Day of Champions, which includes three other graded 
stakes. Past winners include Tabasco Cat and Thunder Gulch, trained 
by Lukas, and Semoran and Silver Charm, trained by Baffert. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's race looked like it would be a small field, with  
only five confirmed starters before four more entries came in just 
before Thursday's draw for post positions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe trainers were looking at the short field and decided to  
jump in,'' Battaglia said. ``If they were thinking it would be 
easy, I think they were dead wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After Classic Cat and Cat Thief, Battaglia made the entry of  
Truluck and Social Charter the third choice at 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
	The field, from the rail out, with jockeys and morning line odds  
for the $500,000 Kentucky Cup Classic: 
</P>
<P>
	Cat Thief, Pat Day, 9-5; Night Dreamer, Chris McCarron, 10-1;  
Part the Waters, Danny Gonter, 20-1; (e) Social Charter, Shane 
Sellers, 3-1; Classic Cat, David Flores, 7-5; Da Devil, Calvin 
Borel, 20-1; Well Noted, Marlon St. Julien, 30-1; Blazing Sword, 
Willie Martinez, 15-1; (e) Truluck, Robby Albarado, 3-1.

<HEADLINE> SEC Supports Stock Market Overseer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman  
Arthur Levitt expressed support Thursday for the creation of a 
single, independent agency to police the nation's stock markets. 
</P>
<P>
	In speech delivered at Columbia University on Thursday night,  
Levitt gave mild support to a plan in which each exchange would 
police its own trading, but an umbrella agency would monitor member 
activities, sales practices and trading between the various 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
	``While I certainly am not wedded to any particular model at  
this point -- a great deal more thinking needs to be done -- this 
latter approach is intriguing,'' Levitt said. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea of a single, independent agency has been gaining steam  
amid a proliferation of smaller alternative markets and the 
likelihood that the self-regulating New York Stock Exchange and 
Nasdaq Stock Market may change into for-profit businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Competition from new ECNs, or electronic communications  
networks, has pressured more traditional, non-for-profit exchanges 
like the NYSE and Nasdaq to consider selling stock to the public to 
raise money and allow for greater flexibility in their operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Both, however, would need SEC approval for changes to their  
business or regulatory units. And concerns have been raised that 
the NYSE's and Nasdaq's regulatory units would face endless 
conflicts of interest if the two exchanges became profit-driven 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked how that would change the SEC's role, Levitt said the  
agency would act not as an enforcer, but rather as a sort of 
arbitrator, getting the various exchanges to remove 
anti-competitive practices and put in place measures that protect 
the public. 
</P>
<P>
	Levitt said the new ECNs provide needed competition in the  
markets, calling them ``one of the most important developments in 
our markets in years -- perhaps decades.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the SEC chairman also said the growing rivalry among markets  
has heightened the need to find a compromise between the benefits 
of competition and the problems created by fragmented markets, 
which can make it hard for investors to obtain information and find 
the best stock price. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the securities industry also expressed support  
Thursday for an umbrella regulatory body. 
</P>
<P>
	``The securities industry would like to see one regulator for  
the entire industry,'' said Bernard Madoff, president of Madoff 
Securities in New York, asserting that the SEC would need to ensure 
that such a body remains independent from any of the dozen or so 
stock markets now operating in this country. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading firms such as Madoff's would save money under a single  
regulatory body because they are currently required to help pay 
regulatory costs at each of the exchanges where they are members. 
</P>
<P>
	Madoff said the industry needs Levitt's leadership on the issue  
because neither the NYSE or the Nasdaq has provided any details on 
how they plan to police their markets should they become for-profit 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Some were critical of Levitt Thursday for not moving fast enough  
to address the rapid changes washing over the markets. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been way behind the curve on this,'' said Junius Peake,  
an economics professor at the University of Northern Colorado and a 
former member of the board of governors at the National Association 
of Securities Dealers, which oversees the Nasdaq market. 
</P>
<P>
	Peake said support for a single, independent regulator has been  
building for 25 years. Such an agency should regulate any aspect of 
an exchange that produces income because, ``That's where everybody 
gets caught up and everybody has a terrible time staying neutral.''

<HEADLINE> U.S., China To Resume Trade Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States and China will resume  
negotiations next week on a trade agreement which could clear the 
way for China's entry into the World Trade Organization, the 
Clinton administration said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The talks will take place Monday and Tuesday in Washington and  
will involve delegations led by U.S. Trade Representative Charlene 
Barshefsky and Chinese Trade Minister Shi Guangsheng. 
</P>
<P>
	The fact that the talks are taking place at such a high level  
was certain to increase expectations that a long-sought deal could 
be imminent. 
</P>
<P>
	But Helaine Klaskey, a spokeswoman for Barshefsky, refused to  
speculate on whether an agreement can be reached during next week's 
discussions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think it is quite premature to say when we may conclude a  
deal,'' Ms. Klaskey said. 
</P>
<P>
	She also refused comment on a report in Thursday's Wall Street  
Journal that quoted unnamed members of China's negotiating team as 
saying China's last offer, made in April, was back on the table. 
</P>
<P>
	The two countries came close to agreement in April during a  
visit to Washington by Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji. Many U.S. 
business interests have been critical of President Clinton for 
rejecting that proposal, which contained a number of Chinese offers 
to lower trade barriers that American companies have been 
complaining about for years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chinese, miffed that they could not get an agreement in  
April, had previously said that offers on the table at that time 
had been withdrawn. The chance of getting an agreement faded 
further after the mistaken NATO bombing of the Chinese Embassy in 
Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton and Chinese President Jiang Zemin agreed during a  
meeting two weeks ago in New Zealand to restart the talks with an 
aim of getting China into the WTO before late November, when the 
Geneva-based organization will hold a ministerial meeting in 
Seattle to launch a new round of global trade talks. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart accused  
Republican congressional leaders of jeopardizing the possibility of 
a deal with China with ``quite irresponsible'' comments that 
Congress might not have time to take up the proposal before 
adjourning this year. 
</P>
<P>
	House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, and Senate Majority  
Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., have both said there is little or no 
chance that Congress would vote this year for China's admission to 
the 134-nation WTO. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to understand why the Republican leader of the  
Senate and the Republican leader of the House would oppose the 
Chamber of Commerce and oppose every business group around and say 
we shouldn't have China in WTO,'' Lockhart told reporters at the 
White House.

<P>
	The Washington Post, on Congress and managed care:

	The majority leadership of both houses of Congress increasingly  
find themselves in the anomalous position of trying to suppress 
majority will. The House last week passed by 75 votes a campaign 
finance reform bill that the Republican leadership opposed and 
agreed to bring to a vote only when a majority threatened to seize 
control of the floor. ... Friday the leadership acquiesced and 
announced it will likewise permit debate next month on a bill it 
opposes regulating managed care. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Senate, the leadership was able to fend off a strong  
managed care bill only by passing a shell. It will likely take part 
in a filibuster next month to head off a campaign finance bill that 
it agreed to schedule only under duress. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Speaker Dennis Hastert has promised a House vote the week of  
Oct. 4 on a managed care bill that he has been trying to deflect 
for months. ... 
</P>
<P>
	For all the claims made for and against, this is actually rather  
modest legislation. The country wants quality health care at 
minimal cost; the managed care industry sits astride that tension. 
...
</P>
<P>
	The major fight is over liability. ... Lest medicine be consumed  
even more by law, we would rather try a strong appeals process 
first. If a right to sue is granted, as the majority seems bent on 
doing in the House, it ought to be heavily qualified. But there 
ought to be a serious bill, not token legislation such as passed 
the Senate. ...

	The Seattle Times, on Northern Ireland:  
</P>
<P>
	Sensitive, creative ideas for reforming the Royal Ulster  
Constabulary, Northern Ireland's police force, must not be allowed 
to wither along with the stunted promise of the Good Friday 
Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the 175 recommendations made public recently go to the  
heart of the real and symbolic impediments to peace. 
</P>
<P>
	For all of the pragmatism and insight behind the proposals, they  
are at the mercy of parties who are masters at creating excuses not 
to act. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1998 Good Friday plan, which won Nobel Prizes for key  
negotiators, was a meticulously drawn schematic for Protestant and 
Catholic governance and power sharing. Virtually nothing has 
happened, with one exception. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the plan created a commission to look at the overhaul of  
the RUC, long perceived as the visible sign of British and 
Protestant oppression of Northern Ireland Catholics. 
</P>
<P>
	Rethinking the RUC is not new. But previous government studies  
documented the RUC's failings as a law-enforcement agency. The 
commission, chaired by former Hong Kong governor Chris Patten, 
focused on integration of the police into a peace-seeking society. 
...
</P>
<P>
	Changing the RUC is basic to a reformed society in Northern  
Ireland.

	Star Tribune of Minneapolis, on conflicts in American culture:  
</P>
<P>
	Often the headlines are disturbing: A man opens fire on  
teen-agers gathered in a Texas church. Jessica Swanson, age 3, 
murdered, dumped in shallow grave. Katie Poirier, age 19, abducted, 
strangled, burned. Sickos threaten Denver-area schools, saying 
Columbine was ``just the beginning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's tempting to see the world in a downward spiral and to  
blame, in the absence of a more precise target, the culture. 
</P>
<P>
	There's plausibility to this assessment. Surely American culture  
has become more vulgar: the language, the messages on T-shirts, the 
loutish talk shows, the crude movies and music, the rowdy audiences 
at sporting events, the road rage, the gun worship, the gruesome 
video games, the sex-obsessed sitcoms, the general meanness that 
seems to escalate to domestic abuse and to verbal and physical 
assault. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet this is not the entire picture. Violent crimes -- including  
school murders -- are actually down nationwide. While some TV is 
vulgar, other TV has never been better. Museums flourish. Music has 
rediscovered melody. The same culture that created two mass 
murderers in Littleton also created two girls who, even at 
gunpoint, refused to renounce their religious faith. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, what we have are cultural trains headed in opposite  
directions. Writing in the conservative journal American Outlook, 
S.T. Karnick describes ``not a simple vulgarization or decay of 
American culture but a polarization. The good is better than it has 
often been, and the evil is very wicked indeed. And the twain 
seldom meet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anything can be found in today's ``Everything Culture,'' he  
continues, ``no shortage of altruism, nor of egotism. There is no 
unified culture, really, and that is part of the problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Karnick goes on to suggest that America must soon chose between  
the Judeo-Christian tradition and an emerging multiculturalism in 
which all values are relative and tolerance (of anything) is the 
greatest virtue. 
</P>
<P>
	The choice is probably not so urgent or so clear-cut. But his  
description of a polarized culture is strikingly accurate. These 
are some of the best, and worst, of times.

<P>
	The Greenville (S.C.) News, on church shooting in Texas:  
</P>
<P>
	(The) violent episode at Fort Worth continued a string of  
indiscriminate killings that are particularly horrible for 
targeting young people. And this one seemed worse for violating a 
religious sanctuary and Wednesday night service for teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreover, this latest horror seemed particularly bewildering for  
the killer being neither mentally deranged nor immature and 
confused. ... 
</P>
<P>
	It added to the horror of his rampage that he appeared to have  
no reason for choosing Fort Worth's Wedgwood Baptist Church, and no 
motive for invading it with deadly intentions. The church was seven 
miles from his home. No one there knew him, and no one could think 
of a grievance he held against the church. He claimed none during 
his movement through the sanctuary firing two pistols and 
denouncing religion. ... 
</P>
<P>
	This terrible event will likely add to the political momentum  
for tighter gun controls. The pattern of violence it extends is bad 
enough to look for any relief from nearly any quarter. But no one 
should think that guns either cause or nurture anger or are even a 
trivial reason for its hateful expression.

</P>
<P>
	John Danforth has an impossible job. The former senator from  
Missouri has been appointed to probe the government's handling of 
the standoff at the Branch Davidian compound in Waco where more 
than 80 people died. 
</P>
<P>
	Danforth's job is impossible because, no matter what his final  
report says, he will never be able to silence the conspiracy 
theorists -- possibly for good reason. 
</P>
<P>
	As with much of the Clinton administration, the public has been  
fed a steady diet of lies about the government's actions. At this 
point, it's hard to know what to believe. 
</P>
<P>
	But Danforth could still do some good. The majority of Americans  
are still willing to listen to reason, and Danforth may be able to 
present a well-balanced report that convinces the majority in the 
middle that it is a thorough documentation of what happened at 
Waco. ... 
</P>
<P>
	All Americans -- including extremists -- deserve a full accounting  
of government actions in Waco, no matter who gets a black eye. 
Until we receive one, we have nothing to believe but the conspiracy 
theories.

injuries: 
</P>
<P>
	Recent reports in the Journal of the American Medical  
Association should serve as a wake-up call to parents and high 
school, middle school and youth league sports officials -- even 
minor head injuries among young athletes can have a negative effect 
on the learning process. 
</P>
<P>
	While one study indicated that football players suffer more than  
63 percent of all mild traumatic brain injuries among their peers, 
other sports also present danger. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Another study in the same edition indicates that ``participating  
in amateur soccer is associated with lower scores on tests used to 
measure performance in memory and planning functions; repeated head 
injuries may be a contributing factor.'' ... 
</P>
<P>
	Does these mean we should ban all athletics?  
</P>
<P>
	Of course not. The lessons learned on the various playing fields  
are valuable and encourage physical and social development. 
</P>
<P>
	But organizers should heed some worthwhile advice: Work harder  
to make the games safer with improved instruction, rules that 
lessen the chance for head-to-head contact, and better equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	While athletics provide many worthwhile lessons, they are only  
valuable if the student-athlete can remember them later in life.

</P>
<P>
	This dispiriting era of political scandal seemed to crest with  
President Clinton's impeachment, but since then there has been a 
steady tide of misbehavior by public officials, and not limited to 
the party of the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Recently it was revealed that former House Speaker Newt  
Gingrich, one of the nation's principal champions of morality and 
traditional values, and one of Clinton's loudest accusers, has not 
been devoted to his second wife, whom he is now seeking to divorce. 
Gingrich has been linked romantically (if that is the right word) 
to a woman who worked for the House when Gingrich was House 
Speaker. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Politicians are only human. Some serve with distinction and live  
by a code of person honor; some do not. All are imperfect. 
</P>
<P>
	If nothing else, the last couple of years should have convinced  
most voters that the political arena is not a useful source for 
moral guidance and certainly not a font of good example. With the 
campaign for next year's primary elections already under way, 
perhaps the politicians will concentrate their rhetoric on public 
policy and spare the voters their protestations of personal honor 
and aspersions on the honor of opponents. As Ralph Waldo Emerson 
said in an earlier era, ``The louder he talked of his honor, the 
faster we counted our spoons.''

</P>
<P>
	In 1997, minister Donald Cobble's then 9-year-old son brought  
home a bad report card. Cobble, believing in stern discipline, 
administered a spanking on his son with a leather belt.

other way, when troops are harmed and costs accumulated.

<P>
	Australia has taken on the role of regional policeman and  
peacemaker, and must be in no doubt the commitment is for as long

</P>
<P>
	A decade after the fall of the Berlin Wall, it is easy to  
dismiss the exposure of former KGB and Stasi agents as a pointless 
exercise, serving no purpose other than to humiliate Left-wing 
academics and journalists, most of them now elderly and infirm. We 
are even less inclined to be vindictive towards those who had been 
Soviet ``agents of influence'' during the Cold War than we were 
after 1945 towards those, such as P.G. Wodehouse, who had been 
useful to the Germans. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet such charity must not be allowed to obscure the historical  
truth. Not every indiscretion is treachery, but there is no other 
word for the systematic collusion of Britons with hostile 
intelligence services which -- whatever its subjective motive -- 
objectively helped to undermine the defense of democracy and 
disseminate lies.

semiofficial organization Arats, which is aware of the relationship 
between Beijing and Taipei, did also. While the tone was subdued, 
the message indicates a joint sadness by all Chinese. The 
rhetorical One-China-Course became superfluous. After the exchange 
of harsh words since July, it was fathomable that the undertone 
carried a `the motherland helps the province,'' possibility. But 
one doesn't pound political capital out of a catastrophe. 
</P>
<P>
	Taiwan should accept the offer of help and with the opportunity  
knot together the threads of dialogue between the two contact 
agencies. After the comments of President Lee Denghui about the 
intrastate character of the relationship across the ocean strait 
and Beijing's responding cannonade of words, its time for 
reflection, in addition the terrible opportunity arises -- the most 
devastating earthquake for a long time -- such contacts rouse 
suspicions it has to do with upcoming elections or so-called higher

	The episode of the pavilion in Orlando shows once more that

Israel's capital is not enhanced by scuffles of this kind. 
</P>
<P>
	Declarations of loyalty to the unity and centrality of Jerusalem  
cannot cover up the city's weaknesses. Despite the policy pursued 
by successive Israeli governments to buttress the Jewish population 
in the capital, Jews are leaving the city in massive numbers. 
Pavilions and telephone cards will not induce them to return. 
</P>
<P>
	The discrimination that has been practiced during the 32 years  
of Israeli rule in the ``united'' city has not succeeded in 
removing the Arab presence from the city. Victories at Disney World

	The gravity of guilt in disregarding the result of a democratic

connection, responses that the Western countries took may also be 
held accountable. 
</P>
<P>
	France, Algeria's former metropolitan country, and other West  
European countries failed to take effective steps to end the 
confusion in Africa. No doubt they feared the emergence of Islamic 
fundamentalism rather than the compromising of democracy. There is 
a strongly held view that Algeria's example led part of the 
wide-ranging Islamic forces in the world to abandon attempts at 
democratic politics, giving them an impetus to go to the extreme. 
The developed world must feel remorse over the way they have 
treated Algeria. 
</P>
<P>
	The reconstruction of Algeria requires assistance from  
neighboring countries. And a preliminary step is for the 
international community to learn from eight years of hideous 
tragedies in that country.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Janet Maslin, the movie critic for The New York

<HEADLINE> Bauer Proposes 16 Percent Flat Tax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican presidential hopeful Gary Bauer on  
Thursday proposed eliminating most tax breaks for businesses and 
individuals and imposing a 16 percent flat tax on income. 
</P>
<P>
	In a National Press Club speech, Bauer also called for reducing  
the payroll tax, which funds Social Security, by 20 percent, while 
cutting the projected increases in benefits for future retirees. 
</P>
<P>
	Families would get a $1,400 per person tax credit and could  
continue to deduct mortgage interest payments and charitable 
contributions. Those are the only deductions Bauer would allow. 
</P>
<P>
	He contrasted his 16 percent flat tax proposal with the 17  
percent flat tax offered by publisher Steve Forbes, a competitor 
for the GOP presidential nomination who is vying with Bauer for the 
support of social conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, Bauer would no longer let businesses deduct the  
cost of new equipment, while Forbes' plan would let them write off 
those purchases immediately rather than spread out the deductions 
over several years. Bauer contended Forbes' plan would let 
companies escape paying taxes altogether. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is an idea that will destroy the GOP,'' Bauer said.  
``Let's allow our corporate friends to pay zero while secretaries, 
cab drivers, waitresses, farmers and schoolteachers pay 17 
percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Bauer would tax capital gains -- profits from the  
sale of stock or other investments -- at 16 percent while Forbes 
would not tax them. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes' campaign manager Bill Dal Col, while welcoming Bauer's  
support of a flat tax, questioned the complexity of his plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``What he continues to do is empower the bureaucracy and the  
lobbyists with its minutiae,'' Dal Col said. ``Our plan is simple, 
honest and fair and takes working people off the income tax 
rolls.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer also asked when Texas Gov. George W. Bush would offer a  
tax plan. ``When he does, it will reflect yet more conventional 
Republican thinking,'' Bauer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said the Republican front-runner  
would propose a tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gov. Bush has a record of cutting taxes in Texas and intends  
to lay out a plan to cut taxes on the federal level as well,'' 
Tucker said. ``He wants to reduce marginal rates to create jobs and 
make sure that we help struggling families on the outskirts of 
poverty.''

<HEADLINE> INS Abolition Gets Bipartisan Push </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON -- A Senate proposal to abolish the Immigration and  
Naturalization Service and replace it with a new, reorganized 
Justice Department agency got a cautiously positive reception 
Thursday from the head of the INS. 
</P>
<P>
	Doris Meissner told the Senate Judiciary Committee's immigration  
panel that she agrees her agency needs an overhaul, even though she 
disagrees with some details of the proposal. She said the current 
INS structure that blends keeping illegal aliens out and processing 
legal immigrants is ``a strained structure designed for a different 
era.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I am committed to change,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	The panel's chairman, Sen. Spencer Abraham, R-Mich., is  
sponsoring a bill that would replace the INS with a new Immigration 
Affairs Agency that would have two bureaus -- one to enforce 
immigration laws and patrol the borders and another to handle the 
cases of legal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
	The new agency's leader, and the heads of both bureaus would be  
appointed by the president and approved by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Abraham said his proposal was meant to solve longstanding  
problems with the INS. The agency's unwieldy management structure 
has contributed to lengthy backlogs in processing immigration visa 
and citizenship requests, as well as overcrowded detention centers 
and other lapses as it tries to block illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot expect the INS to be the good service provider by  
day and the tough cop by night,'' Abraham said. 
</P>
<P>
	He cited the case of suspected serial killer Angel Maturino  
Resendiz, who was apprehended at the border and released to Mexico 
even after police alerted the INS this summer that he was a murder 
suspect. Resendiz surrendered in July. 
</P>
<P>
	Abraham and other backers of the bill said reorganizing the INS  
alone would not solve the problems if the new agency lacks good 
management. 
</P>
<P>
	``None of us believe that reorganization is a panacea,'' said  
Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
	Abraham's proposal has bipartisan support -- a co-sponsor is Sen.  
Edward Kennedy, D-Mass. -- and backing from groups representing INS 
agents, immigration lawyers and legal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we presently have is similar to expecting one manager to  
oversee the operations of the FBI and the Social Security system at 
the same time,'' said Paul Berg, a Border Patrol manager who heads 
the Chief Patrol Agents Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Several of those groups are critical of a House proposal  
sponsored by Rep. Harold Rogers, R-Ky., that would split the INS 
into two separate bureaus within the Justice Department. That 
separation ``would make it virtually impossible to articulate or 
implement a coherent, unified immigration policy,'' said Warren 
Leiden of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Backers of the House bill said they were encouraged the Senate  
was tackling the issue, noting that both measures have a long way 
to go before they can come to a final vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anything that advances the cause of immigration reform is a  
good thing,'' said Dan DuBray, Rogers' spokesman.

<HEADLINE> 'Not So Mighty' Gators Take on KU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- When he sees how many yards and turnovers  
Florida is giving up, coach Steve Spurrier can't believe his team 
is 3-0 and ranked third in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not as mighty as a lot of people think,'' Spurrier said  
this week. ``It's sort of scary when you look at it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, the Gators (1-0 Southeastern Conference) may not need  
to be mighty to beat Kentucky (2-1, 0-0) on Saturday at 
Commonwealth Stadium. It's been 13 years since the Wildcats beat 
the Gators and six since Florida won by less than double digits. 
</P>
<P>
	Kentucky has come a long way since 1996, when a 65-0 loss at  
Florida helped end Bill Curry's tenure as coach. Nevertheless, 
coach Hal Mumme's teams have been beaten soundly in their two 
meetings with the Gators, 55-28 in 1997 and 51-35 last year. 
</P>
<P>
	To stop Florida's streak before it reaches 13, ``It's got to be  
a really good football game for us,'' Mumme said. 
</P>
<P>
	After preserving their nation's-best home winning streak with a  
23-21 win over Tennessee, Spurrier wants his Gators to show better 
form in their first road game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Offensively, we need to score some points,'' he said. ``We can  
play a lot better than we played last week. Eliminate some 
turnovers, hold onto the ball better and eliminate some 
penalties.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Florida has SEC-high 12 turnovers, including six interceptions  
by quarterback Doug Johnson. Johnson also will be without his top 
receiver, Travis Taylor, who's out for three to four weeks with a 
severe right ankle sprain. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, some of those younger players who have not done  
much yet can step forward and become ballplayers,'' Spurrier said. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Florida's all-sophomore secondary is giving up 325  
passing yards a game and should be tested by Mumme's ``Air Raid'' 
offense, they will get a boost if Alex Brown can duplicate his 
dominating performance against Tennessee. The sophomore end 
deflected a pair of passes, forced a fumble, made an interception 
and sacked Volunteers' quarterback Tee Martin five times. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never thought I'd get five sacks in a game,'' said Brown,  
who counted them on his fingers at one point in the game. ``It 
really surprised me to actually go out and do it. Then to do it 
against Tennessee, on a nationally televised game. It was a really 
big game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Days later, Brown's teammates were still impressed.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've been watching college football since I was a kid, and  
been in games here,'' tailback Earnest Graham said. ``I've never 
seen a guy take over a game like that or do as much as he did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mumme joked that he initially considered a kamikaze defense  
against Brown, sending a walk-on outfitted with a dynamite vest out 
to block him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know one thing,'' Mumme said, ``I don't want him to hit  
(quarterback) Dusty (Bonner) like he hit Tee Martin,'' Mumme said. 
``I don't know what we'll do. We'll have a plan. Whether or not 
it'll work, I don't know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coming off a 44-35 win at Indiana, the Wildcats are looking a  
lot like last year's team, with an efficient, high-scoring offense 
and a vulnerable defense. Though not as strong-armed as the 
departed Tim Couch, the sophomore Bonner has picked up where Couch 
left off statistically, throwing for at least 300 yards and three 
touchdowns in each of his first three games. 
</P>
<P>
	Former walk-on James Whalen Jr. ranks as the nation's leading  
tight end, with 25 catches for 306 yards and five touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense, widely expected to take some of the pressure of a  
young offensive unit, has disappointed so far, though, allowing an 
SEC-worst 35 points per game.

<HEADLINE> Vikings Dare Teams To Keep Blitzing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. (AP) -- The Minnesota Vikings, who have been  
blitzed silly since the preseason, are daring teams to keep it up. 
</P>
<P>
	``We like people to blitz,'' coach Dennis Green insisted. ``I  
think if you have the right receivers and you're on your game, then 
that's a way that you can strike very quickly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The problem for the Vikings (1-1) is they haven't been on top of  
their game yet. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, they set an NFL scoring record with a quick-strike  
offense that forced teams to respect the deep ball and not risk 
sending defensive backs and linebackers after the quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	Randall Cunningham had all day to throw the deep jump ball to  
Randy Moss. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Minnesota is struggling to score points and run the ball  
effectively. Cunningham is spending too much time on the turf 
because his Pro Bowl-studded offensive line is getting beaten 
repeatedly, and Moss hasn't gotten into the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
	Moss was sent home from practice Thursday with the flu and added  
to the team's injury report, where he was listed as probable for 
Sunday's game. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings expect to see plenty of blitzes Sunday at Green Bay,  
especially with new coach Ray Rhodes much more willing to send 
LeRoy Butler, the best-blitzing safety in the NFL, after 
Cunningham. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are going to blitz,'' Green said. ``They're going to  
take their chances on whether or not they can cover Randy Moss and 
Cris Carter one-on-one. It helps to shut down the run game. And 
we've just got to do a better job. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are going to blitz. Our team is what it is and at some  
point, people are going to take chances. If you have success, 
you'll do it more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Teams plotted ways to stop the Vikings all offseason and so far  
the blueprint is this: blitz more often and send defensive backs 
into deep coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	That's deprived Cunningham of the time and Moss of the room that  
allowed them to hook up for 10 touchdowns of 40 yards or more last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Teams are going to do that, but we'll adjust pretty quick,''  
promised Cunningham, who also said he's going to get rid of the 
ball more quickly. ``I don't know what Coach Green is going to do 
offensively, but I think we'll get to a point where we're 
outsmarting teams, because we know what teams are going to do 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the Vikings having scored just 17 points in each of their  
games so far after averaging 35 last year, Moss said he expects 
opponents to stick to what's working. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they'll approach the game as far as not letting me  
explode or have a career day. I think teams on down the line are 
going to take the same approach,'' Moss said. ``When you're 
doubling, tripling me, we've just got to find a way to make it 
happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Complicating matters is the knee injury to Pro Bowl right tackle  
Korey Stringer, who might not play Sunday, giving way to 
second-year pro Matt Birk, who would make his first NFL start. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings didn't allow more than three sacks in any game last  
year, but yielded six against Oakland last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``If anything, it's going to make everyone concentrate that much  
more,'' center Jeff Christy said. ``Everyone's going to re-evaluate 
where they're at.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Offensive line coach Mike Tice said: ``You know, when you get  
blitzed a lot, your quarterback's going to get hit some, that's the 
nature of the beast. What disturbs me is when we break down 
physically on technique things that we work extremely hard on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Tice said he also would love to see the steady diet of  
blitzes continue. 
</P>
<P>
	``We love the blitz,'' Tice said. ``I hate to say it, but we  
love the blitz because we've had a lot of big plays against the 
blitz. We used to beg for the blitz. Yeah, they're blitzing us, who 
cares? If we hit a couple big plays, they're not going to blitz us, 
you know? They'll be petrified.''

<HEADLINE> Packers Duo Fill Chmura Void </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- The Green Bay Packers won't find one man  
who can replace Mark Chmura. Luckily, they don't have to. 
</P>
<P>
	Chmura, the Packers' Pro Bowl tight end, is out for Sunday's  
game against the Minnesota Vikings -- and perhaps forever -- after 
three incidents of temporary numbness and partial paralysis 
resulting from a bulging disc in his neck. 
</P>
<P>
	The team announced on Thursday that Chmura will undergo two  
additional weeks of tests before he makes a decision on his future. 
His wife and agent have urged him to retire, and the Packers are 
preparing for a season without his contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mark Chmura continues to be a member of our active roster,''  
GM Ron Wolf said. ``He wants to play, and we would like him to 
play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before Chmura's injuries, the Packers had enviable depth at  
tight end. With the nonpareil blocking of Chmura, the pass 
receiving skills of Tyrone Davis and the toughness of Jeff 
Thomason, Green Bay had perhaps the best three-man combination in 
the league. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Davis and Thomason will be sharing time and will often be  
on the field together in some of offensive coordinator Sherman 
Lewis' sets. Green Bay also signed Lamont Hall as a third tight end 
after waiving him earlier in the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the last way I want to get in there and play,''  
Thomason said. ``Chewy is a good friend of mine, and you never want 
to succeed at the expense of your friends -- at least, I don't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both Davis and Thomason must have strong games against the  
Vikings, coach Ray Rhodes said. Thomason's blocking will be 
particularly important, because Chmura made three Pro Bowls largely 
on the strength of his blocking skills before evolving into a more 
complete tight end later in his seven-year career. 
</P>
<P>
	``The guys that take his place have got to step up, and you've  
got to get the same production,'' Rhodes said. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis is a big, capable passing target, with excellent hands and  
decent speed. He was a wide receiver at Virginia and during his 
first NFL season, but he bulked up to 255 pounds last year, when he 
caught 18 passes for 250 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody can do the things Mark can do. That's why he's probably  
the best tight end in the game,'' Davis said. ``I can do some 
things, and Jeff can do some things, and we should be fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomason also has hands, which he uses almost exclusively for  
catching touchdowns. He scored twice in the preseason, and he 
caught the game-winner with 11 seconds to play in Green Bay's 28-24 
season-opening win over Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	He was Chmura's primary backup the last two seasons, and he and  
Davis also play important roles on special teams. Both will likely 
cut back their special teams roles in anticipation of more 
offensive snaps. 
</P>
<P>
	Chmura will be missed most by quarterback Brett Favre, who has  
used his good friend as a safety valve on offense for seven 
seasons. Nobody on the Green Bay roster knows Favre's thoughts as 
well as Chmura. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's sort of a crutch for me,'' Favre said. ``That's from  
playing together for a long time, practicing together, talking. I 
could be at the line of scrimmage and just call out his name, and 
he knew exactly what I was thinking. You just don't replace that.''

<HEADLINE> Balloon Lands at D.C. Museum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The capsule that carried balloonists on the  
first nonstop hot air trip around the globe went on permanent 
display Thursday in the National Air and Space Museum, next to the 
Wright brothers' plane and the craft that carried man to the moon. 
</P>
<P>
	Balloonists Bertrand Piccard and Brian Jones, who made their  
journey over 19 days in March, beamed as museum officials showed 
off the neon orange passenger compartment of their Breitling 
Orbiter 3 balloon. 
</P>
<P>
	It rests at ground level in the ``Milestones of Flight''  
gallery, adjacent to the Wright brothers' Flyer, Charles 
Lindbergh's ``Spirit of St. Louis,'' Chuck Yeager's supersonic Bell 
X-1 and the Apollo 11 command module. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials from the Federation Aeronautique Internationale, an  
international aeronautics body, also presented Piccard and Jones 
with papers certifying three world records: distance, duration and 
shortest time around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think for Brian and I, the flight really ends today, because  
finally, after going around the world, the Breitling Orbiter 3 has 
landed,'' said Piccard. ``It's almost like a circle has been 
closed, has been finished.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones expressed amazement at their accomplishment and new honor.  
</P>
<P>
	``When people use our names in the same sentence as John Glenn,  
Neil Armstrong and the Wright brothers, we still tend to look over 
our shoulders to see who they're talking about. There is a sense of 
disbelief which pervades still and, I think, will last a long 
time,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Piccard, a Swiss psychiatrist, and Jones, an English balloonist,  
began their journey March 1, lifting away from the village of 
Chateau D'Oex in Switzerland. They headed south, caught favorable 
winds around the equator and circled the Earth from west to east in 
19 days, 21 hours and 47 minutes. They landed March 21 in the 
Egyptian desert. 
</P>
<P>
	While the crew's computers showed they traveled 29,056 miles,  
the federation determined that they had traveled 25,361 miles after 
subtracting twists and turns. 
</P>
<P>
	During the trip, the balloonists lived in a pill-shaped  
pressurized compartment the size of a minivan, flying as high as 
36,000 feet and moving at up to 105 mph. The gondola contains a 
galley, two bunks, a toilet and the instruments and controls to 
operate the balloon. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the cylinders that carried the liquid propane used to  
heat the balloon's 181-foot-tall envelope still hang on the 
outside. The velope itself is too big to be displayed. Instead, the 
public will see a piece of it. Other pieces will be displayed in 
museums around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides earning a place of distinction in the museum -- part of  
the Smithsonian Institution -- Piccard and Jones have already 
received another reward for their record-breaking journey: 
Anheuser-Busch Cos., the beer brewer, paid them $1 million for 
becoming the first to circumnavigate the globe in a hot-air 
balloon. 
</P>
<P>
	They said they will use some of the money to start the Winds of  
Hope Foundation, which will award prizes each March 21 to those who 
are committed, in Piccard's words, to ``fighting against forgotten 
sufferances.''

<HEADLINE> Bush Seeks $20B for New Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate George W.  
Bush is promising to ``redefine war on our terms'' with a defense 
policy that pumps billions of dollars into the search for new 
weapons he said would help America keep the peace. 
</P>
<P>
	Unveiling his plans for the U.S. military in a speech today, the  
GOP front-runner said he would increase spending on research and 
development of weapons, raise soldiers' salaries, develop an 
anti-ballistic missile system and avoid ``vague, aimless and 
endless'' troop deployments throughout the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``If elected, I will set three goals: I will renew the bond of  
trust between the American president and the American military; I 
will defend the American people against missiles and terror; and I 
will begin creating the military of the next century,'' he said in 
an early draft of his speech to The Citadel military academy in 
Charleston, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
	``The best way to keep the peace is to redefine war on our  
terms,'' said Bush, who served in the Texas Air National Guard 
during the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-term Texas governor holds a hefty lead in polls over all  
Democratic and Republican presidential contenders. The address -- 
part of a series of speeches designed to spell out his presidential 
agenda -- is an answer to critics who say Bush is not ready to be 
president and that his views on public policy are undeveloped. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Vice President Al Gore, who is seeking the  
Democratic nomination, made light of Bush's foreign policy 
credentials and his history of confusing names of countries. ``The 
governor's foreign policy expertise begins with Slovenia and ends 
with Slovakia, and even these have proven to be too much of a 
challenge,'' Chris Lehane said today. 
</P>
<P>
	In advance of the speech, Bush stopped in Columbia, S.C., where  
he was met by former Gov. Carroll Campbell, one of the state's most 
popular politicians. Campbell said Bush was the only candidate who 
could help the Republican Party take back America and ``run the 
country right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest price tag in Bush's package is for research and  
development, where Bush would increase spending by $20 billion over 
five years. The annual Pentagon budget is about $270 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, 20 percent of the current budget for weapons and  
information systems should be earmarked for the purchase of weapons 
that take advantage of new technologies, Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	With the end of the Cold War -- what he called ``the hard but  
clear struggle against an evil empire'' -- Bush said America must 
take advantage of ``a revolution in the technology of war'' to 
remain strong enough to maintain peace throughout the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Reagan called Russia an ``evil empire'' when Bush's father was  
vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our challenge is not as obvious, but just as noble: To turn  
these years of influence into decades of peace,'' the governor 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Power is increasingly defined, not by mass or size, but by  
mobility and swiftness,'' Bush said. ``Influence is measured in 
information, safety is gained in stealth, and force is projected on 
the long arc of precision-guided weapons,'' he said. ``This 
revolution perfectly matches the strengths of our country -- and the 
skill of our people and the superiority of our technology.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He vowed to challenge each branch of the armed services to move  
beyond marginal improvements in existing weapons systems to ``skip 
a generation of technology.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This involves spending more and spending more wisely,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush implied that the Clinton administration has broken faith  
with U.S. troops by paying them too little and putting them in 
harm's way too often. He promised to spend $1 billion a year for 
years on top of a pay increase pending in Congress to increase 
their salaries, and said he would order a review of overseas 
commitments. 
</P>
<P>
	Their mission is ``to deter wars -- and win wars when deterrence  
fails,'' Bush said. ``Sending our military on vague, aimless and 
endless deployments is the swift solvent of morale.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Advisers said Bush has no problem with long-standing commitments  
to countries such as Israel, Japan and South Korea. But the Texas 
governor, who supported the U.S.-led NATO intervention in Kosovo, 
wants to look at what he considers to be more open-ended 
peacekeeping operations in places such as Kosovo and Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a call to withdraw from the world, rather a  
realization that we ... cannot be everywhere in the world,'' said 
his top foreign policy adviser, Condoleeza Rice. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush also called for the development of anti-ballistic missile  
systems that would be deployed inside and outside the United States 
``to guard against attack and blackmail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration plans to decide as early as June 2000  
whether to deploy a limited national defense system. Republicans 
and Democrats are generally in agreement that a theater-based 
system should be developed as soon as possible. On troop salaries, 
the administration is proposing 4.4 percent increases, while 
Congress is seeking 4.8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush put no price tag on his anti-missile plan.  
</P>
<P>
	Rice said the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with Russia  
would need to be amended, and Bush would be willing to scrap the 
pact if the necessary changes could not be made. ``Both sides know 
that we live in a different world than in 1972,'' Bush said.

<HEADLINE> Can Randle El Solve Penn State's D? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) -- Antwaan Randle El might be the  
antidote to Penn State's aggressive defense. 
</P>
<P>
	The thrilling option quarterback trying to turn around Indiana's  
fortunes should test the Nittany Lions' defense. Now, if only 
Indiana's porous defense can stop Penn State, there might be a good 
game Saturday in Beaver Stadium as the Hoosiers (1-2) and the No. 2 
Nittany Lions (4-0) open their Big Ten seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to focus on stopping their overall offense and then  
try to find a way to attack different parts of their defense,'' 
said Indiana coach Cam Cameron, whose team is probably too young to 
do either. ``But I don't see any weaknesses at this point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There might be one: Penn State's defense, so touted before the  
season, has given up enough yards to be ranked no higher than 
seventh in Big Ten statistics. 
</P>
<P>
	Blame the tough non-conference schedule, but last week gave  
cause for concern. Facing No. 9 Miami, the defense had a 
spectacular first half, then ended up surrendering 320 yards, two 
late touchdowns and the fourth-quarter lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Only a fourth-and-2 stop and a big TD on offense kept the Lions  
from leaving Florida wondering what went wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	By attacking the outside, Hurricanes tailback James Jackson  
rushed for 129 yards to become the first back to gain more than 100 
yards against Penn State in 15 games. On his 39-yard touchdown, he 
took advantage of good blocking, but Penn State's 
over-aggressiveness allowed him to sprint into the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lions expect the same sort of workout from Randle El, whose  
514 yards passing and 295 yards rushing account for 70 percent of 
the Hoosiers' total offense. 
</P>
<P>
	Penn State linebacker LaVar Arrington said he runs the option  
like Donovan McNabb, the Syracuse QB drafted No. 2 by the 
Philadelphia Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to find a way to stop that speed to the outside,''  
Arrington said. ``I think Randle El is one of the best quarterbacks 
around. He's going to cause some problems for us. We're just going 
to have to be disciplined in our assignments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The last time Penn State faced a true option quarterback was  
last November against Wisconsin, when Mike Samuel rushed for 89 
yards and a touchdown in the Badgers' 24-3 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Randle El noticed some cracks in the Lions defense. He said he  
thinks they have a way to attack it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd rather not say right now,'' he answered.  
</P>
<P>
	For Indiana, the problem is that Randle El can lead his team to  
touchdown after touchdown -- and still find his team trailing. The 
Hoosiers put up 30 points against North Carolina and 35 against 
Kentucky, and lost both games as the defense gave up nearly 1,000 
yards and 86 points. 
</P>
<P>
	So for the Lions, who proved they can throw the ball, this would  
be a great time to get their running game back on track. Penn State 
had 65 yards against Pittsburgh and only 110 yards against Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to come,'' Kevin Thompson said Tuesday. ``We're  
going to work on it this week, as far as staying on assignments, 
staying on blocks. We'll get it going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Penn State coach Joe Paterno thinks so, too. But true to form,  
he isn't banking on an easy victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have eight wars ahead of us now. Eight wars. Everybody in  
the Big Ten is tough. They are all physical. Every one is capable 
of beating us,'' he said. ``I don't think I will have a very tough 
job selling that to our kids.''

<HEADLINE> Grace Battling for '90s Hit Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Lou Boudreau. Richie Ashburn. Roberto Clemente.  
Pete Rose. Robin Yount. And in a few weeks, maybe, Mark Grace. 
</P>
<P>
	With 1,744 hits so far in the 1990s and nine games left, Grace  
has a chance to join the Hit King and the four Hall of Famers on 
that list of decade hits leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to get it. I'd like to get the most hits, the most  
doubles. That'd be nice,'' said Grace, who led Rafael Palmeiro of 
the Texas Rangers by one hit after Thursday's games. ``Robin Yount 
was the '80s, Pete Rose the '70s -- that's some pretty good 
company.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's certainly not a group Grace expected to join. He was the  
Chicago Cubs' 24th-round draft pick in 1985, not exactly the place 
where teams find the future of their franchises 
</P>
<P>
	But he won the Midwest League batting title in 1986, hitting  
.342. The next year, he was the Eastern League's MVP with a 
league-high 101 RBIs. On May 2, 1988, he was called up to the Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
	``They probably thought I'd help them in A ball for a couple of  
years and then send me back to San Diego or something,'' Grace 
said. ``My expectations were, `Hey, here's my opportunity and I've 
got to take advantage of it.' Twenty-fourth-rounders don't get the 
breaks that the high picks get. We've got to make our own breaks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had to make it happen and make it happen fast,'' he said.  
``I just drove myself to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grace may not have the gaudy numbers of Tony Gwynn or the talent  
of Ken Griffey Jr., but does have amazing consistency and a work 
ethic that constantly drives him. 
</P>
<P>
	He got his 2,000th hit on Aug. 2. He's hitting .300 for the  
ninth time in 11 seasons. He has 1,233 singles and 360 doubles in 
the 1990s, both second-highest in the decade. He's won four Gold 
Gloves. He's only the second Cub to be the opening-day starter at 
the same position for an entire decade. 
</P>
<P>
	On the mornings after a night game, he's one of the first Cubs  
to make the trek across the field to the batting cages. He's 
usually one of the last to leave the clubhouse, sitting around with 
a few teammates to rehash the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing I'm doing that other guys probably aren't  
doing. I just love to play,'' Grace said. ``What drives me is 
competing. The best players in the world, you get to play against 
them every day and that's what drives me. I want to be one of the 
best of the best. That's it, pretty much, in a nutshell.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So what does make Grace such a good hitter? He's got a natural  
swing, teammate Gary Gaetti said. And like Gwynn and Wade Boggs, 
who both reached 3,000 hits this season, Grace watches the ball 
longer than most players, Cubs manager Jim Riggleman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They stay inside the ball a long time to evaluate ball and  
strike,'' Riggleman said. ``They make good decisions about what to 
swing at and what not to swing at.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Riggleman calls the decade hits record as significant as  
the home run or batting titles, Grace's run at the '90s mark has 
been overshadowed by The Great Home Run Race, Part II. With the 
Cubs so far down in the standings it's not even worth talking 
about, most fans go to games just to see if Sammy Sosa will hit 
another home run. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mark is tied for the most hits in the decade and people aren't  
sticking around to see if he's getting that hit,'' Riggleman said. 
``I don't think that they're quite aware of the magnitude of this 
feat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added teammate Glenallen Hill, ``I can't put it into words. To  
actually get a major league hit is tough. To put together the most 
hits in the 1990s is just incredible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Equally incredible is that Grace has managed to do it all in one  
uniform. While Sosa may be the heart of the Cubs these days, Grace 
is their soul. He's Mr. Cub of the '90s, right down to the Wrigley 
Field ivy painted on his Harley-Davidson. 
</P>
<P>
	He's played for six managers and watched dozens of teammates  
come and go. He played with Greg Maddux, Rick Sutcliffe, Andre 
Dawson, Shawon Dunston and Ryne Sandberg. Only equipment manager 
Yosh Kawano has been with the Cubs longer. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a little, small fraternity that I'm in, and there's  
some awfully, awfully good players in that fraternity: Gwynn, (Cal) 
Ripken, (Barry) Larkin, Chuck Finley, (Craig) Biggio,'' Grace said. 
``It's not so much one team, it's this team. This is my home. This 
is where I belong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And maybe soon, he'll belong with Boudreau, Ashburn, Clemente,  
Rose and Yount.

<HEADLINE> Albright Urges Nuclear Test Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- On the eve of the third anniversary of President  
Clinton's signing of a treaty to ban all nuclear weapons tests, 
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright appealed Thursday to the 
Senate to join the 45 nations that have approved the pact. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking at the Association of the City Bar of New York,  
Albright said the ban helps curb the spread of nuclear weapons by 
putting explosive tests ``out of bounds for good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States can maintain a safe and reliable nuclear  
weapons defense without tests, Albright said, and is capable of 
detecting tests conducted by other countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``Americans and people around the world do not want to live in a  
world in which nuclear testing is business as usual,'' Albright 
said. ``They do not want to make it easy or acceptable for nuclear 
weapons to spread further.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three years ago on Friday, Clinton became the first world leader  
to sign the treaty. It banned underground weapons tests, the only 
kind permitted after the late President John F. Kennedy signed a 
treaty in 1963 to outlaw nuclear testing in the atmosphere or under 
water. 
</P>
<P>
	Ratification requires the approval of tow-thirds of the Senate.  
</P>
<P>
	A leader in the drive, former Sen. James Exon, D-Neb., pledged  
to do all he could to secure the required votes. But, in an 
interview, he said Clinton had to do more ``and give this some 
additional visibility from the bully pulpit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton approved the treaty after some debate within the  
administration over whether there should be an exemption for very 
limited testing to keep the U.S. nuclear arsenal up to date.

<HEADLINE> Flooding Causing Hurricane Deaths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The way hurricanes kill has changed, with the  
majority of lives now being claimed by inland flooding rather than 
the long-feared coastal storm surges. 
</P>
<P>
	The nearly 70 U.S. fatalities attributed to Hurricane Floyd so  
far make it the deadliest hurricane since Agnes, 27 years ago. And 
``it will again be freshwater flooding that was the cause of the 
majority of the deaths,'' said hurricane forecaster Ed Rappaport. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, inland flooding is most evident in North Carolina and New  
Jersey, where heavy hurricane rains overwhelmed rivers and drainage 
systems inundating large areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the era of modern warnings and evacuations, the  
wind-driven waves known as storm surges were the greatest killers, 
claiming thousands of lives along coastlines. 
</P>
<P>
	Of 415 drownings blamed on hurricanes since 1970, a total of  
292, or 71 percent, occurred in inland freshwater floods, Rappaport 
reports in a study being prepared for publication later this year. 
By contrast, just 62 were shoreline drownings and five were in the 
storm surges. 
</P>
<P>
	That's a far cry from decades earlier when powerful storms often  
caused hundreds of deaths with the storm surge, a massive wall of 
water driven ashore by the hurricane. Indeed, the greatest natural 
disaster in U.S. history took place 99 years ago when a hurricane 
storm surge swept over Galveston, Texas, claiming an estimated 
8,000 lives. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that the greatest potential for a loss of large  
magnitude is still the coast,'' Rappaport said, attributing the 
decline in storm surge deaths to improved forecasts and storm 
warnings and the willingness of people to move away from the coast 
when threatened. 
</P>
<P>
	And there has been some luck along the way too. For example,  
last year's Hurricane Georges was forecast to cross the Florida 
Keys as a category 3 storm, but weakened to a category 2. If it had 
strengthened instead, there could have been many fatalities, 
Rappaport said. 
</P>
<P>
	While people are increasingly aware of the storm surge danger at  
the coast, they know less of the hazard of inland flooding, he 
said, often waiting too long to react and then driving into danger. 
</P>
<P>
	``At least 20 percent of the (drownings) were people who were  
in, or attempting to abandon, their vehicles. Almost all of these 
were on, or near, freshwater-flooded roads,'' Rappaport noted in 
his study. 
</P>
<P>
	In his paper, Rappaport estimated that hurricanes have killed a  
total of about 25,000 people in the United States since the 
American Revolution, mostly in storm surges. 
</P>
<P>
	He focused closely on the period from 1970 to 1998, however, and  
found the shift to inland flooding as the greatest hazard. During 
that period, he found 517 deaths directly attributable to 59 
different tropical storms and hurricanes 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 517 fatalities, 295 died in inland counties, 128 in  
coastal counties, 55 offshore and 39 in locations that could not be 
determined. Besides those who drowned, others died of wind-related 
injuries, were killed by tornadoes associated with the hurricanes 
or from building failures, lightning, hypothermia or in downed 
aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	``Large losses occurred in several tropical cyclones, with more  
than 100 fatalities in Agnes, mostly due to inland flooding in the 
Northeastern states. In numerous instances, loss of life was large 
even after the storm had little or no remaining surface 
circulation,'' he reported, including Charley in 1998, 13 deaths; 
Alberto in 1994, 34 deaths, and Amelia in 1978, 33 deaths. ``For 
these systems, like Agnes, inland flooding from rain was the 
culprit,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> JonBenet Ramsey Grand Jury Resumes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- The grand jury investigating the slaying  
of JonBenet Ramsey returned to work Thursday for the first time in 
four months, facing a deadline only a month away to complete its 
task. 
</P>
<P>
	The 12 members are meeting in secret, as required under grand  
jury rules. 
</P>
<P>
	JonBenet was found beaten and strangled in the basement of her  
parents' home on Dec. 26, 1996. Police said the 6-year-old beauty 
queen's parents, John and Patsy Ramsey, are under an ``umbrella of 
suspicion.'' They have maintained their innocence. 
</P>
<P>
	District Attorney Alex Hunter turned to the grand jury after the  
case bogged down over accusations that police bungled the 
investigation early on by allowing John Ramsey to search the house 
for evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	The grand jury began investigating the slaying last September.  
</P>
<P>
	Boulder County officials said Hunter and the grand jury would  
have to come up with new information to justify more funds for the 
grand jury and the investigation, which has already cost the county 
more than $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Among witnesses who are said to have testified are police,  
forensics experts and friends and relatives of the Ramseys, 
including JonBenet's brother, Burke. Her parents are not believed 
to have made an appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	The grand jury could issue an indictment, put out a report  
without bringing any charges, or disband without taking any action.

<HEADLINE> Senate Blocks Oil Royalty Overhaul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Over objections that oil companies are ripping  
off taxpayers, the Senate voted Thursday to block the Interior 
Department from revamping the way it collects royalties on oil and 
gas taken from federal land. 
</P>
<P>
	By a 51-47 vote, oil-state senators won a weeklong struggle to  
put a provision into a $14 billion Interior Department spending 
bill that directs the department not to impose the proposed fee 
changes for a year. 
</P>
<P>
	For nearly two years, the department has tried to change the way  
royalties are calculated, arguing that the government is being 
shortchanged by $5.6 million a month. The government collects about 
$1.2 billion annually from the 12.5 percent oil royalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil-state senators argued the fee change amounts to an  
additional tax at a time oil companies are in economic trouble. 
``What is being proposed is unfair,'' declared Sen. Kay Bailey 
Hutchison, R-Texas., who led the campaign block the Interior 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote on Hutchison's amendment cleared the way for a final  
approval of the spending bill that provides money for the Interior 
Department as well as energy conservation, forest programs and 
subsidies for the arts. The bill was passed 89-10 and now must be 
reconciled with a House-approved version. 
</P>
<P>
	The oil royalty issue had stymied action on the bill for a week  
as a group of Democrats, led by Sen. Barbara Boxer of California, 
refused to allow a vote. After failing to cut off debate last week, 
supporters mustered the 60 votes earlier Thursday to move the 
matter forward. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., said the Interior proposal is ``a  
scheme that is unnecessarily complicated, unworkable and absurd. 
... It's federal government mooching.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Currently the value of oil taken from federal land is determined  
at the wellhead by the oil companies themselves. The Interior 
proposal would peg the value to the oil's fair market price, taking 
into account certain costs. Critics of the current system say oil 
companies now undervalue the oil by as much as $4 to $5 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hutchison said the higher royalties amount to a new tax and  
will raise the cost to oil companies, increasing the price of oil. 
``Who is going to pay? It's going to be the hard working Americans 
who fills up his or her gas tank,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Boxer maintained that the oil companies themselves have  
acknowledged manipulating the numbers and undervaluing the oil and 
gas they take from federal land and from offshore wells. 
</P>
<P>
	A half dozen oil companies in a lawsuit being heard in Texas  
have settled to avoid trial, paying $230 million, she noted. States 
have also collected millions of dollars because of underpayments 
for oil take from state lands, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This allows the oil companies to continue this cozy  
arrangement where they decide what they're going to pay the federal 
government,'' said Boxer. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wis., a staunch advocate for campaign  
finance reform, noted that senators leading the fight against the 
royalty proposal also are the top recipients of oil industry 
campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody's attempting to do anybody a favor,'' said Domenici.  
``What we're talking about is simple, plain fairness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchison has received $1.2 million in oil and gas industry  
contributions since 1993, more than any other senator, and Domenici 
$186,289, sixth highest, according to the Center for Responsive 
Politics. 
</P>
<P>
	The spending measure includes $658 million for energy  
conservation programs, $154 million less than what the Clinton 
administration had requested and $34 million less than provided 
this year. Some senators objected to conservation programs being 
used to push climate change programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also would block an executive order issued by President  
Clinton earlier this year that requires federal agencies to 
significantly cut energy use because of a dispute over fuels to be 
used. 
</P>
<P>
	An attempt by Sen. Conrad Burns, R-Mont., to permanently bar  
introduction of grizzly bears in the Bitterroot Wilderness in Idaho 
and Montana was rejected. But the bill blocks any bears from being 
put into the area before Oct. 1, 2000.

<HEADLINE> Memphis Has Tough Task vs. Vols </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- For Memphis, the timing probably  
couldn't be worse. 
</P>
<P>
	It's bad enough that the unranked Tigers (1-2) arrive Saturday  
to face No. 7 Tennessee (1-1) for the first time since Memphis 
broke a string of 15 straight losses to the Vols with a 21-17 upset 
in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Tigers also come seven days after Tennessee's 23-21 loss  
to Southeastern Conference rival Florida, a defeat that could 
severely hurt its chances of repeating as national champion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure that there is a good time'' to play Tennessee,  
Memphis coach Rip Scherer said. ``I didn't know there was a good 
time. I'd just as soon be playing James Madison or somebody. ... I 
mean, I am sure they are upset about losing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee coach Phillip Fulmer sets his jaw, tries to put his  
sixth loss in seven games to the Gators behind him and looks to 
Saturday's contest. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's not going to be a letdown, ain't going to happen,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Volunteers coaches reviewed the Florida game, in which the  
Vols' fourth-quarter comeback fell short, and judged it a success 
in effort if not execution. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whenever you have 13 penalties called on you as an offense and  
you give up seven sacks, it is hard to win,'' offensive coordinator 
Randy Sanders said. ``We can't beat many folks playing like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quarterback Tee Martin, who is ready to play despite a shoulder  
injury against Florida, said he is eager to see how the Vols bounce 
back. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can only go up,'' he said. ``As bad as we played we only  
lost by two points. That shows you how good we were, and I know how 
good we are. The rest of the year, we are just going to have to 
have better concentration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fulmer is impressed that even in losses, Memphis held  
Mississippi and Mississippi State to a combined 16 points. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tigers have ``a very challenging (defensive) scheme that we  
don't see typically. They have a multitude of movement and blitzes 
and potential for problems out there,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tigers coordinator John Thompson threw a similar scheme at the  
Vols when he ran the defense at Southern Miss. The Vols won those 
games handily in 1995 and 1997, but it still posed a challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders said the Tigers ``at times will look like minnows in a  
bucket, moving around everywhere. It is one of those schemes that 
if you don't make your plays and you don't stay aggressive, you can 
look ugly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee hasn't lost two consecutive games since 1994.  
</P>
<P>
	``They are a prideful team and a team that does not lose very  
often,'' Scherer said. ``So I would anticipate that their mentality 
will not be real positive. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's something we have no control over. We are coming up  
there to play our tails off and to try to win the football game, 
and whatever Tennessee's mentality is -- we respect the daylights 
out of them -- but we really can't worry that much about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Tigers' 1996 upset of the then sixth-ranked Vols in Memphis  
still haunts Tennessee. At the time, Fulmer called it ``the most 
disappointing game I've coached'' and Vols coaches still point to 
it as an example of why no opponent should ever be overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of guys have that Memphis game lingering in the back of  
their head,'' Tennessee linebacker Raynoch Thompson said. ``They're 
not putting what happened behind them.''

</P>
<P>
	stable of seven alternative weekly newspapers, including

<HEADLINE> China Rejects U.S. Explanation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- China today assailed a widening probe into  
allegations of nuclear espionage and rejected a U.S. explanation 
that NATO's bombing of the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia last May 
was a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite attempts by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to  
project a spirit of U.S.-Sino cooperation, Foreign Minister Tang 
Jiaxuan chose to emphasize what he called ``obstructions'' in the 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	He rejected as ``irresponsible and false'' allegations the  
Chinese may have obtained secret information about the design of 
the most advanced U.S. nuclear warhead, the W-88. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Janet Reno and FBI Director Louis J. Freeh have  
expanded an inquiry that was centered on mishandling of classified 
material at the Los Alamos National Laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
	Tang also lit into the United States over its explanation that  
the embassy bombing during the conflict to rid Kosovo of Serb 
troops and special police was a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot accept the explanation,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Tang welcomed moves by the United States to compensate the  
families of the three people killed and the 27 injured in the 
attack. But he added: ``The United States is obligated to offer a 
more satisfactory explanation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Albright, appearing with him at a joint news conference,  
appeared taken aback. ``It is difficult when one is giving the true 
explanation and the other side is rejecting it,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can only repeat it was a mistake,'' Albright said.  
</P>
<P>
	Faulty maps and other errors were said by the United States to  
be the reason for the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	On another touchy front, Tang assailed the president of Taiwan,  
Lee Teng-hui, for saying relations with China should be considered 
on a ``state-to-state or at least special state-to-state'' basis 
</P>
<P>
	Lee, the first democratically elected president of Taiwan, said  
in comments published Saturday that relations with China should be 
considered on a ``state-to-state or at least special 
state-to-state'' basis and that ``greater China,'' including 
Taiwan, should be broken up into seven regions and governed as a 
federation. 
</P>
<P>
	Tang called Lee a troublemaker and said his views were an  
obstacle to better U.S.-Sino relations. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright again tried to smooth over the discord.  
</P>
<P>
	She reiterated U.S. policy is to recognize only one China, and  
she said China and Taiwan should be concentrating now on helping 
the people of Taiwan to recover from the enormous earthquake that 
struck Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright began the joint news conference trying to emphasize  
areas of cooperation, in Asia and especially over East Timor. But 
Tang took the discourse into a negative direction.

<HEADLINE>  Mars Orbiter Presumed Destroyed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- A $125 million spacecraft meant to be  
NASA's first interplanetary weather satellite was presumed 
destroyed today after it failed to regain contact with Earth 
following a critical engine firing to place it in orbit around 
Mars. 
</P>
<P>
	A preliminary analysis shows the Mars Climate Orbiter approached  
Mars too closely and likely broke into pieces or burned up in the 
atmosphere, said operations project manager Richard Cook of NASA's 
Jet Propulsion Laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem likely stemmed from human or software error, not a  
mechanical problem with the spacecraft, he said. The cause is being 
investigated. 
</P>
<P>
	The orbiter was believed to have come within 37 miles of Mars'  
surface at about 2 a.m., just as the probe's main engines were 
firing for orbit insertion. The lowest survivable close encounter 
is believed to be 53 miles, Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe the spacecraft came in at a lower altitude than we  
predicted,'' he said. ``Depending on how low that was, it could be 
the total loss of the mission.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Until final altitude numbers become available, the giant  
antennas of NASA's Deep Space Network were scanning the skies in 
search of a signal from the probe. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said the loss will not hurt the space program in the  
long run. 
</P>
<P>
	``We intend this to be a case of science delayed, not science  
lost,'' said Carl Pilcher, of NASA's Office of Space Science. 
</P>
<P>
	The orbiter, one of two probes scheduled to arrive at the red  
planet this year to study the weather and search for evidence of 
water, should have regained contact with Earth at 2:26 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	The probe was behind the planet and out of radio contact during  
most of the 17-minute engine firing that should have placed it in 
orbit. Contact should have been established by 2:30 a.m. at the 
latest. 
</P>
<P>
	The orbiter and its companion, the Mars Polar Lander, carried  
instruments designed to discover the fate of water believed to have 
once formed rivers or lakes on the planet. Mission scientists say 
water is the key to determining whether life ever existed on Mars. 
</P>
<P>
	The separately launched lander, due to arrive Dec. 3, was  
supposed to use the orbiter as a communications relay. But the 
lander also can communicate directly with Earth, and the already 
orbiting Mars Global Surveyor can act as a limited relay as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Both probes are part of a $327.5 million mission collectively  
known as Mars Surveyor '98, NASA's latest in a series of relatively 
inexpensive robot probes. The orbiter rocketed into space last Dec. 
11 and its sibling probe was launched Jan. 3. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Mars Pathfinder and its rover, Sojourner, explored the  
geology of the planet and found some evidence that water may once 
have flowed. The Mars Global Surveyor, which arrived later that 
year, mapped the surface and found more signs of once-flowing 
water.

<HEADLINE> 2nd Blast Rocks Black Fla. College </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- After a second bomb exploded in less  
than a month at Florida's historically black university, some 
students said they no longer felt safe going to classes or even 
staying in their dorm rooms. 
</P>
<P>
	However, others vowed to return to class at Florida A&AMP;M  
University today, saying that staying away would mean a victory for 
whoever made racist telephone threats before and after the blast. 
</P>
<P>
	``What they would love for us to do is not to show up,'' said  
Derric Heck, a junior from Brunswick, Ga., and the student 
government vice president. ``Let them know that our education 
cannot be stopped.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fire officials said the pipe bomb went off Wednesday in a  
first-floor men's room in Perry Paige Hall, which was full of 
students in classrooms, labs and offices. No one was injured, but 
classes were canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	Some students said they didn't want to stay in their dorms and  
planned to spend the night off campus. 
</P>
<P>
	``Telling a freshman to not be afraid as they lay their head  
down for the night is something I can't see,'' said Nekeisha 
Briggs, a senior from New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	A caller phoned a warning into a local television station around  
the time the bomb went off, just as happened Aug. 31 when a bomb 
went off in a campus administration building. No one was injured in 
that blast. 
</P>
<P>
	A warning that more violence could ensue came into the TV  
station later in the day, in a second call laced with profanity and 
racial slurs. 
</P>
<P>
	``FAMU has seen the beginning of this ... they got no business  
having a college where there ain't nobody ... smart enough to get a 
degree .... This is just the beginning, brother,'' station WTXL-TV 
quoted the caller as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials weren't saying much about the calls and said they had  
no direct evidence the two bombings were related. But ``there are 
obvious, common sense connections you could make,'' said Byron 
Price, FBI supervisor in Tallahassee. 
</P>
<P>
	Security was stepped up after the August blast, and security  
guards were on duty in dormitories overnight Wednesday. 
Administrators assured students that law enforcement was working to 
make sure the campus was safe.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Feeling Ryder Cup Pressure  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROOKLINE, Mass. (AP) -- Imagine facing a 3-2 pitch in the bottom  
of the ninth in the World Series. Standing at the free throw line 
with the score tied and one second left in the NBA Finals. Staring 
at a 6-foot putt to win the Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	Pressure in the Ryder Cup is every bit of that.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's like playing golf in the middle of the Super Bowl,''  
Sweden's Jesper Parnevik said of the biennial matches between the 
United States and Europe, which start Friday at The Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
	The pulse quickens, legs turn to mush, palms get clammy -- and  
that's just when flags are raised and anthems are played during the 
opening ceremony. Walk to the first tee to hit the first shot in 
the first match, and the pressure gets insufferable. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing that stands still is the shaft of the club, and  
that's before you take the club out of the bag,'' two-time Masters 
champion Jose Maria Olazabal said. ``Everything shakes -- hands, 
legs, everything. There's nothing you can do to avoid that. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what makes it so special.''  
</P>
<P>
	Tom Lehman played his first Ryder Cup in 1995 and was called  
upon to hit the first shot of the matches. He used a 3-wood, which 
goes about 250 yards under normal circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
	``It went 320,'' Lehman said. ``So, where was my blood pressure?  
You figure it out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a most complicated game, played this week in the most  
unpredictable format, understanding what is at stake for the U.S. 
team in the next three days is simple. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to win,'' Lehman said.  
</P>
<P>
	Never mind that the British invented the game, or that an  
English seed merchant named Samuel Ryder dreamed up this concept in 
1927 of matching the best players on both sides of the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans come to the Ryder Cup with better credentials, a  
cast that includes Tiger Woods, David Duval, Davis Love III, Payne 
Stewart -- no player lower than 28th in the world rankings. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got the 12 best players in the world,'' Jeff Maggert  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	What they don't have is the cup. Europe has won or retained the  
Ryder Cup five times in the past seven matches. Still, it returns 
every year as the underdog. And even though it owns the cup, 
another victory would be considered another major upset. 
</P>
<P>
	That's just what Europe wants to hear.  
</P>
<P>
	``They must be under pressure, being the 12 best players in the  
world, according to themselves,'' England's Lee Westwood said. 
</P>
<P>
	``People at home are all hoping we're going to win, not  
expecting us to win,'' Darren Clarke of Northern Ireland said. 
``And that's a huge difference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to the pressure for the United States is the rift over  
Ryder Cup revenue, estimated at $63 million with a net profit of 
$23 million for the PGA of America. Woods and Duval led a faction 
of U.S. players who want some of that money, at least for charities 
of their choice. 
</P>
<P>
	The PGA says it will have such a plan in place by the end of the  
year, but the damage has been done. Another loss, and the Americans 
will look like greedy millionaires who have everything but a 
17-inch gold chalice that money can't buy. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the Americans can find the passion to win from captain  
Ben Crenshaw, who goes by the nickname ``Gentle Ben'' but who also 
broke his putter during a fit of rage during the 1987 Ryder Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's terribly important for us,'' Crenshaw said. ``I think  
everyone knows that for our side, not having success in the last 
few occasions. We've felt that sting twice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another loss surely is possible.  
</P>
<P>
	After all, this is match play, the most fickle format in golf,  
especially over 18 holes. The match is decided by who wins the most 
holes, not who shoots the lowest score. All it takes is one player 
to make a couple of long putts, or hole a shot from the bunker, for 
momentum to shift and the lead to become insurmountable. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we can beat anybody,'' Westwood said. ``This format  
leads to shocks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With 28 matches worth one point each over three days, no team  
has won by more than two points since 1987. In the past five Ryder 
Cups, the United States has won 70 1/2 points, compared with 69 1/2 for 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	``A few rolls of the ball here, a rub of the green there, a bit  
of luck in the middle, and the match can go either way,'' European 
captain Mark James said. ``There's an element of luck, and I think 
you have to be aware of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woods is regarded as one of the best in match play, particularly  
since he became the first man to win the U.S. Amateur three 
straight times. But as great as he is, Woods lost a crucial singles 
match to Costantino Rocca, a former factory worker in Italy, in the 
Ryder Cup at Valderrama, Spain, two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``In match play in 18 holes, all it takes is just one shot here  
and there, especially on the back nine,'' Woods said. ``If we can 
make those putts at the crucial times, who knows? We could turn it 
around and get the cup back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If not, the pressure will build with every shot on every hole.  
The teams are decided over a two-year process (one year for 
Europe), so some may not be playing at their best. Mark O'Meara, 
the Masters and British Open champion of 1998, hasn't won this year 
and has offered to sit out some of the matches. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can show up this week and play very bad, and that's when  
the pressure turns into fear and panic,'' Parnevik said. ``And you 
don't want to be here.''

<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Jeff Cunningham scored twice to lead the Columbus  
Crew to a 2-1 victory over the Chicago Fire on Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago's Roman Kosecki opened the scoring in the third minute  
on a free kick that beat Crew goalkeeper Mark Dougherty. 
</P>
<P>
	Cunningham tied it three minutes later and added the game-winner  
in the 21st minute. Andy Williams assisted on Cunningham's second 
goal, which squirted in from about eight yards out. 
</P>
<P>
	Both teams have already clinched playoff berths but are looking  
to improve their home field advantage in the postseason. 
</P>

	The Fire was playing its final home game of the regular season  
without Josh Wolff, who underwent knee surgery Thursday, while 
Robert Warzycha of the Crew was sidelined after receiving a yellow

<HEADLINE> Vols' Loudermilk Out for Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Tennessee kicker Robert Loudermilk will  
miss the rest of the season because of a stress fracture in his 
lower back. 
</P>
<P>
	The fifth-year senior had tests Wednesday showing damage to one  
of his lower vertebrae. Loudermilk has a condition called 
scoliosis, or curvature of the spine, and kicking apparently 
aggravated it. 
</P>
<P>
	He has been receiving treatments but the pain got worse on  
Monday, his father, Bob Loudermilk, told The Tennessean. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Phillip Fulmer said freshman Alex Walls will take over the  
place-kicking duties and punter David Leaverton will kick off. 
</P>
<P>
	Loudermilk, who is from Brentwood, Tenn., walked on at Tennessee  
because he had grown up a Volunteers fan. It took him five years to 
win the starting job and he got to kick in two games. 
</P>
<P>
	He missed his only field goal attempt, against Wyoming, and was  
perfect on nine points-after against the Cowboys and Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just very tough, to work as hard as Robert has and then  
get into the first two games of the season and have this happen to 
him,'' Bob Loudermilk said. ``It's a broken dream, but life goes 
on.''

<HEADLINE> 400 Richest in U.S. Top $1 Trillion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The 400 richest Americans for the first time  
have collectively amassed $1 trillion, a figure greater than the 
gross domestic product of China, according to Forbes magazine, 
which issued its annual ranking of the nation's wealthiest people 
on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft Corp. chairman Bill Gates once again led the list with  
a net worth of $85 billion, up from last year's $59 billion. The 
total number of billionaires on the annual list increased by 79 to 
268, making 1999 the first time billionaires made up more than half 
the list, Forbes said in its issued dated Oct. 11. 
</P>
<P>
	Second on the list was Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, with a  
net worth of $40 billion. Warren Buffett, chairman of Berkshire 
Hathaway Inc., ranked third with $31 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Ballmer, Microsoft's president was No. 4 with $23 billion,  
and No. 5 was Dell Computer chief executive officer Michael Dell, 
with $20 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes said the 400 had an average net worth of $2.6 billion,  
which would give them a total worth around $1.04 trillion, up from 
$738 billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The soaring stock market helped land 60 new names on this year's  
list, 35 of them billionaires. Of the rookies, 19 made fortunes 
from Internet-related businesses, including Amazon.com chairman 
Jeffrey Bezos, ranked 18th with a net worth of $7.8 billion. Jay 
Walker, founder of the online merchant Priceline.com, who was 
ranked 43rd with $4.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street also helped some on the list become billionaires  
almost overnight. No. 68 Gary Winnick joined the billionaires club 
just 18 months after founding Global Crossing, which is building a 
global fiber optic telecommunications network. 
</P>
<P>
	The minimum net worth needed to qualify for the Forbes 400 rose  
to $625 million from $500 million in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	A college degree was not required to make the list -- at least 63  
members never graduated college and their net worth averaged was 
$4.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 40 percent of the list, or 149 members, got rich the easy  
way: They inherited some or all of their wealth. Their average net 
worth was $2.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The 251 members who made it rich on their own had an average net  
worth of $2.7 billion. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Calif. Cracks Down on Gas Cans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- A state board Thursday adopted new  
regulations for portable gas cans in an effort to curb pollution 
from spills and fumes. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's really astounding is the amount of emissions we get  
from gasoline cans,'' said Allan Hirsch, spokesman for the Air 
Resources Board, the state's top air-quality enforcer. 
</P>
<P>
	The board's scientists say the gas containers -- there are more  
than 10 million of them in California -- emit daily pollution 
equivalent to a million automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
	The rules require that cans be spill-proof, made of impermeable  
material and block fumes. The spouts would have drip shields. 
</P>
<P>
	The regulations will be phased in gradually beginning in 2001.  
</P>
<P>
	The changes could triple the cost of a portable gasoline  
container, which typically costs less than $6 now. 
</P>
<P>
	Manufacturers say the new rules go too far, and fear that once  
California adopts the regulations, other states will follow suit.

<HEADLINE>  Sotheby's Begins Baseball Auction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Step right up, folks. The most breathtaking  
collection of baseball memorabilia imaginable, everything from Moe 
Berg's spy camera to Bill Buckner's faulty glove, is up for bid 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
	One word of caution. Bring a checkbook and be prepared to write  
a lot of zeroes. Barry Halper's stuff is not cheap. The entire 
collection is estimated between $7 million and $11 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think that's a bit conservative,'' said David Goodwillie,  
who heads the sports collectibles department at Sotheby's Auction 
House. ``We wouldn't be surprised if it reaches $15 million or 
more. So much of it is unique, pieces that have never been sold 
before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 20 percent of Halper's collection was purchased by major  
league baseball for $6 million and is now housed at the Hall of 
Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y. The remainder is to be auctioned by 
Sotheby's over the next week. More accustomed to handling estate 
sales of art and furniture, the auction house needed two floors of 
its Manhattan building to house the Halper collection. 
</P>
<P>
	The whole operation is watched over by a larger-than-life wax  
figure of Babe Ruth, listed from $3,500 to $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
	There's a framed display of canceled paychecks for the 1920  
Cincinnati Reds. Their most expensive player was Hall of Famer Edd 
Roush, who was getting a fancy $425 every two weeks. He batted 
.339, third in the National League, that season. 
</P>
<P>
	One customer, awed by the number of items on display, said of  
Halper, ``He must have a very understanding wife.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He'd have to just to accommodate the uniform jerseys that cover  
three walls at Sotheby's and rode on a dry cleaning rack in the 
basement of his home. 
</P>
<P>
	The jerseys include one from home run king Hank Aaron that's  
inscribed, ``I hit a few in this,'' and another identified as among 
those Pete Rose wore the night he broke Ty Cobb's hit record. If 
you prefer something straight from Cobb, his dentures are 
available. 
</P>
<P>
	In another corner are first baseman Buckner's glove and cleats  
from the sixth game of the 1986 World Series. Buckner's 10th inning 
error enabled the New York Mets to beat Boston and the Mets went on 
to win the Series in seven games. 
</P>
<P>
	The glove is accompanied by a card from Buckner to Halper which  
contains a misspelling. It says: ``To my pal, Barry. This glove has 
way to many holes in it. This is the glove I wore when I missed 
Mookie Wilson's ground ball in the sixth game. What a nightmare.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Berg's spy camera dates to a 1934 barnstorming trip through  
Japan when the mysterious catcher was frequently missing from the 
other players, off taking reconnaissance pictures for the United 
States government that proved helpful when World War II began. 
</P>
<P>
	The most expensive item for sale is a collection of 16 World  
Series rings from former New York Yankees owner Del Webb, a 
co-owner of the team during its dynasty years of 1947-64. They are 
listed from $100,000 to $200,000 in the two-volume Sotheby's 
catalog, which costs $80. 
</P>
<P>
	The auction began Thursday night with 133 lots up for bids in  
the first of 16 sessions. It continues through Sept. 29 with 2,500 
lots for sale. 
</P>
<P>
	Another 5,500 pieces, most of them priced under $1,000, will go  
on sale at Sotheby's Internet site, which will be launched in 
November. There is a 15 percent buyer's premium for items up to 
$50,000 and 10 percent after that. 
</P>
<P>
	Halper, a Livingston, N.J. businessman and minority owner of the  
Yankees, began his collection simply with player autographs. It 
just grew from there. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodwillie, who spent two years after college playing Class-A  
baseball at Newark, Ohio, said, ``Barry never asked me for my 
autograph.''

<HEADLINE> City of Miami Charged in Bond Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The city of Miami and two top officials defrauded  
investors on three 1995 bond offerings by presenting a rosy picture 
of city finances when deficits were secretly mounting, federal 
regulators say. 
</P>
<P>
	The following year, a $68 million hole in city funds was  
uncovered when corruption charges brought in a new administration. 
The city is still operating under a state financial oversight 
board. 
</P>
<P>
	The administrative complaint filed Wednesday by the Securities  
and Exchange Commission charged the city, former city manager Cesar 
Odio and former finance director Manohar Surana with fraudulent 
bond sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC is seeking no fines but wants a cease-and-desist order  
requiring the city to give an accurate picture of its finances in 
future securities offerings. 
</P>
<P>
	John Incorvaia, who follows Miami finances for Moody's Investors  
Service, said the SEC charges should have no impact on the city's 
bond ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	Previous disclosures about $116.5 million in bond sales cited by  
the SEC hurt the ratings when new city management disclosed the 
extent of city deficits. 
</P>
<P>
	The city issued misleading documents before the sales and  
provided inaccurate financial statements afterward, the SEC 
charged. 
</P>
<P>
	The city plans to fight the charges along with a lawsuit filed  
by its old auditors, Deloitte &AMP; Touche. The city claims it was 
unaware of its own financial state, but auditors said city 
officials were fully informed. 
</P>
<P>
	Donald Bierman, attorney for Odio, said he ``depended upon his  
staff and believed at all times that the city, while it had its 
traditional cash shortfall, was solvent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Josefsburg, attorney for Surana, did not return a call  
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Odio spent nearly a year in federal prison for blocking an FBI  
probe into city contract kickbacks and remains on probation. Surana 
turned government witness after he was implicated in the schemes. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors lost no money on the bonds because there were no  
defaults, but the city might have been required to pay higher rates 
if its financial situation had been fully disclosed.

same dates in February, but their schedule is reversed. Their plan 
is to have the Republicans on Feb. 2 and Democrats on Feb. 3 
</P>
<P>
	New Hampshire's primary is scheduled for Feb. 8.  
</P>
<P>
	The New Hampshire Primary Debate Partnership is comprised of The

News, New Hampshire Public Television, an NBC affiliate, and either 
MSNBC or CNBC. PBS will offer a live feed, which is expected to be 
picked up by stations in other states with early primaries. 
</P>
<P>
	WNDS-TV and C-SPAN will host a forum on Oct. 18 that will  
include candidates from both parties.

<HEADLINE> Va. Tech May Be Asked To Leave A-10 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLACKSBURG, Va. (AP) -- Virginia Tech, which plans to join the  
Big East Conference as a full-time member in 2001, may be asked to 
leave the Atlantic 10 Conference next summer, according to A-10 
commissioner Linda Bruno. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want to cut Tech loose with no place to go, but two  
years is a long time,'' Bruno told The Roanoke Times on Wednesday. 
``We want to help Tech, but there's also concern for the league.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tech had planned to remain in the A-10 until its Big East  
membership started in July 2001. If Tech has to leave the A-10 next 
year, it would either move into the Big East early, pending 
approval by other Big East member schools, or spend the 2000-01 
season as an independent in all sports but football and wrestling. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Weaver, Tech's athletic director, said he was unaware of the  
possibility of an early exit from the A-10. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know nothing about it,'' he said. ``... Obviously, the  
league doesn't feel strongly enough about it yet to let Virginia 
Tech know what's going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Big East deal, announced Aug. 24, is contingent on the  
league's current football membership remaining intact for 2001-02.

<HEADLINE> Neuheisel To Face Old School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- It's time for Rick Neuheisel to face the  
situation. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, some old friends arrive in town to play Neuheisel's  
new football team, the Washington Huskies. Only this time, his old 
friends, the Colorado Buffaloes, are enemies. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to have to watch it because I'm going to be  
emotional,'' said Colorado linebacker Ty Gregorak, recruited from 
Spokane to play football in Boulder. ``It's a big game for me 
personally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's a big game for Colorado, which feels Neuheisel betrayed the  
Buffaloes for big bucks after a 51-43 victory over Oregon in the 
Aloha Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington was on that same bowl doubleheader in Honolulu last  
Christmas. The Huskies lost to Air Force 45-25 in the Oahu Bowl, a 
loss that probably cost coach Jim Lambright his job. 
</P>
<P>
	When Washington athletic director Barbara Hedges received  
permission from Colorado AD Dick Tharp to talk to Neuheisel in 
January, she sold him on the Huskies with a $997,000-a-season, 
five-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Colorado players felt Neuheisel had led them to believe he  
had made a lifetime commitment to stay in Boulder. 
</P>
<P>
	After accepting the Washington job, Neuheisel flew back to  
Colorado to talk to his former players. They were shook up. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the end of the speech, he said, `Does anyone have anything  
to say?' It was silent for about a minute. I just said, `See you 
the 25th,''' Gregorak said. ``I can't believe it's already here. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt like it just flew by. I can't wait for it to come.''  
</P>
<P>
	The players Neuheisel recruited to Colorado could make  
Washington's worst start since 1985 even worse. A victory by the 
Buffaloes would make the Huskies 0-3 for the first time since 1969, 
when they lost their first nine games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Huskies, short on talent and depth, lost to Air Force 31-21  
last Saturday for their first defeat in a home opener since 1985. 
They were beaten 35-28 in their opening game at BYU. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado was upset by Colorado State 41-14 in its opener in  
Denver, then beat San Jose State 63-35 and Kansas 51-17. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew it was coming,'' Neuheisel said. ``If it helps them  
prepare for the game using a revenge factor or anything like that, 
`Let's get the coach, he left us, that kind of a thing,' then I'm 
sure they'll try to use it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neuheisel remembers Gregorak's promise.  
</P>
<P>
	``That was a very emotional day,'' he said. ``I'm sure he's  
looking forward to the contest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neuheisel defended his decision to bolt Colorado, where he  
replaced Bill McCartney in 1995, and go to Washington, where the 
program began to unravel last season when the Huskies were 6-6. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado replaced Neuheisel by luring Gary Barnett from  
Northwestern. Like Neuheisel, Barnett had said he didn't intend to 
leave. Like Neuheisel, he left. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think both of us fully believed that,'' Neuheisel said. ``I  
don't think there's any question that both of us fully believed 
that we could stay at those particular institutions for a long time 
and be very happy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was not unhappy at Colorado. That wasn't why I left. I was  
given a fantastic opportunity at a fantastic university that forced 
me to explore and upon exploration I made the best decision for 
myself and for my family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Colorado's players aren't happy with Neuheisel's decision,  
Neuheisel isn't happy with Barnett's remarks about minor recruiting 
violations that occurred after he arrived in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Neuheisel says Barnett insinuated on TV that Neuheisel lied  
about having no knowledge he was violating NCAA rules when he sent 
five coaches to visit prospects during a mandated quiet period 
shortly after both coaches were hired. 
</P>
<P>
	``He never directly called me a liar,'' Neuheisel said, ``but  
anyone looking at that footage would come to that conclusion that 
he thinks that. And that bothers me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Self-imposed penalties by Washington satisfied the Pac-10, which  
took no further action. The penalties include loss of recruiting 
time later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	With all the sniping between the coaches, one could be led to  
believe a feud has developed. Asked if there was any bad blood 
between them, Barnett said, ``No ... Does that shock everybody?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barnett even went as far as to say that time has caused the game  
to lose its emotional edge. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this game was played six months ago, it would have been an  
issue,'' Barnett said. ``I don't think it's an issue now. I think 
us losing to Colorado State has taken most of all that out of this 
team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That will be seen Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Has Money-Laundering Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration today unveiled its  
first national money-laundering strategy, aimed at stanching the 
flow of billions of criminal dollars through the U.S. financial 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	The package of proposed new laws and rules comes as federal  
investigators examine allegations of a huge money-laundering scheme 
involving Russians and the Bank of New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``Money laundering is a very sophisticated crime and we must be  
equally sophisticated,'' Attorney General Janet Reno said at a news 
conference. Money laundering, she said, ``directly impacts each and 
every hard-working American.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The scheme of cleansing criminal (money) through legitimate  
bank accounts of hard-working Americans must be stopped,'' said 
Reno, who was joined by Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers. 
</P>
<P>
	The new strategy seeks to bolster international cooperation in  
investigating money laundering and strengthen U.S. enforcement 
through tighter regulation of banks and other financial 
institutions. It includes a requirement that storefront check 
cashiers, brokerage firms and casinos notify authorities of 
suspicious activities the way banks must do. The government would 
designate new high-intensity money-laundering zones. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposals are aimed at combating the cleaning of  
drug-trafficking profits and other illicit gains by cycling them 
through the financial system. Congress directed the Treasury and 
Justice departments to submit the new strategy early this year, 
before the case involving the Bank of New York broke. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration is ``on the same path we're on,'' said Rep.  
Spencer Bachus, R-Ala., chairman of the House Banking subcommittee 
on monetary policy and a key author of legislation to fight money 
laundering. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of New York episode ``certainly brought it home to  
everyone,'' Bachus said Wednesday in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal investigators, meanwhile, are working hard to unravel  
the alleged money-laundering scheme involving the bank, James 
Robinson, assistant attorney general in charge of the Justice 
Department's criminal division, testified Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian businesses and individuals -- including organized crime  
groups -- are suspected of illegally channeling as much as $10 
billion through the Bank of New York, the nation's 15th-largest and 
said to be its oldest. 
</P>
<P>
	No one has been charged. On Tuesday, Switzerland's government  
announced that Swiss banks have frozen $16.8 million in accounts 
suspected to be linked to the case. Authorities in Britain, Russia, 
France and Austria also have been dissecting the complex case. 
</P>
<P>
	USA Today reported today that investigators now believe as many  
as 10 U.S. banks might have been used in the money laundering 
scheme. But it said none have been accused of wrongdoing and that 
all are cooperating with the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been and will continue to be a complex and  
painstaking investigation,'' Robinson said at a House Banking 
Committee hearing. ``Significant investigative resources have been 
and will continue to be expended in an effort to ensure that we 
uncover the full story behind those transactions and bring any 
merited criminal charges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, Robinson noted, ``we have seen with increasing  
frequency suspicious financial transactions emanating from (Russia) 
..., which naturally raise the question of money laundering.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also at Wednesday's hearing, the Bank of New York's chairman  
defended his institution's reputation but acknowledged ``a lapse'' 
by its internal supervisors in allowing questionable accounts to 
stay open. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas A. Renyi, who also is the bank's chief executive officer,  
stressed that no charges have been filed against the bank. 
</P>
<P>
	In response to questions, Renyi confirmed that the son-in-law of  
Russian President Boris Yeltsin maintained accounts at an offshore 
branch of the bank in the Cayman Islands. 
</P>
<P>
	The accounts were in the name of Leonid Dyanchenko, an oil  
trader who is married to Yeltsin's daughter, Tatyana. The 
Washington Post quoted sources in today's editions as saying the 
accounts contained more than $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Manhattan-based Bank of New York, founded in 1784 by Alexander  
Hamilton, has been buffeted by the allegations since they surfaced 
in news reports on Aug. 19. 
</P>
<P>
	``Neither the bank nor any of its customers have lost any money  
as a result of the activities in question,'' Renyi said. ``We have 
cooperated fully with the ongoing investigations.''

<HEADLINE> Microsoft To Spin Off Expedia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	REDMOND, Wash. (AP) -- Microsoft announced Thursday that it is  
spinning off its Internet travel reservation service, Expedia, as a 
separate company, and that it had filed with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission for an initial public offering of stock. 
</P>
<P>
	The spinoff is the latest move by the software giant to  
capitalize on the Internet. It will give investors a chance to 
focus on just one aspect of Microsoft's business and could bring in 
as much as $75 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, Microsoft announced a joint venture with Ford  
that will upgrade Microsoft's CarPoint automobile sales site on the 
Web to allow consumers to order specific new Ford cars and trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	Expedia is one of the leading travel sites on the Internet,  
allowing customers to book airline tickets, hotel rooms and other 
travel needs. 
</P>
<P>
	Since going online in October 1996, Expedia has had gross  
bookings of more than $700 million by more than 860,000 customers, 
the SEC filing said. 
</P>
<P>
	Expedia Inc. said in the filing that the worldwide travel  
industry ``is especially well-suited to benefit from increased 
Internet and electronic commerce adoption.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It cited a Forrester Research finding that travel has already  
become the largest online retail category with estimated 
transactions of $7.8 billion in 1999, and growth forecast to reach 
$32 billion in 2004. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the stock offering, Expedia will become a separate  
company but will have a contractual relationship with Microsoft, 
which will be its majority owner. Money raised in the stock 
offering will be used for working capital and general purposes, the 
SEC filing said. 
</P>
<P>
	Analyst Scott McAdams, president of McAdams Wright Ragen in  
Seattle, said the stock offering could be another way to reward -- 
and retain -- employees who might be tempted by huge stock gains at 
other Internet companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think one of the challenges for Microsoft has been to keep  
the talent from being hired away by other dot-com companies in the 
Northwest and elsewhere,'' McAdams said. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft stock is valuable, but ``it's not in the stratosphere  
like a lot of Internet companies are,'' McAdams said. 
</P>
<P>
	Expedia had revenues of $38.7 million and losses of $19.6  
million for the fiscal year ended in June. Such losses are common 
for Internet startups, which still attract investors convinced they 
are buying a stake in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Microsoft can spin off Expedia and get a very fat  
evaluation on it, it'll be cheap currency to grow their business 
with,'' McAdams said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the Expedia spinoff, Microsoft on Thursday  
released details of how it plans to revamp MSN.com Web gateway with 
a new online shopping service and a Web site to help small 
businesses use the Internet to attract new customers. 
</P>
<P>
	MSN, which began life in the mid-1990s as the Microsoft Network,  
has been frequently modified as technology and competition changed 
business on the Web. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft shares fell $4.87 1/2 to $91.18 3/4 Thursday as part of a  
sharp selloff on Wall Street, fueled in part by a warning from 
Microsoft President Steven Ballmer that technology stocks are 
overvalued, including those of his own company.

<HEADLINE> 2nd Blast Rocks Black Fla. College </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- After a second bomb exploded in less  
than a month at Florida's historically black university, some 
students said they no longer felt safe going to classes or even 
staying in their dorm rooms. 
</P>
<P>
	However, others vowed to return to class at Florida A&AMP;M  
University today, saying that staying away would mean a victory for 
whoever made racist telephone threats before and after the blast. 
</P>
<P>
	``What they would love for us to do is not to show up,'' said  
Derric Heck, a junior from Brunswick, Ga., and the student 
government vice president. ``Let them know that our education 
cannot be stopped.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fire officials said the pipe bomb went off Wednesday in a  
first-floor men's room in Perry Paige Hall, which was full of 
students in classrooms, labs and offices. No one was injured, but 
classes were canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	Some students said they didn't want to stay in their dorms and  
planned to spend the night off campus. 
</P>
<P>
	``Telling a freshman to not be afraid as they lay their head  
down for the night is something I can't see,'' said Nekeisha 
Briggs, a senior from New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	A caller phoned a warning into a local television station around  
the time the bomb went off, just as happened Aug. 31 when a bomb 
went off in a campus administration building. No one was injured in 
that blast. 
</P>
<P>
	A warning that more violence could ensue came into the TV  
station later in the day, in a second call laced with profanity and 
racial slurs. 
</P>
<P>
	``FAMU has seen the beginning of this ... they got no business  
having a college where there ain't nobody ... smart enough to get a 
degree .... This is just the beginning, brother,'' station WTXL-TV 
quoted the caller as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials weren't saying much about the calls and said they had  
no direct evidence the two bombings were related. But ``there are 
obvious, common sense connections you could make,'' said Byron 
Price, FBI supervisor in Tallahassee. 
</P>
<P>
	Security was stepped up after the August blast, and security  
guards were on duty in dormitories overnight Wednesday. 
Administrators assured students that law enforcement was working to 
make sure the campus was safe.

<HEADLINE> Vets at Higher Risk for Hepatitis C </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Many veterans unknowingly harbor a  
liver-destroying virus, according to a new campaign encouraging 
veterans to seek testing and treatment for hepatitis C. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 2.7 million Americans are infected with hepatitis  
C. Although it kills up to 10,000 Americans a year, it can lurk for 
decades without causing symptoms, so many people don't know they 
are infected until their liver is seriously damaged. 
</P>
<P>
	Veterans may be at special risk. The Department of Veterans  
Affairs estimates that 8 percent to 10 percent of veterans treated 
at VA medical centers have hepatitis C -- an infection rate some 
five times higher than in the general population. 
</P>
<P>
	Veterans treated by the VA tend to have poorer health, so no one  
can say if all veterans have such a high risk, cautions the VA's 
Dr. Toni Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
	But more veterans need to demand testing, says Terry Baker of  
the Vietnam Veterans of America, director of a new campaign that is 
launching ads and an Internet site to increase hepatitis C 
awareness. 
</P>
<P>
	The VA ``is not giving out the information to the vets,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a survey of 500 veterans commissioned by the Veterans Aimed  
Toward Awareness campaign, 60 percent said they have not been 
tested because they don't believe they are at risk. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign is partially funded by a $130,000 grant from  
Schering-Plough Corp., which makes the only government-approved 
hepatitis C treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	The chief risk factors are injection drug use -- even a single  
experimentation with drugs 20 or 30 years ago could have spread the 
virus -- and blood transfusions before 1992, when the blood supply 
was first tested for hepatitis C. 
</P>
<P>
	Other risks include having had sex with an injecting drug user;  
using hemophilia clotting factors before 1987; long-term kidney 
dialysis; tattooing with unsterilized equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	Any veteran who requests a hepatitis C test at a VA medical  
center is supposed to get it, and those hospitals also are supposed 
to ask veterans if they have any risks that would trigger testing, 
said Mitchell, who investigates complaints if that doesn't happen. 
</P>
<P>
	Treatment is still somewhat controversial. The VA is following  
National Institutes of Health guidelines that recommend treatment 
if a liver biopsy shows damage, Mitchell said.
