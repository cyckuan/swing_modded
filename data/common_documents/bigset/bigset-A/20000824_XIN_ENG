<HEADLINE> India, Japan Establish Global Partnership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Japanese Prime
Minister Yoshiro Mori declared here Wednesday night that India and
Japan established global partnership.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from a 90-minute one-to-one and delegation-level talks
with his Indian counterpart Atal Biheri Vajpayee, Mori announced
that "India and Japan have become global partners from today".
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee said that new partnership between the two countries
would work for peace, development and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"As a result of our meetings, our bilateral relations have
acquired new dimensions and new depth," he said, adding regional
and international interests would also be taken into account.
</P>
<P>
Briefing reporters almost immediately after the meetings,
Indian External Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh described the talks
between leaders of the two countries as "very successful".
</P>
<P>
The two prime ministers had "constructive and very productive"
discussions which were held in a cordial, friendly and cooperative
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
On Indian signing of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT),
Singh said that India conveyed to Mori that the voluntary
moratorium on nuclear test, a commitment made soon after India's
nuclear tests in May 1998, would continue and New Delhi would not
go in for further nuclear tests, and India would not stand in the
way of CTBT going into force.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed to initiate a security dialogue despite
differences on nuclear issues, the Indian minister said.
</P>
<P>
The dialogue would be held this year for which date and venue
would be decided through mutual consultations.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also agreed to hold regular high-level political
contacts.
</P>
<P>
Mori announced that his country would give more fellowships for
Indian students wishing to pursue higher education in Japan.
</P>
<P>
"I will like to make India-Japan relations much better than
what they are now," said Mori after he was accorded a ceremonial
welcome at the presidential place here this morning.
</P>
<P>
Mori, who arrived here Tuesday evening for a three-day official
visit from Bangalore, 2000 kilometers south of here, held wide-
ranging talks today with Vajpayee on regional, international and
issues of mutual concern, a high-ranking Indian official said.
</P>
<P>
The visit, the first by a Japanese Prime Minister in the last
ten year, highlighted that Tokyo is keen to bring back on track
bilateral relations derailed in the aftermath of India's nuclear
tests in May, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure for New Delhi, the Japanese leader, who
arrived in Bangalore Monday evening from Pakistan, reportedly
proposed a major promotion and cooperation initiative between the
two countries in information technology (IT) sector.
</P>
<P>
He told Indian industrial leaders in Bangalore that the
current cooperation between the two countries in the IT field
still remained low profile compared to its potential, adding that
he would like to show Indian Prime Minister Vajpayee the proposed
IT promotion and cooperation exchange.
</P>
<P>
Japan is a major source of development assistance and leading
trade partner and investor in India, with the two-way trade
increasing to 4.56 billion U.S. dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
Japan imposed strict economic sanctions against New Delhi
immediately after India's nuclear tests in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Body of Iranian Pilot Found From Wreckage of Crashed Helicopter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 24 (Xinhua) -- One body of the two pilots aboard
an Iranian helicopter that crashed into the Persian Gulf on August
15 has been recovered from the copter's wreckage, the Islamic
Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It has not been determined the body was that of the pilot or the
co-pilot, who have been missing since the incident.
</P>
<P>
The helicopter, owned by the Iranian Helicopter Services
Organization, crashed 15 minutes after taking off from the Saga 2
platform in the South Pars gas field, 190 kilometers west of the
Kish Island. The cause of the crash is still under investigation.
</P>
<P>
Three workers on board were rescued minutes after the crash,
with one injured. The two pilots, however, have been missing.
</P>
<P>
The wreckage of the helicopter is reportedly being hauled on to
the surface of the waters.
</P>
<P>
Searching is still going on for the other pilot, an official of
the Iranian Oil Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Reports earlier had said the two pilots were netted alive by an
American warship that happened to be near the spot of the crash on
August 15. But the United States has denied the allegation.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's War Veterans Demonstrate at Ruling Party's Headquarters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's war veterans Thursday
prevented President Robert Mugabe's motorcade from leaving the
ruling Zanu-pf headquarters in Harare, demanding to meet Home
Affairs Minister John Nkomo who ordered police to evict them by
demolishing their shacks on farms they occupied.
</P>
<P>
Presidential guards had to use force as the war veterans had
taken control of the entrance. The war veterans besieged the Zanu-
pf headquarters where a political bureau meeting was being held.
</P>
<P>
They were chanting songs denouncing Nkomo and Police
Commissioner Augustine Chihuri for ordering police to destroy
their temporary structures on the farms.
</P>
<P>
A police officer in plain clothes was severely beaten by the
war veterans after being accused of spying, the Zimbabwe News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The war veterans booed when Vice-President Joseph Msika
transferred Mugabe's message that they should not disturb the
important meeting and must air their grievances through the right
channel.
</P>
<P>
Vice-President Simon Muzenda later told the war veterans that
they should remain on the farms they had occupied.
</P>
<P>
"The government is seeking ways of how they can assist you
after the destruction of your structures," he said.
</P>
<P>
Commander of farm invasions Joseph Chinotimba told the war
veterans that Nkomo must resign as Zanu-pf Chairman because he was
a traitor.
</P>
<P>
Police destroyed temporary structures belonging to the war
veterans on several farms on Tuesday and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The government has since accepted responsibility saying it
would compensate affected families.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe has backed the veterans' occupation of over 1,000 white-
owned farms since February this year to demand accelerating land
reform.

<HEADLINE> Uruguay Stops Meat Imports from Brazil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Uruguay has ceased importing
meat from Brazil after August 23, upon receiving confirmation of
an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in Brazil's southern state
of Rio Grande do Sul, Minister of Livestock, Agriculture and
Fishing Gonzalo Gonzalez said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Uruguay has adopted severe health control measures at the
borders with Brazil and forbids the entry of meat products, as
well as of subproducts and elaborations of Brazilian provenance,
said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Uruguay arranged to send a commission of veterinarians
to the focus where the illness appeared in Cruz Alta, north of
Santa Maria, Rio Grande do Sul, to observe the situation.
</P>
<P>
On the short term, exports of Uruguayan meats won't be
affected toward markets free of foot-and-mouth disease like the
United States, Canada, Mexico, Japan and other countries, as long
as Uruguay adopts precautions, said the official.
</P>
<P>
Uruguay's government forbade cattle and meat imports from
Argentina and Paraguay since August 15, due to the discovery of
aphthouse virus in northern province of Formosa, apparently coming
from Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
Uruguay exports each month about 270,000 tons of meat.

<HEADLINE> Barak: Meretz Top Candidate to Enter Israeli Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The left-wing Meretz party is
a "natural ruling partner" and if the cabinet is to be expanded, it
will be the first to be invited into the government, the Israeli
Prime Minister's Office said on Thursday in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement was in response to Meretz leader Yossi Sarid's
criticism of Prime Minister Ehud Barak's intention to form a
national unity government with the opposition Likud as being "
unrealistic."
</P>
<P>
A Knesset (parliament) member from Barak's Labor Party said that
to form a national unity government with the Likud would mean the
failure of Barak's government. He suggested that the prime minister
build a limited cabinet and at the same time try to win over as
much parliamentary backing as possible.
</P>
<P>
In a cold response to Barak's overture regarding the possibility
of the Likud joining a national unity government, Likud leader
Ariel Sharon told reporters that the proper course for Barak would
be to call for early elections as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Sharon said he had no room for Likud's joining the cabinet, and
blasted Barak of having made too many concessions in the
negotiations with the Palestinians and having failed to handle
domestic social issues "in the proper manner."
</P>
<P>
Sharon met Thursday afternoon with the secular Shinui leader
Tommy Lapid, in an attempt to win Shinui's support for a possible
no-confidence vote against the Barak government next month.
</P>
<P>
But Lapid responded that his party is committed to the peace
process, and would not join a no-confidence vote while negotiations
with the Palestinians are still continuing.
</P>
<P>
Lapid added that Shinui, which champions secular rights, would
be willing to join a Barak-led government provided it does not
include the ultra-Orthodox religious Shas Party.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Barak said that if he fails to reach a peace
accord with the Palestinians, he will form a broad government based
on his recently announced social "civic agenda."
</P>
<P>
He said he has not shut the door to Shas but there are natural
partners to the type of government he would like to form, such as
the opposition Likud, Shinui, the left-wing Meretz and the Center
Party.
</P>
<P>
He singled out Likud as a particular natural partner for his new
agenda and said Sharon would be qualified for the post of foreign
minister.
</P>
<P>
Likud Knesset member Ruby Rivlin has called on Sharon to reject
any overtures from the prime minister, saying Barak was not a
politician who could be trusted.
</P>
<P>
Rivlin said the vast majority of his party members are opposed
to forming a national unity government with Barak's Labor Party and
it would be a great surprise and disappointment to him if Sharon
acted otherwise.
</P>
<P>
Meretz Knesset member and former Minister of Agriculture Haim
Oron said his party will not be a member of a government that will
include the Likud. He said that in his view, inviting the right-
wing party into the coalition would halt the peace process with the
Palestinians at a critical juncture.
</P>
<P>
Barak has been engaged in coalition negotiations since returning
from the July 11-25 Camp David summit, which ended without reaching
an agreement due to the wide gaps between the Israelis and
Palestinians on the final-status issues, particularly the status of
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Barak's government has been severely crippled by the resignation
of three right-wing and religious coalition partners including the
Yisrael Ba'aliya, the National Religious Party and Shas on the eve
of his departure for Camp David in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The resignation of former Foreign Minister David Levy and his
Gesher Party from the ruling coalition One Israel dealt another
political blow to Barak, leaving his government with only 40 seats
in the 120-member Knesset.
</P>
<P>
Barak has made some temporary appointments to fill the cabinet
posts thus vacated and talked with various parties to figure out
coalition options.
</P>
<P>
Later, the prime minister slowed down the coalition efforts,
saying that he was in no hurry to form a new coalition and would
wait until the end of September before announcing a new government.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday night, Barak unveiled a set of social reform
programs at a meeting with his One Israel cabinet ministers and
lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
The new program includes the allowing of civil marriages and
calls for mandatory national service from all citizens, including
Arabs and ultra-Orthodox Jews.
</P>
<P>
The move was charged by Likud as an electioneering stunt to
divert the public from his political woes while Meretz and left-
wing circles were worried that the emerging change of direction in
policy marked the end of the peace process with the Palestinians
and the Syrians.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian-Israeli Peace Accord Possible in Fall: Norwegian FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Norwegian Foreign Minister
Thorbjoern Jagland said on Thursday it is still possible for the
Palestinians and Israel to reach a peace agreement later this year.
</P>
<P>
Jagland said that from his recent meeting with Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat and with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, he
is convinced that there is a possibility of reaching a peace accord
based on compromises between the Palestinians and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after meeting with Mubarak in Egypt's
Mediterranean port city of Alexandria, the Norwegian foreign
minister said the time is pressing but the two sides still have an
opportunity to realize peace this autumn.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli negotiations have been stalled since the
failure of the Camp David summit in the United States last month
over the issue of Jerusalem, which both sides claim as their
capital.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the issue of Palestinian refugees, Jagland said
Norway is ready to contribute financial support for the solution to
the problem.
</P>
<P>
Jagland left Egypt later Thursday for Israel for a two-day visit
as part of his Middle East tour for consultations on the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Norway hosted the secret negotiations between the Palestine
Liberation Organization and Israel that led to the breakthrough
Oslo accords in September 1993.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Meets Mexican President-Elect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 24 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton on
Thursday met with Mexican president-elect Vicente Fox, saying he
was impressed by Mexico's economic and democratic progress.
</P>
<P>
"What happened in Mexico was very impressive," Clinton said
ahead of his talks with Fox, who won a presidential election on
July 2, thus ending the 70-year reign by the ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party.
</P>
<P>
"I always like to remind the American people that our Mexican
neighbors paid their loan back ahead of time and in the best
possible way," Clinton added, referring to the 20-billion-dollar
bailout loan in Mexico's peso crisis.
</P>
<P>
Fox, who will take office on December 1, thanked Clinton for
his steadfast support through Mexico's troubled times.
</P>
<P>
"When we were in crisis we always got and saw the hand of a
friend," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he would also discuss Fox's proposal for more
liberal U.S. immigration policies, but cautioned: "Obviously, we
have borders and we have laws that apply to them and we have to
apply them, and so do the Mexicans."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Fox met with Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic
candidate in the November presidential election. He said his
meeting with Fox was a chance for "one-on-one talks about all the
ideas that I have and all the ideas that he has."
</P>
<P>
He said Fox "represents a real beginning in Mexico and we look
forward to having a great relationship with him."
</P>
<P>
Fox will meet Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush
in Dallas on Friday.

<HEADLINE> Relatives of Plane Crash Victims Arrive in Bahrain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAMA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- A special plane carrying relatives
of the victims in the Gulf Air plane crash Wednesday night touched
down at Bahrain international airport Thursday afternoon from
Cairo, Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The relatives were in deep sorrow. They were greeted at the
airport by Bahraini officials and Egyptian ambassador there.
</P>
<P>
Three Chinese journalists, who lost their wives in the tragic
accident, also arrived aboard the plane. They were met by Chinese
charge D'affaires to Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
Gulf Air Vice President Ali Ahmadi extended deep condolences to
the relatives, and promised to provide every possible means to
facilitate the identification of the deceased.
</P>
<P>
The ill-fated Airbus A320 of the Gulf Air went down into the
shallow waters of the Gulf near the runway after two attempted
landings, killing all 135 passengers and eight crew on board.
</P>
<P>
The airline officials have confirmed that the passengers include
63 Egyptians, 34 Bahrainis, 12 Saudis, two Britons, an Australian,
nine Palestinians, six from the United Arab Emirates, three
Chinese, one Korean, one Kuwaiti, one Sudanese, one Omani and an
American.
</P>
<P>
The eight crew included two Bahrainis and one each from Oman,
the Philippines, Poland, India, Morocco and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Rescue workers have recovered all the bodies from the crash site
over the night under the personal direction of Crown Prince Salman
Ibn Hamad.
</P>
<P>
Bahraini Emir Sheikh Hamad Bin Isa al-Khalifa has ordered
investigation into the cause of the crash, which so far remains
unknown.
</P>
<P>
The two black boxes of the plane -- flight data recorder and
cockpit voice recorder -- have been found. Probe will begin after
the arrival of an expert team from Airbus Industrie, which
manufactured the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The plane joined the Gulf Air fleet in 1994, and had accumulated
17,000 flying hours.
</P>
<P>
Gulf Air belongs in equal parts to Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and the
government of Abu Dhabi, the largest of seven sheikdoms making up
the United Arab Emirates. The Bahrain-based Gulf Air operates a
fleet of 28 planes and flies to 53 international destinations.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Ready to Put off Statehood Declaration: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Chief of Palestinian Preventive
Security Forces in Gaza Strip, Colonel Mohammed Dahlan, said
Thursday the Palestinian side was ready to consider putting off
statehood declaration in case there was a positive sign in the
peace talks or a radical change in the Israeli positions.
</P>
<P>
Contacts are underway between the Palestinians and Israel to
assess the results of last month's Camp David summit in the United
States as a prelude to the resumption of the talks, Dahlan told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are looking forward to the solution of the final-
status issues, especially the issue of Jerusalem, but they have
failed so far to reach any solution, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side will never yield sovereignty over East
Jerusalem, which was seized by Israel in the 1967 Mideast War and
later annexed, Dahlan added, adding that the Palestinian National
Authority would allow the Jews access to their holy sites such as
the Wailing Wall.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Vows to Strike Back In Case of Israeli Re-invasion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon has dismissed a Israeli
invasion threat, saying Thursday that the Lebanese troops and
resistance groups are ready to strike back any more Israeli
invasions.
</P>
<P>
The remarks made by Lebanese Information Minister Anwar Khalil
came one day after Maj. Gen. Moshe Ivry-Sukenik, commander of
Israel's land forces, said Israel was prepared to move back into
Lebanon if anti-Israeli violence on the Lebanese side of the border
continues, National News Agency (NNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
But he added such a possible thrust would be to temporal and
with an aim to restore order, not to establish a new occupation.
</P>
<P>
The threat reflected Israel's spiraling unease about the stone-
throwing attacks by Lebanese and Palestinian civilians on the U.N.-
drawn common border, the Blue Line.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese and Palestinian civilians have been staging almost
daily stone attacks across the Fatma Gate border crossing since
Israeli troops withdrew from south Lebanon on May 24, ending a 22-
year occupation.
</P>
<P>
An Nahar newspaper said Thursday that "quiet diplomatic efforts"
were underway for a deal, under which Israel would free 18 of the
last 20 Lebanese prisoners it still holds in exchange for an end to
Fatma Gate hostilities. The paper said unidentified "international
and regional sides" were handling the endeavor.

PARIS, August 24 (Xinhua) -- France sent two investigators and
four technical experts to Bahrain on Thursday to help investigate
the cause of the Gulf Air Airbus crash Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
The Bureau of Accident Investigation (BEA), which is in charge
of investigating accidents like the Air France Concorde crash on
July 25, said that French investigators will analyze the black
boxes found from the debris of the Airbus.
</P>
<P>
According to the international rules, technical investigation
of the accident is conducted by Bahrain, but France, which is the
country that registered the plane and the builder of the Airbus,
will also participate in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
Primary investigations showed that the crash could have been
caused by "a human error" by the pilot rather than a technical
failure.
</P>
<P>
All the 143 people on board were killed when the Airbus plunged
into the coast of Bahrain after failing to land at the local
airport.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Sees Millennium Summit as Very Much Working Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Briefing the press on the largest-ever gathering of world
leaders, U.N. Deputy Secretary-General Louise Frechette, said more
than 150 heads of State or Government are expected to gather at
the United Nations Headquarters in New York from September 6 to 8
for the Millennium Summit.
</P>
<P>
They will tackle some of the world's most pressing problems,
including how to pull millions of people out of abject poverty,
strengthen the United Nations in the 21st century, protect the
global environment and reverse the HIV/AIDS epidemic, the Deputy
Secretary-General told the press.
</P>
<P>
She said the Millennium Summit is convened at a time when the
world is going through a dramatic change in relations and new
direction should be adapted for the United Nations so as to meet
the challenges of the new era.
</P>
<P>
In addition to making formal speeches at the summit, the world
leaders will participate in one of four interactive round-tables
with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's Millennium Report as the
main topic, each to be chaired by a nation nominated from a
different region. They were expected to be the heads of the State
or Government from Algeria, Poland, Singapore and Venezuela, she
said.
</P>
<P>
The Summit will adopt an outcome document that is being
prepared through consultations in the General Assembly under the
leadership of current Assembly President Theo-Ben Gurirab of
Namibia, the deputy Secretary-General said.
</P>
<P>
A meeting of the Security Council at the heads of State level
will also be held during the Summit on September 7 to focus on
peacekeeping issues, especially in Africa. The Council debate is
expected to draw on the work of a special United Nations panel
chaired by Lakhdar Brahimi, set up by the Secretary-General to
consider how to strengthen peace operations, she said.
</P>
<P>
Heads of State or Government have also been invited by the
Secretary-General to take the opportunity of the Summit to sign or
deposit instruments of ratification for multilateral treaties they
may not yet have joined, especially 25 core treaties representing
key United Nations objectives, she said.
</P>
<P>
The Millennium Summit, proposed by the Secretary-General in his
1997 report "Renewing the United Nations: A program for Reform",
was officially mandated in December 1998 by the U.N. General
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The Assembly, convinced that the turn of the century is a
unique and symbolically compelling moment to articulate and affirm
an animating vision for the United Nations in the new era, decided
to designate its 55th Session as the Millennium Assembly and to
hold a Millennium Summit.

<HEADLINE> Defense Probes Airport Security at Lockerbie Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAMP ZEIST, Netherlands, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The defense team
on Thursday challenged the security control at the Heathrow
airport at the Lockerbie trial.
</P>
<P>
Ex-Pan Am employees were cross-examined by the defense team
over the security at the British airport. The defense team hoped
to depict a picture of lax security and the bomb that caused the
mid-air explosion could have been loaded onto the Pan Am Flight
103 there.
</P>
<P>
Former Pan Am employees admitted that at times luggage at
Heathrow would just lay unattended in transit sheds and records of
luggage were contradictory.
</P>
<P>
It was disclosed that one passenger who had checked in two bags
onto the New York-bound airliner failed to board before it took
off on December 21, 1988.
</P>
<P>
Witness Nicola Milne, who was in charge of supervising
passengers onto Flight 103, told the court that decision had to be
taken to allow the aircraft to take off despite the "no-show" of
the passenger. The left-behind passenger was later found in a bar.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution claims that Abdel Basset al-Megrahi and Al-Amin
Khalifa Fahima used their cover working as employees of the Libyan
Arab Airlines in Malta to place a suitcase bomb on a plane bound
for Frankfurt where the suitcase was transferred onto the Pan Am
Flight 103.
</P>
<P>
The defense team, however, pointed to a major discrepancy
between statements given by one of the witnesses who had served as
Pan Am employees at the time.
</P>
<P>
Peter Walker, the former Pan Am luggage supervisor, told the
police immediately after the mid-air explosion that he had no
knowledge of a container with luggage in it being taken out to
meet Flight 103 from Frankfurt before transit luggage destined for
New York were added at Heathrow.
</P>
<P>
He later told the British government Fatal Accident Inquiry
that a colleague brought a half-filled luggage container into the
luggage shed before it was taken to meet the in-coming flight from
Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
The Lockerbie trial, started on May 3 this year, will enter a
key stage next Monday when a former Libyan secret service agent
who defected to the United States would appear in the Scottish
court on Dutch soil to testify.
</P>
<P>
Abdul Majid Giaka, former Libyan agent who became U.S. double
agent shortly before the Lockerbie bombing, was originally due to
appear in court on Wednesday but the defense team objected,
persuading judges that it needed more time to study the documents
released by the United States secret service CIA.
</P>
<P>
The Lockerbie trial, that took almost 12 years to investigate
and prepare, is expected to last up to a year's time before the
three Scottish judges could give out their verdict.

<HEADLINE> Donor Nations Want to Ensure Hezbollah Won't Get Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Nations considering aid to Lebanon
want to make sure that the Hezbollah guerrilla group won't benefit
directly or indirectly form this aid, As Saifr newspaper reported
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted American sources as saying that unnamed donor
nations have held consultations recently to see what they can do to
prevent Hezbollah from benefiting from their help toward the
reconstruction of south Lebanon, which Israel had occupied for 22
years.
</P>
<P>
As soon as Israel withdrew last May, Hezbollah guerrillas moved
in to take over control. Under domestic and international pressure,
the Beirut government dispatched a token task force of army troops
and police to establish official presence, but Hezbollah dominance
continues to prevail, raising concern among potential donor nations
and keeping the situation in south Lebanon uncertain.
</P>
<P>
The absence of a strong and effective central government
presence in the south "is keeping donor nations reluctant to come
forth with aid because they want to avoid dealing with Hezbollah,"
the report said.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the report added, donor nations prefer to withhold
their aid until the time comes when they will be asked to finance
comprehensive Middle East peace agreements, "which constitutes a
stronger motive for the international community to come up with
aid."
</P>
<P>
The report said Lebanon had initially asked for 500 million U.S.
dollars in aid, which it then reduced to 250 million dollars as a
result of "conservative reaction" by donor states. It said American
officials were talking about 60 million dollars in U.S. aid over
three or four years. This is in addition to U.S. annual assistance
to Lebanon of about 15 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
It added that Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Senator
Jesse Helms, chairman of the foreign relations committee, shared
the same concern about the Hezbollah's presence in south Lebanon
and urged large-scale deployment of Lebanese army throughout the
area.

<HEADLINE> Acting Israeli FM Praises Egyptian Ideas on Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Acting Israeli Foreign Minister
Shlomo Ben-Ami Thursday praised Egyptian leaders for their "
interesting ideas" aimed at advancing the Palesintian-Israeli peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
Terming his talks Thursday with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
and Foreign Minister Amr Moussa as "important," Ben-Ami said Egypt
has offered "interesting ideas on different issues in the
negotiations between the Israelis and the Palestinians."
</P>
<P>
The Egyptians were "very constructive and helpful," and the
meeting was "extremely important," he added.
</P>
<P>
Ben-Ami arrived in the Egyptian Mediterranean port city of
Alexandria earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Moussa said the discussions with Ben-Ami involved
exchange of views on the Egyptian ideas and ways of helping reach
a "fair deal" between the Palestinians and Israelis.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Egypt has not yet made any official proposals,
and it would decide on the next step after discussing with the
Palestinians and other parties concerned.
</P>
<P>
Both Moussa and Ben-Ami did not give any details of the Egyptian
ideas.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli official said that it was still too early to decide
whether it was worth convening another Israeli-Palestinian summit
after last month's failed talks at Camp David of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Substantial sorts of understanding has to be reached on
different issues to pave the way for a possible new summit, he
said. But this is not yet the situation, he added.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem is the toughest issue in the Palestinian-Israeli
final-status talks, which are envisaged to end by September 13 with
a comprehensive peace deal between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
But the two sides have not yet found solutions to narrow their
differences over the status of the holy city. The Palestinians want
the Arab East Jerusalem seized by Israel in the 1967 Mideast War as
the capital of their future state while Israel claims the whole
city as its "eternal and indivisible capital."
</P>
<P>
Egypt, which has a leading role in the Arab world and has been
striving to bring Israel and the Palestinians together, rejects
Israeli sovereignty over East Jerusalem, and supports the
Palestinian demand that Israel return this part of the city.

<HEADLINE> Gasoline Smuggling Rises as Prices Soar in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 24 (Xinhua) -- As the gasoline prices in
Thailand rise continuously, more and more people are turning to
smuggling gasoline from Malaysia, where the petroleum prices are
about half of those in the country, custom officials said here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Officials at checkpoints on the Thai-Malaysian border have been
taking action since last week against vehicles entering Thailand
from Malaysia with full tanks of petrol, according to a report
from Thai custom office.
</P>
<P>
"Officials have been instructed to siphon off petrol from
vehicles entering the country from Malaysia with more than half a
tank of gasoline," the report said.
</P>
<P>
Officials would also confiscate petrol-filled containers
carried in vehicles coming from Malaysia, it said.
</P>
<P>
However, it said that the most serious smuggling between the
two countries takes place at sea, aboard converted fishing boats.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Durable-Goods Orders Post Record Drop in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 24 (Xinhua) -- New orders to U.S. factories
for durable goods plunged a record 12.4 percent in July, led by
the biggest-ever monthly drop in demand for airplanes and other
transportation equipment, the Commerce Department reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The larger-than-expected decrease in orders for durable goods,
items expected to last at least three years, left orders at a
seasonally adjusted rate of 212.4 billion U.S. dollars, compared
with 242.5 billion dollars in June.
</P>
<P>
Orders rose a revised 9.5 percent in June, down from the
previous estimate of a 9.7 percent rise.
</P>
<P>
July's performance largely reflected a record 31.7 percent
decline in orders for transportation equipment, mostly due to
lower demand for airplane and aircraft parts, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Excluding the volatile transportation sector, durable-goods
orders fell 4.8 percent in July after a 0.5 percent increase in
June. The transportation sector can swing widely from month to
month because it includes costly items such as airplanes. In June,
orders for transportation equipment surged a huge 41.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
For the first seven months this year, durable-goods orders were
9.9 percent above the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Shipments of durable goods, a good sign of current demand, fell
1.9 percent in July, led by a drop in shipments of transportation
products. In June, total shipments of durable goods rose 1.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
In a second report, the Labor Department said the number of
Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits rose last
week for the fourth week in a row, by 4,000 to 314,000, suggesting
the tight labor market may be loosening a bit.

<HEADLINE> Japan, DPRK End Normalization Talks Without Breakthrough </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Negotiators from Japan and the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) on Thursday concluded
the final day of their two-day second round of normalization talks
in Kisarazu, Chiba Prefecture, with no breakthrough on key issues.
</P>
<P>
The two sides failed to bridge the gap on ways to settle past
issues, including the alleged abduction of Japanese nationals by
DPRK agents in the 1970s and 1980s and the DPRK's demand for
compensation for Japan's 1910-1945 colonial rule of the Korean
Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Kojiro Takano, who led the Japanese negotiating team,
offered to extend economic cooperation to the DPRK, instead of
compensation, for Japan's colonial rule on the Korean Peninsula, a
move aimed at finding a compromise when the next talks take place
in October, Kyodo News quoted a government official as saying.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Jong Thae Hwa, who headed the DPRK delegation, did
not give any outright response and maintained the basic position
of seeking compensation to "liquidate the past" between the two
nations, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The two-day session began on Tuesday in Tokyo. After a one-day
break, it moved to Kisarazu in neighboring Chiba Prefecture.
</P>
<P>
The two countries clashed over compensation and abduction
issues in the first round of their negotiations in April in
Pyongyang. The April talks followed an eight-year suspension of
normalization talks, which collapsed in 1992 after eight rounds.
</P>
<P>
Jong reiterated that the settlement of the past should be
treated as a priority issue under a four-point package he proposed
in April, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The four points are an official written apology, compensation
to satisfy DPRK people, compensation for damaged or stolen
cultural assets, and an assurance of the legal status of DPRK
national's permanently residing in Japan.
</P>
<P>
Takano maintained that Japan agrees to liquidate the past, but
repeated its rejection of war-time reparations on the grounds that
Japan and Korea were not at war during the colonial period, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
Takano ruled out any agreement that shelved the abduction issue
by stressing that a normalization treaty "must gain wide public
support" in order to be ratified by lawmakers, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Jong repeated that no such abductions took place, but promised
to continue investigations into "missing persons" as the two
countries earlier agreed in talks between Red Cross
representatives.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed to meet again in October after improving
their understanding of each other's positions and confirming their
commitment to seek agreements during the next round, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
The next meeting is likely to take place in Beijing,
negotiation sources said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides issued a brief one-page statement Thursday
spelling out the next schedule and confirming their commitments to
facilitating the plenary normalization negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK delegation, which arrived in Japan Monday, is
scheduled to head home on Friday morning.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: S. Africa Eager for Sydney Olympic Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 24 (Xinhua) -- As the Olympic torch
continues the final leg of its journey from Olympia in Greece to
Sydney, the venue for the 2000 Olympic Games, South African
organizers and participants have begun the countdown to the
official opening ceremony on September 15.
</P>
<P>
The Olympic torch, which arrived in Australia on June 8, is on
a 100-day, 27,000-km journey to the Olympic stadium in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
Months and years of preparation by up to 130 individual and
team entrants from South Africa will be brought into sharp public
focus as they compete over a two-week period in Sydney from
September 15 to October 1, which will be followed by the
International Paralympic Games from October 19 to 29.
</P>
<P>
Executive President of the South African National Olympic
committee Sam Ramsamy said South Africa will be participating in
18 sports, namely athletics, archery, baseball, boxing, canoeing,
cycling, modern pentathlon, sailing, shooting, swimming, taekwondo
(a martial arts sports), wrestling, rowing, tennis, soccer, field
hockey, judo and triathlon.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that about 40 percent to 45 percent of the South
African entrants will come from the black community, compared with
20 percent at the Atlanta games four years ago.
</P>
<P>
South Africa will be hoping to improve on its tally of five
medals at the Atlanta Olympics, where Penny Heyns won two gold
medals in the 100m and 200m breastroke swimming, Josiah Thugwane
won a gold medal in the marathon, Hezekiel Sepeng won a silver
medal in the 800m athletics event and Marianne Kriel took bronze
in the 100m backstroke.
</P>
<P>
"We believe our best prospects for medals in Sydney could lie
in the swimming and track-and-field events. Our chances can not be
ruled out in football, where the level of competition among the 16
teams is high," Ramsamy predicted.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that even if we don't win many medals we will come
back with commendable performances. This is why we are taking such
a large team," he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the big-money incentives and commercialization in
the sports event, the president said the ethics of sportsmanship
and fair play are coming under the microscope as never before, but
the Olympic ideal of team spirit and the honour of representing
one's country still inspires sportsmen and sportswomen across the
world.
</P>
<P>
Sponsorship and marketing campaigns are also a key part of the
build-up to the games with the right to use the Olympic five-ring
logo a much-coveted prize for organizations and companies
associated with the event, Ramsamy added.
</P>
<P>
In South Africa, eight companies, namely Vodacom, Nedbank,
Volkwagen, South African Airways, Reebok, Metropolitan, Telkom and
Boeringer Ingelheim, have paid 5 million rand (about 700,000 U.S.
dollars) each for the right to be official Olympic Games sponsors.
</P>
<P>
This includes the use of the Olympic five-ring symbol with the
South African flag in their marketing campaigns to promote their
association with the games.

<HEADLINE> IOC Inspectors Start Picking Apart Progress Report for 2004 Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 24 (Xinhua) -- International Olympic Committee
inspectors on Thursday combed through a progress report to
determine if Athens organizers made a 100-day deadline to get back
on track for the 2004 Games.
</P>
<P>
IOC coordinators for the Athens Games, headed by Jacques Rogge,
began two days of meetings and updates on the progress made by
Athens organizers since their last inspection in May, which came
after a warning by IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch that
Greece had placed the games at risk because of major delays.
</P>
<P>
"We look forward to the meetings, discussing in very much
detail on some few points that are important and especially
preparing for Sydney so the experience of the Olympic Games will
be gathered by the organizing committee here," said IOC spokesman
Franklin Servan-Schreiber.
</P>
<P>
During the IOC visit, Rogge is to meet with Public Works
Minister Costas Laliotis, who on Thursday released details of 18
major transportation infrastructure projects that will cost of 390
billion drachmas (1.04 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Rogge is also expected to discuss security issues with Public
Order Minister Mihalis Chrisohoides.
</P>
<P>
The recent assassination of a British diplomat in Athens and
Greece's inability to eradicate a host of underground terrorist
and arson groups have raised questions about the country's ability
to provide security during the games.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Former President Sentenced to Imprisonment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Former President Hussain Muhammad
Ershad was sentenced Thursday to five years' imprisonment and also
fined 54 million taka (1 million U.S. dollars) by the High Court
on graft charges.
</P>
<P>
A High Court bench pronounced the verdict of the much-
orchestrated Janata Tower case, commuting an earlier sentence in
which a lower court had awarded him seven-year prison term. His
parliament membership is also scrapped automatically according to
the constitution.
</P>
<P>
The main charge in the case is that Ershad had built the Janata
Tower at a cost that was far beyond his lawful income. The former
president will have to serve an additional two years in jail in
case of non-payment of the fine.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Dhaka District Additional Judge Ansaruddin Sikder in
his verdict in 1993 convicted all the 19 accused, including Ershad,
and sentenced him to seven years' imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
The high court also order confiscation of the multi-storied
Janata Tower building in the city's Kawran Bazar business hub
along with the land.
</P>
<P>
Former military ruler Hussain Muhammad Ershad, now Chairman of
the Bangladesh Jatiya Party, was President of Bangladesh from
December, 1983 to December, 1990 when he was ousted in a mass
upsurge.
</P>
<P>
After the fall of Ershad in 1990, the Bangladesh Nationalist
Party government of Khaleda Zia filed over a dozen corruption
cases against the deposed president. He was convicted in three
cases and sentenced to a total of 17 years' imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
After Awami League formed government in 1996 with the support
of Ershad's Jatiya Party, he was enlarged on bail after spending
six years in jail in 1997.

Wednesday night, as it was trying to land in the island nation of
Bahrain, killing everyone aboard.
</P>
<P>
-- For years, President Clinton has pledged that what he wants
for Washington is "progress not partisanship." But the Democrats

President Gore that he wants to fight for "the people not the
powerful."
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. National Institutes of Health on Wednesday issued

decades to come.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- The weakening euro is putting more pressure on Europe's
central bank to raise interest rates. But hints that Europe's
economy may be heading for a slowdown have put the bank in a bind.

JOHANNESBURG, August 24 (Xinhua) -- South African athletes who
win medals at the Sydney Olympics are in line to win substantial
cash awards as part of an Olympic incentive program, Vodacom, one
of the eight official South African Sydney Olympics sponsors
announced on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Vodacom, which was an official sponsor of the 1996 Atlanta
Olympic Games, is this time offering a 1 million rand (about 140,
000 U.S. dollars) lump sum award to those who win gold medals.
Silver medalists will receive 500,000 rand (about 71,000 U.S.
dollars) and bronze winners 250,000 rand (about 36,000 U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
"We believe our incentive program will spur our athletes
towards their very best achievements," Vodacom Managing Director
Andrew Mthembu said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that his company has been committed to the development
of sport in South Africa since the African National Congress came
into power in 1994.
</P>
<P>
"Sport has an important role to play in reconciliation and
nation-building. This is particularly true of international
sporting events, where South Africans unite towards a common
ovjective," Mthembu said.
</P>
<P>
Sam Ramsamy, Executive President of the South African National
Olympic Committee, said it is the policy of the International
Olympic Committee not to award prize money, but Olympic committees
in individual countries may authorize prize money in the form of
an incentive scheme, which is done by Olympic committees in most
countries.

<P>
NAIROBI, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Eric Keter, Kenya's 400-meter
hurdles world champion, will join the Kenyan teams to this year's
Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
Three judges from the Kenyan Court of Appeal Wednesday ordered
the Kenya Amateur Athletes Association (KAAA), the National
Olympic Steering Committee and the National Olympic Committee of
Kenya (NOCK) to ensure that Keter will leave for Sydney by
September 13, the Daily Nation newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The judges cautioned the officials of the three organizations
that the order, made by Commissioner Visram directing them to
enlist Keter as a qualified member of the Kenyan Olympic team,
must be implemented.
</P>
<P>
A copy of their ruling has been given to the officials of the
three organizations who should personally appear in court on
Friday, the judges said.
</P>
<P>
They also ordered the Kenya Amateur Athletes Association to pay
Keter 10,000 shillings (around 130 U.S. dollars) as costs of the
association's application for stay and meet the costs of the High
Court suit.
</P>
<P>
After the ruling, NOCK Chairman Kipchoge Keino said that KAAA
had asked him to include Keter in the Kenyan Olympic team and he
had also contacted the games organizers in Sydney asking them to
include Keter in the Kenyan team.
</P>
<P>
Keter has assured Kenyans that he would go for a gold at the
Olympic Games in Sydney.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Selects 28-Player Olympic Baseball Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 24 (Xinhua) -- With its first game less than
a month away, the U.S. Olympic baseball team was announced
Wednesday by USA Baseball in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
Although this will be the first Olympics in which professionals
may participate, U.S. manager Tommy Lasorda has expressed dismay
at the lack of major leaguers or top minor league prospects on the
team.
</P>
<P>
One of the few players on the roster with big league success is
catcher Pat Borders, a 37-year MVP of the 1992 world series as a
member of the Toronto Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
Other players over 30 are pitcher Rick Krivda, outfielder Ernie
Young, and infielder Shawn Gilbert.
</P>
<P>
Lasorda who managed the Los Angeles Dodgers to two world titles
and four pennants, said that "I hope and pray that the U.S. team
will come home from Sydney a happy bunch, because we're going to
win a gold medal, we're not going 6,000 miles to lose."
</P>
<P>
Lasorda inherits the core of a team that finished behind Cuba
in last year's Pan Am Games, with former Baltimore Orioles manager
Phil Regan as pitching coach.
</P>
<P>
The United States will compete in a eight-team round-robin
tournament including Cuba, Japan, South Korea, Italy, the
Netherlands, South Africa and the host Australia, with top four
advancing to the semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
The Americans will start their campaign on September 17 against
Japan in the tournament.

<HEADLINE> Cheung Kong, Hutchison Report Profit Increase in Half Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The Cheung Kong (Holdings)
Limited and the Hutchison Whampoa Limited reported increased
profit over the first half of this year, according to their
interim reports for 2000 released here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Cheung Kong's unaudited consolidated net profit after tax for
the first half of 2000 amounted to 17.395 billion HK dollars (2.23
billion U.S. dollars), representing an increase of 2.54 times as
compared to the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Hutchison's unaudited consolidated net profit for the half year
ended June 30, 2000, amounted to 31.126 billion HK dollars (4
billion U.S. dollars), an increase of 3.26 times over the
comparable period last year.
</P>
<P>
Li Ka-shing, chairman of the two companies, attributed the
progress of Cheung Kong, which mainly deals with properties, to
continuing quality and value enhancement of properties, active
expansion into the property markets of the Chinese mainland and
other countries and regions as well as vigorous new technology
development.
</P>
<P>
Eighty percent of Hutchison's profit was generated outside of
Hong Kong, he said.
</P>
<P>
Hutchison, whose business covers ports and related services,
telecommunications and commerce, earned 50 billion HK dollars (6.4
billion U.S. dollars) from the exchange of a 10.2 percent interest
in Mannesmann for an approximate 5 percent interest in Vodafone
AirTouch and 1.6 billion HK dollars (205 million U.S. dollars)
from the subsequent disposal for cash of an approximate 1.5
percent interest in Vodafone AirTouch.
</P>
<P>
It gained 1.72 billion HK dollars (220.5 million U.S. dollars)
on the sale of a 50 percent interest in the Hong Kong fixed line
telecommunications business to Global Crossing and 2.2 billion HK
dollars (282.1 million U.S. dollars) on the sale of a 19 percent
interest in the Hong Kong cellular operation to NTT DoCoMo.
</P>
<P>
Hutchison's provision for the potential effect of share price
and exchange rate fluctuations on the group's overseas investments
totaled 30 billion HK dollars (3.8 billion U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> China to Accelerate Reform of Stock Market, Report Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 24 (Xinhua) -- China is expected to press
ahead with an aggressive program of reforming its stock market, a
report released by Standard Chartered Bank Thursday said.
</P>
<P>
The reform program is intended to facilitate more listings of
state-owned enterprises as well as non-state enterprises, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Analysts from the bank said in the report that this is
considered an effective way to introduce more corporate governance
into the enterprises, as the presence of a substantial proportion
of minority shareholders will put more public pressure on the
management to look after the interest of the shareholders.
</P>
<P>
Currently, most large and medium sized enterprises in China are
effectively majority-owned by the state and run by civil servants
appointed by the government, they said.
</P>
<P>
Economists here believed that most state-owned enterprises need
a lot of funds to modernize and upgrade themselves, and getting a
listing on the stock market will help many of these enterprises to
raise the capital required.
</P>
<P>
However, the report also cautioned that the experiences of many
developing countries show that liberalization and development of
stock markets are often a difficult balancing process.
</P>
<P>
It is of utmost importance that the government should handle
the regulatory issues very carefully since excessive ups and downs
in the stock market are difficult to prevent, the report said.

<HEADLINE> 55 Percent of China's SOEs Out of Red: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 24 (Xinhua) -- About 55 percent of China's
State-owned enterprises (SOE) have stopped losing money, a senior
Chinese official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Zeng Peiyan, minister of the State Development Planning
Commission, made the remark this morning while reporting to the
ongoing 17th meeting of the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress (NPC), China's top legislature, on China's
economic and social development in the first six months of this
year.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, by the end of this June, 3,625 of
China's 6,599 money-losing SOEs are no longer in the red, after
more than two years of efforts since Chinese Communist Party (CPC)
Central Committee pledged to reform the SOEs and help SOEs out of
red within three years.
</P>
<P>
NPC Standing Committee Chairman Li Peng presided over the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of the year, the minister said, China enjoyed
a stable rural economy, marked growth in fixed assets investment,
and smooth operation of major projects, as well as a number of
good signs in many aspects.
</P>
<P>
For the second half of the year, the minister called on
departments concerned to implement a positive fiscal policy,
adjust and improve the structure of rural economy, deepening the
reform of the SOEs, and create a fairer, and more competitive
environment.
</P>
<P>
Zeng also pointed out that efforts should be made to promote
the development of the non-state sector, further perfect the
welfare system, make preparations for the country's entry into the
WTO, improve the development of education, scientific and
technological reform.

<HEADLINE> UAE Expresses Condolences to Bahrain, Egypt Over Air Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE)
has expressed the deepest condolences and consolation to the
governments and peoples of Bahrain and Egypt over the Gulf Air
plane crash Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
UAE Deputy Prime Minister Sheikh Sultan Bin Zayed al-Nahyan sent
a telegram of condolences to Bahraini Emir Sheikh Hamad Bin Isa al-
Khalifa over the death of Bahraini nationals in the air crash,
which killed all 143 people aboard the ill-fated Airbus A320.
</P>
<P>
He also sent a similar cable to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
over the death of 63 Egyptians in the incident, the official WAM
news agency reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Gulf Air's two-engine Airbus A320, coming from the Egyptian
capital Cairo, had made two unsuccessful landings at the Bahraini
International Airport on Wednesday night, and it ditched into the
shallow waters of the Gulf near the runway on its third landing
attempt, with one engine on fire.
</P>
<P>
Officials of Gulf Air then confirmed that there was no survivor
on the crashed plane, including 63 Egyptians, 34 Bahrainis, 12
Saudis, two Britons, an Australian, nine Palestinians, six from the

Sudanese, one Omani, a diplomatic courier from the United States

<HEADLINE> Israeli PM Reaches out to Ring-wing Likud Over Coalition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak said on Thursday that if he fails to reach a peace accord
with the Palestinians, he will form a broad-based government.
</P>
<P>
Based on his recently announced social "civic agenda," Barak's
new program includes the allowing of civil marriages and calls for
mandatory national service from all citizens, including Arabs and
ultra-Orthodox Jews.
</P>
<P>
Barak told Israel Radio that he has not shut the door to the
ultra-Orthodox Shas Party but there are natural partners to the
type of government he would like to form, such as the opposition
Likud, secular Shinui Party, the left-wing Meretz and the Center
Party.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said that the Likud headed by Ariel Sharon is
the natural partner for such a political agenda. He said he has
great personal respect for Sharon and has no doubt that he can even
fulfil the post of a foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the disarray in his own office and the criticisms from

some senior officials who resigned, including Haim Mandel-Shaked,
the chief of staff in the Prime Minister's bureau and his deputy
Shimon Batat, Barak said he found their remarks very painful, but
they are irrelevant for the national agenda.
</P>
<P>
In response, Likud Knesset (Parliament) member Ruby Rivlin
called on Sharon to reject any overtures from the prime minister,
saying Barak was not a politician who could be trusted.
</P>
<P>
Rivlin said the vast majority of his party members are opposed
to forming a national unity government with Barak's Labor Party and
it would be a great surprise and disappointment to him if Sharon
acted otherwise.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Sharon is continuing his efforts to mobilize a
majority of 61 legislators to topple the government during the
Knesset's summer recess.
</P>
<P>
He met on Thursday with Shinui Party leader Tommy Lapid on the
issue, but failed to convince him to sign on a petition calling for
the convention of the parliament during recess so as to topple the
government.
</P>
<P>
Meretz Knesset member and former Minister of Agriculture Haim
Oron said his party will not be a member of a government that will
include the Likud. He said that in his view, inviting the right-
wing party into the coalition would halt the peace process with the
Palestinians at a critical juncture.
</P>
<P>
Barak has been engaged in coalition negotiations since returning
from the July 11-25 Camp David Summit.
</P>
<P>
His government has been severely crippled by the resignations of
three right-wing and religious coalition partners including the
Yisrael Ba'aliya, the National Religious Party and Shas on the eve
of his departure for Camp David.
</P>
<P>
The resignation of former Foreign Minister David Levy and his
Gesher Party from the ruling coalition One Israel dealt another
political blow on Barak, leaving his government with only 40 seats
in the 120-member Knesset.
</P>
<P>
Barak has made some temporary appointments to fill the cabinet
posts thus vacated and talked with various parties to figure out
coalition options.
</P>
<P>
Later, the prime minister slowed down the coalition efforts,
saying that he is in no hurry to form a new coalition and will wait
until the end of September before announcing a new government.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday night, Barak unveiled a set of social reform
programs at a meeting with his One Israel cabinet ministers and
lawmakers. The move was charged by Likud as an electioneering stunt
to divert the public from his political woes.
</P>
<P>
Meretz and left-wing circles were worried that the emerging
change of direction in policy marked the end of the peace process
with the Palestinians and the Syrians.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Rules out Military Option in Sulu Hostage Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- As the government awaits for new
developments in the hostage crisis in Sulu, Philippine President
Joseph Estrada reiterated Thursday that "military option is not
being considered" at this time.
</P>
<P>
In a press release issued here, Press Secretary and
Presidential Spokesman Ricardo Puno said that the President
reiterated the policy of peaceful negotiations with the Abu Sayyaf
group upon the release of the mostly foreign hostages.
</P>
<P>
Estrada, according to Puno, made his policy clear in reaction
to a letter jointly sent to him by Finnish President Tarja Halonen,
French President Jacques Chirac and German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
Dated August 22, the letter expressed deep concern over the
long-running hostage crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf group is still holding captive 12 foreigners,
including two Germans, two French, two Finns, two South Africans
and one Lebanese, all abducted from Malaysia in April. Besides,
the bandits are also holding three French journalists.
</P>
<P>
The three European leaders told Estrada that they are "
confident that the negotiators will finalize the negotiating
process and achieve a release of all hostages without any further
delay."
</P>
<P>
In this context, the European leaders said, they are grateful
for Libya's assistance and they trust in the good cooperation
between Philippine government negotiators and the Libyan envoy.
</P>
<P>
The leaders added that the hostages' release "must not be
jeopardized by any action or any announcement the abductors on the
island of Sulu could perceive as a reason not to implement a
negotiated solution to this drama."
</P>
<P>
Puno said the administration is "optimistic that positive
results" are forthcoming in the hostage negotiations, adding that
Robert Aventajado, chief government negotiator, is working hard
for the release of the foreign hostages.
</P>
<P>
But Puno said President Estrada does not consider the letter as
a "lecture" to the Philippine government on the handling of the
hostages, but rather just a constructive statement of support for
the continued efforts of government negotiators.

<HEADLINE> Brunei Announces News Laws for International Financial Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Brunei Thursday announced
news laws for the International Financial Center.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the Brunei International Financial Center
was announced by Sultan Hassnal Bolkiah on July 15 aimed to
develop Brunei as a regional hub for finance, banking, securities,
insurance and other services.
</P>
<P>
The new laws cover international banking, business companies,
trusts and limited partnerships as well as registered agents and
trustees licensing.
</P>
<P>
"The laws strongly resist money laundering and criminal
activity. They allow us to exchange information with other
countries so that we may combat crime together," the Brunei
Finance Ministry said in a statement faxed from Bandar Seri
Begawan, Brunei, to Xinhua Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Other new laws on insurance licensing and regulation as well as
securities and mutual funds are to be enacted in the next few
months, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Brunei pledged a continuous monitoring process to ensure that
policies and laws remain in tune with changes in international
finance.
</P>
<P>
Brunei also hoped to fulfill the needs of an obvious niche
market in the rapidly growing world of Islamic financing, it said.
</P>
<P>
The legislation for the center has taken a little over three
years to prepare, the statement said, adding "The time has now
come when we are ready to commence our operations."

<HEADLINE> China to Accelerate Reform of Stock Market, Report Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 24 (Xinhua) -- China is expected to press
ahead with an aggressive program of reforming its stock market, a
report released by Standard Chartered Bank Thursday said.
</P>
<P>
The reform program is intended to facilitate more listings of
state-owned enterprises as well as non-state enterprises, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Analysts from the bank said in the report that this is
considered an effective way to introduce more corporate governance
into the enterprises, as the presence of a substantial proportion
of minority shareholders will put more public pressure on the
management to look after the interest of the shareholders.
</P>
<P>
Currently, most large and medium sized enterprises in China are
effectively majority-owned by the state and run by civil servants
appointed by the government, they said.
</P>
<P>
Economists here believed that most state-owned enterprises need
a lot of funds to modernize and upgrade themselves, and getting a
listing on the stock market will help many of these enterprises to
raise the capital required.
</P>
<P>
However, the report also cautioned that the experiences of many
developing countries show that liberalization and development of
stock markets are often a difficult balancing process.
</P>
<P>
It is of utmost importance that the government should handle
the regulatory issues very carefully since excessive ups and downs
in the stock market are difficult to prevent, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Japan Appeals India to Sign CTBT </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Japanese Prime
Minister Yoshiro Mori appealed to India Thursday to sign the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) for further promoting
amicable bilateral relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"I strongly expect India's early signature to the CTBT, in
order that we can take initiatives together for nuclear
disarmament and nonproliferation and further promote our amicable
relations," Mori said at a meeting here organized by the
Federation of Industrial and Commerce Cooperation of India (FICCI).
</P>
<P>
"By taking such steps," the Japanese leader said, "India will
win due respect and praise from the international community as a
responsible nation."
</P>
<P>
Mori justified Tokyo's imposition of "economic measures"
against New Delhi following the latter's nuclear tests in May 1998,
saying the tests came as bolt from the blue to Japanese people.
</P>
<P>
He asked India to understand the sentiment of Japanese people
who solely experienced the disaster of nuclear bombs and their
heartfelt desire for nonproliferation and elimination of nuclear
weapons.
</P>
<P>
Condemning terrorism in all forms, he said "there can be no
justification for terrorist acts, no matter what their reasons may
be."
</P>
<P>
Mori told Indians that he had asked Pakistan's military ruler
General Pervex Musharaff to control terrorism and create a
conducive environment for resumption of dialogue with India.
</P>
<P>
Mori, who arrived here Tuesday evening for a three-day official
visit, held wide-ranging talks Wednesday evening with Indian
leaders including his Indian counterpart Atal Biheri Vajpayee.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from a 90-minute one-to-one and delegation-level talks,
the two leaders declared that India and Japan established global
partnership.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the media after the meetings, Indian External Affairs
Minister Jaswant Singh said the two sides agreed to initiate a
security dialogue despite differences on nuclear issues this year.
</P>
<P>
Mori announced that his country would give more fellowships to
Indian students wishing to pursue higher education in Japan.
</P>
<P>
The visit, the first by a Japanese Prime Minister in the last
ten year, highlighted that Tokyo is keen to bring back on track
bilateral relations derailed in the aftermath of India's nuclear
tests in May, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure to New Delhi, the Japanese leader, who
arrived in Bangalore Monday evening from Pakistan, reportedly
proposed a major promotion and cooperation initiative between the
two countries in information technology (IT) sector.
</P>
<P>
He told Indian industrial leaders that Japan had prepared a
package of measures to spend 15 billion U.S. dollars over the next
five years to achieve the goals of elimination of the digital
divide between countries.
</P>
<P>
Japan, he said, would take a lead in promoting the use of IT in
developing countries, especially in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Japan is a major source of development assistance and leading
trade partner and investor in India, with the two-way trade
increasing to 4.56 billion U.S. dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
Japan's direct investment in India since 1991 ranks third among
major countries and nearly 200 Japanese companies have set up
their offices in the South Asian country.

<HEADLINE> South Korea to Complete Parts of Inter-Korean Railroad Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 24 (Xinhua) -- South Korea will complete the
construction of some sections of the railroad and highway system
linking the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) by next
September, said the South Korean Ministry of Construction and
Transportation Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The systems in the western part of South Korea will re-connect
with the inter-Korean railway and road networks that were severed
in 1945 when the Korean Peninsula was divided.
</P>
<P>
A dedication ceremony for the project will be held September 15.
</P>
<P>
The 12-kilometer long railroad section of the Seoul-Shinijiu
Line in South Korea, between Munsan and Changdan, will be
reconstructed at a cost of 54.7 billion won (some 50 million U.S.
dollars). The railroad section in the DPRK is also 12 kilometers
long between Kaesong and Changdan.
</P>
<P>
Some 100 billion won will be spent building a 6 kilometer, four-
lane highway linking the Tongil Grand Bridge to Changdan along the
Seoul-Shinijiu Kyongui Line.
</P>
<P>
"Construction costs will come from the existing South-North
Cooperation Fund. We are poised to help North Koreans restore
their railroad and highway networks near the border area, if they
wish to do so," South Korean Minister of Construction and
Transportation Kim Yoon-ki said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the reconstruction of the railroad and
highway systems will consist of the simultaneous undertaking of
design and civil engineering to shorten the construction time.
</P>
<P>
Hyundai, Samsung and Daewoo construction companies have been
named to perform the reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
Senior officials from the two sides agreed to re-link the
severed Seoul-Shinijiu railroad system during their August meeting
in Seoul after South Korean President Kim Dae-jung and DPRK leader
Kim Jong-il reached a reconciliation agreement during the
Pyongyang summit on June 13-15.

SHENYANG, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Police in Shenyang, capital

detained two foreigners on charge of stealing 6,100 U.S. dollars
from a local bank.
</P>

The two, holding passports of a south Asian country, went into
a local bank of the Bank of Communications on August 14, asking to
exchange two 50-U.S. dollar bank notes for a 100 dollar bill.
While pretending to choose a bill with a specific serial number
from the given bank notes, they put some of the money in their
pockets. Their activities were recorded by a video camera
installed in the bank.
</P>
<P>
The two were caught in a local hotel five days later and
confessed they had stolen altogether 6,100 dollars from the bank.

<P>
Further investigation is underway, police said.

<HEADLINE> UNESCO Says China Successful in Balancing Economy &AMP; Culture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 63-year-old diplomat from Japan expressed sincere gladness
over the visit, the first since he assumed the office last
November.
</P>
<P>
He said China is an important member of UNESCO, and his current
visit is to discuss further China-UNESCO cooperation with Chinese
officials and hold talks on several cooperative projects.
</P>
<P>
"UNESCO's cooperation with China in the cultural, educational,
and scientific sectors has been progressing steadily and I'm quite
satisfied with such a cooperative relationship," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the question of economic globalization and cultural
preservation, Koichiro said the controversy between economic
development and cultural heritage preservation reasonably and
theoretically exists, however, it is not an issue that can not be
surmounted.
</P>
<P>
All the developing countries, while giving priority to economic
development, should make serious efforts to preserve cultural
heritage, and never should they sacrifice the cultural heritage
for economic benefits only. Otherwise, they would eventually
regret, he said.
</P>
<P>
China, while achieving a rapid economic growth in recent years,
has paid great importance to the preservation of its rich cultural
heritage, he said. So far, some 23 Chinese cultural sites have
been listed by UNESCO as world cultural heritage, and 61 more have
been submitted for application.
</P>
<P>
As a director-general from Asia, he thinks that Asian countries,
faced with economic globalization, should maintain their own
cultural identity in order to continue their cultural influence on
the world stage. This applies not just to Asian countries, but to
all countries across the world as well, he said, adding that's why
UNESCO has always been advocating cultural identity and diversity
all over the world.
</P>
<P>
Under UNESCO's proposal, the year 2000 was designated by the
United Nations as International Year for the Culture of Peace. The
concept of "Culture of Peace" originates from the fact that
conflicts and wars still exist even after the Cold War and UNESCO
takes promoting world peace through cultural, educational and
scientific cooperation among world countries as its major
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
UNESCO will, by cooperating with all countries worldwide,
continue advocating this concept in the future, he added.

policy, and never allows any activities undermining China's
interests in its territory, adding that Nepal would like to join
hands with China to advance relations based on the Five Principles
of Peaceful Co-existence.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 24 (Xinhua) -- While the movie with the anti-
corruption theme, "Live or Die", is breaking earnings records in
local cinemas, its original script, a novel titled "Option", has
also seen a comeback with brisk sales in the nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
The film has pocketed 25 million yuan so far across the country,
breaking the records set by imported motion pictures.
</P>
<P>
The novel was also one of the bestsellers of the year in China,
when it was published in 1997. Film producers were competing to
turn the story into a film drama.
</P>
<P>
According to the Mass Publishing House, publisher of the novel,
more than 100,000 copies of the novel have been printed, but it
has not been able to prevent its copy rights from being infringed
upon. Several pirated copies have been found so far.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Kejian, head of the general editing board of the press,
urged police to crack down on book piracy.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Trying to Protect Old Murals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Local scientists are making
strenuous efforts to look for ways for protecting murals in
ancient grottoes, according to Chen Shiliang, former director of
the Guici Grottoes Institute, in this capital of Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
They are cooperating with experts from the Dunhuang Institute.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese researchers are hoping to deal with murals that
have been covered with thick smoky ash, which is deemed as the
most difficult problem for experts to solve in protecting ancient
relics in the world.
</P>
<P>
The smoke came from different sources including burning of
horse manure, wood and oil, the expert said. Different techniques
are required to handle them, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
In the late 1970s, the Guici institute used acid solvents to
clean the murals but a dozen years later the physical nature of
the murals changed, resulting in a change of color.
</P>
<P>
"We have to stop cleaning the murals until we have developed
better technology," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Murals covered with smoky ash are easier to be protected than
being exposed after cleaning, Chen said. The ash could prevent the
painting from being oxygenized, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to the expert, the US-based Getty Conservation
Institute has showed its interest in studying the subject together
with Chinese researchers.

Localities have made experiments in running universities on a
cooperative basis. University zones have been set up in some areas.
</P>
<P>
Many colleges have opened up their labs or jointly built their
logistical departments to optimize the use of resources.
</P>
<P>
The reform, which took eight years, has been proceeding
smoothly. The reform will pave the way for the further development

<HEADLINE> Israeli Acting FM in Egypt for Talks on Mideast Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Acting Israeli Foreign Minister
Shlomo Ben-Ami arrived in Egypt's Mediterranean port city of
Alexandria Thursday for talks on ways of advancing the peace
negotiations with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
He was received by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, with whom
he focused the discussions on the question of Jerusalem, the key
sticking point in the Palestinian-Israeli final status talks,
Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Later, Ben-Ami held talks with Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa on the latest developments of the peace process and the
consultations conducted by all parties concerned to help narrow the
gaps between the Palestinians and Israelis, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli summit at Camp David of the United
States ended last month without any agreement largely due to
failure to overcome differences over Jerusalem. The concerned
parties have been seeking ways of reactivating the peace process
ever since.
</P>
<P>
Israel occupied East Jerusalem during the 1967 Middle East War
and declared later all of Jerusalem its "eternal and undivided
capital," while the Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital
of their future independent state.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Egyptian university students on Wednesday,
Mubarak expressed rejection of any Israeli sovereignty over East
Jerusalem and the Al-Aqsa mosque there, which is Islam's third
holiest site.

KATHMANDU, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The South Asian Association
for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) and the World Health Organization
(WHO) agreed Wednesday to enlarge cooperation in agreed ways to
help SAARC member countries to strive towards the goal of "health
for all".
</P>
<P>
According to a press release issued here Thursday by the SAARC
secretariat, SAARC and WHO signed a memorandum of understanding (
MOU) on Wednesday in the realization that health is central to the
process of socio-economic development.
</P>
<P>
Among the mutually agreed fields of cooperation under the MOU
are collaborations with the SAARC Tuberculosis Center in Kathmandu
and other institutions in South Asia, particularly those active in
the field of malaria, tuberculosis (TB) and HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The MOU also noted that research, analysis and dissemination of
information are to be promoted to enhance technical cooperation
and human resources development, including programs to improve the
health of women and children and to mobilize innovative actions in
favor of the underprivileged.
</P>
<P>
Specific projects and program of collaborations will be
developed by WHO and the Standing Committee of SAARC, said the MOU.
</P>
<P>
Due to extreme poverty, South Asian countries are afflicted
with various diseases, especially TB, malaria, cholera and HIV/
AIDS. Statistics show that 2.5 million cases of TB occur each year
in SAARC countries, representing over 30 percent of the cases
worldwide.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Launch Internet Literacy Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia will launch a year-
long National Internet Literacy Campaign next month in a bid to
increase the number of Internet users in the country.
</P>
<P>
The campaign's objectives are to raise the level of Internet
literacy among Malaysians, and to promote a lifelong learning
culture among participants in line with Malaysia's goal of
achieving a knowledgeable society, Deputy Minister of Energy,
Communications and Multimedia, Tan Chai Ho announced here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
There are more than four million Internet users in Malaysia and
studies indicate the majority of them are those in the 20 to 24
years old age group who are taking the lead in enlarging the
Internet population in the country.
</P>
<P>
Tan Chai Ho said that however there are other levels of the
population that had yet to go "online".
</P>
<P>
Malaysians over 30 years old are under-represented online
although many of the people signed up for Internet accounts are
over 30 years old, he said, adding various factors contribute to
the scenario, one of the most highlighted being that Malaysians
over 30 years old prefer conventional methods and their dependence
of their old-habits makes it difficult for them to adopt the new
ways of doing things.
</P>
<P>
The campaign, targeting the adults, would provide training and
hands-on Internet courses to participants who would also learn how
to use the campaign's website which provides a series of online
training programs including to see, hear and receive multimedia
data from trainers.
</P>
<P>
Organizers expect about 500,000 Malaysians to participate in
the campaign jointly organized by various commercial and non-
profit organizations.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Army Chief of Staff
Gen. Tyasno Sudarto called on here Wednesday western countries to
lift their embargo on the sale of aircraft to Indonesia, saying
the Indonesian Military (TNI) needs planes to carry out
humanitarian duties.
</P>
<P>
"Putting an end to the conflict in Maluku is also a
humanitarian duty rather than an encounter with the enemy. That is
why western countries should no longer impose the embargo on the
sale of aircraft (to Indonesia)," Sudarto was quoted Thursday by
Antara as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Army has U.S-made Bell helicopters and Spain-
made Cassa fixed-wing aircraft in addition to IPTN (National
Aircraft Industry) made planes which are relatively expensive.
</P>
<P>
"Once we tried to purchase Russian-made MI-17 planes. I visited
Russia and signed a contract for the purchase of the aircraft. But
because of the monetary crisis, the plan was canceled," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sudarto added that the Army has drawn up a medium term plan to
purchase aircraft and main weaponry system but to date, only 37
percent of the plan has been realized.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chief of the Army's Strategic Reserve Command (
Kostrad) Let. Gen. Ryamizard Ryacudu said only 50 percent of the
Kostrad weaponry is worth using, while the rest are damaged.
</P>
<P>
And because of limited transportation, the security authorities
have found it difficult to move troops from one place to another
in Maluku province to cope with horizontal conflict there.

KUALA LUMPUR, August 24 (Xinhua) -- A Japanese engineer was
jailed for eight years and ordered to be given 10 strokes of the
rattan by the Sessions Court here Thursday for using criminal
force to outrage the modesty of a manager in November last year.
</P>
<P>
Hiroshi Iwabuchi, 43, of Kanagawa, Japan, was found guilty of
using criminal force to outrage the modesty of the 27-year-old
manager at a local hotel here on November 19 last year, according
to Bernama news agency.
</P>
<P>
Passing the sentence, Judge Akhtar Tahir ordered the jail term
to commence on November 22 last year, the day Iwabachi was
arrested.
</P>
<P>
The judge said that the offense committed by Iwabuchi was a
very serious one as he had used criminal force on the manager to
the extent of causing serious injuries to her private parts.
</P>
<P>
He said that she would also be scarred for life.
</P>
<P>
The charge under Section 354 of the Penal Code carries the
maximum jail term of 10 years or fine or whipping or any two, on
conviction.
</P>
<P>
Iwabuchi originally also faced a charge of raping the manager,
who is married and has a child, and of sodomizing her at the same
time and place. However, he was acquitted and discharged on April
27 this year on both charges without his defense being called.

JAKARTA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Following the announcement of
the new cabinet lineup by Indonesian President Abdurrahman Wahid
on Wednesday afternoon, the country's rupiah exchange rate on
Thursday dropped to 8,400 (buying) and 8,550 (selling) against U.S.
dollar, from the previous day when it traded at 8,340/8,390 per U.
S. dollar.
</P>

But, analysts here predicted the currency will edge up soon
after the new cabinet drawing up its economic programs in
particular in connection with the ongoing economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, rupiah hit a three-month high as it broke through the
8,200 level against the greenback on Tuesday following a calmer
political situation as well as an expectation for a more capable
cabinet lineup.
</P>
<P>
And the day before the announcement of cabinet rupiah touched 7,
950 (buying) and 8,150 (selling) per dollar.

According to analyst of PT Danareksa, Yosef Ginting, the

</P>
<P>
He said market had made negative judgment instead of a positive
one against the formation of Wahid's cabinet.

"We hope that Wahid cabinet would be able to show its good
performance albeit most people here feel disappointed," he was

<HEADLINE> Thai PM Urges Olympic Team to Do Best </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Thai prime minister Chuan
Leekpai on Thursday exhorted Thailand's Olympic Team do their best
in Sydney, both on and off the field.
</P>
<P>
Meeting representatives of the country's Olympic team, led by
National Olympic Committee president Chettha Thanajaro, the prime
minister issued words of encouragement to them and insisted that
besides winning, strictly keeping to the rules of competition and
fair-play is equally important.
</P>
<P>
"Just go out there and do your best, which will satisfy the
Thai people, but do not pressuress yourselves too much because it
could hurt your performance," said Chuan.
</P>
<P>
However, the prime minister said he hoped the athletes would do
as well as the previous Games in Atlanta in 1996 when boxer
Somluck Kamsing clinched Thailand's first Olympic gold medal and
another boxer also produced a bronze medal.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the Thai Olympic team, Chettha said: "we are not
going over the top with our predictions. If we repeat our Atlanta
performance, I will be satisfied."
</P>
<P>
He expects one gold medal at least and picked boxing as the
most likely sport for success.

BEIJING, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Beijing Customs confirmed today
that they recently found 78.5 grams of marijuana in a magazine
sent to Japan by Express Mail Service (EMS) and caught the sender,
who had a Ghana passport.
</P>
<P>
The suspect, Kofi Amanfo Tawiah, confessed that he had started
selling drugs since he came to China in 1995. He has sent drugs to
foreign countries by mail using fake names and addresses many
times. The case is under further investigation.
</P>
<P>
Smugglers tend to send drugs by mail because it is less risky.
The Customs office has uncovered three cases of drug smuggling
through EMS, confiscating altogether 3.1 grams of heroine and 155.
85 grams of marijuana this year.
</P>
<P>
Beijing Customs officials have discovered 366.1 grams of

<HEADLINE> China to further Rectify Intermediary Organs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 24 (Xinhua) -- China will further rectify
intermediary organs of the country and a scope of the
rectification has been drawn up, Minister of Finance Xiang
Huaicheng said today.
</P>
<P>
More than a dozen kinds of intermediary organs and related
professional service organizations, including accounting firms,
lawyer's offices and notarial agents, will be subject to the
rectification, Xiang told a national meeting on the work.
</P>
<P>
He said that the agencies of the same or similar professions
should be merged and put under unified administration. Those that
have unique functions and cannot be merged with other services
will be allowed to continue independent operations under stricter
regulations.
</P>
<P>
The services that are not "mature" enough or cannot meet the
requirements for professional regulations will be ordered to quit
the market.
</P>
<P>
The minister pointed out that there are too many intermediary
organs in China, many of which are connected with or even directly
run by government departments.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the central government has ordered all such
organs to cut links with their government sponsors in terms of
personnel, finance, business operation and titles, and transform
into entities based on partnership or with limited liability
before the end of October 1.
</P>
<P>
Those who still maintain the links after the deadline will be
severely dealt with, the minister warned.

<HEADLINE> HK's External Trade Up in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's total exports and
imports showed further notable increases in July, according to the
external merchandise trade figures released Thursday by the Census
and Statistics Department of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The value of total exports of goods increased by 9.6 percent in
July over a year earlier to 134.4 billion HK dollars (17.2 billion
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The value of re-exports rose markedly by 11.1 percent to 118.2
billion HK dollars (15.1 billion U.S. dollars), while that of
domestic exports increased slightly by 0.1 percent to 16.3 billion
HK dollars (2.1 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The value of imports of goods increased by 11.6 percent in July
over a year earlier to 142.5 billion HK dollars (18.3 billion U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
A visible trade deficit of 8.1 billion HK dollars (1.04 billion
U.S. dollars), equivalent to 5.7 percent of the value of imports
of goods, was recorded in July. This was larger than the deficit
of 5.1 billion HK dollars (654 million U.S. dollars), equivalent
to 4.0 percent of the value of imports of goods, recorded in July
1999.
</P>
<P>
For the first seven months this year as a whole, the value of
total exports of goods increased considerably, by 17.0 percent
over a year earlier. Over the same period, the value of imports of
goods also rose significantly, by 19.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Taken together, a visible trade deficit of 56.6 billion HK
dollars (7.25 billion U.S. dollars), equivalent to 6.2 percent of
the value of imports of goods, was recorded.
</P>
<P>
A government secretariat spokesman said that the year-on-year
increase in the value of total exports of goods in July, while
still robust, moderated somewhat from the double-digit surge
recorded in the past eight months.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also observed a continued rise in imports
retained for local use, reflecting a sustained pick-up in domestic
demand upon the economic revival.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 24 (Xinhua) -- With the continuing recovery
of the Hong Kong economy, it is expected more jobs would be
available in the market, Hong Kong's Financial Secretary Donald
Tsang said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Total employment has risen six months in a row, and total
employment has gone up by 2.1 percent in May to July, representing
an acceleration from the increases of 1.7 percent and 1.9 percent
respectively in the first two quarters," Tsang said after chairing
the twenty second meeting of the Task Force on Employment.
</P>
<P>
In July, some 14,200 job vacancies were registered with the
Labor Department, representing a 12.8 percent increase over the
same month last year, Tsang said.
</P>
<P>
The Department also found jobs for 5,200 job-seekers which is a
record figure for the month of July and represents a 27.8 percent
increase over the same month last year, he said.
</P>
<P>
As for the youth, Tsang said the government has added a three-
month On-the-Job Training Scheme to the Youth Pre-employment
Training Program (YPTP) this year, in a bid to enhance job
opportunities for young people.
</P>
<P>
At the end of July, the Labor Department has found more than
800 training vacancies for YPTP trainees and over 1,000 trainees
have registered under the scheme.
</P>
<P>
To further increase the trainees' employment opportunities in
specific trades and professions, the Labor Department has
organized a series of trade specific briefings and tailor made
courses for them, Tsang said.
</P>
<P>
"Assisting the youth to equip themselves with the necessary
skills and knowledge to find jobs remains one of our top
priorities," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 24 (Xinhua) -- In 1999, China raised 146
billion yuan to fund science and technology development, up 12.5
percent year-on-year, with 67.8 billion yuan, from the total,
spent on research and development projects.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Premier Li Lanqing today disclosed the figures while
reporting on the implementation of the strategy to revitalize the
nation through science and education at a meeting of the Standing
Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC).
</P>

<HEADLINE> Law Helps Protect Land in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 24 (Xinhua) -- China has maintained a dynamic
balance of land acreage in this most populous country and the
largest agriculture in the world, thanks to the Land
Administration Law.
</P>
<P>
This remark was made by Zou Jiahua, a vice-chairman of the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), in his
report to the ongoing 17th meeting of the NPC Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
The law is featured with the policy of strengthening the
protection of land which says that a piece of cultivated land used
for building infrastructure has to be made by opening up a new
piece of land equal in size, according to Zou.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, the government released the ban on occupying farmland
by non-farming projects and the land used for infrastructure
projects has been remarkably increased, but it has not led to a
surprising rise in the occupation of cultivated land, due to the
law, he noted.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ministry of Land Resources, 24 of the country'
s 31 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions achieved a
balance in land use last year.
</P>
<P>
In some areas, the amount of land has increased due to the
policies to reclaim land occupied for other purposes and to
readjust the structure of farming, Zou said.
</P>
<P>
China has a large population and lacks cultivated land.
According to statistics made in 1996, the country had 1.3 billion
hectares of cultivated land, 0.1 hectares per person on average,
which is less than 43 percent of the world's average.
</P>
<P>
Among China's over 2,800 counties, 666 have their per-capita
farmland acreage below the alarming line of 0.053 hectares set by
the UN Food and Agriculture Organization.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Legislators Condemn False Medical Ads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese lawmakers attending the
current 17th meeting of the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress (NPC) expressed that false or exaggerated
medicine commercials should be checked by law.
</P>
<P>
They expressed the above opinion when examining the draft of
the revised Drug Administration Law.
</P>
<P>
Some of them complained that in many commercials, drugs are
like magic products with great medical power.
</P>
<P>
The participants agreed that false advertisements mislead
patients and bring harm to them, physically and psychologically.
False commercials must be stopped through laws, they held.
</P>
<P>
Many pharmaceutical manufacturers are investing more and more
money in advertisement than in the development of new products,
according to lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
Chen Junliang, a member of the NPC Standing Committee, proposed
that the commercials must make it clear what is being advertised
are medicine or health products. The law must force these ads to
declare the ingredients, effects, ways of taking them, possible
side effects, taboos and other matters that should be noted.
</P>
<P>
A kind of medicine that did not declare its side effects has
caused many children to lose their hearing, he noted.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest reports, 2.5 million Chinese took wrong
drugs, annually, due to false advertisements.
</P>
<P>
In her speech, Chen Suzhi, another NPC Standing Committee
member, denounced the false advertisements using film stars. The
actors should be on their guard when endorsing medical products in
advertisements, she said.
</P>
<P>
Some other speakers suggest that greater awareness about how to
recognize false or true commercials be made among the public.
</P>
<P>
The advertisement Industry has developed rapidly in China in
recent years. In the first half of this year, the country achieved
28.2 billion in the sales of advertisements, up 12.3 percent over
the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
China adopted the Drug Administration Law in 1985 and enacted
the Methods on the Examination of Medical Advertisement. Last July,
the government began revising the administration law.

<HEADLINE> Philippines, U.S. to Continue Info Exchange on Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines said Thursday
that it will continue to exchange information with the United
States to fight against terrorism, although Manila prefers to
handle alone the hostage crisis in Sulu.
</P>
<P>
Clarifying this point here, Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado
said, "Terrorism is a transnational crime that must be addressed
not just by one country."
</P>
<P>
"Our cooperation consists mostly of exchanging intelligence
information. No military aid," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mercado said the United States should not take
offense at President Joseph Estrada's pronouncement Wednesday that
the Philippines could handle the Jolo crisis on its own.
</P>
<P>
Besides, he said, Washington has not formally offered Manila
any assistance to secure the safe release of the Filipino and
foreign hostages being held by the Abu Sayyaf in Sulu.
</P>
<P>
Mercado said two of the three local residents taken by the Abu
Sayyaf have been released. The remaining hostage, reportedly taken
as a bride, remains unidentified.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf group is still holding captive 12 foreigners,
including nine foreigners abducted from Malaysia in April and
three French journalists who were covering the event in Jolo,
provincial capital of Sulu. Besides, a Filipino hostage, also
taken from Malaysia, is in their hand.

PHNOM PENH, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's parliament started
its recess Thursday with 50 days period while a draft law on Khmer
Rouge trial is still in high hope for parliament to debate soon.
</P>
<P>
President of the National Assembly Prince Norodom Ranariddh
announced that his parliament will come back for work on Oct. 16.
</P>

The recess is made amid debates on a draft law of electricity

To further promote the trainees' employment opportunities in

"Assisting the youth to equip themselves with the necessary
skills and knowledge to find jobs remains one of our top
priorities, and we are happy to consider any suggestions to
further improve the Program," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 24 (Xinhua) -- With the support of 20
environmental groups, Beijing has promised to stage a Green
Olympics in 2008.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-based environmental bodies joined their hands with
the Beijing 2008 Olympics Games Bid Committee and the Beijing
Municipal Bureau of Environmental Protection in this campaign as
they inked the "Act Plan for Green Olympics" here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
To fight against urban pollution has been one of the top
priorities for Beijing, one of the ten cities bidding for the 2008
quadrennial games.
</P>
<P>
Beijing will motivate all walks of life to make sure that
during the July-August period in 2008, the environmental quality
will be completely up to the standards for hosting the Games,
according to the pact.
</P>
<P>
Liao Sheri, President of the Global Village of Beijing, praised
the agreement as "unprecedented in the history of Beijing
environmental protection".
</P>
<P>
"Whether Beijing finally win the 2008 bid or not, the Act Plan
for Green Olympics will be of great significance to Beijing's
sustainable development," said Liao at the signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Liao received the prestigious Sophie Prize in May in Norway for
her pioneering efforts to combat pollution and environmental
degradation in China.
</P>
<P>
Liang Congjie, President of Friends of Nature, expressed his
hope that the 2008 bid could help Beijing make great progress in
addressing the beleaguering problems in environment.
</P>
<P>
"Be serious in solving the environmental problem, so that the
Beijingers could still benefit from the Olympics bid even if we
lost it," said Liang, who founded China's first environmental NGO.
</P>
<P>
"People can benefit from the bid, that is why we support it,"
added Liang, who will fly to Manila tomorrow to receive this year'
s Ramon Magsaysay Award for public service.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The United States survived a huge
rally of Japan in the third set for a 27-25, 25-22, 25-23 victory
Thursday to keep its bid for a decent finish in the 2000 World
Women's Volleyball Grand Prix being held here.
</P>
<P>
The Americans pulled out solid attacks while foiling the
Japanese with their blocking defense to build a 20-9 lead in the
third set.
</P>
<P>
But the Japanese refused to give up as newcomer setter Yoshie
Takeshita continued to play consistently on reception to lead
Japan's big comeback that cut the big margin to just 24-23.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese, one of the youngest teams competing in this eight-
nation tournament, had a chance to tie the match at 24-all, but
Miyuki Takahashi hit a wild return, giving the Americans the
winning point.
</P>
<P>
"It's a very strange game because Japan will play very well,
but for a while it will lose the momentum. The good point is we
won," said U.S. coach Mick Haley after their third sraight win
over Japan this year.
</P>
<P>
"We played hard but we could not beat the U.S. team because
they performed better than us," said Japanese coach Yoshida
Nobuyuki.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. coach commended Japan for giving its best throughout
the 8th edition of the Grand Prix despite failing to qualify in
the forthcoming Sydney Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese team gave their best. They have great courage to
fight all their opponents despite their failure to qualify to
Sydney," said Haley, whose team is one of the 12 countries
competing in the Olympics next month.

on its famed speed and defense to outlast the taller Italian squad,
25-20, 24-26, 25-18, 25-17, Thursday to face the United States for
the fifth place of the 2000 World Women's Volleyball Grand Prix
being held here.
</P>
<P>
The Italians recovered from first-set loss and clinched the
next set but they failed to keep the momentum as the South Kreans
overpowered them in the third and fourth to advance against the
Americans for fifth and sixth places.
</P>
<P>
Denied of a slot for the final four by China, the Americans
poured their frustration on Japan also on Thursday with a 27-25,
25-22, 25-23 victory to keep their bid for a decent finish alive.
</P>
<P>
The South Koreans' win was their second straight against the
crowd-favorite Italians following their 25-23, 25-17, 26-24
sweeping of Italy last week during the third preliminary round
hosted also by Manila.
</P>
<P>
With their loss, the Italians will meet the still win-less

ZHENGZHOU, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Hao Ruiduan, ex-director of
Huaiyang County Grain Bureau in central China's Henan Province,
was given the death penalty today for the killing of a deputy
curator of Huaiyang County Museum.
</P>
<P>
Hao asked Chi Hengjun, one of his subordinates, to find someone
to kill Li Genghai, a deputy director of his bureau, suspecting
that Li had disclosed his corruption activities.
</P>
<P>
Chi then turned to Sun Jiatian, a farmer, who went to his
brother-in-law, Ye Canjun. Ye finally hired two men to exert the
murder.
</P>
<P>
The two hired men, Cui Jianjun and Jia Lianjun, mistook the
deputy curator as Li and killed him by suffocating the victim at
his home on March 13, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The two confessed the whole thing to the police since Hao
refused to pay the set 70,000 yuan (8,400 U.S. dollars) for the
murder.
</P>
<P>
Chi and Cui were also given the death penalty, Sun and Jia were
sentenced to death with two years' reprieve of execution, and Ye
was sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment.

TEHRAN, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Tehran on Thursday denied a report
that Judiciary Chief Ayatollah Hashemi Shahroudi would be elected
as successor to supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
"Such reports carried out by foreign media is a mere lie against
the Islamic Republic of Iran," said Ayatollah Ebrahim Amini, vice
chairman of the Experts Assembly which is responsible for electing
the country's supreme leader.
</P>
<P>
Amini told the Islamic Republic News Agency that Khamenei's
health is in excellent condition, and the report by the Arabic
daily As-Sharq al-Wasat (Middle East) about Khamenei's illness
was "a sheer lie."

Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was elected by the Experts Assembly to
replace late Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Musavi Khomeini who
died in June 1989.

<HEADLINE> More Assistance for Explosion Victims' Kin: Estrada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada ordered Thursday that more assistance be extended to
families of the victims in last weekend's explosion at a firing
range in the southern Philippine province of Cebu.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado told reporters that the
president wants the government agencies concerned to see what more
could be done to help the victims' kin.
</P>
<P>
"The president ordered us to help provide assistance to the
families," Mercado said, adding that this is apart from the help
already given by the Department of Foreign Affairs for burial
expenses.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that on August 19, two boys died while another was
wounded after they tinkered with an unspent grenade launcher
ammunition they had found in a compound in Toledo city, Cebu.
</P>
<P>
The site of the explosion was used as a firing range in one
recent small-scale Philippine-U.S. joint military exercise,
reports said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mercado said the Presidential Commission on the
Visiting Forces Agreement (PCVFA) continues to investigate the
incident.
</P>
<P>
Mercado said the PCVFA hopes to determine what actually
happened, and will "try to correct this mechanism" involving joint
Philippine-U.S. military exercises.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon also ordered the
indemnification of the families of the victims in the Cebu
explosion.

<HEADLINE> American Firms to Invest More in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 24 (Xinhua) -- American electronic firms
are expected to invest 7 billion ringgit (1.84 billion U.S.
dollars) in Malaysia over the next three years mainly in the non-
semiconductor sectors such as the telecommunications industry.
</P>
<P>
The expected investment reflects confidence among the American
electronics firms in wanting to continue to invest for growth or
in new products in Malaysia, Malaysian American Electronics
Industry (MAEI) Chairman Teh Chin Bin said at a briefing here.
</P>
<P>
The investments are mostly from existing companies to reinvest,
to extend their facilities and add new products, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the expected investments, a number of MAEI member companies
are also planning to raise production capacity in order to cope
with the anticipated increase in global demand for chips, disk
drives and other electronics components, he said.
</P>
<P>
MAEI represents the electronics industry sector of the American
Malaysian Chamber of Commerce. Last year, MAEI member companies
including Motorola Malaysia, Texas Instrument, Western Digital,
Intel Technology and Dell Asia Pacific, invested some 2.0 billion
ringgit (0.52 billion U.S. dollars), according to Teh.
</P>
<P>
He said the investments by MAEI members had led to significant
spinoffs such as supporting local vendors, developing ancillary
industries and building the capability of contract manufacturers
to meet stringent requirement of global players.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that some negative perceptions about Malaysia
had also prevented some new companies from investing in the
country.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Shuttler Arbi Resigns From National Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hari, well-known veteran star, said that he made the decision
due to his recent weak physical condition.
</P>
<P>
"I have been injured for quite some time and it's really
difficult to recover enough to reach my peak form. I have to
accept this so that the Badminton Association of Indonesia (PBSI)
can focus its attention more on the youngsters. I don't want to
become a burden to PBSI as it has to spend money to finance me if
I'm still in the Indonesian Badminton Center," He was quoted by
the Jakarta Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
PBSI secretary general Leo Chandra Wiranata said that Hari's
request was approved by PBSI Chairman Subagyo Hadisiswoyo to
officially resign on August 21.
</P>
<P>
"Hari said in his letter that he felt incapable of reaching his
peak form as he did several years ago. He wanted to quit,"
Wiranata added.
</P>
<P>
Hari sparked controversy last year after winning the Singapore
Open title and saying that he would move to the neighboring
country after retirement.
</P>
<P>
"No, I'll stay in Indonesia. In my resignation letter, I asked
for PBSI's permission to allow me to continue practicing at the
center. At least I can be a practice partner for the youngsters. I
can't just quit. Whenever I'm ready, I'll compete for a tournament,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
Hari, who married long-time girlfriend Wiwiek Wiral in February,
claimed that he did not have any plans for business at the moment.
</P>
<P>
"I don't have any ideas to start a business," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hari's final performance was at the Thomas Cup championships in
May where he failed to play well after suffering a hamstring
injury during training at the Putra Stadium in Kuala Lumpur.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about the best moment of his career, Hari mentioned
winning the 1995 World Championships in Lausanne, Switzerland, as
the most impressive moment of his life.
</P>
<P>
However, he regretted his loss in the 1996 Olympic Games in
Atlanta, U.S.

BEIJING, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese treasuries stood stable.
Four bonds saw tame rises, the remaining two edged down by no more
than 0.02 percent. The combined turnover on the market expanded by
738 million yuan to 2.07 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Bond 009704 ended the session up 0.17 percent at 145.90 yuan
with the yield down 0.04 percentage points to 3.78 percent, still
the highest among all bonds. Bond 009905 climbed 0.06 percent to
99.92 yuan, pressing the yield down 0.01 percentage point to 3.30
percent, according to Homeway, China's leading on-line financial
and securities advisory company.
</P>
<P>
Both 000896 and the new floating-rate 010004, whose coupon rate
is 2.87 percent this year, picked up by 0.04 percent. The two
bonds ended at 123.94 yuan and 104.56 yuan with the yields coming
to 2.90 percent and 2.39 percent, respectively.

The domestic stock market rebounded and recouped the losses on

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Supreme Court President Aharon Barak Wednesday
rejected an appeal by former ultra-Orthodox Shas party leader Aryeh
Deri for a second hearing of his conviction on bribe-taking and
other charges. Barak ordered Deri to begin serving his three-year
prison term on September 3.
</P>
<P>
Former National Infrastructure Minister and Shas Knesset
(Parliament) Member Eli Suissa accused the Supreme Court of "
twisting the knife that has been planted in the backs of Sephardi
Jews for 52 years."
</P>
<P>
He also accused Prime Minister Ehud Barak of launching a "jihad"
against the religious public by announcing plans for civil reform.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Regional Cooperation Minister Shimon Peres fears
deeply for the fate of the peace process with the Palestinians, and
is scathingly critical of Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
He believes that the timing and method of the negotiations with
Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat were all
wrong.
</P>
<P>
Last month's Camp David peace summit focus on the issue of
sovereignty over the Temple Mount was a recipe for an impasse and
it was unnecessary for Barak to demand so strongly that the
Palestinians formally agree to "an end of the conflict."
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- The Israeli military has escalated its war of words with the
treasury in the battle for the budget for defense next year. The
head of the Israel Defense Force (IDF) Ground Corps Command, Major
General Moshe Ivri-Sukenik said "in the next war, we'll have to
send soldiers to the front in buses because we won't have enough
personnel carriers."
</P>
<P>
Sukenik described the treasury's argument that the IDF would
save money because of the withdrawal from Lebanon as misleading.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli President Moshe Katsav criticized ultra-Orthodox Shas
Party Knesset (Parliament) Member Eli Suissa's comments on the
ruling of Supreme Court in former Shas leader Aryeh Deri's case,
and endorsed more moderate comments from Shas chairman Eli Yishai.
</P>
<P>
Katsav said that it was improper to attack the dignity and
authority of the Supreme Court and called for moderation and
restraint in words and deeds to avoid a national rift.

<HEADLINE> Seoul Urges Establishment of Peace System by Four-Way Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 24 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim Dae-
jung Thursday called for the establishment of a peace system on
the Korean Peninsula by four-way talks which include South Korea,
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), China and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
"We've yet to touch on the inter-Korean military showdown,
although the atmosphere of reconciliation and cooperation has been
fostered following the inter-Korean summit," Kim said at a meeting
of security-related ministers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Kim stressed that South Korea needs to come up with a complete
peace system on the peninsula through a four-party peace
conference supported by the United States and China to eradicate
the legacies of the past and achieve peaceful coexistence on the
Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
South Korea and the DPRK will also "have to deter war by
building trust through mutual exchanges of military information,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Kim urged more exchanges between South Korea and the DPRK as
well as joint efforts with the United States and China to reach a
peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
Seoul and Pyongyang will have to establish joint committees to
address military, economic, social and cultural issues to develop
inter-Korean relations in a balanced manner and secure peace on
the peninsula as "peace on the Korean Peninsula has yet to
materialize or be guaranteed," said the president.

<HEADLINE> Shenzhen: China's Rising High-Tech Star </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, August 24 (Xinhua) -- A fishing village 20 years ago,
Shenzhen now has become one of China's three leading high-tech
development centers like Beijing and Shanghai. And the city has
plans to have half of its industrial output value come from the
high-tech sector in five years.
</P>
<P>
The young city, which sees Hong Kong across a river, has strong
momentum for high-tech development though the high-tech industry
only took off in the past decade, according to Chen Zhangliang, a
vice president of China's renowned Beijing University.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show the annual output value of Shenzhen's high and
new industry averaged 56 percent in the last nine years. In 1999,
the high-tech sector had an industrial output value of 82 billion
yuan, accounting for 40.5 percent of the city's total.
</P>
<P>
This means a contribution of four percentage points to the
growth of Shenzhen's gross domestic product (GDP), and shows the
high-tech industry has become the primary powerhouse of the local
economy, said a city government official.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2005, the industrial output value of Shenzhen's
high-tech products will account for half of the city's total, said
Mayor Yu Youjun.
</P>
<P>
The city government will do everything it can to create
favorable conditions for the growth of the high-tech industry, the
mayor said.
</P>
<P>
"The local government works very efficiently," said Chen
Zhangliang, who heads a research and production center in the
Shenzhen High-Tech Industrial Park.
</P>
<P>
The center, set up one year ago with investment from Beijing
University, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and the
Shenzhen city government, is engaged in projects related to
biology, information, energy and the environment.
</P>
<P>
It was built in only a few months with the strong support of
the local government, Chen said, adding that Shenzhen has become
Beijing University's most important high-tech industrial base
outside Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Attracting big name universities and research institutes from
other parts of the country is one of the strategies of the
Shenzhen city government for high-tech development.
</P>
<P>
At present, Qinghua University, Harbin Industry University and
33 other Chinese institutions of higher learning have also
established cooperative ties with Shenzhen or research and
production bases in the city, attracting a big number of talent
from across the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
The former rebels have threatened to storm the Uganda High
Commission in Nairobi if the government does not handle their
repatriation urgently, one of their leaders Nimrod Chandi was
quoted as saying by the New Vision newspaper Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The group, with about 400 children, has been in Nairobi for
almost a year, awaiting repatriation.
</P>
<P>
The Uganda Amnesty Commission, charged with reintegration and
resettlement of former rebels, has been running advertisement re-
assuring the ex-rebels that everything was being done to return
them.
</P>
<P>
However, Chandi said: "Those handling the matter seem to have
their hands tied and cannot proceed, that is why we want to have
audience with the President, who may be the only solution."
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the group leader met the Permanent Secretary of
Internal Affairs Ministry Paul Bachengana over the issue.
</P>
<P>
Bachengana reportedly said the government had solicited funds
from donors for the purpose but had not received it.
</P>
<P>
Chandi said many children had died due to lack of medication,
while others were very sick.
</P>
<P>
The leader said the Amnesty should give cards to those who can
transport themselves.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Prepares Repatriation of Burundi Refugees in Tanzania  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The official Daily News Thursday quoted Kai Nielsen, the Deputy
Representative of UNHCR country office here, as saying that
preparations for the repatriation and re-integration of the
refugees are already in full swing both in Burundi and on the
Tanzanian side.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. agency is planning to launch an information campaign
from next Monday after the signing of a peace agreement to try to
convince the refugees to return "on an orderly manner," said the
official.
</P>
<P>
""Despite the contingency arrangements that we have already
made for the safe return of the refugees, our concern is that
there may be a spontaneous voluntary repatriation," Nielsen told
the paper on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that UNHCR is also in the final stages of
completing a survey on the number of Burundi refugees who are
ready to return to their homes and the conditions they may have.
</P>
<P>
However, Nielsen said the level of the repatriation will be
determined on whether or not a cease-fire agreement will be signed
next Monday.
</P>
<P>
"If there is no cease-fire the refugees will not go home. That
is the major issue that has to be resolved," he was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, there are a total of around 532,900
Burundi refugees hosted at the camps in Tanzania's western regions
bordering Burundi.
</P>
<P>
"The government of Tanzania estimates that there are 300,000
undeclared refugees living in the villages. This brings to about
800,000 Burundi refugees in total, added Nielsen.
</P>
<P>
In Burundi, fighting between the army led by the Tutsi
minorities and the rebels of the majority Hutus has claimed the
lives of around 200,000 people, most of them civilians, and
displaced 1.2 million others since 1993.
</P>
<P>
The international mediator, former South African President
Nelson Mandela, has set August 28 as the deadline for the warring
fractions to sign a power-sharing accord. He has invited world
leaders, including U.S. President Bill Clinton, to attend the
ceremony to be held in Tanzania's northern town of Arusha and put
pressure on all sides to sign.
</P>
<P>
However, with fighting continuing and several key groups saying
they can not reach a deal by the deadline, political observers
here cast doubt on whether the agreement to be signed next Monday
could bring final peace to the tiny central African country.

<P>
SEOUL, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Peru has extradited a criminal
suspect to South Korea at the latter's request although the two
countries have not reached a treaty over criminal extradition.
</P>
<P>
The suspect, Byun Byung-ho, has been accused of having smuggled
300 million U.S. dollars out of South Korea by making false import
declarations in 1996-1997, said the Justice Ministry Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to the ministry, Byun was arrested in Peru through
Interpol in July this year.
</P>
<P>
The ministry received an approval on July 26 this year after it
asked the Peruvian government to deliver the suspect who fled
South Korea while awaiting court trial in April this year.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the cooperation, South Korea will seek to sign an
extradition and judicial cooperation pact with Peru, said the
ministry.

<HEADLINE> Father Accused of not Paying Tuition Fee for Son </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, August 24 (Xinhua) -- A high school graduate recently
accused his father of not paying for his imminent undergraduate
study.
</P>
<P>
Lu Wentai, 18, who lives in east China's Zhejiang province, did
well in the national matriculation examination in June and was
admitted to a university in Xi'an in mid-west China, which
demanded tuition and living costs totaling 8,204 yuan (about 1,000
U.S. dollars) when he registers for classes at the end of this
month.
</P>
<P>
However, his father, Lu Hongguang, refused to pay the fee, with
the excuse that his son did not perform well enough to qualify to
enter any of the three renowned universities like Peking
University, Qinghua University and the Fudan University.
</P>
<P>
His father, a self-employed farmer operating a freight truck,
had agreed to pay for his son's tuition fee when he divorced his
wife (a vegetable grower) in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Persuasion from local officials failed to change his mind so
the son finally lodged a suit against his father, asking that his
father cover all four years of his undergraduate study, which is
estimated at about 40,000 yuan (about 4,800 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
But the father claims that he earns only about 5,000 yuan a
year and cannot afford to pay his son's tuition alone.
</P>
<P>
Understanding the father's financial difficulty, the court
decided that the father cover 8,000 yuan for the first academic
year and 5,000 yuan for each of the following three years, and his
son has to pay the rest.

<HEADLINE> Clean Production Makes Headway in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Clean production has made much
headway in China, with pilot projects established in about two
thirds of the country's provinces, municipalities and autonomous
regions.
</P>
<P>
The progress marks an encouraging shift in the country's
protection of the environment, according to today's People's Daily.
</P>
<P>
So far, over 400 enterprises in the country have passed clean
production tests. It is estimated that after the transition the
enterprises will lower their pollutant emissions by over 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
Clean production was first introduced into the country in the
early 1990s, which was marked by the establishment of the National
Clean Production Center in Beijing at the end of 1994.
</P>
<P>
After that, Beijing and Shanghai, and a host of provinces,
established their own centers of clean production.
</P>
<P>
The environmentally friendly way of production has found its
way into industries like the chemical industry, building materials,
metallurgy and textiles.

<HEADLINE> China Considers Law to Regulate Foreign Words </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 24 (Xinhua) -- With more and more words with
foreign origins, like "Internet" and "WTO," entering into the
everyday life of the Chinese, China's top legislature is working
on a law to regulate the usage of these words in the country.
</P>
<P>
The draft National Common Language Law was presented once again
to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC)
for deliberation and examination, which is holding its 17th
meeting in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
How to regulate the use of foreign words has become a topic of
heated discussion among Chinese lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
The draft stipulates that since Putonghua is the common speech
of the Chinese language, and should be used in all broadcasts, TV
programs, movies, public facilities, billboards, business names,
as well as packages and directives of all goods marketed within
the territory.
</P>
<P>
"Some of the goods carry with them no Chinese words but English
letters. It's hard for consumers to understand," lawmakers said.
</P>
<P>
They proposed that all packaged goods have the Chinese language
written on it, which should also apply to the directives.
</P>
<P>
Some lawmakers pointed out to the mistakes in the translation
of foreign words. The country should designate some departments
for official translations.
</P>
<P>
However, a few lawmakers voiced their concern about the
feasibility to regulate the use of foreign words with laws. "It
will be very difficult, though necessary," a lawmaker said.

<HEADLINE> Appointment of New NZ Governor-General Welcomed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, August 24 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Prime Minister
Helen Clark issued a statement here Thursday, welcoming the
announcement that the Queen has approved the appointment of Dame
Silvia Cartwright to succeed Sir Michael Hardie Boys as Governor-
General of New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
"Dame Silvia Cartwright Has made an impressive contribution to
New Zealand at home and abroad as a lawyer and jurist, and as an
advocate for women and women's rights," Helen Clark said.
</P>
<P>
She said New Zealand is "extremely fortunate" to have Dame
Silvia as its Governor-General.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the New Zealand government, Helen Clark conveys
her best wishes to Dame Silvia and her husband, Peter Cartwright.
</P>
<P>
The Governor-General is appointed by the Queen on the advice of
the New Zealand government. The usual term of appointment is five
years.
</P>
<P>
Sir Michael Hardie Boys will complete his term in March and
Dame Silvia will be sworn in as Governor-General in April.
</P>
<P>
Dame Silvia, 57, was born in Dunedin, the largest city on the
southern part of New Zealand's South Island. After graduating with
a law degree from Otago University in 1967, Dame Silvia spent the
next 14 years in practice in the country. In 1993, she was the
first woman to be appointed a High Court judge. She hosted an
international conference of women judges in Wellington on the same
year.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993 Dame Silvia has been a member of a United Nations
human rights treaty body. This committee has responsibility for
monitoring compliance with the United Nations Convention on the
Elimination of Discrimination Against Women.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Dollar Sinks to New Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand dollar took
another hit here Thursday as the country's grim trade figures
pushed it to a new all-time low.
</P>
<P>
After losing almost 2.5 percent Wednesday, the New Zealand
dollar slumped another 2 percent to 42.35 cents of the U.S. dollar
Thursday, its lowest level ever.
</P>
<P>
The slide came after Statistics New Zealand released
provisional figures for trade in July, showing a bigger-than-
expected deficit between the country's imports and exports.
</P>
<P>
According to the New Zealand government statistical department,
the country had a deficit for the month of July of 330 million NZ
dollars (140 million U.S. dollars) against expectations of just 20
million NZ dollars (8.5 million U.S. dollars). The trade deficit
for the year from August 1999 to July 2000 is now 3.36 billion NZ
dollars (1.423 billion U.S. dollars) against an average market
expectation of 3.059 billion NZ dollars (1.3 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Evening Post quoted New Zealand Finance Minister Michael
Cullen as saying he would not direct the Reserve Bank to intervene
to prop up the ailing currency because any intervention in the
currency market put the New Zealand taxpayer at the risk of "
taking a bath."
</P>
<P>
Local economists are reluctant to predict if the slide of the
New Zealand dollar will continue or if there will be a recovery in
the currency in the short term, the Wellington-based newspaper
said.

<P>
MANILA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Share prices at the Philippine
Stock Exchange (PSE) marginally dropped Thursday despite recent
revamp of the PSE board.
</P>
<P>
The 30-company Phisix, the market's main index, fell 0.6 of a
point to close at 1,491.25.
</P>
<P>
But the broader all-shares slightly crept higher by 2.78 points
to 658.69.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said investors discounted the PSE board revamp as they
still are wary over the country's political and economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
"The revamp didn't affect the market. The hostage crisis is a
more important issue and its resolution will give a bigger impact
in the market," said Irving Ackerman, a local market analyst.
</P>
<P>
The PSE elected five more non-brokers, making them eight to sit
in its 15-member board. The election is in compliance with the
newly enacted securities laws, designed to enhance the
transparency and fair play in the exchange.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Government Seeks to Help Evicted War Veterans  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a statement last night, Minister of State for Information
and Publicity in the President's Office Jonathan Moyo said that
while the police had a duty to keep peace and to enforce and
restore order where necessary, this must be done in accordance
with government policies and plans.
</P>
<P>
It should be done within the usual standards and expectations
of human dignity and common decency, he said.
</P>
<P>
Since Monday the police have launched raids on several farms
and properties around Harare illegally occupied by landless people,
resulting in property worth millions of dollars being destroyed.
</P>
<P>
Since February this year, the war veterans and other landless
people have occupied about 1,500 white farms countrywide in
protest against the slow pace of land resettlement.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, hundreds of the evicted war veterans and homeless
people marched through streets of Harare to protest against police
action.
</P>
<P>
They marched to Parliament where they demanded to see Speaker
Emmerson Mnangagwa. When told that he was not available, they
proceeded to the President's Office where their leaders met vice-
president Simon Muzenda.
</P>
<P>
In his statement, Moyo said,"The government is satisfied that,
in the interest of the rule of law, both the accelerated land
reform program and the urban housing scheme are being implemented
within the framework of the Constitution and laws of Zimbabwe, and
within the government policies."
</P>
<P>
He said, "Regrettably, the police not only acted outside this
stakeholder-driven approach, but also demolished and burned down
costly structures and materials worth more than five million
Zimbabwean dollars (100,000 U.S. dollars)."
</P>
<P>
Moyo said that the police actions in the recent evictions were
not inspired by, and did not provide a guide to, the government
policy in respect of the on-going rural resettlement program.
</P>
<P>
The government policy remains one of acquiring at least five
million hectares of land to meet the huge land need, including
the requirements of the demonstrating war veterans who have agreed
not to demonstrate in the form of fresh farm occupations. End

<HEADLINE> World Bank Sets Conditions for Supporting Zambia's Tourism  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Speaking during the first meeting of the tourism marketing
campaign committee on Wednesday in Lusaka, Samukonga said the
World Bank and other donors alike have been deeply disappointed
with Zambia's tourism support infrastructure, particularly in
Livingstone which is the country's tourism capital.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's Zambia newspaper, The Post, quoted Samukonga as
saying they observed that as the national tourism capital,
Livingstone had no plan and was certainly not moving in the right
direction as can be evidenced by the number of shanty compounds
springing up everywhere around the town.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that with an integrated approach where all line
ministries would be involved, the World Bank was ready to support
the industry with about 150 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"The World Bank wants to see the involvement of all
stakeholders and the ministries of finance, environment and
transport and communication," Samukonga said.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, various representatives of business
organizations and hospitality fraternity converged on Wednesday to
form a planning committee prior to the stakeholders meeting to be
held later this year.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the committee is to map out a plan on how all
stakeholders in the local tourism industry can come together and
deliberate on issues of tourism marketing and reflect on problems
affecting the industry and then map a way forward for an ambitious
and well funded marketing program.
</P>
<P>
Samukonga reiterated that cash constraints and lacking
supporting infrastructure have largely contributed to hampering
ZNTB's already developed five-year marketing strategy whose
targets have carefully been selected to fit within limited
resources.
</P>
<P>
He said currently, the amount allocated to tourism marketing
annually in Zambia was a meagre 500,000 dollars which in most
cases was not available at the end of the year.

<HEADLINE> More Players Leave Indonesian Badminton Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The Badminton Association of
Indonesia (PBSI) Secretary-General Leo Chandra Wiranata said on
Wednesday that seven more players had resigned from the Indonesian
Badminton Center.
</P>
<P>
This follows the resignation of the 1995 world champion
Hariyanto Arbi. Arbi had said that he resigned due to his
stagnant performance and a prolonged injury.
</P>
<P>
Men's singles players Irwansyah and Vidre Wibowo and doubles
specialists Hermono Yuwono, Imam Tohari and Rizal Fadillah were
earlier expelled from the center.
</P>
<P>
Men's doubles player Denny Kantono resigned due to age but will
still help the association as a practice partner while Ade Lukas
plans to move to a different country. Ade said earlier he was
offered the position of practice partner with the Swedish national
team.
</P>
<P>
"Some of the athletes returned to their clubs. But they will
still receive what is rightfully theirs, including prize money or
contracts with Yonex. The expulsion is effective from today (
Wednesday)," Wiranata was quoted by the Jakarta Post Thursday as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Yonex, the Japan-based sports equipment, signs a four-year
contract with PBSI worths 1.1 million U.S. dollars per year.
</P>
<P>
PBSI has also warned eight players: men's singles competitors
Jeffer Rosobin and Yudi Suprayogi; women's doubles players
Angelina de Pauw, Puspa Dewi and Eny Widowati; and men's doubles
players Santoso Sugiharjo, Andreas and Hadi Saputra.
</P>
<P>
Some of them were warned due to their stagnant performance in
international tournaments while others were cautioned over
undisciplined behavior. They were given a deadline of December to
improve their achievements and behavior.
</P>
<P>
"Should there be no changes in December, the eight shuttlers
will be expelled, as stated by the PBSI official in charge of
athletes development (Mangombar Ferdinand Siregar)," Wiranata
added.

JAKARTA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's star badminton
player Taufik Hidayat, the winner of the recent Indonesia and
Malaysia Open tournaments, said that he aimed at winning the JVC
Asian Badminton Championships slated at the Senayan Indoor Stadium
here November 1 to 5.
</P>
<P>
"It's an important event because if I win I will be crowned the
best in Asia. We all know that Asia is the center of badminton
power in the world," he was quoted by the Jakarta Post Thursday as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The 19-year-old shuttler also aims at the Olympic gold medal in
the coming Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
The Badminton Association of Indonesia (PBSI) Secretary-General
Leo Chandra Wiranata said that PBSI and the Asian Badminton
Confederation (ABC) would lobby China to send its best team to the
championships.
</P>
<P>
China has been absent from the annual Indonesia Open since 1997,
due to security reasons. This year it sent its second stringers,
except Sun Jun, to the Indonesia Open last month.
</P>
<P>
"We'll talk to them at the Olympics to persuade them to come to
Jakarta. But the ABC had early discussions with China and they
promised to support the event," Wiranata said.

<HEADLINE> DPRK to Receive Unconverted Long-term Prisoners From S. Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The Red Cross Society of the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) will receive all 63 "
unconverted long-term prisoners" in South Korea, DPRK's official
KCNA news agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the central committee of the DPRK Red Cross Society,
Jang Jae On, on Wednesday phoned his South Korean counterpart,
Jang Chung-sik, saying the DPRK Red Cross plans to receive the
prisoners and their families in near future.
</P>
<P>
"Our side has the pleasure to inform you that it has decided to
receive all 63 unconverted long-term prisoners of whom your side
notified our side," the KCNA quoted the chairman as saying.
</P>
<P>
Jang Jae On said the direct air route between Pyongyang and
Seoul which has been available for recent visits will be used to
transfer the prisoners. The DPRK will send a plane to Kimpho
Airport in Seoul next Saturday with about 20 guides and medical
workers aboard, said the KCNA.
</P>
<P>
"Unconverted long-term prisoners" refer to prisoners detained
by South Korea since the Korean War in the 1950s who would not
change their political conviction.
</P>
<P>
The repatriation of the prisoners was included in the June 15
North-South joint declaration signed by DPRK leader Kim Jong Il
and South Korean President Kim Dae-jung at the end of the historic
inter-Korean summit in Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
The Red Cross delegations from Pyongyang and Seoul signed an

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Form Regulatory Body for Power Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- A move is under way to form a
regulatory body for Bangladesh's energy sector to address the
current disorder in the sector, The Financial Express reported
here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to official sources, the proposed body will be named
Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) and it will work as a high-
powered body with a provision to regulate, control and monitor
activities of both private and public entities involved in the
energy sector.
</P>
<P>
One of the main objectives of the proposed commission will be
creation of a healthy atmosphere where public and private
enterprises can operate their business in a competitive manner,
the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Thus it is expected that after the formation of the new
regulatory body, the present monopolistic influences of the public
enterprises in the power sector will be eliminated and an equal
commercial right will be established.
</P>
<P>
Besides these objectives, the proposed ERC will ensure rights
of consumers through its strong monitoring and supervision. It
will also be empowered to fix tariff of electricity in all sorts
of usage, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
The ERC will be formed in line with the government-sponsored
power sector reform programs. The Power Cell, an organ of the
Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources which is entrusted with
carrying out reform programs, has already prepared draft laws for
the proposed ERC and sent them to the cabinet for approval, the
sources disclosed.

<HEADLINE> S.Lanka Disappointed Over Britain's Delay to Ban Tamil Tiger Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka has expressed
disappointment over the British government's delay to ban the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels whose international
headquarters are in London, press reports said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We expected the British to act fast on our request," a
government official was quoted in the Island newspaper as saying.
He said delays will only help the LTTE, who have waged a 17-year
war against the Sri Lankan government seeking to establish a
separate state of Tamil Eelam in the country's north and east.
</P>
<P>
British High Commission (Embassy) spokesperson Alison Kemp has
said Britain was considering the request of Sri Lanka's Foreign
Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar to proscribe the LTTE under the
Terrorism Act of July 2000.
</P>
<P>
However, Britain has said it will decide on the matter early
next year. British Home Secretary Jack Straw will decide on which
organizations will be proscribed when the act comes into effect in
early 2001.
</P>
<P>
Kemp quoted the home secretary as saying that the act will
enable the United Kingdom to cooperate fully in the international
fight against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
In late July, Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Kadirgamar met
British State Minister of Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs Peter
Hain recently and formally requested Britain to ban the LTTE. Sri
Lanka has long urged the British government to curtail the LTTE's
activities on its own soil, but it is the first time that a formal
diplomatic request has been made to ban it.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting Sri Lanka's Ministry of Foreign Affairs
announced that Britain had a comprehensive legal framework to
effectively deal with foreign terrorist groups on the British soil.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka calls the LTTE a terrorist organization and accuses
it of assassinating political leaders, military officials and
carrying out bomb attacks on civilian and military targets.
</P>
<P>
The United States in 1997 included the LTTE on its list of
foreign terrorist organizations, making it difficult for the group
to raise money there and for its members to get visas.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE was also banned in India after being accused of using
a suicide bomber to assassinate former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi
during an election rally in 1991.

<HEADLINE> Japan, DPRK Resume Normalization Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 24 (Xinhua) -- After a one-day break, negotiators
from Japan and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)
resumed their second round of talks on normalizing diplomatic ties
Thursday morning in Kisarazu, Chiba Prefecture, east of Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Jong Thae Hwa, head of the DPRK delegation, and
Japanese chief negotiator Ambassador Kojiro Takano agreed to
discuss the settling of the past as they began their second day of
discussions, the Kyodo news reported.
</P>
<P>
One focal point at the final-day session of their two-day
second round of talks is whether the two sides can narrow their
differences on long-standing contentious issues over which they
remained apart at their first day of talks in Tokyo Tuesday -- the
alleged abduction of Japanese nationals by DPRK agents in the
1970s and the 1980s and compensation for Japan's 1910-1945
colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The two countries clashed over the two issues when they held
the first round of negotiations on normalizing ties in April in
Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, chief negotiators of both sides reaffirmed their
commitment to normalizing ties but maintained their basic
positions on the two issues.
</P>
<P>
The two sides intend to discuss individual issues in more
detail at the meeting in Kisarazu, but are unlikely to achieve a
breakthrough, a Japanese government official said.
</P>
<P>
Japanese officials have expressed the hope that the talks will
lay the groundwork for a third round during which the two sides
are expected to begin substantial negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The next session is expected to take place in October in
Beijing or another city in a third country.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Official Criticizes Sports Commercialization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Jose Ramon Fernandez, president
of the Cuban Olympic Committee (COC), Wednesday criticized the
intrusion of commercialization into international sports as well
as the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
But Cuba shall maintain the amateur status of competitions, he
told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Fernandez, also vice-president of the Council of Ministers,
said that the Olympic Games have been invaded ever since the Los
Angeles Games in 1984.
</P>
<P>
Contrary to the losses reported in the Munich and Montreal
Games, the Los Angeles event produced profits by selling the
television rights of competitions and commercial TV advertising.
</P>
<P>
Sports commercialization stimulated the rich countries to buy
athletes from poor nations to represent them, in exchange of
offers of better living standards, Fernandez said.
</P>
<P>
He mentioned as an example the impending presence in the
Olympic Games in Sydney where at least 15 athletes of fame will
compete under the flags of their adopted nations.
</P>
<P>
"The sale of sportsmen and sportswomen is in some way like the
sale of slaves. It's bad taste," Fernandez said. "The athlete is
offered as an instrument, a commodity."
</P>
<P>
What Fernandez most criticized was the prize money made by some
governments awarded to gold medalists at the Games, insisting that
nothing is farther from the pure Olympic spirit than this.
</P>
<P>
Cuba firmly maintains the position on the side of the amateur
spirit, he said that "professionalization is in the long run a
damage to sports."
</P>
<P>
Fernandez said no other nations have done more for sports than
Cuba because of their big scales and the development of values.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Farmer Buys 130 Russian Military aircraft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, August 24 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese farmer has bought 130
Russian scrapped military aircraft over the past years.
</P>
<P>
What Zhai Genxi bought were virtually airframes, mostly
scrapped types like MIG-17 and MIG-15, with weapon installations
and all devices for flight dismantled.
</P>
<P>
Zhai, 42, from east China's Jiangsu province, made full use of
the aircraft frames made of metals to manufacture stainless steel
and aluminum products for civil use, which brought him a good
fortune.
</P>
<P>
"It not only eased our demand for stainless steel, but cut the
cost considerably as well," said the farmer-turned-entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
The farmer usually had the airframes dismembered in Russia and
freighted the parts home in containers. The smart farmer got the
idea from the information that Russia were discarding some
outdated military equipment and some of which were made of high-
quality stainless steel, aluminum and other useful metals.
</P>
<P>
He has been to Russia and some east European countries several
times on business mission.

<P>
BRASILIA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- American Chamber of Commerce
chairman Thomas Donahue Wednesday asked Brazil to devote more
efforts for the creation of the Free Trade Area of the Americas (
FTAA) than for the negotiations with the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Donahue, who is visiting Brazil, said Brazil's exports to the
North America Free Trade Area (NAFTA) countries grew more rapidly
than those to the European Union.
</P>
<P>
"Brazilian exports to NAFTA between 1995 and 1999 grew 27
percent, while those to the European Union grew only 6.4 percent,"
the Brazilian business daily "Gazeta Mercantil" quoted Donahue as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the litigation over steel and orange juice from
Brazil in the U.S. market, Donahue said these disputes could only
be resolved through negotiations. Economic relations between the
two countries can advance in other areas, such as electronic
commerce and manufacturing, he added.
</P>
<P>
Donahue also praised the integration projects led by Brazil in
the Southern Common Market (Mercomun) and with the Andean
countries.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Blames High Oil Prices on Main Consuming Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The main oil consuming countries
are to be blamed for the high crude oil prices, said Hector
Ciavaldini, Chairman of Venezuelan state oil company Petroleos de
Venezuela (PDVSA) on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ciavaldini made the remark in response to criticism by the
European Union (EU) and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The EU and the United States, the main oil consumers, on
Tuesday asked Venezuela to moderate its stand on oil production
and collaborate to reduce the oil prices to "reasonable" levels so
as to guard against the risk of inflation and economic recession
in the industrialized world.
</P>
<P>
Ciavaldini blamed the United States and Europe for pushing up
oil prices with speculation, high taxes and costly environmental
regulations on oil.
</P>
<P>
The international market is balanced and does not need more oil
from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC),
said Ciavaldini, adding that these countries must reduce
speculation and high taxes to ease the pressures of the high oil
prices.
</P>
<P>
European countries collect a tax of between 200 and 300 percent
on motor vehicles fuels.
</P>
<P>
The West Texas crude price reached Wednesday a little below 33
dollars per barrel, its highest in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Europe have asked OPEC to increase its
oil supplies to the international market so as to lower the prices.

<HEADLINE> Chile Won't Change Key Trading Polices After Joining Mercosur: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The admission of Chile as a
full member of the Southern Common Market (Mercosur) will not
change key aspects of its trading policies, Chile's Foreign
Minister Soledad Alvear said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This process will neither change its policies of customs
tariffs nor lead to a "surrender" of its trading autonomy, said
the foreign minister after chairing a meeting of the Foreign
Policy Advisory Council.
</P>
<P>
Alvear said the first formal meeting on Chile's membership in
Mercosur will be held in Brazil on September 19-20. However, She
said the process might take five to eight years.
</P>
<P>
Chile, the same as Bolivia, is now an associate member of
Mercosur, the South American trading bloc currently made up of
Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
The Chilean government began to reduce tariffs at a rate of one
percentage point per year from 1998, when the general tariff on
imports was 11 percent. The customs tariff now stands at nine
percent and is expected to drop to six percent in 2003.
</P>
<P>
Chile wants other Mercosur members to take similar steps to
lower their customs tariffs, which is one of the thorniest issues
to be discussed in the impending negotiations, analysts said.

to the Champions League Wednesday after managing a goalless tie
with hosts FC Porto in the second leg match in the Antas Stadium

With this result, Anderlecht went back to European soccer's top

on their sixth consecutive presence in the league and will fight

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Expects Higher Economic Growth in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Guangdong Province, China's
forerunner of reform and opening-up, expects to have a higher
economic growth rate this year than it had in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The prediction was made recently by Bu Xinmin, head of
Guangdong Provincial Statistics Bureau.
</P>
<P>
According to Bu, Guangdong created 406.28 billion yuan in gross
domestic product (GDP) in the first six months of the year, up 10.
6 percent from the same period last year. The growth rate is one
percentage point higher than for the same period last year,
suggesting an improvement in the province's economic prosperity
status.
</P>
<P>
Bu explained that Guangdong's economic growth reached its peak
in the early 1990s, but started to slow down from 22.3 percent in
1993 to 9.4 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
He was confident that Guangdong's first economic recovery in
six years would take place in the new millennium, because there
was a notable rising tendency in the province's economic
performance, and the economic growth rate in the second quarter of
the year was higher than that in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
From January to June, the province reported increases of 13
percent, 6.1 percent, 32.8 percent in total retail sales of
consumer commodities, fixed assets investment, and exports,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The statistics bureau chief attributed the province's faster
economic growth this year to the effects from the implementation
of a range of state and provincial policies designed to increase
investment, spur consumption and economic recovery and the
province's efforts to optimize economic structure and improve
economic performance. It is also due to Guangdong's improved
economic development and a faster growth in world economy and
international trade.
</P>
<P>
Propelled by an increase in demand, the industrial sector of
the province created 189.5 billion yuan in added value in the
first six months of the year, up 12.5 percent, or one percentage
point more than that for the same period last year.

<HEADLINE> Gulf Air Plane Crashes, No Sign of Survivors Yet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAMA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- All the 143 people, including 135
passengers and eight crew, aboard a Gulf Air plane that crashed in
the Gulf Wednesday night near Bahrain were feared dead.
</P>
<P>
Six hours after the crash, which took place at 1630 GMT, 110
bodies have been reportedly retrieved from the wreckage of Airbus
A320, and still no signs of survivors.
</P>
<P>
Rescue operation is still going on and helicopters from the U.S.
Navy 5th Fleet based in Bahrain are assisting in search for more
bodies, possible survivors and the two blackboxes that record
pilots' conversations and the performance of the plane.
</P>
<P>
The two-engined Airbus A320 coming from Egyptian capital Cairo
had made two unsuccessful landings at the Bahraini International
Airport, and it ditched into the shallow waters in the Gulf near
the runway on its third landing attempt, with one engine on fire, a
Bahraini official said.
</P>
<P>
Bahraini Emir Sheikh Hamad Bin Isa al-Khalifa has ordered
investigation into the cause of the plane crash.
</P>
<P>
Bahraini officials had earlier said the flight GF072 plunged
into the waters shortly after taking off from the Bahraini
International Airport in the country's capital of Manama.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Gulf Air have confirmed that the passengers
include 63 Egyptians, 34 Bahrainis, 12 Saudis, two Britons, an
Australian, nine Palestinians, six from the United Arab Emirates,
three Chinese, one Korean, one Kuwaiti, one Sudanese and one Omani.
</P>
<P>
The crew comprised the Polish pilot, two Egyptians, an Indian,
one Filipino, one Moroccan, an Omani and one from the United Arab
Emirates.
</P>
<P>
Gulf Air belongs in equal parts to Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and the
government of Abu Dhabi, the largest of seven sheikdoms making up
the United Arab Emirates. The Bahrain-based Gulf Air operates a
fleet of 28 planes and flies to 53 international destinations.
</P>
<P>
There are altogether 1,100 Airbus A320s in service around the
world and the Airbus A320 can seat up to 150 passengers.

<HEADLINE> FBI Opens Office in Romania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. FBI juridical attache
opened office here Thursday in the presence of Romanian Interior
Minister Constantin Dudu Ionescu and U.S. Ambassador in Romania
James Rosapepe.
</P>
<P>
By opening an FBI office in Bucharest, Romania proves itself,
once more, to be a key partner for the European countries and the
United States in the struggle against the organized and
transborder crime, the U.S. ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
The Bucharest-based FBI office will cooperate with the
institutions watching the observance of the law in Romania and
will facilitate the information flow. All the FBI investigations
will be also coordinated by the Romanian authorities.
</P>
<P>
Thank to this partnership, the Romanian lawmen can resort to
the FBI services for the investigations taking place on the U.S.
territory.
</P>
<P>
This joint project views the protection of the commoners
against the criminal groups. By opening Romanian-U.S. partnership
relations, it shows the U.S. interest in backing up Romania's
efforts aimed at ensuring lawfulness and the citizens'
constitutional rights and liberties, and meeting democratic
countries' standards, Romania's Minister of Interior Constantin
Dudu Ionescu said in his turn.
</P>
<P>
The Bucharest headquarters will encompass two special agents,
not yet nominated.

<HEADLINE> DRC Signals Readiness to Allow Deployment of U.N. Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The Government of the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has signaled its readiness
to allow United Nations troops to be deployed in areas in controls,
U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said the change of position by the DRC emerged during recent
talks between President Laurent Kabila and U.N. Secretary-General'
s Special Envoy to the region, General Aldulsalami Abubakar of
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, troop deployment was just one of
the issues that Abubakar was trying to clarify with the DRC
Government.
</P>
<P>
"Freedom of movement is a very important issue," said he,
adding that the "essential issue" was the cessation of hostilities.
</P>
<P>
Describing the deployment report as good news, the spokesman
said "if indeed the president is prepared to allow the United
Nations to deploy to Government-controlled areas, that is a step
forward while the questioning of the Lusaka accords is a step
backward."
</P>
<P>
Any decision on a time-frame for deployment of U.N. troops will
await the arrival in New York of General Abubakar early next week,
Eckhard added.

<HEADLINE> Britain Names Britons Among the Bahrain Plane Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Britain said Thursday that two
British people died in the Gulf Air Airbus A320 jet which crashed
into the sea off Bahrain Wednesday, leaving no survivors.
</P>
<P>
The Britons have been named as Aileen Woods, in her late 20s,
who was from Scotland and resident in Bahrain, and Chris Keenan,
in his early 40s, from London and resident in Abu Dhabi.
</P>
<P>
The airline has set up an emergency response center in London.
The bodies of all 135 passengers and eight crew have been
recovered from the site of the crash.
</P>
<P>
Reports here said searchers have retrieved the cockpit voice
recorder of the Airbus A320. Investigators are due to study the
black box flight recorder very soon.
</P>
<P>
The plane was traveling from Cairo to Bahrain when it came down
shortly before it was due to land.
</P>
<P>
A Bahraini Information Ministry official, Said Al-Bably, said
the plane crashed after one of its engines caught fire. Bahrain
has started its probe, but also awaits experts from Airbus in
France and from the United States for help.
</P>
<P>
Britain's general manager for Gulf Air, John Evans, told BBC's
Radio 4 that the Airbus, which was just seven years old and part
of a fleet of 13 was a "superb aircraft" and "the latest in state
of the art technology."
</P>
<P>
A team from Airbus was now on its way out to join Bahrain
aviation officials to conduct a full investigation, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to an air traffic controller at Bahrain airport, the
jet circled the runway twice in an attempt to land, then on the
third attempt plunged into the sea and exploded in flames. He said
it came down at 1620 GMT.
</P>
<P>
Evans said he believed the pilot had not raised any alarm about
possible difficulties.

<HEADLINE> South Africa Guarantees Power Supply for Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- South Africa will supply
Mozambique with energy for new development projects until the
Cahora Bassa Hydroelectric Dam is restructured, according to
reports by the Portuguese news agency Lusa on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The decision was announced Thursday in Mozambique after the
country's president Joaquim Chissano met with his visiting South
African counterpart, Thabo Mbeki, who was in Maputo on a six-hour
visit.
</P>
<P>
Cabinet ministers from both countries were present during the
talks, which focused on bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Mozambican Finance Minister Luisa Diogo highlighted the
importance of Cahora Bassa Hydroelectric Station, which dams the
Zambeze River in the central interior region, as a power source
for the development projects, which include a new titanium plant
in the southern Gaza Province and an aluminum factory in the
central coast city of Beira.
</P>
<P>
However, Diogo and the South African Deputy Trade Minister Alex
Erwen declined to comment on the tariff question, nor on the non-
compliance with a 1998 accord on Cahora Bassa reached in Vimieiro,
Portugal. The Mozambican minister emphasized that the Cahora Bassa
question was tripartite, adding that "naturally, we will never
discuss restructuring Cahora Bassa per se, without the third
partner Portugal".

<HEADLINE> Nigeria, Togo, Benin to Enhance Energy Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria, Togo and Benin have
intensified their cooperation in the energy industry to promote
the integration process in the sub-region, Nigerian local
newspaper "The Guardian" reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Energy ministers from the three west African countries met in
Nigerian capital Abuja on Thursday to work out ways of
implementing a trans-national electrification project totaling 15
billion naira (about 150 million U.S. dollar), said the report.
</P>
<P>
The project, dubbed the Nigeria-Benin-Togo Regional Integration
Project, would install electricity line running from Lagos,
Nigeria to Togo through Benin.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's Power and Steel Minister Olusegun Agagu assured his
Beninese and Togolese counterparts, Messrs Dansou Essou-Felix and
Anjou Tchamdja that Nigeria was leaving no stone unturned to make
the electricity line project become a reality.
</P>
<P>
Agagu said that the project "is supposed to demonstrate
economic integration within the west African sub-region.
</P>
<P>
"The role of power in the economy of the country, region and
sub-region cannot be over-emphasized. We are convinced that this
is a project we should drive as fast as possible," said the
minister.
</P>
<P>
The Togolese Minister of Energy Anjou Tchamdja also disclosed
that presidents Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria, Gnassingbe Eyadema
of Togo and Mathew Kerekou of Benin had earlier met on the project
and discussed the cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Zanzibar President Vows Against Genocide During Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Zanzibari President Salmin
Amour has assured the people living on the Spice Islands that
peace and stability will prevail throughout the general elections
period and it will never turn into a place of genocide as in
Rwanda in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The opposition should not dream of turning Zanzibar into a war-
ravaged nation such as Rwanda because the government is well
prepared, the outgoing president was quoted as saying by Friday's
Guardian newspaper in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a campaign rally in the Isles for the ruling Chama
Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) presidential candidate for Zanzibar, Salmin
sounded the warning Thursday that those who brag of being capable
of causing chaos on the isles would suffer.
</P>
<P>
He said politics should not be the source of hatred. Leaders of
political parties should come up with political issues that would
bring about development instead of chaos and problems.
</P>
<P>
Salmin promised a sounding victory for CCM in the October
elections because "opposition politicians have failed to implement
democratic principles. Instead they are threatening people."
</P>
<P>
Presidential candidate of the opposition Civil United Front (
CUF), Seif Hamad, warned on Wednesday that his party will apply
whatever force possible to protect its victory in case it wins the
October elections.
</P>
<P>
He told his supporters that if the government depends on state
power to make sure the CCM candidate win the Zanzibar presidency,
CUF will bank on God and people's power.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar joined with mainland Tanganyika to form the United
Republic of Tanzania in 1964. But with its own government and
parliament, it is a semi-autonomous region in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
It will go to polls on October 29 simultaneously with the
mainland in the second multi-party elections this year, choosing
its own president as well as a new leader of the Union government.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar's CCM, under President Salmin, claimed a narrow
victory over the CUF in the 1995 elections, but the CUF questioned
the result and has been seeking a revenge.

<HEADLINE> Uganda, Rwanda Warn Congolese President on Lusaka Peace Accord  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Uganda and Rwanda have warned
that Laurent Kabila, President of the Democratic Republic of the
Congo (DRC), would be forced to comply with Lusaka peace accord,
or face the consequences.
</P>
<P>
"Kabila will be made to comply. We shall find ways to making
him conform with Lusaka agreement or face the consequences,"
Rwandan Patriotic Front Secretary-General Charles Murigande was
quoted as saying by Friday's New Vision, a Ugandan daily.
</P>
<P>
Uganda National Political Commissar James Wapakabulo and
Murigande were reacting to reports that Kabila would not honor the
accord, saying it did not respect the sovereignty of his country.
</P>
<P>
Wapakabulo and Murigande said after their talks on Thursday
that their countries would respect the Lusaka accord.
</P>
<P>
"For us, we are committed to the Lusaka process," said
Wapakabulo, adding that "it is Kabila who is creating an impasse
and it is up to the international community to bring him back into
the process."
</P>
<P>
The talks were a follow-up of the July Entebbe summit of
presidents Yoweri Museveni of Uganda and Paul Kagame of Rwanda.
The talks were aimed at improving relations between Uganda and
Rwanda after their armies clashed in the Congolese city of
Kisangani in May and June this year.
</P>
<P>
Wapakabulo said the two countries could continue discussing
their concerns in the Congo, and the next meeting will be held in
Kigali, Rwanda, in September.

<P>
"With the coming in of combatants from war-torn countries, we
feel the local people are at a great security risk," Machungwa
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the government in partnership with the UNHCR would
construct police posts and houses for police officers in refugee
camps to ensure security in the areas.
</P>
<P>
He said there was also need to rehabilitate and construct roads
and bridges in refugee camps for easy access to the areas.
</P>
<P>
Machungwa said Zambia accommodated more refugees than any other
country in the Southern African region adding that as at last week,
the number had risen to 220,000.

NAIROBI, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Kenyans will brace for harder
times ahead as the prevailing drought is set to persist, the Kenya
Meteorological Department has said.
</P>
<P>
The East African Standard newspaper Friday quoted the
department as saying most parts of the country are unlikely to
receive significant rainfall between October and December, instead,
they are likely to receive near normal to below average in the
coming season.
</P>
<P>
"The negative impact associated with the current drought might
persist for a long period," said JR Nykabana, Director of
Meteorological Services.
</P>
<P>
He advised the government to put into place measures aimed at
addressing drought in areas where little or no rainfall in
expected, especially in northwest and northeast of the country.
</P>
<P>
The weatherman, however, said central districts have better
chances of receiving above normal rainfall, and other areas
including the capital Nairobi and the southeastern parts of the
country would expect normal rainfall.
</P>
<P>
Most parts of the country have been under severe drought since
1998. So far around 3 million Kenyans are facing the famine and

<P>
A government report said durable goods orders to the U.S.
factories fell by a record 12.4 percent in July while jobless
claims ticked higher last week. The new data indicated that the U.
S. economy is slowing and inflation remains tame and therefore the
Federal Reserve will leave interest rates alone in the future.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve decided to stay on hold at a meeting on the
rate issue Tuesday but to leave the door open to further rate
hikes when a threat to inflation grows. Analysts believed that an
autumn rate hike right before voters go to pools is unlikely in
the presidential election year.

<HEADLINE> Romania Antivirus Soft Among World's Ten Best </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The RAV AntiVirus series
produced by a Romanian company has been over the last ten years
among the ten best antivirus products in the world, placing
Romania in the world elite of the software industry, the official
Rompres news agency reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, GeCad company that produces the RAV
AntiVirus series distributes its software in seven western-
European countries, concluding contracts with resounding companies
such as the Italian Ostfeld or the French MHD Informatique.
</P>
<P>
GeCad experts have created new systems against hoax-type
viruses as well as protection systems against hackers.
</P>
<P>
Hoex is a kind of e-mail tricking the user into multiplying the
virus by warning him, under the name of a well-known IT company
such as Microsoft or IBM, that it is not advisable to open the
message having a certain title because it contains a virus. In
such cases, the users multiply the message, extending the virus
that can destroy irreversibly the information in the computer. The
Romanian Company has created a program that detects such false
messages.
</P>
<P>
GeCad also created a new system capable to detect hackers who
take advantage of the technical problems of security systems, such
as simple passwords, communication protocols, faulty programming
or denial of service, to steal or destroy information. The
producer of the RAV AntiVirus has elaborated a study about
computer security informing its users how to apply the necessary
protection measures without help from specialists.

<HEADLINE> United States Refuses to Talk With Colombian Rebel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Ambassador in Colombia Anne
Patterson said Thursday her country won't have any direct contact
with the Colombian Revolutionary Armed Forces (FARC) while the
rebel group doesn't deliver the murderers of three American pro-
Indian investigators.
</P>
<P>
Patterson, who presented Thursday her credentials to Colombian
President Andres Pastrana, said her government won't carry through
measures with the FARC that kidnapped and killed in 1999 Ingrid
Washinawatok, Terence Freitas and Laheenae Gay.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. policy toward the FARC is very clear: we won't have,
on our government's behalf, any contact until the murderers of
these American workers are delivered to justice," said the new
ambassador.
</P>
<P>
The three investigators were kidnapped by a FARC front from an
oil zone in Colombia's northeastern Arauca department. Their
bodies appeared in March 1999 at a riverside on the border with
Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
The FARC, Colombia's biggest and oldest guerrilla force, has
held peace talks with Colombia's government since last October,
and has committed itself to investigate murderers although nothing
's been done as yet.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Debt Declines in Romania: National Bank Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Romania's foreign debt stood
at 8.111 billion U.S. dollars at the end of May, a 361.4 million
dollar drop from the beginning of January, Romania's National Bank
said in a report issued Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The drop was the result of net payments of 145.1 million
dollars and the depreciation of other foreign currencies against
the U.S. dollar, thus contributing to a 216 million dollar
decrease in Romania's foreign debt balance in the medium and long
term.
</P>
<P>
In terms of creditors, the most powerful influence over the
curtailment of the foreign debt in the medium and long term was
determined by a 22.4 percent shrinkage in portfolio investments
from more than 1 billion dollars at the end of 1999 to 810 million
dollars at the end of May, the central bank reported.
</P>
<P>
Romania repaid in May 1.1 million dollars of its debt to the
Merrill Lynch investment bank; it still has to repay 58 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral credits dwindled to 864 million dollars from 943
million dollars at the end of last year, with the most significant
drop being in credits with Germany.
</P>
<P>
Romania's biggest debt to international bodies at the end of
March was to the World Bank at 1.716 billion dollars, followed by
761 million dollars owed to the European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development.
</P>
<P>
The foreign debt diminished to 24 percent of the exports of
goods and services in May 2000 from 35.9 percent in 1999, the bank
reported.

<HEADLINE> IOC Satisfied With Athens 2004 Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"We are very satisfied with the progress of works and with the
close cooperation we have with Minister of Public Works Costas
Laliotis and his department," said IOC Vice-President Jacques
Rogge after separate meetings with Greek officials, including
Greek Deputy Culture Minister for Sports Giorgos Floridis and
Athens Mayor Dimitris Avramopoulos.
</P>
<P>
Rogge, who arrived here Thursday to review the preparations by
Greece for the Athens 2004 Olympics, also said that the results
had been encouraging so far and their greatest satisfaction was
that Greece would be left with an improved infrastructure after
the 2004 Games.
</P>
<P>
Describing his meeting with Rogge as fruitful and productive,
Laliotis said that they presented the analytical time line of
developments for the preparations and proved that all their
actions and projects would in fact be realized.
</P>
<P>
The Greek minister Thursday unveiled plans for 18 major roads
and five of the projects would be reportedly completed by the end
of 2003 and the remainder in May 2004, four months before the
start of the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
In April, IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch sharply
criticized Athens for its delays in several areas of Olympic
preparations, saying that such delays would endanger the 2004
Games' smooth running.
</P>
<P>
After the IOC warning, Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis
began to take actions to accelerate the pace of the preparations,
with the reorganizing of the Athens Olympic Organizing Committee,
which is currently headed by Yianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki, who
helped Athens obtain the right to host the Games in 2004.

<HEADLINE> Romania to Hold General Elections on November 26 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The parliamentary and
presidential elections in Romania will take place on November 26
and December 10, respectively for the second ballot, according to
the decision endorsed Thursday by a government resolution.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made during a meeting between the Prime
Minister Mugur Isarescu and the leaders of the ruling parties late
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The decision stipulates that the election campaign will confine
from 60 to 45 days, that is to say, it will start on October 12.
</P>
<P>
According to the laws in force, the elections' second round for
Romania's president will be staged two weeks after the first round,
namely on December 10, when the first ranked two candidates stay
vying.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition party -- the Social Democracy Party of
Romania -- doesn't agree with the delay of the elections,
considering that "the real reason of this decision is the ruling
parties' desire to profit by Romania's National Day (December 1)
to lead their election campaigns and to get advantages from the
position they are holding now in Government and state", "the
establishment of the Election Day during the winter season
encourages the absenteeism, which advantages the parties within
the ruling coalition".
</P>
<P>
The last elections were held on November 3, 1996.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Shilling Weakens Further Against U.S. Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Uganda shilling has
continued to weaken following an increasing local demand for the U.
S. dollar and limited inflows of the currency over the past few
weeks.
</P>
<P>
Foreign exchange dealers in the capital Kampala Friday are
buying the dollar at about 1,700 shillings and selling at 1,720
shillings, as against 1,680 shillings and 1,690 shillings
respectively last week.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Uganda (BOU) has sold 120 million U.S. dollars in
the foreign exchange market since the beginning of this year to
cushion up the shilling against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
It is said that corporate and individual buyers purchase up to
90 percent of the dollars sold in the market at every intervention
by BOU.
</P>
<P>
"A study should be conducted on who buys these dollars and
where they to, because this is becoming a dangerous game," said
one city dealer.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say the Uganda shilling is weak due to lower export
earnings as a result of a world coffee price slump and the
involvement of Ugandan army troops in the crisis in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo.
</P>
<P>
These created a bottomless hole for the foreign currency,
skyrocketing demand that is not being matched by supply, they said.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Increase Minimum Capital Requirement for Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The South African
Parliament's
finance portfolio committee on Friday unanimously passed the Banks
Amendment Bill, which seeks to increase by five times banks'
minimum capital requirement.
</P>
<P>
The draft legislation will now be referred to the National
Assembly for debate during the parliamentary session beginning on
September 11.
</P>
<P>
The bill, once promulgated, will raise the minimum required
level of capital and reserve funds for commercial banks in South
Africa from 50 million rand (about 7 million U.S. dollars) to 250
million rand (about 35.5 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
According to a memorandum attached to the bill, the increase is
necessary to cope with inflationary growth since 1994, as well as
the expansion of banks' activities and a need to remain
competitive on a globalized market.
</P>
<P>
The committee passed the bill -- tabled on Wednesday -- with an
amendment which was requested by South Africa's Banking
Adjudicator Neville Melville.
</P>
<P>
According to the amendment, a person called as a witness by the
banking sector's review board would now be allowed legal
representation at his or her own cost.

LAGOS, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Two Nigerian soldiers serving
under the United Nations Peacekeeping Mission in Sierra Leone (
UNAMSIL) were wounded when their unit attacked by the rebel
Revolutionary United Front (RUF), the News Agency of Nigeria
reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Fred Eckhard, spokesman for the U.N. Secretary-general Kofi
Annan, was quoted as saying at the U.N. headquarters that the
attack, which lasted for about four hours, took place on Wednesday
in the western area between Port Loko and Lungi in the war-torn
west African country.
</P>
<P>
The Sierra Leonean government troops were also attacked by the
RUF fighters around Port Loko, said Eckhard, adding that the
situation was under UNAMSIL's control after the U.N. peacekeeping
unit in the area had been placed on high alert.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the RUF attacks on the U.N. peacekeepers
have become common since May, when the rebels renewed its military
operations against the government following its abduction of about
500 peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
Seven U.N. peacekeepers have so far died in the attacks, five
of them are Nigerians.

<P>
LAGOS, August 25 (Xinhua) -- About 32 senior officials from the
Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) are to open a
workshop to discuss the training of security personnel on the
control of small arms in the region, said a statement reaching
here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement from the secretariat of the 16-
member organization in the Nigerian capital Abuja, the proposed
four-day workshop was part of a plan of action to facilitate the
implementation of the ECOWAS Moratorium on light weapons.
</P>
<P>
The plan of action was adopted by ECOWAS ministers of foreign
affairs at their meeting in Mali's capital Bamako last March and
approved by the 22nd ECOWAS summit in Lome, the capital of Togo,
last December.
</P>
<P>
The workshop, to be attended by chiefs of police, customs and
gendarmerie, would determine the measures to strengthen the
military, security and police forces of the member states, said
the statement.
</P>
<P>
The participants would also work out ways of implementing the
moratorium on the importation, exportation and manufacture of
light weapons to check the sporadic outbreak of violence in the
region, it added.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that about 40,000 light weapons are believed to
be in circulation in the region and are blamed for the recurring
conflict in west Africa.

JOHANNESBURG, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Two South African cameramen
Gugu Radebe and Tim Lambon, and their two colleagues, arrested a

Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi told reporters after
the meeting that their discussions mainly centered on potential

</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe has for the past nine months faced fuel supply
problems which are mainly attributed to the shortage of foreign
currency to make payment to the suppliers.
</P>

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Takes Measures to Protect Refugees in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) will issue identification cards
to refugees in Zambia in the next few weeks to protect them from
harassment by local law enforcement officers.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR Southern African Regional Director Illunga Ngandu, who
has been in the country since last Saturday, announced the plan at
a press briefing at the UNHCR office here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR will also put in place a stringent screening mechanism
with a view of identifying and isolating combatants from civilian
refugees in order to guarantee the security of refugees in camps.
</P>
<P>
The measures are in direct response to last month's arrest and
detention of refugees who were among 750 illegal aliens netted in
a clean-up campaign by the Immigration Department on the
Copperbelt Province.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the UNHCR also warned against an impending food
crisis in refugee camps as the refugee population in the country
continued to swell with an average of 100 to 150 refugees per day
entering the country from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (
DRC) and Angola.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest UNHCR statistics, there are about 224,
472 refugees in the country and the number is steadily rising.
</P>
<P>
Ngandu who visited some camps in the country said without any
rationing the present food supplies would only last until December,
adding that with the steady inflow of refugees in the country, the
UNHCR would have to ration food supplies.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to donor nations to come to the rescue of the UNHCR
and the Zambian government to avert massive suffering of thousands
of refugees in the county.
</P>
<P>
He implored donors not to turn a blind eye or pay lip service
to the critical refugee's situation in Zambia, which would persist
due to the continued fighting in the DRC and Angola.

<P>
HARARE, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Globalization is the major
challenge facing developing countries which should set up a forum
to encourage interaction among themselves, Iranian Foreign Affairs
Minister Kamal Kharrazi said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi made the remarks while addressing audience at the
University of Zimbabwe on globalization, civilizations and
cultural rights.
</P>
<P>
"It is through dialogue that we get to prepare to interact as
countries. We should get together and develop a united front,"
said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Globalization, he said, had an impact on a country's economy as
the more resources and technology a country had the better it was
ranked in terms of being advanced, and by being in this position
it was considered more powerful.
</P>
<P>
He said although it was usually difficult for different
countries to speak with one voice all the time, a program to
encourage such a forum was necessary.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi was in Zimbabwe for a three-day official visit aimed
at finding possible areas of cooperation between the two countries
both in the public and private sectors.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Shilling Weakens Further Against U.S. Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Uganda shilling has
continued to weaken following an increasing local demand for the U.
S. dollar and limited inflows of the currency over the past few
weeks.
</P>
<P>
Foreign exchange dealers in the capital Kampala Friday are
buying the dollar at about 1,700 shillings and selling at 1,720
shillings, as against 1,680 shillings and 1,690 shillings
respectively last week.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Uganda (BOU) has sold 120 million U.S. dollars in
the foreign exchange market since the beginning of this year to
cushion up the shilling against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
It is said that corporate and individual buyers purchase up to
90 percent of the dollars sold in the market at every intervention
by BOU.
</P>
<P>
"A study should be conducted on who buys these dollars and
where they to, because this is becoming a dangerous game," said
one city dealer.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say the Uganda shilling is weak due to lower export
earnings as a result of a world coffee price slump and the
involvement of Ugandan army troops in the crisis in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo.
</P>
<P>
These created a bottomless hole for the foreign currency,
skyrocketing demand that is not being matched by supply, they said.

discuss ways for further expanding bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi told reporters after

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Takes Measures to Protect Refugees in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) will issue identification cards
to refugees in Zambia in the next few weeks to protect them from
harassment by local law enforcement officers.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR Southern African Regional Director Illunga Ngandu, who
has been in the country since last Saturday, announced the plan at
a press briefing at the UNHCR office here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR will also put in place a stringent screening mechanism
with a view of identifying and isolating combatants from civilian
refugees in order to guarantee the security of refugees in camps.
</P>
<P>
The measures are in direct response to last month's arrest and
detention of refugees who were among 750 illegal aliens netted in
a clean-up campaign by the Immigration Department on the
Copperbelt Province.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the UNHCR also warned against an impending food
crisis in refugee camps as the refugee population in the country
continued to swell with an average of 100 to 150 refugees per day
entering the country from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (
DRC) and Angola.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest UNHCR statistics, there are about 224,
472 refugees in the country and the number is steadily rising.
</P>
<P>
Ngandu who visited some camps in the country said without any
rationing the present food supplies would only last until December,
adding that with the steady inflow of refugees in the country, the
UNHCR would have to ration food supplies.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to donor nations to come to the rescue of the UNHCR
and the Zambian government to avert massive suffering of thousands
of refugees in the county.
</P>
<P>
He implored donors not to turn a blind eye or pay lip service
to the critical refugee's situation in Zambia, which would persist
due to the continued fighting in the DRC and Angola.

HARARE, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Globalization is the major
challenge facing developing countries which should set up a forum
to encourage interaction among themselves, Iranian Foreign Affairs
Minister Kamal Kharrazi said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi made the remarks while addressing audience at the
University of Zimbabwe on globalization, civilizations and
cultural rights.
</P>
<P>
"It is through dialogue that we get to prepare to interact as
countries. We should get together and develop a united front,"
said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Globalization, he said, had an impact on a country's economy as
the more resources and technology a country had the better it was
ranked in terms of being advanced, and by being in this position
it was considered more powerful.
</P>
<P>
He said although it was usually difficult for different
countries to speak with one voice all the time, a program to
encourage such a forum was necessary.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi was in Zimbabwe for a three-day official visit aimed
at finding possible areas of cooperation between the two countries
both in the public and private sectors.

four-day workshop was part of a plan of action to facilitate the
implementation of the ECOWAS Moratorium on light weapons.
</P>
<P>
The plan of action was adopted by ECOWAS ministers of foreign
affairs at their meeting in Mali's capital Bamako last March and
approved by the 22nd ECOWAS summit in Lome, the capital of Togo,
last December.
</P>
<P>
The workshop, to be attended by chiefs of police, customs and
gendarmerie, would determine the measures to strengthen the
military, security and police forces of the member states, said
the statement.
</P>
<P>
The participants would also work out ways of implementing the
moratorium on the importation, exportation and manufacture of
light weapons to check the sporadic outbreak of violence in the
region, it added.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that about 40,000 light weapons are believed to
be in circulation in the region and are blamed for the recurring
conflict in west Africa.

HARARE, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe met here Friday with a six-member delegation from Iran to
discuss ways for further expanding bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi told reporters after
the meeting that their discussions mainly centered on potential
areas of economic cooperation between the two countries.

this visit will help pave the way for the enhancement of bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
The minister also told a breakfast meeting reporters that it
is possible for Iran to supply oil products to Zimbabwe.

the relevant officials of the two countries later.

<P>
A joint economic commission meeting also will be held between

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Takes Measures to Protect Refugees in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) will issue identification cards
to refugees in Zambia in the next few weeks to protect them from
harassment by local law enforcement officers.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR Southern African Regional Director Illunga Ngandu, who
has been in the country since last Saturday, announced the plan at
a press briefing at the UNHCR office here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR will also put in place a stringent screening mechanism
with a view of identifying and isolating combatants from civilian
refugees in order to guarantee the security of refugees in camps.
</P>
<P>
The measures are in direct response to last month's arrest and
detention of refugees who were among 750 illegal aliens netted in
a clean-up campaign by the Immigration Department on the
Copperbelt Province.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the UNHCR also warned against an impending food
crisis in refugee camps as the refugee population in the country
continued to swell with an average of 100 to 150 refugees per day
entering the country from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (
DRC) and Angola.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest UNHCR statistics, there are about 224,
472 refugees in the country and the number is steadily rising.
</P>
<P>
Ngandu who visited some camps in the country said without any
rationing the present food supplies would only last until December,
adding that with the steady inflow of refugees in the country, the
UNHCR would have to ration food supplies.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to donor nations to come to the rescue of the UNHCR
and the Zambian government to avert massive suffering of thousands
of refugees in the county.
</P>
<P>
He implored donors not to turn a blind eye or pay lip service
to the critical refugee's situation in Zambia, which would persist
due to the continued fighting in the DRC and Angola.

<HEADLINE> Iran Urges Developing Nations to Cope With Globalization Unitedly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Globalization is the major
challenge facing developing countries which should set up a forum
to encourage interaction among themselves, Iranian Foreign Affairs
Minister Kamal Kharrazi said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi made the remarks while addressing audience at the
University of Zimbabwe on globalization, civilizations and
cultural rights.
</P>
<P>
"It is through dialogue that we get to prepare to interact as
countries. We should get together and develop a united front,"
said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Globalization, he said, had an impact on a country's economy as
the more resources and technology a country had the better it was
ranked in terms of being advanced, and by being in this position
it was considered more powerful.
</P>
<P>
He said although it was usually difficult for different
countries to speak with one voice all the time, a program to
encourage such a forum was necessary.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi was in Zimbabwe for a three-day official visit aimed
at finding possible areas of cooperation between the two countries
both in the public and private sectors.
