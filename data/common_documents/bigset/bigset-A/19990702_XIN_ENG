<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Unconcerned by Russia Bomber Incident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Thursday that it was unconcerned by the incident in which two
Russian strategic bombers was reportedly intercepted by U.S.
fighter jets near Iceland.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said that the incident was
not "a militarily significant event."
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. routinely protects the airspace of Iceland and I
don't think there's anyone who believed that these two propeller
bombers posed a significant military threat," he said.
</P>
<P>
Two Russian strategic bombers flew with striking distance of
the U.S. last week as part of Moscow's largest military exerciseds
since the end of the Cold War, The Washington Post reported in its
Thursday's edition.
</P>
<P>
The TU-95 Bear bombers were intercepted by four U.S. F-15
fighters and a P-3 patrol plane near Iceland early Friday morning
and escorted in a clockwise flight around the island, the
newspaper quoted U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
The incident astounded U.S. officials and underlined recent
Western concerns about the military leadership in Moscow, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. National Security Council spokesman P.J. Crowley said that
the bombers were international airspace as part of a military
exercise announced in advance by the Russian government.
</P>
<P>
"Russia routinely holds military exercises and we are not
particularly troubled by this. I don't think that there's any
need to over-dramatize this," Crowley added.
</P>
<P>
Moscow also dowplayed the incident by denying any wrongdoing.
"Our planes did not violate any laws in that area," a Russian Air
Force spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Army Recovers Strategic Position </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Angolan army Thursday recovered
Mbazi, a strategic position outside the central highland city
Huambo, putting an end to the constant shelling of the city by the
opposition National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA).
</P>
<P>
According to a military source who preferred not to reveal his
name, the UNITA forces often launch bombardment and even attacks
at the city and its suburbs from Mbazi, a highland 40 kilometers
to the north of Huambo, with long-range cannons.
</P>
<P>
The source did not disclose losses of the two sides during the
fighting, but he said the government army has used cannons to
support the ground attacks.
</P>
<P>
Mbazi fell in January this year. The source said its recover
undoubtedly dealt "a heavy blow" to the UNITA forces besieging the
Huambo city.
</P>
<P>
Huambo city has so far witnessed the most fierce fighting in
the war- ravaged southern African country. UNITA forces renewed
its shelling on Huambo city since June 18 and attacked Caala city
40 kilometers away, making the situation more tense in the region.

<P>
CAIRO, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- A monthly report of the Egyptian Ministry of Economy
has disclosed that Egypt's actual reserves of natural gas amount
to about 1 trillion cubic meters, enough for the coming twenty
years.
</P>
<P>
The report, printed Thursday by Egyptian daily "Alam Al Yom,"
says that Egypt's annual gas production, which now stands at 43.2
million cubic meters, is expected to double by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
ALGIERS -- The United States has agreed to extend a loan of
651,000 U.S. dollars in the form of technical assistance to
Algeria to improve the performance of projects undertaken in the
field of energy in the country.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- The gross domestic product (GDP) of the United
Arab Emirates (UAE) dropped by 5.8 percent in 1998, with the share
of the oil sector sinking to 21.7 percent, according to the annual
report of the UAE Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
The report, released on Wednesday, said the GDP dropped to
170 billion dirhams (about 46.5 billion U.S. dollars) in 1998 due
to the decline in oil revenue.
</P>
<P>
However, non-oil sector performance improved in 1998 thanks to
the government's effort to diversify sources of national income
and to stimulate the performance of the private sector.
</P>
<P>
SANAA -- A memorandum of understanding was signed here Thursday
between Japan and Yemen, according to which Japan will grant 3
million dollars' assistance to Yemen.
</P>
<P>
The grant is aimed at easing Yemen's foreign debt in line with
a decision by the United Nations on relieving the foreign debts of
impoverished countries.

suggested that the first meeting of the commission be held in
Havana, the Ethiopia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The understanding was reached here when Ethiopian Prime
Minister Meles Zenawi held discussions with visiting Cuban
Deputy-Minister of Foreign Affairs Angel Dalmau Fernandez.
</P>
<P>
Meles was quoted by the report as saying that Ethiopia desires
to further strengthen its relation with Cuba.

<HEADLINE> WHO to Do More for the Poor's Health: Brundtland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Poverty is an underlying
cause of ill health and under-development and the World Health
Organization (WHO) will mobilize increasing efforts to meet the
goals set by the Cairo Conference 5 years ago.
</P>
<P>
WHO Secretary-General Gro Harlem Brundtland made the remarks at
the on-going special session of the U.N. General Assembly in New
York on Thursday. The meeting is a follow-up to the International
Conference on Population and Development in Cairo in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Pregnancy-related complications, sexually transmitted diseases
and HIV/AIDS account for over one third of all healthy years of
life lost among women of reproductive age in poor countries, but
they can be prevented or managed at low cost, she said.
</P>
<P>
"WHO will work with countries and development partners to
identify and implement key interventions to reduce this
unnecessary burden," she said.
</P>
<P>
She deemed making young people informed about reproductive
health essential for the world to reduce sexually transmitted
diseases, avoid early or unwanted pregnancies and control
population growth.
</P>
<P>
According to Brundtland, there are 333 million new cases of
curable sexually transmitted diseases every year and one in 20
adolescents contracts an STD.
</P>
<P>
Another 5.2 million people are infected by the HIV virus each
year, over half of them young people less than 24 years old.
</P>
<P>
She believed that giving young people information "does not
encourage promiscuity, rather it fosters mutual respect and shared
responsibility".

ATHENS, July 1 (Xinhua) -- More than half of Greece's Olympic
Airways (OA) flights were canceled on Thursday as a result of the
24-hour strike held by its employees who are protesting the
handover of the airline's management to Speedwing, a British
Airways subsidiary, for the next 30 months.
</P>
<P>
Forty-six out of 77 domestic and international flights, as well
as 27 out of 45 Olympic Aviation flights, have been canceled on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The airline's unionists warned that they would stage more
strikes through the season.
</P>
<P>
The Greek government has sunk billions of drachmas into the
ill- fated restructuring programs and repeatedly covered debts at
the national carrier.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the government decided that Speedwing would take
over the management of the airline in order to make it more
competitive.

<HEADLINE> France Has Its Most Deadly Cable Car Accident in 40 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 1 (Xinhua) -- France had on Thursday its most
deadly cable car accident in 40 years, with 20 people killed in
the fall of a cable car from 80 meters high in the Alps mountain
region.
</P>
<P>
The cable car, which was sending technicians and workers to an
astronomy observatory on a plateau 2,550 meters high, suddenly
disconnected with the cable at 7:30, leaving all its passengers
dead.
</P>
<P>
The accident, which took place near a village called
Saint-Etienne-en-Devoluy in the Haute-Alpes region in eastern
France, was the most deadly of its kind in 40 years.
</P>
<P>
French officials do not rule out any possibility in the causes
of the fall, including a problem in the pulling strength of the
cable, the wind, and a sudden breakdown of a brake.
</P>
<P>
Most of the dead were employees of the astronomy observatory
who lived in Saint-Etienne-en-Devoluy. They commuted to the
observatory everyday on the cable car.
</P>
<P>
The home village of the dead, which had 545 permanent
residents, stayed in a state of shock and a church there has been
turned into a praying chapel for the dead.
</P>
<P>
An anonymous witness said that when he was waiting for the next
car at the cable station, he heard a big sound and saw the car
lying in ruins on the ground under his foot.
</P>
<P>
French television pictures showed the holder of the car and the
cable lying on the ground among the ruins. It is not possible to
see from the pictures how the car dropped.
</P>
<P>
The cable car line, which was opened in 1981, was completely
repaired last year and received many visitors during that year,
said an official of the French national trade union of cable cars
producers.
</P>
<P>
The cable car service exclusively works for the astronomy
observatory, which is quite well known in Europe for its five
gigantic telescopes of 15 meters in diameter specialized in
receiving cosmic radio emissions.
</P>
<P>
The observatory belongs to the French-German Institute of
Millimetric Radio-Astronomy based in the nearby city of Grenoble.
</P>
<P>
The French judicial authorities are expected to launch an
inquiry into those who could be held responsible for manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
France had about a dozen accidents of cable cars over the past
20 years, but none of them as deadly as this one.
</P>
<P>
French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin said that the country must
draw consequences from the accident, including a ban of cable car
service.

<HEADLINE> Islamic Group Calls for Intervention in Kashmir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 1 (Xinhua) -- An international Islamic relief group
on Thursday called on Muslim countries to intervene to stop armed
hostilities between India and Pakistan over Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
The fighting between the two nuclear powers "is a dangerous
setback to the peace efforts to achieve nuclear stability," the
International Islamic Council for Religious Calling and Relief
said.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, carried by Egypt's Middle East News Agency, the
group blamed the international community for failing to contain
the crisis and urged Muslim nations to raise the conflict in
international forums.
</P>
<P>
The group called on the two countries to end their military
actions and show restraint in the crisis, the worst between the
two countries since they last fought a war in 1971.
</P>
<P>
India and Pakistan have been engaged in fierce fighting for
seven weeks over the disputed Kashmir with scores of casualties on
both sides.
</P>
<P>
India says that the Islamic fighters entrenched the
Indian-controlled part of Kashmir are Pakistani soldiers who
crossed the 1972 cease-fire line that divides Kashmir between the
two neighbors. New Delhi refuses mediation or talks until the
intruders leave.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has said its troops are engaged only in retaliatory
shelling and have not crossed the cease-fire line.

<P>
WASHINGTON, July 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton said
on Thursday that he expected to be hosting Israeli Prime
Minister-elect Ehud Barak soon now that Barak is close to forming
a new government.
</P>
<P>
"We now have a real chance to move the peace process forward in
the Middle East," Clinton said at a joint news conference after
his meeting with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he would lay out his own ideas for new accords
between Israel and the Arabs.
</P>
<P>
"I do think that the time is ripe, but I think that before I
advance publicly any ideas I should have a chance to meet with the
Prime Minister-elect Mr Barak," He said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also said Israel should implement agreements it has
already reached with the Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said he would meet with Israeli and Arab leaders to try
to revive negotiations on the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
"We shall be working with President (Hefez) Assad, Prime
Minister Barak and Chairman (Yasser) Arafat respectively with a
view to creating the necessary atmosphere for resuming the peace
process without delay," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We remain most willing and determined to do all we can," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders this morning held talks mainly on the peace
process which had been stall over the past six months because of
outgoing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's reluctance to
make a further withdrawal from the West Bank in accordance with
the Wye River accord.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said there was an "opportunity that should not be
missed" as Netanyahu was defeated in the May election by Barak who
had shown his intention to revive the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian president took the chance here to criticize
israel's bombing of targets in Lebanon last week, calling the
action a threat to the atmosphere for peace, and he urged the
Israelis to exercise "maximum restraint."

<HEADLINE> Russia Criticizes British-Dutch Draft on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Foreign Ministry has
criticized a draft resolution concerning Iraq, which Britain and
the Netherlands had submitted to the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
"This document is an attempt at preserving the "Butler" special
commission under a new sign and to even toughen its methods,"
Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin said at a briefing
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Although this draft envisions several steps for easing the
humanitarian situation in Iraq, it simultaneously imposes new
limitations. They will make the regime of sanctions eternal and
set a sort of humanitarian protectorate in that country," he said.
</P>
<P>
This draft "does not contain the main thing - changes to the
regime of sanctions," he said.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has rejected the British-Dutch draft resolution as "a
virulent attempt to undermine Iraq's legitimate right."
</P>
<P>
Rakhmanin said that Russia, jointly with China and France,
drafted a resolution concerning Iraq, which "pursues a different
direction."
</P>
<P>
"Our draft is aimed at a resumption of Baghdad's cooperation
with the United Nations via setting up a new international
mechanism for monitoring Iraq's abandonment of prohibited military
programs with the simultaneous lifting of sanctions," he said.
</P>
<P>
This draft reaffirms a comprehensive ban on military
cooperation with Iraq, he said.

<HEADLINE> UNDP Must Reinvent Way of Doing Business in Coping With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The new administrator for
the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), Mark Malloch Brown,
begins his four-year term Thursday, vowing to address
unprecedented global challenges and be reinvent its way of doing
business.
</P>
<P>
Brown told a press conference that the momentum of a declining
resource base for UNDP has not been broken, and that indeed, it is
accelerating.
</P>
<P>
Two UNDP donors have just indicated major cuts, one to finance
relief in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo, the other to conform to
the Masstricht balanced budget in Europe, he said.
</P>
<P>
Asserting that this was a moment of truth for UNDP and its
Executive Board, Brown said that the organization would "attack
its business strategy for the next nine months with a passionate
sense of urgency."
</P>
<P>
He pledged that, by next spring, UNDP would "define its driving
goals and benchmarks, concentrate its business vision, set up
efficiency, accelerate its results-oriented and strengthen its
management team."
</P>
<P>
Brown comes to UNDP at a time when the world faces a
development crisis, when shrinking aid resources are challenging
UNDP's capacity to remain relevant.
</P>
<P>
"UNPD's funding crisis is part of the wider crisis in ODA (the
Official Development Assistance)," he said. "That wider crisis
amounts to a failure of imagination that threatens to sap the
international community's response in a time when more, not less,
development cooperation is needed."
</P>
<P>
"Ours is a generation with unprecedented possibilities for
human betterment. yet the mismatch between those possibilities and
our priorities is mind-boggling, as last year's Human Development
Report exposed," he said, "With just 9 billion U.S. dollars a
year, the world could deliver safe water and sanitation to all,
ending the transmission of debilitating water-borne diseases."
</P>
<P>
"With only 6 billion U.S. dollars more in annual spending, we
could give a basic education to every child on earth," he said.
</P>
<P>
But despite the fund challenges facing UNDP and the
international aid community, Brown said that this is a great time
to be in development because of advances in such areas as
information technologies, global communications and opportunities
presented by globalization and new drugs and vaccines.
</P>
<P>
UNDP is entering a new millennium with a strong strategic
advantage as a development cooperation organization that is rooted
in its "universality" represented by its presence in 133 program
countries, its many years of development cooperation with those
countries and its role as the coordination arm of the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
"These unique attributes allow UNDP an important role in
helping countries respond to the challenges of change in the new
millennium. Such challenges include choices to improve governance
and national capacity, strategies for post-conflict
rehabilitation, and urgent management decisions concerning
international trade, energy, the environment and social and
economic program," he said.
</P>
<P>
Brown, a former vice-president of external affairs of the World
Bank, was nominated for UNDP chief by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan and confirmed by the General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
He succeeds James Gustave Speth, who held the post for six
years.

<HEADLINE> Malawian President Warns Cabinet Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Malawian President Bakili Muluzi
said Thursday that he is not ready to work with a cabinet that is
prone to corruption at a time when people's expectations are very
high, the Malawi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The president advised his cabinet to desist from the temptation
of corruption and laziness in Blantyre at a swearing-in ceremony
of the cabinet ministers and deputies he appointed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
One by one, the 24 available ministers and deputy ministers
swore to "give any counsel and advice to the president" and
"protect and defend the constitution of the Republic of Malawi."
</P>
<P>
Then, Muluzi, in a brief statement, reminded them that they
have been appointed to the cabinet to serve the people, not to
profiteer.
</P>
<P>
"You must serve the people with dedication so that the people
of Malawi improve their lives," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Democracy should imply that people's living standards go up.
Multi- party democracy alone is not enough," the president said.
</P>
<P>
He said the ministers should assist him to transform into
reality the dreams of Malawi's 10 million people who need improved
opportunities in commerce and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The president said that his new administration is more
committed to improving the living standards of the people and he
asserted that only serious and hard working cabinet could help
attain that ideal.
</P>
<P>
Muluzi ousted the joint opposition alliance by over 2.4 million
votes and his major rival in the race Gwanda Chakuamba acquired
barely two million votes in the June 15 elections.
</P>
<P>
Malawi held its first democratic multi-party polls in 1994,
ending the over-30-year rule by former President late Hastings
Kamuzu Banda.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Not Lacking Laws Protecting Women, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's Attorney-General Bert
Katurebe said Thursday his country has no shortage of law and
treaties that protect the rights of women and children.
</P>
<P>
The attorney-general made the remarks when opening a two-day
workshop on the rights of women and children here Thursday, the
Uganda News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Katurebe said that what needs to be done is to have everyone
sensitized about the existence of the law and the need for its
implementation.
</P>
<P>
Uganda has put in place various laws that protect the rights of
women and children but government efforts in implementation have
been hampered by lack of resources, the illiteracy of the
population on their rights and the slow eradication of backward
customs, he added.
</P>
<P>
Lack of knowledge by local authorities on their duties toward
children, marginalization of girl children and lack of adequate
trained staff on treaty reporting obligation are also blamed for
hampering the implementation of laws.
</P>
<P>
United Nations Development Program Resident Representative
Aeneas Chuma said at the workshop that Uganda is Africa's leading
example of progressive legislation on the protection of children's
rights.
</P>
<P>
However, more needs to be done for the rampant abuse of women
and children's rights in the country, he noted.

<HEADLINE> Panel to Be Set up in Nigeria for Delta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo
has sent a draft bill to the National Assembly for the creation of
a development commission for the troubled Niger Delta.
</P>
<P>
Presidential spokesman Doyin Okupe said here Thursday that the
commission would enable the government to pursue the "development
needs of the area" which has recently been the scene of violent
ethnic clashes.
</P>
<P>
The commission would develop and implement a master plan for
the development of the area in the wake of agitations by local
communities alleging "marginalization" by the Nigerian government,
according to him.
</P>
<P>
President Obasanjo has repeatedly blamed the "neglect of the
area by previous administrations" for the recurring agitation by
youths in the oil- rich Niger Delta.
</P>
<P>
The president said in an interview broadcast nationwide on
Wednesday that "the loss of confidence in government led to
frustration and anger in the Niger Delta."
</P>
<P>
During the interview, he justified the necessity for a master
plan, attributing its absence for the "wastage of funds previously
committed to the development of the area."
</P>
<P>
"We are fashioning a master plan for the development... to
ensure the money allocated for its development were judiciously
used," President Obasanjo noted.
</P>
<P>
Okupe expressed the hope that the 469-member legislature would
pass the bill to enable the president to "give effect to his
pledge to take concrete action to address the development needs of
the area."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Nigeria's 109-member Senate is scheduled to have a
meeting on July 6 with representatives of the country's umbrella
organization for oil industry workers in an effort to forestall a
planned industrial action by oil workers.
</P>
<P>
The strike was planned to take effect from June 28 to protest
the condition of the workers in the six multi-national oil
companies operating in the West African country.
</P>
<P>
Following the intervention of the National Assembly, the action
was postponed to enable the legislature to resolve grievances of
the workers in oil producing area of Niger Delta.
</P>
<P>
Senator Melford Okilo, chairman of a Senate ad-hoc committee on
the matter said Thursday that a seven-member delegation would
deliver the invitation to officials of the umbrella union for oil
workers.
</P>
<P>
He said that the lawmakers were compelled to "intervene because
of the importance of oil to the survival of the country", adding
that "anything that affects the sector threatens the
socio-economic and political wellbeing of the country."
</P>
<P>
Oil provides about 95 percent of the foreign exchange for the
most populous African country, which produces about 2 million
barrels of crude oil per day.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: U.N. Faces Daunting Task in Kosovo  (by Gu Zhenqiu) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 1 (Xinhua) -- When U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Wednesday was chairing an international conference on
Kosovo, foreign ministers or high-level representatives from 18
countries and three regional organizations, though dividing on
some key issues, all agreed that the post-war reconstruction in
Kosovo is enormous in scope and complex in execution.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, billed as "unprecedented" effort to organize and
support the rebuilding of Kosovo, touched upon the U.N.-led
civilian operation in the Yugoslav province -- the U.N. Interim
Administration in Kosovo (UNMIK).
</P>
<P>
As Carl Bildt, the U.N. special representative for Kosovo put
it, the issue tabled at the Wednesday meeting is about "the most
challenging and complicated mission ever undertaken by the
organization in modern times."
</P>
<P>
In other words, the task of post-war reconstruction in Kosovo
constitutes one of the largest and most ambitious such exercises
by the 185-nation United Nations.
</P>
<P>
It includes, among other things, establishing a political
system, providing police and fire services, stabilizing the
currency, delivering the mail, providing health care and even
collecting trash.
</P>
<P>
But to make a successful story in its 20-day-old operation, the
United Nations, with the help from its member states, has to cope
with immediate challenges: resettling the massive daily flow of
refugees and internally displaced persons, the establishment of a
regime of law and order and making progress in the process of
rehabilitation and reconciliation in the multi-ethnic Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Delegates said the maintenance of law and order is the priority
for Kosovo, where revenge killings broke out after tens of
thousands of ethnic Albanian refugees are returning each day.
</P>
<P>
Ever since the withdrawal of Yugoslav security forces from
Kosovo, there has been signs of growing lawlessness in Kosovo,
where revenge killings broke out in the wake of massive return of
Albanian refugees.
</P>
<P>
At present, there appears a tendency of worsening security
condition in the province although the NATO-led peacekeepers,
known as KFOR, are being deployed.
</P>
<P>
Annan made his appeal for the swift deployment of police,
trainers and monitors to the province during a New York meeting of
"the Friends of Kosovo" -- an expanding group of nations that is
concerned about conditions in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations said it has received commitments for nearly
2,000 of the 3,110 police it wants to send to Kosovo. But Annan
said that the organization was still waiting for countries to
honor their promises.
</P>
<P>
"These are pledges," he said, "We cannot deploy and distribute
what we do not have."
</P>
<P>
A major issue still dividing countries and delaying the police
deployment is whether the civilian police should be armed. The
Netherlands said it preferred the police to be unarmed as most
U.N. civilian police are. Britain as well indicated it would have
trouble contributing to an armed police mission because the bulk
of its own police force was unarmed.
</P>
<P>
Despite the sense of urgency, Annan found himself unable to
complete the politically sensitive task of picking a candidate to
run the demanding Kosovo mission. Brazilian diplomat Sergio Vieira
de Mello is serving in that capacity on a temporary basis.
</P>
<P>
Although Annan succeeded in recruiting 1,900 international
police fo Kosovo, but he said nations still differed on how much
assistance should be given to Serbia.
</P>
<P>
"If the governments maintain that they will not provide
economic assistance or development assistance to Belgrade as long
as President (Slobodan) Milosevic is in office, and that situation
persists for a long time, then we are going to have a real
challenge of reconstructing the economy of southeastern Europe
with a big hole of Serbia in the middle," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
Unlike its previous experiences in the post-war areas, the
United Nations has to proceed its mission on the basis of the
coordination and cooperation with the European Union, the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for the United Nations to undertake the
post-war reconstruction, which will surely take years in the
process, in a province of a sovereign state.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, it is also important to solicit the viewpoints from
Belgrade and involve the Yugoslav Government in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Central at issue is the respect for the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia under
the Security Council Resolution 1244, adopted by June 10.
</P>
<P>
However, some countries are intending to put Serbia, a main
republic of Yugoslavia, out of the assistance package in order to
press for the change of legitimate government in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Time is pressing, if the operation does not progress smoothly,
the international community will see one more humanitarian
catastrophe in the war-torn province in the coming winter because
many homes, together with the water-supplying system, were
destroyed by the 79-day NATO bombing.
</P>
<P>
"It is pointless to take in loads and loads of medicine if
people are taking in dirty water and then get sick," Annan said.

<HEADLINE> S. African Firm to Cut Jobs to Stem Rise in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 1 (Xinhua) -- State-controlled Telkom is to
cut jobs significantly in a bid to stem the rise in net operating
costs which surged 3.5 billion rand (583 million U.S. dollars ) to
18.46 billion rand (three billion dollars) in the year to end in
March.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed in Johannesburg Thursday by Telkom Chief
Executive Officer Sizwe Nxasana when he presented the group's
financial results.
</P>
<P>
Nxasana said that since April Telkom had shed some 2,000 of its
61,000 employees through early retirement. It was also looking to
exit from non-core business and outsource work where possible.
</P>
<P>
Nxasana also disclosed that the rise in Telkom's operating
costs had been greater than the comparable increase in revenue
received and that, with planned restructuring, costs would be even
higher in the current financial year.
</P>
<P>
Telkom has embarked on a wide-ranging efficiency and
cost-containment drive to "trim wastage and duplication on an
unprecedented scale."
</P>
<P>
It said its start-point during 1998-99 had been to clamp down
on "unnecessary expenses, including travel and subsistence
allowances, and tighten up controls on the use of vehicles and
other equipment."
</P>
<P>
But the Telkom chief said if these measures did not meet
requirements, then the telecommunications company would have to
introduce a complete retrenchment program.
</P>
<P>
Nxasana, however, declined to say how many jobs the company was
going to cut. "We have a figure in mind. But it is confidential,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
There have been rumors that the group was looking at trimming
its labor force to around 50,000.
</P>
<P>
Since 1995 Telkom's staff complement has fallen from almost
59,000 to 56, 480 in 1998. But by March this year it had climbed
to 61,237.
</P>
<P>
It has however embraced the transformation process and in the
past five years the composition of its work force has changed from
being 54 percent white and 46 percent black to 59 percent black
and 41 percent white.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the increase in the group's net operating costs,
Nxasana said this was directly related to Telkom's decision to
invest heavily in its national infrastructure to ensure it could
improve on the level of service provided to new and existing
customers both in the short term and in the years ahead.

<TEXT>
<P>
Nxasana said, "Retaining and growing our customer base is what
it is all about. The lack of ongoing maintenance in previous years
had led to the steady deterioration of our network, exposing
customers to seasonal, weather- related service disruptions.
</P>
<P>
"Realizing that the state of our network posed a liability,
both in terms of service and quality and our long-term efficiency,
we began investing heavily in network rehabilitation almost three
years ago."
</P>
<P>
"This rehabilitation drive reached a peak during the period
under review when Telkom spent 1.436 billion rand (239 million
dollars) on network rehabilitation, 632.7 million rand (105
million dollars) more than in 1997- 98", he added.
</P>
<P>
Nxasana said he had budgeted for capital spending of 10 billion
rand (1.6 billion dollars) in the current financial year.
</P>
<P>
"Our initiatives to restructure and transform the company for
competition will be accelerated during 1999-2000 and will
therefore be reflected in higher costs associated with
restructuring for the year," he said. "This will in turn have an
impact on our net income for 1999-2000 which we expect will be
significantly lower than in 1998-99."
</P>
<P>
He added: "Our share-holders fully support our drive to
position ourselves for competition well before it is introduced,
even if this requires a short- term drop in net income."
</P>
<P>
Telkom said that during the financial year it had provided
502,750 new telephone lines, 42,750 more than its license
requirements.
</P>
<P>
During the year, 920 villages went on-line for the first time,
27,271 new pay phones were installed and there were new
connections for 4,774 priority customers - hospitals, clinics and
schools.
</P>
<P>
Nxasana said Telkom was committed to providing a better quality
service for all sectors of South African society.
</P>
<P>
"Telkom," he also stated, "remains fully committed to meeting
the vast and changing telecommunications needs of the South
African business community and will not sacrifice its efforts to
service one key customer group at the expense of another."

<HEADLINE> World Conference Ends Demanding Science for Peace and </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, July 1 (Xinhua)--After six days of debates and
discussions, the World Conference on Science ended on Thursday
with two documents calling for employing science and technology
for the peace and welfare of the world.
</P>
<P>
Some 2,000 scientists, officials and other stakeholders in
science and education from 150 countries all over the world
accepted the "Declaration on Science and The Use of Scientific
Knowledge" and the "Science Agenda-Framework for Action".
</P>
<P>
The two documents were issued by the U.N. Educational,
Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) that held the
conference together with the International Council of Science
Unions (ICSU).
</P>
<P>
"You have deployed so much energy over the last six days and
contributed to so many important debates, that our final documents
can truly be said to result from...a highly interactive process,"
Federico Mayor, Director-General of the UNESCO and chairman of the
conference, expressed his satisfaction to the participants in the
conference at his final address.
</P>
<P>
Amid the rapid progress of science during the 20th century and
an even explosive one in the next, the documents called on
scientists and scientific policy-makers to concentrate their
endeavors for a peaceful world and the well-being of human
society, but not for high-tech armaments.
</P>
<P>
"This is a crucial time for science," said Mayor, adding:"our
professional activities are more than just jobs-underlying them is
a mission--to improve the lives of human beings."
</P>
<P>
Too many times during the out-going century, people have wasted
scientific findings and technical breakthroughs in wars, conflicts
and weapons, he said at an earlier interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The resolution documents, which will be later sent to the U.N.
General Assembly for adoption, urged governments to aim their
research projects specifically at addressing the basic needs of
population. Moreover, it urged the industrialized countries to
help the poor ones in scientific and technical projects.
</P>
<P>
Also, the documents urged all parts of the society, not only
the scientists, to make and fulfill commitments for more healthy
development and better employment of scientific knowledge.
Governmental leaders, educational experts, enterpreneurs and media
staff should make up a "big alliance" for the goal, Mayor said.
</P>
<P>
The importance of ethic standards in scientific issues were
fully recognized at by the delegates to the conference. At the
final documents, the delegates to Budapest called scientists to
take responsibility for world's peace and development, and to
respect the dignity of human beings in their research works.
</P>
<P>
Topics such as intellectual property rights, women's role in
science, science education, and the popularization of science were
also accepted into the final documents as most important issues.
</P>
<P>
As a partial success, some of the world's poorest nations added
their demands into the resolutions, which urged to fund the
scientific projects in the most undeveloped countries to be funded
with the resources freed by debt relief.
</P>
<P>
The initiative, though strongly against by the rich nations,
was appreciated by delegates from Africa and the Islamic world,
and was hailed as the greatest achievement of the conference.
</P>
<P>
"We have it in our power to contribute to the well-being and
the human dignity of people who will never hear of conference, but
whose lives we can improve." said Mayor.
</P>
<P>
"And now, as we split up and go our separate ways, we take with
us a shared determination...And even after we separate, we remain
joined by a shared-by a new-commitment." he added.

WASHINGTON, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
and U.S. President Bill Clinton started their talks at the White
House on how to revive the Middle East peace process as Israel's
Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak was forming a new government to
give a new momentum for the peace course.
</P>
<P>
"The primary agenda items for the president's meeting with
President Mubarak will be the Middle East peace process," White
House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"they will discuss their own shared vision for how to move the

</P>
<P>
The "shared vision" was based on the Oslo and Wye River peace
accords between Israel and the Palestinians, he said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Heavy Rainstorms Cause Flooding On Yangtze River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Rainstorms that hit parts of the
middle and lower reaches of China's Yangtze River have caused
serious flooding in Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Anhui provinces.
</P>
<P>
According to the Zhejiang Flood Control and Draught Relief
Headquarters, local officials started floodwater-discharge
measures today, diverting the water into a 4.7-sq.km. area in the
city of Yuhang.
</P>
<P>
The 1,100 people living in the flood-diversion zone had already
been moved to safer ground before the floodwater hit and no
casualties have been reported.
</P>
<P>
Water levels at the Jiujiang Hydrology Station downstream at
the city of Jiujiang in eastern Jiangxi have also risen above the
danger mark. The city recorded 230 mm of precipitation in the past
two days and floodwaters are flowing into nearby Poyang Lake at a
rate of 13,860 cubic meters per second.
</P>
<P>
Two highways between Jiujiang and Wuning and Xiushui counties
have been closed because of the rain and the province is
intensifying its fight against the floodwaters. The rain, however,
is unlikely to let up, according to meteorologists forecasts.
</P>
<P>
Floodwaters have caused more than 30 deaths and covered large
tracts of farmland in the southern part of Anhui Province, causing
an estimated 2.5 billion yuan in damage and affecting more than 5.
76 million people and about 400,000 million hectares of farmland.
</P>
<P>
The province's rainy season started a little earlier this year.
Rainfalls in most places have exceeded 600 mm for the past days
and nearly 1.5 million people are already involved in the fight
against the rising waters.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Raises Export Target of Electronic Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government has set a new
target for exports of electronic products at one trillion baht (27
billion U.S. dollars) annually, or one percent of the world's
trade on the products, Thai Industry Minister Suwat Liptapallop
said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Thai cabinet had ordered the Industry Ministry to seek ways
to boost exports of the electronic and electrical products, sugar
and sugar canes, Suwat was quoted by Thai News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's current level of exports of electronic products
stands at 400 billion baht (10.8 billion dollars), or 0.5 percent
of the global trade of the goods.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has also set a target of four percent growth in
exports for the year 1999 to 56 billion U.S. dollars. However, the
central bank has lowered the projection to 2.1 percent due to the
unsatisfactory performance of the sector in the first five months
of this year.

<HEADLINE> World Economy in Slow Growth: U.N. Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Despite some short-term
favorable developments, global economic growth in 1999 "remains
inadequate and markedly lower than at mid-decade", particularly
for most developing countries, a U.N. report said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Experts of the U.N. Department of Economic and Social Affairs
said world output is forecast to grow 2 percent in 1999 against
1.9 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Developed countries as a group are predicted to rise 1.75
percent compared to 2 percent in 1998, developing economies are
expected to go up 2.5 percent from 1.7 percent and transition
economies covering former Eastern Europe are foreseen to decline
0.50 percent from a positive 0.2 percent a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Presenting the report of "The World Economy in 1999" to the
press, U.N. Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social
Affairs Nitin Desai said the financial crises of the past two
years and ensuing economic slowdowns "have dealt a stunning blow
to world development prospects".
</P>
<P>
The resport suggests that a growth rate of 3% annually needs to
be sustained to allow progress in raising living standards and
reducing poverty.
</P>
<P>
Only 13 developing countries are forecast to grow enough to
meet that benchmark in 1999, compared to 39 in 1996, the year
immediately before the global financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The 31-page report is on the agenda of the high-level meeting
in Geneva from July 5-30 of the U.N. Economic and Social Council.
</P>
<P>
The analysis follows a letter form U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan to the June Group of 8 Summit in Cologne, Germany, calling
on leading industrialized countries to take measures to increase
world economic growth, shore up international financial structures
and take greater account of the need of the poor.

WASHINGTON, July 1 (Xinhua) -- While the USA practice, the
German women's soccer team enjoyed a day off Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Germans also went for an evening of dinner and shopping
inthe Georgetown section of Washington, D.C..
</P>
<P>
"We do it often before a game. This is a tournament, and you
travel a lot. You don't have time for yourself," coach Tina Theune-
Meyer says.
</P>
<P>
Geramny is ready tonight against the USA in the quarterfin
alsof the Women's World Cup at Jack Kent Cooke Stadium.
</P>
<P>
"I think our whole team is strong enough to beat the U.S. team
maybe. If we give our best, there is no doubt," says defender
SteffiJones, daughter of a U.S. soldier who was stationed in
Germany.
</P>
<P>
Germany was runner-up in the 1995 World Cup and third in 1991.
Theune-Meyer said her team would be without captain-midfielder
Martina Voss, who reinjured a hamstring against Brazil.
</P>
<P>
But U.S. star Mia Hamm expects top form from Germany.
</P>
<P>
"Germany is not going to just show up and hang out and try to
give us a game," Hamm says.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. team practiced penalty kicks yesterday. If the game
istied after 90 minutes of regulation adn 30 minutes of sudden-
deathovertime, the Americans are prepared to win the game on
penalty kicks.
</P>
<P>
"I have told them if you're going to prepare to take penalty
kicks, then prepare to make penalty kicks," coach Tony DiCicco
says.)
</P>
<P>
After a run of comfortable wins by the USA, a close game is
expected when two of the top four seeds meet. "We'd be very happy
with a 2-1 win," assistant coach Lauren Gregg says.
</P>
<P>
"The Germans are the best in combination play in the world,"
says DiCicco. "They can knock circles around you."

<HEADLINE> Greenpeace Threatens to Sue EU Over Gene Corn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Environmental protection group,
Greenpeace, is threatening to sue the European Union (EU) if the
bloc's executive body, the European Commission, failed to withdraw
authorizations for genetically modified corn in the 15 EU member
countries.
</P>
<P>
The Greenpeace took the step because researchers at Cornell
University found in May that the hybrid crop, known as Bt-maize,
produced pollen that could harm the larvae of the monarch
butterfly. Bt-maize has been developed to protect maize from
attacks by the corn borer pest.
</P>
<P>
In respond to the research result, the European Commission said
it would block the approval of another Bt-maize developed by U.S.
company Pioneer Hi-Bred International, but also said similar crops
already being marketed by Monsanto Co and Novartis AG, the two
European companies, would not be immediately affected.
</P>
<P>
"The commission's logic is skewed," Greenpeace biotechnology
campaigner Thomas Schweiger said in a statement. "It is not taking
action on the already approved lines of Bt-maize even though it is
obvious that the products already out there present much greater
risk than the ones in the pipeline."
</P>
<P>
The environmental group said it would consider legal action if
the EU executive failed to act. The Greenpeace said it has sent
the commission a legal opinion demanding that the already approved
Bt-maize products must be withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
EU environmental ministers last week reached an initial
agreement on revisions to the bloc's approval system for new
genetically modified organisms (GMOs).
</P>
<P>
They agreed that they would probably not approve any more GMOs
until the new rules are up and running.

defense to make new contributions to the development of that
industry and the nation's economy.
</P>
<P>
Zhu addressed a ceremony for the founding of 10 military-
industrial groups today, where he said that the military-

competitiveness of related enterprises, and accelerating national
defense modernization.
</P>
<P>
He said that the science and technology for national defense is
a key strategic industry and an important material and
technological basis of national defense modernization and that the
industry's strength is a reflection of national strength.
</P>
<P>
He said that the newly-established groups should make an effort
in 5 areas: separating government from businesses; setting up a
mechanism of fair competition; concentrating scientific research
on ensuring production and development of weaponry and equipment;
promoting better military-industrial layout and restructuring; and
creating a good environment for enterprises to free themselves
from difficulties and get reinvigorated.

<P>
The Commission of Science and Technology for National Defense
Industry should play a role in supervising the industry and
drawing up policies, laws, regulations, and standards governing
the development of these groups, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
The premier stressed that earnest efforts be made to speed up
the development of China's weaponry and equipment to meet the
growing demand of its military forces.
</P>
<P>
Measures should also be taken to adjust the structures in the
science and technology industry related to national defense, he
noted, adding that more advanced technology should be introduced
to boost the industry.

<HEADLINE> New York Talks First Step to Improve Ties, Says Greek </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Talks between Greek and Turkish
Foreign Ministers in New York were "a first step" to seek ways to
cooperate on a number of issues, Greek government spokesman
Yiannis Nikolaou said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing, Nikolaou said that there should
not be either great optimism or great pessimism.
</P>
<P>
Following talks with his Turkish counterpart Ismail Cem, Greek
Foreign Minister George Papandreou said that there was room for
bilateral cooperation between the two neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey on Wednesday agreed to hold talks on a
Foreign Ministry senior officials level on issues concerning the
economy, trade, environment, tourism, as well as combating
organized crime, illegal immigration, drugs and on law and order
issues, and once the potential for cooperation was ascertained,
the two countries would proceed further.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the New York talks, Greece's main opposition New
Democracy (ND) on Thursday said in a statement that the ND backed
the normalization of Greece's relations with Turkey, but the
dialogue between the two countries must be held under conditions
such as the halt by Turkey to make territorial claims, the
abandonment of the threat of using force and the respect for
international law and existing treaties.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, former Greek Prime Minister Constantine Mitsotakis
also voiced his support for the government's dialogue with Turkey,
however, he stressed that such dialogue had to be conducted in a
specific framework.
</P>
<P>
The road to an improvement in Greek-Turkish relations could
open at the same time as substantial progress on the issue or
Cyprus, which was necessary for any attempt at rapprochement
between the two countries to be lasting and continuous, he added.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Greece and Turkey have been strained over
decades for their disputes in the territorial waters, air space
limits, the delimitation of the continental shelf in the Aegean
Sea and the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Greece has repeatedly said that relations between the two
countries can only improve step-by-step and if Turkey believes
there are issues which are unsettled, it can seek recourse to the
International Court of Justice at the Hague.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Slams Turkey for Extending Operation Northern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Iraq on Thursday slammed Turkey's
decision to extend the presence of western air force in Turkish
air bases for patrolling northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
A foreign ministry spokesman told the Iraqi News Agency that
the Turkish parliament has approved the extension of the force,
codenamed Operation Norther Watch, in Turkish bases for another
six months as from June 30.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Iraq holds the Turkish government responsible
for the possible aggression by the force against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The force, established by the U.S.-led western allies in 1991
after the Gulf War, uses Turkish air base to monitor the northern
no-fly zone in Iraq, carved up unilaterally by the allied forces
with a claimed aim of protecting the Kurds there from possible
attacks by Iraqi government troops.
</P>
<P>
The allied forces also use air bases in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait
to patrol another no-fly zone set up in southern Iraq claimedly to
protect the Shiite Muslims there.
</P>
<P>
Since the United States and Britain launched airstrikes against
Iraq last December, Baghdad has been denying the two no-fly zones,
saying they were not sanctioned by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Skirmishes between Iraqi air defense force and the western
warplanes have become regular occurrence in the two zones ever
since.

<HEADLINE> ICRC Urges Governments to Strengthen Arms Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The International Committee of the
Red Cross (ICRC) has called on governments to limit the
uncontrolled proliferation of arms and ammunition.
</P>
<P>
"The current pattern of transfers of small arms, light weapons
and related ammunition, because it is largely outside
international control, should be a matter of urgent humanitarian
concern," said ICRC President Cornelio Sommaruga here Thursday
when launching an ICRC report entitled "Arms Availability and the
Situation of Civilians in Armed Conflict".
</P>
<P>
"We call on states to review their policies concerning the
production, availability and transfer of arms and ammunition in
light of their responsibility to 'respect and ensure respect' for
the international humanitarian law," he went on.
</P>
<P>
In the report, the ICRC blamed the uncontrolled proliferation
of arms and ammunition for "increasing tension in the world's
trouble spots, prolonging conflicts and undermining the laws that
protect civilians in time of war".
</P>
<P>
The Geneva-based humanitarian organization warned of the
disastrous effects on civilian populations of uncontrolled
transfer and misuse of weapons.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that the number of manufacturers of small arms
is estimated to have increased by 25 percent between 1985 and
1995. Furthermore, it said, large quantities of weapons were sold
or given away as the world's big military powers reduced their
stocks after the end of the Cold War.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Why Congo (K) Peace Talks Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Nothing has come out from the
on-going ministerial meeting on ending the 11-month conflict in
the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) for a third day running
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting which started Monday attended by defense, home and
foreign affairs ministers from the 14 Southern African Development
Community (SADC) member states, as well as from Rwanda, Uganda and
Libya, discussed a draft document on a cease-fire in Congo (K) by
a technical committee.
</P>
<P>
The draft document was reported to call for a cease-fire from
July 3, deployment of peace-keepers in the DRC, withdrawal of
foreign armies and disarming of rebel groups.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the meeting told Xinhua on condition of
anonymity Thursday that disagreement remained over some main
points in the draft document.
</P>
<P>
If discussion by the ministers are eventually successful, heads
of state from the region will gather here to put their signatures
to the cease-fire agreement.
</P>
<P>
Officials said they were optimistic that a deal could be struck
finally. However, a quick breakthrough is not realistic, they
added.
</P>
<P>
Participants attending the peace talks disclosed that the
meeting had been temporarily put off to allow the belligerents to
resolve their differences.
</P>
<P>
It was said rebels were still divided over who should lead in
the talks and which one is the main group.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, for the first time, is understood to have been
attended by leaders of the three rebel groups fighting to oust
Congolese President Laurent Kabila's government: Wamba dia Wamba's
Rally for Congolese Democracy (RCD), Jean Pierre Bemba's Movement
for the Liberation of Congo (MLC) and Emile Ilunga's Goma-based
RCD splinter group.
</P>
<P>
Wamba insists that his is the main group and "the splinter
group should have no mandate at the talks", while Ilunga said his
group would not accept Wamba to attend any meeting because he "has
no mandate of the Congolese people or the RCD".
</P>
<P>
In turn, the Goma-based RCD also calls Wamba's group as a
splinter, and threatened to walk out of the Lusaka talks should
Wamba be allowed to attend the meeting.
</P>
<P>
At Wednesday's meeting of belligerents when Wamba arrived, the
Goma- based RCD faction led by Ilunga walked out immediately.
</P>
<P>
Conference sources said other areas for contention were rebel
demands to negotiate a new political structure in the country,
which is rejected by the government. The rebels also insist that
all foreign forces be withdrawn simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
But the contentious issues are reported to hinge on the
timetable for withdrawal of foreign forces and the mandate of the
joint military council that is supposed to oversee the
implementation of the cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
The Kabila government demands a full control of the country
soon after the cease-fire pact is adopted while the rebels prefer
holding on to the territory now under their control as
negotiations on political reforms continue.
</P>
<P>
Congolese Foreign Minister Abdoulaye Yerodia said control of
the country' s territory after the cease-fire agreement was an
internal matter that should not be on the agenda of the Lusaka
talks.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the hitches at the talks, Yerodia said this was
normal in such talks. "There is a delay, yes, but we did not come
here just to say 'Okay and good-bye.' This conflict has been going
on for two years and you don't expect us to come and finish it so
soon."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, SADC Secretary-General Kaire Mbuende said the delay
is mainly "on full stops and commas".
</P>
<P>
"But we are almost through now. It might take sometime but we
are optimistic that we will finish," Mbuende stressed.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Sticks to Cease-fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Emile Lahoud
Thursday renewed his country's commitment to adhere to the
five-nation committee monitoring a truce agreement in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"Lebanon is committed to the letter and spirit of the April
Understanding and refuse any attempts for amendment or
modifications of it,"he said when meeting with the country's
parliament members.
</P>
<P>
The committee, made up of representatives from the United
States, France, Syria, Israel and Lebanon, was established after
Israel and Lebanon reached a truce agreement in April 1996 which
ended a 16-day Israeli blitz on Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The committee was due to convene on Tuesday to discuss 14
complaints filed by Lebanon and 21 by Israel after a 10-hour
Israeli air strike on Lebanon late June 24 which killed eight
Lebanese and wounded 64 and destroyed the country's
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon accused Israel of violating terms of the accord and
targetting civilians while Israel argued that its operations
came in retaliation to Hezbollah's cross-border Katyusha attacks
which killed two Israelis.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, is fighting
to oust Israeli troops out of south Lebanon where the Jewish
state set up a self-declared security zone in 1985 as a
buffer zone to protect its north.
</P>
<P>
But, the planned panel meeting was suspended by outgoing
Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Arens who said Israel would
participate again in the meeting after the Prime Minister-elect
Ehud Barak forms his government next week.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli move sparked Lebanese government's concern that
Israel will abort the accord which Lebanon said could protect
civilians and Arens dismissed as useless.

JOHANNESBURG, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The scheduled take-over of the

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Set Up New Office to Manage Public Debts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government will set up a
new office to be in charge of managing the country's public debts
which have increased by about 50 percent over the past six months,
Thai Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Tarrin said Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai agreed with his
proposal to set up the special office, aimed at helping manage
public debts more efficiently by bringing all separately existing
agencies involved in public debt management under the sole control
of the newly-established organ, Thai News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Thailand's public debts are under the supervision of
many agencies.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's public debts stood at 1.77 trillion baht (47.84
billion U.S. dollars) as of June 30, compared to 1.16 trillion
baht (31.35 billion dollars) as of the end of last year. The debts
are the government's foreign borrowings used to support economic
reforms and rehabilitation after the Thai economy was hard hit by
the financial crisis which began two years ago.
</P>
<P>
The new office will examine the government's capability of debt
servicing and risk management, as well as fluctuations of interest
rates and exchange rates and the scheduling of the debt repayment,
said Tarrin.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's foreign exchange reserves, which measure the
government's foreign debt repayment capability, stood at 31
billion dollars as of June 18.

<P>
HARARE, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's foreign exchange market,
hit by shortages in April, appeared to be firm during the past
week on the back of foreign currency inflows from the country's
premier crop, tobacco.
</P>
<P>
The market, which has been in shortages for the greatest part
of the past two months, improved dramatically during the past
week from a deficit of 5.1 million U.S. dollars on June 24 to a
deficit of 600,000 U.S. dollars Wednesday, the Reserve Bank of
Zimbabwe said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In its weekly foreign exchange report for the week ending June
30, the central bank said the level of forex inflows was almost
balanced with inflows of 51.5 million U.S. dollars and outflows
of 50.1 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The past week recorded the highest inflows of 12.5 million U.S.
dollars on June 30 with the highest outflows on June 24 at 13.1
million U.S. dollars.

HARARE, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Britain has committed 48 million
pounds (about 75.6 million dollars) toward a project to combat
malaria in Africa, World Health Organization (WHO) director for
Africa Ebrahim Samba said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Samba said the money would be split over four years to reduce
malaria deaths and sufferings by 50 percent by the year 2010.

<HEADLINE> UK Manufacturing Returns To Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON. July 1 (Xinhua) -- The UK manufacturing industry
expanded for the first time for more than a year in June as both
domestic and overseas orders increased, according to the latest
research.
</P>
<P>
The return to growth comes on the back of increasing orders and
higher factory output, the research by the Chartered Institute of
Purchasing and Supply (CIPS) found.
</P>
<P>
It's purchasing managers index was 50.4 in June, up from 49.4
in May and the first reading above 50 since March last year when
it was 51.1. A figure above 50 indicates expansion, below 50
contraction.
</P>
<P>
Roy Ayliffe, director of professional practice at CIPS, said:
"This is the best news the manufacturing economy has had for
fifteen months."
</P>
<P>
CIPS' separate index on total manufacturing output also grew
for the third month in a row, with the index showing 53 for June,
up from 52.4 in May.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the recent strengthening of order books, firms
continued to concentrate on cutting costs and improving
efficiencies wherever possible," the CIPS said.

LONDON, July 1 (Xinhua) -- European stock markets rocketed to
sharply higher closes Thursday after the U.S. Federal Reserve's
decision to hike interest rates by a quarter point to 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Stock markets normally fall back when interest rates go up, but
investors had been expecting this rise - and were pleased that the
Fed indicated that it was not planning to raise interest rates
again soon.
</P>

London shares surged 170.4 points, their biggest single-session
point gain in nearly six months. The FTSE-100 Index closed up 2.7
percent at 6488.9.
</P>
<P>
Interest-rate sensitive banking stocks were cheered by the
Fed's decision and made a healthy contribution to the Footsie's
strong gains on the first day of the new quarter.
</P>
<P>
HSBC shares soared 119p, or 5 percent, to 2366p while NatWest
jumped 59p to 1404p, Royal Bank of Scotland rose 40p to 1332p and
Standard Chartered finished up 44p at 1080p.
</P>
<P>
Germany's benchmark share index, the Xetra Dax, advanced 101.70
points, or 1.89 percent, to 5480.22 amid sharp strides in the
banking sector.
</P>
<P>
But strong economic data in the United States triggered fears
of further hikes, dampening the mood on the Dax and braking its
advance past the 5500 resistance level.

</P>
<P>
After increasing by nearly 12 percent in 1997, Estonia's
economy slowed to 4 percent in 1998 and appears to have contracted
in early 1999, largely because of the situation in neighboring
countries and related banking system difficulties.
</P>
<P>
In an annual review of the Estonian economy, the IMF praised
the authorities for its success in narrowing current account
deficit, reducing inflation and implementing essential structural
reforms.
</P>
<P>
"Directors recognized that the immediate difficulties in the
banking system had now been successfully overcome, and considered
that Estonia's economy was well positioned for a recovery," the
IMF said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Still Optimistic About N. Ireland Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Thursday said that Northern Ireland parties were determined to
break the deadlock in their peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Clinton told a news conference at the White House that he had
been "in virtually constant contact" with parties to the Belfast
talks.
</P>
<P>
"They are in negotiations as we speak and the mood seems to
be reasonably positive," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
"They are exploring some new ideas and they do seem determined
to work it through to a positive conclusion," he added.
</P>
<P>
The president also said he had offered his own ideas on how to
break the deadlock over the key issues of the timing of guerrilla
disarmament and the formation of a power-sharing provincial
government.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Clinton spoke to British Prime Minister
Tony Blair for a third time in 24 hours to discuss the peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said that the president
remained ready to lend a hand to nudge the talks forward if
necessary.
</P>
<P>
"The president again made the point that both he and the United
States government stands ready to intercede and help in any way
that they can," Lockhart added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Clinton also spoke by telephone with Northern
Ireland's main Protestant leader David Trimble and Sinn Fein
President Gerry Adams Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Clinton urged all political parties in Northern
Ireland to "give peace a chance" as they worked against a midnight
deadline to save the Good Friday peace pact.
</P>
<P>
"I will do whatever I can to be helpful. We're moving forward
and I'm hoping for the best," Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> Missing Myanmar Aircraft Crashes Near Sittway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, July 2 (Xinhua) -- A missing Myanmar aircraft of the
state-run Myanma Airways crashed on Friday afternoon near an
island in Sittway, the country's western Rakhine state, just a few
minutes before landing, the official Radio Myanmar reported.
</P>
<P>
The wreckage of the aircraft, Fokker XYAEO, was discovered in
the west of Phayonka island by an aircraft of the Myanmar Air
Force, it said.
</P>
<P>
The cargo aircraft, carrying construction materials on a
chartered flight from Yangon to Sittway, took off at the Yangon
International Airport Friday afternoon at about 1 p.m. (local
time).
</P>
<P>
When it approached Sittway and was 16 kilometers away from the
Sittway airport, the aircraft lost contact with the airport
control tower there at about 2:27 p.m. (local time) due to the bad
weather condition, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Rescue work is underway, the report added, without disclosing
the casualties.
</P>
<P>
In January and August last year, two Myanmar passenger Fokker
aircraft crashed in Thandwe, the southwestern Rakhine state, and
Tachilek, the eastern Shan state, respectively.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Tying Gold Production To Global Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WEIHAI, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The deputy director of the State
Economic and Trade Commission's Gold Bureau, Cheng Fumin, says
that China's gold industry needs to be more aware of the market
and be ready to confront market challenges to maintain healthy
growth.
</P>
<P>
Cheng told the opening ceremony of the Daye Gold Mine in the
city of Rushan in Shandong Province today that the situation the
gold industry faces is the most serious since China started its
reforms and opening up in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
The international gold price has dropped to the lowest point in
the past two decades, as gold reserves are sold off by central
banks in many countries. China has been speeding up the process of
entering the international market with a gold management system
and the Bank of China cut the price of gold twice in May and June.
</P>
<P>
The price is now 71.64 yuan a gram (8.6 U.S. dollars), a drop
of 15 percent as China reacted to changes in the international
gold market, Cheng says, explaining that a world-market-oriented
price system has essentially been established in China as an
unavoidable step. China's gold companies need to watch the trends
in international gold prices closely to adjust to them.
</P>
<P>
China will support several big gold companies that are expected
to head up the industry and to make it more competitive in the
world.
</P>
<P>
China produced 172.8 tons of gold last year and had a billion
yuan (120 million U.S. dollars) in profits. It plans to produce
175 tons this year and announced a slowdown in production at the
beginning of the year.

<HEADLINE> Iran Expresses Concern Over Afghan Civil War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi has expressed concern over the incessant civil war in
Afghanistan, the Foreign Ministry said on Friday in a press
release.
</P>
<P>
"War of attrition and never-ending blood letting in
Afghanistan has proved that the crisis in Afghanistan has no
military solution and that neither a political faction nor an
ethnic group is capable of imposing its will over the rest of
Afghans," said Kharrazi.
</P>
<P>
He welcomed the recent invitation of United Nation
Secretary-General Kofi Annan to different Afghan factions and
ethnic groups to return to the negotiation table, the Islamic
Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
In a report to the U.N. Security Council, Annan on Wednesday
urged the Afghan belligerent parties to resume direct talks
"unconditionally and without delay" to restore peace and stability
in the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
Annan called on countries concerned to improve coordination for
a common approach towards the settlement of Afghan crisis.

<HEADLINE> India Says No Widening of Conflict In Kashmir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI July 2 (Xinhua) -- India said Friday that there was
no widening of the on-going conflict with Pakistan in Kashmir
though there was no evidence of Pakistan withdrawing its troops
and "extremists" from the Indian side of the line of control
(LoC).
</P>
<P>
An External Affairs Ministry spokesman told a news briefing
that Pakistan was making "desperate attempts" to replenish
supplies to the "intruders" who were being systematically pushed
back.
</P>
<P>
"There is no evidence on the ground that Pakistan is
withdrawing its forces from the remaining pockets of intrusion on
our side of the LoC," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He urged Islamabad to withdraw its "armed intruders" from the
Indian side of the LoC, after which he said the question of
resumption of the Lahore process could be taken up.
</P>
<P>
New Delhi has insisted that there be no further talks with
Pakistan before the "intruders" are cleared out of the Kargil
sector in the disputed Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
An Indian army spokesman said at the briefing that fierce
fighting was going on to evict the "intruders" from the strategic
"Tiger Hill" overlooking the crucial Srinagar-Leh highway in
Drass, another battle ground in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
He said that while the enemy had been evicted completely from
one position and partially from another, a foothold was yet to be
achieved at the other three or four locations in Batalik sector.
</P>
<P>
In the last 24 hours, he said, seven Pakistan soldiers had been
killed, taking the toll of Pakistani army regulars to 446, while
217 Indian troops had been killed, as many as 406 wounded and nine
were missing.

<HEADLINE> Thai Govt Can Do Without SAP: Interior Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Sanan Kachornprasart, Thailand's
Interior Minister in charge of election affairs, said Friday that
the government can do without the outgoing Social Action Party
(SAP).
</P>
<P>
Newly-elected SAP leader Suvit Khunkitti announced earlier
Friday that his party has decided to quit the Thai coalition
government.
</P>
<P>
Sanan said that since SAP could not solve its internal problems
and manage to stay in the coalition, what the government could do
was let it be.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Suvit said he believed that SAP's withdrawal will
not affect the stability of the coalition government, which
originally enjoyed a 257 majority in the 393-seat lower house of
parliament.
</P>
<P>
SAP's decision to quit was made at a SAP congress earlier in
the day, which was to elect a new party leader and an executive
committee.
</P>
<P>
Suvit, former party leader who quit the post amid an internal
row over cabinet seats allocation under the party's portfolio, was
re-elected as party leader.
</P>
<P>
And a 37-member executive committee, including Suvit himself,
was also elected at the party congress.
</P>
<P>
SAP holds 20 seats in the House of Representatives. It was one
of the seven partners within the current Chuan Leekpai government,
led by the Democrat Party.
</P>
<P>
SAP used to control five cabinet posts in the government. But
all of its ministers resigned before the party congress.
</P>
<P>
SAP's decision to quit was well anticipated by local political
analysts after a month-long struggle within the party over cabinet
seats pending a government reshuffle this month.
</P>
<P>
Rebel factions, led by party advisor Rakkiat Sukthana and party
secretary-general Somsak Thepsuthin, had demanded Suvit give up
his science minister post and keep only the deputy premiership.
But Suvit refused to give in to the demand even after the rebels,
who controlled nine of the party's 20 seats in the lower house,
threatened to withdraw their support for the government.
</P>
<P>
Instead, he fought back by resigning as party leader, forcing
the party to choose a new leader, a battle he had confidence to
win.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said SAP's withdrawal showed that Suvit, though
successfully re-elected, failed to quell the differences within
his party.
</P>
<P>
With SAP's decision to quit the coalition, the government is
expected to conduct a reshuffle in the following two or three
days.
</P>
<P>
A well-informed source said that four of the five cabinet posts
made vacant by SAP's withdrawal will be shared by the three
largest parties in the coalition -- the Democrat, Chart Pattana
Party and Chart Thai Party.
</P>
<P>
He said Chart Pattana, the second largest party in the
coalition which holds 51 seats in the lower house, will get the
lion's share of two posts. The Democrat, holding 123 seats, and
Chart Thai Party, 39 seats, will each bag one in their respective
portfolios. One job is still at stake.

<HEADLINE> France Urges Israel to Return to Lebanon Truce Committee Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 2 (Xinhua) -- France Friday called on Israel to
return to the meeting of the Truce Surveillance Committee in
Southern Lebanon after Israel's new Prime Minister Ehud Barak has
formed his government.
</P>
<P>
Israel boycotted a meeting of the committee previously
scheduled for this week.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Ministry vice spokesman Francois Rivasseau said
that the committee had helped save hundreds of lives and greatly
reduced the tension in southern Lebanon since its creation in
August 1996.
</P>
<P>
"The committee has over the past several years calmed down the
situation which was once very tense (in southern Lebanon), due to
the good will of the parties present and the efforts of the Franco-
U.S. co-presidency," he said.
</P>
<P>
The committee consists of France, the United States, Syria,
Lebanon and Israel.
</P>
<P>
The United States has also expressed its intention to continue
working for the committee despite Israel's boycott.
</P>
<P>
"The United States government supports totally the pursuit of
the work of the surveillance committee in charge of supervising
the implementation of the April 1996 truce agreement, because it
provides the most efficient mechanism for tackling the tension and
protecting civilians in southern Lebanon," said U.S. ambassador to
Lebanon, David Satterfield, in Beirut on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
France called for a meeting of the committee after Israel
launched air raids against Lebanon two weeks ago, killing eight
people and injuring 62.
</P>
<P>
Israel said it was taking revenge for the rocket attacks by
Shiite Muslim Hezbollah guerrillas in southern Lebanon, which
killed two Israelis.

tests will be ready after 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
Due to the shortage of specialists, FISU gave a course in
October on sample collection to the 26 doctors that will serve the
duty.

<TEXT>
<P>
PALMA DE MALLORCA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- FISU president Primo
Nebiolo said here on Monday that he believes Beijing will host the
best ever world university games in 2001.
</P>
<P>
After hearing Beijing mayor Liu Qi's report on the works
Beijing had done in preparation of the 2001 university games in
the 20th FISU general assembly, Nebiolo said: "I'm quite sure
Beijing will hold the best ever universiade in 2001, and I'm very
proud for having brought the games to Beijing."
</P>
<P>
"Beijing enjoys an important position not only in international
sports, but also in international politics," said Nebiolo, who is
also IAAF president.
</P>
<P>
He said Beijing has the capacity to build up ideal stadiums and
create benign atmosphere for the 2001 universiade.
</P>
<P>
Liu said in his report that Beijing now boasts over 30 large
stadiums, which can meet the demand of the games.
</P>
<P>
In case of fund shortage, Beijing government will offer their
backing to ensure the games a complete success.

<HEADLINE> Euro Reference Rate Slips to Record Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN July 2 (Xinhua) -- The Euro's reference rate slipped
Friday to a record low of 1.0241 U.S. dollars, two tenths of a
cent off Thursday's 1.0264 dollars, according to the European
Central Bank (ECB) in Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
That meant the dollar would buy 1.9098 German Mark, up from
Thursday's 1.9055 marks.
</P>
<P>
The ECB set reference rates for the euro of 0.64980 pounds
sterling (0.65020) 123.93 yen (124.12) and 1.6060 Swiss francs
(1.6043) (Thursday reference rates in brackets).
</P>
<P>
On the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, Thursday's rally petered out
and the main index, the DAX was up just 2.82 points at 2 p.m. to
5480.04 amid very mixed trading. Secondary stocks improved,
pushing the 70- stock M-DAX up 10.51 points to 4067.01.
</P>
<P>
European stock prices were held back by signs of a continuing
economic boom in the United States that was "wrecking the illusion
that only one interest-rate hike will be enough to cool it off".
</P>
<P>
"The minute the interest-rate scare evaporates, it comes back
again," said one trader ruefully.
</P>
<P>
Automobile stocks were among those that performed worst Friday,
with BMW easing 1.71 per cent to 686 euros and Volkswagen hit by
rumours that analysts were recommending the stock be sold. VW fell
2.92 per cent to 61.55 euros as a result.
</P>
<P>
Thyssen-Krupp stock beat the pessimism, rising 2.3 per cent to
22.20 euros, while Lufthansa jumped 1.24 per cent to 18.02 euros.
</P>
<P>
On the Frankfurt bond market, prices eased as much as 2.42
percentage points and the Bundesbank's Umlauf yield rose 14 base
points to 4.33 per cent. The Euro Bund Future rate was off 26
points by 2 p.m. to 109.54.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Unemployment Edges up Slightly to 4.3 Percent in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The Labor Department said Friday
that the U.S. unemployment rate edged up only 0.1 percent to 4.3
percent in June as factories continued to shed jobs.
</P>
<P>
The rate still remained at the lowest levels in nearly three
decades, even though the May unemployment rate of 4.2 percent was
a 29-year low.
</P>
<P>
In June, manufacturing jobs decreased by another 35,000,
bringing the total job loss at factories since March 1998 to
488,000. Manufacturing has been the hardest hit sector from the
global financial crisis, because of a loss of major export markets
overseas and increasing competition from cheap imports.
</P>
<P>
However, employment at U.S. businesses accelerated sharply last
month with a total of 268,000 new jobs created with all industries
except manufacturing and mining posting solid gains.
</P>
<P>
Average hourly earnings, a key gauge of inflation pressures,
increased by 3.7 percent in June, compared to a year ago, to 13.23
dollars. This was up only slightly from the May increase.
</P>
<P>
The declines in manufacturing jobs were widespread last month,
led by large job losses at aircraft factories and plants making
electrical equipment and apparel. Employment in the apparel
industry has fallen by one-third since November 1991.
</P>
<P>
The Department said mining also saw further job declines in
June, losing 3,000 jobs while job losses in oil and gas drilling
lessened during the month.
</P>
<P>
But construction, which had suffered big job losses in May,
rebounded last month, posting a gain of 26,000 jobs with plumbing,
electrical work and roofing all showing increases.
</P>
<P>
The overall gain of 268,000 payroll jobs was led by strong
hiring at amusement parks. Also posting big gains were retail
trade, which added 49,000 jobs in June, bringing total job growth
in this sector to 265,000 through the first half of this year. The
largest gain of last month came from hiring at restaurants and
bars.

<HEADLINE> New Act to Protect Industrial Designs Adopted by Consensus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- A new act to broaden the
geographical scope of international industrial design protection
was adopted by consensus here Friday at the end of the diplomatic
conference of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO).
</P>
<P>
WIPO Director General Kamil Idris welcomed the successful
conclusion of the Geneva Act of the Hague Agreement Concerning
International Registration of Industrial Designs, which became
effective in 1960.
</P>
<P>
"We are delighted with the outcome of the diplomatic conference
and the positive spirit of cooperation that prevailed throughout
the talks and resulted in consensus on all the issues discussed,"
said Idris.
</P>
<P>
The new act, the WIPO head said, will help fulfill the
tremendous potential of the Hague system by offering an even more
flexible, cost-effective and user-friendly means for companies and
individuals across the globe to protect their industrial designs.
</P>
<P>
The new act, expected to enter into force after six
ratifications of over 80 contracting parties, introduces a number
of important changes to the Hague system for the registration of
industrial designs, according to WIPO.
</P>
<P>
The Geneva act enhances the existing system for the
international registration of industrial designs by making it more
compatible with the registration systems in countries such as the
United States and Japan.
</P>
<P>
One of the main advantages of using the Hague system is that it
allows users to include up to as many as 100 designs in each
international application that is made.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, WIPO registered about 4,000 international deposits
each covering on average 11 countries. This represented a 40
percent increase on the number deposited 10 years previously.

<HEADLINE> HK's External Trade Volume Down in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The volume of Hong Kong's re-
exports in April 1999 fell by 2.7 percent over a year earlier, and
that of domestic exports by 14.1 percent, according to statistics
released by the Census and Statistics Department here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Taken together, the volume of total exports decreased by 4.2
percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the volume of imports dropped by 11.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Comparing the first four months of 1999 with the same period a
year earlier, the volume of Hong Kong's re-exports fell by 3.7
percent, and the volume of domestic exports by 10.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Taken together, the volume of total exports during the period
dropped by 4.6 percent. Meanwhile, imports fell by 10.6 percent in
volume.
</P>
<P>
Comparing April 1999 with April 1998, the prices of re-exports
and domestic exports fell by 4.0 percent and 3.0 percent
respectively. Import prices also declined, by 3.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
As regards price changes in the first four months of 1999 over
the same period a year earlier, the prices of re-exports and
domestic exports were down by 4.4 percent and 2.7 percent
respectively, and import prices by 3.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Ian K Perkin, chief economist of the Hong Kong General Chamber
of Commerce, said these figures showed Hong Kong's external trade
still being affected by both lower global prices and trade volumes.
</P>
<P>
But the declines in export volumes and prices were more than
offset by a big drop in import volume, he added.

<HEADLINE> Barak, Arafat Agree to Meet Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister-elect
Ehud Barak and Palestinian National Authority (PNA) Chairman
Yasser Arafat agreed Friday to meet soon after Barak takes office
next week, Barak's spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"The prime minister-elect and Arafat agreed to arrange a
meeting shortly after the government is presented to the Knesset
(parliament)," local media quoted spokesman David Ziso as saying.
</P>
<P>
In his telephone conversations with Arafat, Barak also
reiterated his determination to continue along the path of late
Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin and put the stalled peace
process back on track, Ziso said.
</P>
<P>
No date being set, the forthcoming meeting would be the first
Israeli-Palestinian summit in nearly seven months. Arafat met with
outgoing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in mid-December in a
three-way summit with United States President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Barak released a statement calling Arafat "an
important and central partner" for peace, saying he would like to
meet with him soon.
</P>
<P>
The victory of moderate Barak in the May elections has raised
hope of reviving the Middle East peace process, which was largely
frozen during the tenure of the hard-line government of Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Barak will present to the parliament next week a governing
coalition he put together through six weeks of grueling talks with
other parliamentary parties.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have hailed "a new era of peacemaking" after
Barak secured a 75-seat majority in the 120-member parliament for
his emerging government.
</P>
<P>
Since Barak has pledged to reinvigorate the peace process in
all tracks, including the Syrian and Lebanon tracks, the
Palestinians have expressed fear that he might prefer to talk
with Syria and Lebanon first and left their problems behind.
</P>
<P>
Media reports said Arafat had complained that Barak did not
phone him after his election victory while exchanging indirect
messages with Syrian President Hafez al-Assad.
</P>
<P>
In a separate development, Barak issued a statement Friday
saying his government would ensure the unity of and Israel's
sovereignty over Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
He was responding to remarks made by a dovish Labor legislator
who said he would not oppose to Palestinian flags flying on the
Temple Mount, a holy site in the city.
</P>
<P>
Yossi Beilin, an architect of the 1993 Oslo peace accords,
confirmed reports that he would agree to the idea of Palestinian
flags being raised on the Al-Aqsa Mosque, a Muslim shrine in the
Arab East Jerusalem, saying this "symbolic and religious" matter
would be accepted by all.
</P>
<P>
The right-wing Likud called on Barak to condemn Beilin's
remarks, which it termed as "grave."
</P>
<P>
Israel annexed Arab East Jerusalem after seizing it from
Jordan's control in the 1967 Middle East war. The Palestinians
want East Jerusalem as capital of their future state.
</P>
<P>
Barak holds the same line on the issue of Jerusalem, claiming
it would remain the "eternal and undivided capital" of Israel
under a permanent peace agreement with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Beilin acknowledged that he discussed the flag issue during
his secret talks with senior Palestinian official Abu Mazen in
1995.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the two had reached a draft agreement on the
future of Jerusalem, under which the Palestinians would agree to
build its capital at Abu Dis, an Arab village just outside East
Jerusalem.

<P>
SHANGHAI, July 2 (Xinhua) --The Composite Stock Index on the
Shanghai Stock Exchange rebounded to above 1,600 points today,
after a sharp drop of about 130 points on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Trading hit a record high and finished at about 1,739 points on
this week's first trading session, amidst a bullish mood that was
buoyed up by encouraging words from the authorities. But, it
started falling on Wednesday and dropped to 1,560 points the
following day. About 270 stocks suspended trading because they had
lost more than 10 percent in one day.
</P>
<P>

was irrational because they have never thought of such a sudden
fall, according to market observers, but most investors are still
confident in market prospects and the stock market is expected to
continue to grow next week.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai rebounded to 1,613.53 points today, 1.23 percent more
than last Friday. Total trading was 142.6 billion yuan this week,
about 0.66 percent lower than for last week.

B shares, which are reserved for overseas investors, also
finished at 55.66 points today, about 0.66 percent lower than for
last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Total B share transactions were estimated at 1.36 billion yuan
this week, and funds trading amounted to 13.8 billion yuan.

Total turnover in bonds was 40 billion yuan for the week, an
increase of 3.4 billion yuan over last week.

<HEADLINE> China Adopts New Standards for State-Owned Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 2 (Xinhua) -- China has announced that it will
adopt international practices in assessing the performance of
state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to facilitate reforms.
</P>
<P>
The new standards involve using return on net assets as an
index of performance to encourage them to concentrate resources on
the core business and discourage them from over-diversifying.
</P>
<P>
The new standards come from the Ministry of Finance, which says
that they address the shortcomings of the previous means of
assessing performance and use a multiple index for complete
assessment of efficiency in finances, assets management,
operational risks, and sustained growth ability.
</P>
<P>
For the first time in the country's history, they provide a
yearly index of SOE performance based on statistics of all SOEs to
set a different specific index for various industries. By
comparing each individual SOE with these standards, differences in
the actual efforts of various enterprises can be shown to improve
performance.
</P>
<P>
A Ministry of Finance official said that, in the past, various
government departments used different ways to assess the
performance of SOEs, a practice that put an excessive burden on
the enterprises and still failed to reflect the true state of
their performance.
</P>
<P>
The new standards reform the old system in management and
supervisory methods and in assessing performance, he added.

<HEADLINE> Situation Along Kenyan-Somali Border Normal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The security situation along the
common border between Somalia and Kenya is returning to normal
Friday after serious tension rose Thursday following the looting
by Somali militiamen of Kenyan army equipment across the border.
</P>
<P>
According to the VHF radio reports near the border, the Somali
villagers and nomads living in the border areas have been
terrified by the Kenyan air force angered by the Somali militiamen
who crossed the border to disarm some of Kenyan soldiers
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan helicopter gun-ships and fighter jets flew over the
border between Kenya and Somalia all day Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The latest reports from the region indicated that the tension
has been defused after Colonel Barreh Hiraleh from the Somali
National Front (SNF) faction turned the two looted lorries to
General Agoi (one name), commander of the Kenyan military forces
in the northeastern region, and other officials at Ammuma village
where looting took place two days ago.
</P>
<P>
Colonel Hiraleh said that his men are working hard to return
other equipment stolen from the Kenyan forces including some
ammunition and uniforms, pledging that the rest of the equipment
would be turned over later Friday.
</P>
<P>
The colonel and other Somali officials have arrived from the
southern port town of Kismayu to tackle the situation at the
border.
</P>
<P>
The Somali militiamen who crossed the border have reportedly
been chasing their opponent militiamen supporting General Mohamed
Saed Hirsi Morgan who lost the town of Kismayu to the Jubba Valley
alliance last month.
</P>
<P>
According to the reports, serious efforts have been made by
General Omar Hajji Masalleh, chairman of the SNF faction, who is
currently in Kenyan capital Nairobi to arrange the safe return of
the lorries and other military equipment looted by his men.
</P>
<P>
In a written message General Masalleh has apologized to the
Kenyan government and pledged that the equipment would be returned
by Friday, and this has shown some positive results.
</P>
<P>
Despite the efforts from the Somali side, still Kenya showed
concern over the situation along the border, since the Kenyan
government reportedly closed the border with Somali Friday
</P>
<P>
Here in Mogadishu, the politicians are also expressing concern
over the new possibility of Kenyan soldiers crossing into Somalia
after the factional and clannish war between the Somalis had
spilled over to their best neighbor of Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Professor Issa Mohamed Siad, a top aid of faction leader
Hussein Mohamed Aidid here in Mogadishu has forwarded his apology
to Kenya for what has happened at the border Somalia shares with
Kenya.
</P>
<P>
"Kenya has all the time been the best friend of Somalia by
accommodating our refugees and assisting them," he said. "We're
working together to return all the equipment."

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, chairman of China's
National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, in a meeting
with Namibia's President Sam Nujoma here this afternoon, said that
China and Namibia have a traditional friendship and their
cooperation in different areas has been reinforced since the
establishment of diplomatic ties nine years ago.
</P>
<P>
China and Namibia also have many common interests and have
always sympathized with and supported each other in international
affairs, Li said, adding that China treasures its relations with
Namibia and hopes to push bilateral friendly and cooperative ties
forward.
</P>
<P>
The NPC and Namibian parliament have a good relationship, which
has increased mutual understanding between the people of the two
developing countries, Li said, and the NPC is ready to increase
exchanges and cooperation with the Namibian parliament.
</P>
<P>
Nujoma discussed the situation in Namibia, saying that it
suffered greatly during the racial segregation imposed by
colonialism and struggled for independence and national liberation
for more than a century.
</P>
<P>
Namibia is now building a democratic system in accordance with
its own characteristics, he said, adding that the system is not a
copy of a Western style but is intended to let Namibians enjoy
equal rights.

<HEADLINE> Thai Govt Can Do Without SAP: Interior Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Sanan Kachornprasart, Thailand's
Interior Minister in charge of election affairs, said Friday that
the government can do without the outgoing Social Action Party
(SAP).
</P>
<P>
Newly-elected SAP leader Suvit Khunkitti announced earlier
Friday that his party has decided to quit the Thai coalition
government.
</P>
<P>
Sanan said that since SAP could not solve its internal problems
and manage to stay in the coalition, what the government could do
was let it be.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Suvit said he believed that SAP's withdrawal will
not affect the stability of the coalition government, which
originally enjoyed a 257 majority in the 393-seat lower house of
parliament.
</P>
<P>
SAP's decision to quit was made at a SAP congress earlier in
the day, which was to elect a new party leader and an executive
committee.
</P>
<P>
Suvit, former party leader who quit the post amid an internal
row over cabinet seats allocation under the party's portfolio, was
re-elected as party leader.
</P>
<P>
And a 37-member executive committee, including Suvit himself,
was also elected at the party congress.
</P>
<P>
SAP holds 20 seats in the House of Representatives. It was one
of the seven partners within the current Chuan Leekpai government,
led by the Democrat Party.
</P>
<P>
SAP used to control five cabinet posts in the government. But
all of its ministers resigned before the party congress.
</P>
<P>
SAP's decision to quit was well anticipated by local political
analysts after a month-long struggle within the party over cabinet
seats pending a government reshuffle this month.
</P>
<P>
Rebel factions, led by party advisor Rakkiat Sukthana and party
secretary-general Somsak Thepsuthin, had demanded Suvit give up
his science minister post and keep only the deputy premiership.
But Suvit refused to give in to the demand even after the rebels,
who controlled nine of the party's 20 seats in the lower house,
threatened to withdraw their support for the government.
</P>
<P>
Instead, he fought back by resigning as party leader, forcing
the party to choose a new leader, a battle he had confidence to
win.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said SAP's withdrawal showed that Suvit, though
successfully re-elected, failed to quell the differences within
his party.
</P>
<P>
With SAP's decision to quit the coalition, the government is
expected to conduct a reshuffle in the following two or three
days.
</P>
<P>
A well-informed source said that four of the five cabinet posts
made vacant by SAP's withdrawal will be shared by the three
largest parties in the coalition -- the Democrat, Chart Pattana
Party and Chart Thai Party.
</P>
<P>
He said Chart Pattana, the second largest party in the
coalition which holds 51 seats in the lower house, will get the
lion's share of two posts. The Democrat, holding 123 seats, and
Chart Thai Party, 39 seats, will each bag one in their respective
portfolios. One job is still at stake.

Nujoma went on to say that Namibia is striving for national
development but the country's economic foundation is still weak
because it is a young state. China's support is precious and
Namibia is ready to increase cooperation with China, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the experiences of both Namibia and China have
shown that economic development is a nation's top priority after
it gains independence, and a stable political situation is the
prerequisite of economic and social progress.
</P>
<P>
He said that China is happy to see that Namibia has made some
remarkable achievements in increasing economic growth and
improving people's livelihood under Nujoma's leadership in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
Namibia has always upheld justice and taken a clear stance in
major international issues, Li said, and China appreciates the
fact that Namibia has actively maintained widely recognized
international norms and rights of developing countries, and is
playing a greater role in regional affairs.
</P>
<P>
China hopes to strengthen cooperation with Namibia in
international affairs, Li said.

BEIJING, July 2 (Xinhua) -- People living along China's Yangtze
River are fighting to protect the lives of thousands of people and
the pandas and giraffes in a zoo against the latest flood threat.
</P>
<P>
A fire brigade today moved over 6,000 animals to high ground in
a large zoo in western Shanghai, half of which has been flooded
for the past two days.
</P>
<P>
Local hydrologists report that the first flood peak of the year
passed the Three Gorges on the upper reaches of the Yangtze early
this morning and shipping channels on that section of the river
have been temporarily closed until July 3.
</P>
<P>
Water levels on the middle and lower reaches rose rapidly this
morning, with record high levels reported where two of its major
branches meet.
</P>
<P>
Meteorologists in the city of Wuhan warn that more floods can
be expected later this summer although the heavy rains that have
been going on for 10 days began easing up today. Government
officials visited river banks to oversee flood-fighting efforts as
Hubei Province declared a state of emergency.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Economy Improving, Says Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Coordinating Minister
for Economy, Finance and Industry Ginandjar Kartasasmita Friday
expressed the government's optimism about the country's economic
recovery.
</P>
<P>
Ginandjar said the optimism stems from the improving
macroeconomic indicators which were "sustainable."
</P>
<P>
"I believe that current economic growth is sustainable. If
political stability is maintained, I am optimistic that
Indonesia's economic performance will be better than the 0.13
percent estimate made by the Central Bureau of Statistics,"
Ginandjar told reporters here.
</P>
<P>
The government has predicted that economic growth would be
between zero to two percent this year.
</P>
<P>
Ginandjar said the sustainable growth showed the success of the
country's economic recovery program with the support of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
The improving economic condition is marked by positive growth,
the strengthening exchange rate of the rupiah, decreasing
inflation rates, and declining bank interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah, which was around 8,500 rupiah against the U.S.
dollar before the June 7 poll, has risen past 7,000 rupiah last
week, and is now trading around 6,700 rupiah against the
greenback.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia posted a deflation of 0.18 percent in March, 0.68
percent in April, 0.28 percent in May and 0.34 percent in June.
</P>
<P>
The minister also said his country's export has notched up an
increasing trend, while the economy has begun to recover.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the rupiah's exchange rate against the U.S.
dollar, Ginandjar maintained that 6,000 rupiah to the dollar would
still be conducive to the growth of the Indonesian economy.
</P>
<P>
"Six thousand rupiah to the dollar will be okay, because it is
still favorable to the repayment of foreign debts and the control
of inflation, while still unproblematic to the export drive," he
said.

<P>
MOSCOW, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin said
on Friday that both Russia and France need to learn from the
lessons of the Kosovo crisis "for further cooperation in both
bilateral and international affairs."
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with visiting French Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin at the Kremlin, Yeltsin noted that Moscow's ties with Paris
were strained by "the military action of NATO countries in the
Balkans, in which France took part," according to Sergei Prikhodko,
Yeltsin's deputy chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Yeltsin said the Kosovo crisis has also been
reflected in "the mutual understanding of Russia and France
regarding the need to expand privileged cooperation" between the
two countries, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Jospin, for his part, said "France attaches and will continue
to attach great significance to the U.N. role in the settlement of
conflicts similar to those in Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
"The Kosovo precedent must not become a rule," Prikhodko
quoted Jospin as saying.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders "expressed confidence that cooperation between
the military peacekeepers from the two countries in Kosovo would
be exemplary, or example-setting in character," Prikhodko said.
</P>
<P>
Besides Kosovo, Yeltsin and Jospin also discussed bilateral
trade and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Jospin, who arrived here Thursday on a two-day official visit,
will also meet with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Stepashin, for
the fifth meeting of the French-Russian inter-governmental
commission on economic and technological cooperation.

<P>
LONDON, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland's disarmament
commission said on Friday it expected the Irish Republican Army
will endorse the decommissioning of weapons offered by its
political wing, Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
"The Sinn Fein statement of July 1 offers the promise that
decommissioning (of weapons) by all paramilitary groups may now
begin. The commission expects that Sinn Fein's proposal will be
endorsed by the IRA and reciprocated by loyalists and other
republican paramilitary groups," General John de Chastelain,

</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein has been locked with the pro-British unionists over
the crunch issue of guerrilla disarmament and the setting up of a
power-sharing cabinet for Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
De Chastelain said that the Sinn Fein statement released on
Thursday provided "the basis for believing that decommissioning
can be completed in the time prescribed by the Good Friday
Agreement."
</P>
<P>
There was still time to meet the May 2000 deadline laid out in
the Good Friday agreement reached last year, if disarmament began
soon, he said.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein's offer to disarm the IRA was the first time for it
to accept an obligation. It vowed to work to start it within a few
months.

But the Ulster Unionists spurned the offer, saying they want a
commitment directly from the IRA.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Govt Vows to Protect Working Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government vowed on
Friday to protect the country's more than 3.7 million working
children from harm by strictly enforcing the laws prohibiting the
employment of minors in hazardous working conditions.
</P>
<P>
Felicisimo Joson, undersecretary of the Department of Labor and
Employment (DOLE), told a meeting that many working children are
either exposed to hazardous working conditions or too long hours
of work.
</P>
<P>
Joson stressed that the law prohibits the employment of
children below 15 years old in public or private undertakings,
saying the DOLE was mandated to promulgate the rules for the
effective enforcement of labor law.
</P>
<P>
However, according to the law, a "go" signal can be given when
the child would work directly under the sole responsibility of his
or her parents or legal guardian.
</P>
<P>
Also, Filipino children could work in public entertainment
areas such as cinema, theater, radio or television production
where their employment or participation "is essential."
</P>
<P>
But Joson said that while the law provides for exceptions, it
nevertheless mandates the employer to ensure the protection,
health, safety, morals, and normal development of the child.
</P>
<P>
It likewise obligates the employer to institute measures to
prevent the child's exploitation or discrimination, he added.
</P>
<P>
More importantly, he said, the employer should first secure a
work permit before engaging the services of the child to ensure
his or her protection against unscrupulous or exploitative
employers.
</P>
<P>
Joson admitted that the task of safeguarding the children's
right is no easy job and called for the support of the whole
society in the effective and full implementation of the law.

<HEADLINE> Barak Rebukes Clinton's Remarks Over Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 2 (Xinhua) -- In his first exchange of harsh
words with Israel's most important ally, Prime Minister-elect Ehud
Barak criticized U.S. President Bill Clinton Friday for his
remarks supporting the return of hundreds of thousands of
Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued earlier in the day, Barak described as
"unacceptable" Clinton's stance on the refugees' right of return.
</P>
<P>
"It's apparently a misunderstanding, and it would have been
appropriate for the (U.S.) administration to clarify and correct
it," Barak said.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference with visiting Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak in Washington Thursday, Clinton said the Palestinian
refugees should be free to live "wherever they like."
</P>
<P>
While responding to a question on whether he would work to
ensure the return of Palestinian refugees, Clinton said, however,
as a practical matter, whether the refugees go home depends on,
among other things, how long they've been away and whether they
wish to return.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians were forced to flee
from their home when the Jewish state was proclaimed in 1948.
</P>
<P>
Currently, more than 3 million refugees and their descendants
are scattered in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip as well as
neighboring Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Israel has been opposed to the return of the refugees for fear
that it will cause a major impact on the character of the Jewish
state, which has a population of 6 million.
</P>
<P>
The future of the refugees, together with other thorny issues
in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict such as the fate of
Jerusalem, is supposed to be discussed in the final-status talks,
which has yet to be started.
</P>
<P>
Barak, who trounced the hard-line Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu in the May election, has pledged to reinvigorate the
stalled Middle East peace process in all tracks. He will present
to the parliament next week of a new government he has put
together through six weeks of grueling talks.
</P>
<P>
Washington and the Arab world have hailed "a new era of
peacemaking" since Barak secured a broad support for his policy
by forming a government with a 75-seat majority in the 120-member
parliament.
</P>
<P>
But observers said Barak, an ex-army chief, wanted to send
a message to Clinton and Israel's Arab neighbors that he will
be tough in negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Authority (PNA), which has developed
warm relations with Washington in three years when Netanyahu was
in office, has welcomed Clinton's remarks on the refugees,
saying they are "encouraging."
</P>
<P>
But Ziad Abu Zayyad, a PNA cabinet member, cautioned that
while Clinton's remarks are very important, the Palestinians
understand that practically speaking, Israel will not accept a
massive return.
</P>
<P>
"We won't ask the Israelis to commit suicide, we won't

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Reserves Position Improved: C. Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The South African Reserve Bank
Friday reported further improvement in the reserves position of
the country.
</P>
<P>
The central bank of South Africa said its provisional gross
gold and foreign exchange reserves amounted to 35.1 billion rand
(5.85 billion U.S. dollars) on June 30 this year, 800 million rand
(133 million dollars) more than that at the end of May.
</P>
<P>
The use of foreign credit lines at the end of June amounted to
16 billion rand (2.67 billion dollars), compared to 16.4 billion
rand (2.73 billion dollars) on May 31.
</P>
<P>
The net open foreign currency position was 18.3 billion dollars
at the close of business on June 30, compared to 19.3 billion
dollars at the end of the previous month.
</P>
<P>
The outstanding oversold forward book of the bank was 21.5
billion dollars at close of business on June 30, compared to 22.2
billion dollars at the end of May.
</P>
<P>
The improvement has sparked renewed calls for domestic interest
rate cuts.
</P>
<P>
Bruce Teubes, economist with Standard Bank Investment
Corporation (Stanbic) said Friday: "The reserves data complete a
week which, with the exception of the PPI (producer price
inflation) data, has been extremely supportive of the case for
lower interest rates."
</P>
<P>
Teubes said that in dollar terms, gross reserves rose by about
300 million dollars during the month to 5.8 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
"With virtually no change in the use of foreign credit lines,
net reserves also rose by 300 million dollars to stand at 3.2
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
"The rand value of reserves did not reflect the same
proportional increase because of the stronger level of the
exchange rate at the end of June (one U.S. dollar equals to 6.03
rand) compared with the end of May (one dollar equals to 6.21
rand)," he added.
</P>
<P>
With the exception of the producer price inflation -- affected
negatively by higher oil prices -- the national economic data
released this week has all been good news.
</P>
<P>
The Quarterly Bulletin of the South African central bank showed
a 5.4 billion rand (900 million dollars) improvement in the
country's reserves in the first quarter of the year.
</P>
<P>
The monthly released Thursday indicated a further build-up in
the country's reserves in April, meaning the balance of payments
remained in surplus.

<HEADLINE> Refugee Camp Crowded in W. Tanzania: Red Cross </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 2 (Xinhua) -- A Red Cross refugee camp in western
Tanzania is struggling to cope with thousands of people fleeing
conflicts from the Democratic of Republic of Congo and it is in
danger of being overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
The camp at Lugufu, 90 kilometers east of the Lake Tanganyika
port of Kogoma, is stretched beyond capacity for weeks with up to
2,000 refugees a day crossing the lake, according to the Regional
Delegation of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red
Crescent Societies.
</P>
<P>
"Close to 370,000 refugees are being helped in Tanzania before
the latest influx and all the region's camps are under pressure,"
the mission said in a press release issued here Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We face a potentially explosive situation in Lugufu," said
Jane Buchan, acting head of the mission.
</P>
<P>
She explained that the Lugufu camp, run by the
federation-supported Tanzania Red Cross, is designed for maximum
40,000 refugees, but it has 55, 000.
</P>
<P>
However, an emergency operation is underway to prepare for
another 7,000 due to arrive in the coming week, she added.
</P>
<P>
Buchan said that the camp had run out of shelter materials and
some 18, 000 people are without cooking utensils.
</P>
<P>
She also noted that the mortality rate rose during May and June
and deaths among children under five are particularly worrying.
</P>
<P>
Within the next few days, she said, two or three new villages
must be constructed, two more health posts set up and more water
points provided in the camp.
</P>
<P>
Appealing for more funding for the camp, Buchan said that
serious consideration must be given to constructing a second camp
in Lugufu but all scenarios present an urgent need for funding.

<P>
WASHINGTON, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Bill Clinton welcomed the news that Israeli
Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak has formed a new, broad-based
coalition government, saying that "the time is ripe" for progress
in long-stalled Arab-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
-- Americans are less likely to marry than ever before,
according to a new study and fewer people who do marry report
being "very happy" in their marriages. A report says the nation's
marriage rate had dipped by 43 percent in the past four decades.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Clinton loosened restrictions on computers that American
companies can export to countries like Russia and China, arguing
that advances in technology have made ordinary machines as
powerful as the supercomputers of just a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
-- Talks to resolve the disarmament impasse threatening the
Northern Ireland peace settlement broke off, and many people
expect a decision to postpone further negotiations until after the
summertime sectarian parades that have been flash points of
tension in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Economists see blue skies ahead for the U.S. economy for the
remainder of this year, but worry that the year-2000 computer
glitch will drag down growth early next year.

<TEXT>
<P>
Stock traders say that the jittery stock market has calmed down,
with Chinese investors still confident in market prospects. They
say that short-term adjustments are necessary and that this will
help the long-term healthy development of the market.
</P>
<P>
Trading on the Shenzhen market soared to a historic high of 526
points on Tuesday, in a bullish mood buoyed by encouraging words
from authorities in recent weeks. But, on Wednesday, the stock
index began dropping drastically.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts say that the returning confidence is the result
of the Central Government's strategy of pooling funds to reform
state-owned enterprises through the stock market. The Shenzhen
Stock Exchange has raised nearly three billion yuan for several
large state-owned businesses in the past few days.
</P>
<P>
Many securities companies have been given approval for
increasing capital by bringing in more shareholders. Some
securities investment funds have also been approved.
</P>
<P>
Financial analysts say that the average prices of stocks are
reasonable in spite of the recent bullish mood.

Some investors note that the nose-diving stock on China's two
bourses in the past two days did not make sense.
</P>
<P>
The stock index in China's two bourses in Shanghai and Shenzhen
closed down sharply Thursday by over 7 percent with a total of 549
company stocks drifting down.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts attribute the drop to the sell-off by
institutional investors after they took big profits from the
upward trend in recent weeks.
</P>

Many investors and analysts say that they would not be

NANNING, July 2 (Xinhua) -- China has just published a book of

</P>
<P>
The 16 million people of the ethnic group reside mainly in

For hundreds of years, members of the ethnic group have
developed many types of medicines and diagnostic and curative
theories.
</P>
<P>
To protect these discoveries, the Chinese government got
scientists to prepare an academic compilation of medical history
of the Zhuang covering the past 2,000 years. The book took them 15
years and appears in both the Han and Zhuang languages. The Han
people are the country's ethnic majority. The book contains a
medical history, medical theories, descriptions of 200 medicines,

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Thai authorities announced plans on
Friday to auction 3.8 billion U.S. dollars worth of loan
portfolios from failed finance firms.
</P>
<P>
The Thai central bank's Financial Sector Restructuring
Authority said in a statement that it had finalized plans to put
the loans on the block in a one-day sale on August 3.
</P>
<P>
The sale, announced exactly two years after the float of the
baht which triggered the Asian financial crisis, will be the
latest in a series of auctions that has so far netted more than
one billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government last month hailed previous auctions of
assets from 56 finance firms, closed after the crisis, as a
success and a sign of a return of consumer confidence.
</P>
<P>
Proceeds from the sales are being used to pay creditors of the
closed finance companies.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Try to Retrieve Looted Public Funds: VP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Vice-President Atiku
Abubakar said Thursday that the government will take efforts to
retrieve the looted public funds by former corrupt officials once
necessary facts have been secured.
</P>
<P>
When meeting a U.K. non-governmental delegation in capital
Abuja, Atiku urged the countries that may be affected to cooperate
with the government.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian newspaper Friday quoted the vice-president as
saying that his government would be ready to make such recoveries
on a negotiated basis.
</P>
<P>
Some European Union countries had earlier stated that Nigeria
must furnish concrete proofs before their investigation of the
suspected bank accounts could start.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted unspecified sources as saying that there are
about 55-billion-U.S.-dollar black money stashed in foreign
accounts.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting with the British delegation, Atiku regretted
that Nigeria did not benefit from the debt reduction recently
announced by the G-8 countries during their last meeting.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president noted that the economic situation of the
most populous African country was on the decline.
</P>
<P>
He said that if Nigeria's debt burden was not reduced by the
international community, it would get to a point where the
community would be invited to help in solving the problems of
poverty in the country.
</P>
<P>
The new democratic dispensation, he complained, was already
being threatened by poverty which had been linked to the debt
burden.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has accumulated a foreign debt of about 32 billion
dollars, according to media reports.
</P>
<P>
Atiku assured that his government is ready to improve the
fortunes of the west African country by reversing the trend in
conformity with the expectations of the international community.
</P>
<P>
Accountability and transparency were already in practice in
government dealings, the vice-president added.

complementary and broad potential for the future economic and

conditions, he added.

<HEADLINE> Meeting To Mark 40th Anniversary of Tibet's Democratic Reform (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The United Front Work Department of
the CPC Central Committee, State Ethnic Affairs Commission and
relevant subcommittees of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) held a meeting here today to mark
the 40th anniversary of the democratic reform of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhaoguo, head of the United Front Work Department of the
Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, said at the
meeting that the marking of the 40th anniversary of the democratic
reform of Tibet is of great importance for speeding up development
of Tibet and maintaining social stability and reunification of the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
"It is also of great importance for promoting national unity
and pushing forward the transcentury development of Tibet," Wang
added.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the democratic reform in Tibet was a
great social change that overthrew the feudal serf system and was
an important part of China's new democratic revolution.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that through the launching of the reform,
millions of serfs became master of the country and that as a
result national unity among people from all ethnic groups has been
strengthened.
</P>
<P>
Wang explained that the reform paved the way for implementation
of the regional autonomy system and socialism in Tibet and ushered
in a new era for Tibet to march forward to modernization together
with people in other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the past 40 years, Tibet has witnessed a great
leap forward in economic development. In 1998, Tibet's gross
domestic product reached 9.118 billion yuan (1.098 billion U.S.
dollars), up nearly 50 times that of 1950 and he revealed that
Tibet had its 11th successive harvest last year with a total
annual grain output of 850,000 tons.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Accuses U.N. Committee of Blocking Contracts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin
Ramadan has criticized the U.N. Sanctions Committee for impeding
the contracts Iraq signed under the oil-for-food deal, the Iraqi
News Agency reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
When meeting with visiting Executive Director of the
U.N. Program for Iraq Benon Sevan on Thursday evening, Ramadan put
the blame on the U.S. and British representatives with the
Sanctions Committee, or 661 Committee.
</P>
<P>
During the past five phases of the oil-for-food program, the
U.S. and British representatives with the 661 Committee had put
hundreds of contracts on hold, said the vice president.
</P>
<P>
He made it clear that the contracts which were on hold covered
electricity, health, agriculture, education, foodstuff and medical
appliances.
</P>
<P>
Under the oil-for-food deal which has been in place since
December 1996, Iraq is allowed to export a limited amount of oil in
every six months to buy food, medicine and other humanitarian
supplies for its people.
</P>
<P>
The vice president said that due to the hegemony of the
U.S. representatives with the U.N. committee, the
U.N. Secretariat-General's role is very weak in implementing and
following up the Iraqi contracts.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Benon Sevan, who has visited some areas in Iraq,
said that he appreciated Iraq's cooperation with him and pledged
to exert utmost efforts to put the Iraqi contracts into effect.

PARIS, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items in
leading French newspapers on Friday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- After the French government and central bank failed to
arrange a consensus agreement between the three major private
banks -- the Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP), the Paribas and the
Societe Generale, which were engaged in a merger war, the BNP lost
no time to launch a higher bid to take over the other two banks on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
-- The United States has declassified thousands of pages of
secret documents on rule of Augustus Pinochet in Chile. The
declassified documents were also censored to preserve the identity
of some people and keep secret the "sources."
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The market now has all the cards in its hand after the BNP
launched an overbidding against the Parisbas and Societe Generale
on Thursday, raising the buying price for them from 36 billion
euros (37.44 billion U.S. dollars) to 38 billion euros (39.52
billion U.S. dollars). Unless a foreign bank intervenes, the
merger battle between the three banks, which has been going on for
five months, is not expected to see an exit.

CAIRO, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs

<P>
SANA -- Lebanon's Albert Abila Group is planning to expand
its services for petroleum companies in Yemen during the coming
five years, the Arab daily Al Hayat reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Exploratory activities in Yemen were promising and 15
companies were already undertaking geophysical and seismic surveys
and were drilling test wells," said Assaf Maakaroum, Director of
the Group's branch in Yemen.
</P>
<P>
The Group owns 39 percent of the shares of the Yemeni Supply
and Services Company and the rest 61 percent are owned by the
Yemeni Petroleum Investment Company under the Yemeni Ministry of
Petroleum.
</P>
<P>
The Albert Abila Group, which was founded about 50 years ago,
has some 32,000 employees in 40 countries. Its annual sales exceed
1 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- The Exchange Program Office in the United Arab
Emirates (UAE) Thursday signed an agreement with the Mobile Oil
Qatar Inc., a subsidiary of the Mobile Corporation, for the
purchase of 300 million to 500 million cubic feet of natural gas
per day under the Dolphin project.
</P>
<P>
The accord has enabled the Dolphin project to receive the first
instalment of natural gas from the current available sources in
the UAE and the Omani Sultanate markets, local press reports said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Dolphin, the biggest energy project in the world, aims at
boosting economic development in the Gulf region. It is expected
to cost 8 to 10 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- The deficit in the unified government financial
account of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) reached 28.9 billion
dirhams (8 billion U.S. dollars) in 1998 as compared to 8.3
billion dirhams (2.5 billion dollars) in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The overall deficit in 1998 accounted for 17 percent of the
gross domestic product (GDP) as against 5.1 percent in 1997 and 13
percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the UAE Central Bank has announced that the deficit
has been covered by government investment revenues, said the
bank's 1998 annual report.
</P>
<P>
The deficit rise was mainly attributed to the drop in oil
prices, UAE's adherence to its export quota as fixed by the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) as well as
the hike in credit expenses and capital contributions.
</P>
<P>
DOHA -- Officials in charge of an international loan of 750
million U.S. dollars to fund a Qatari-U.S. petrochemicals joint
venture announced that the loan will be offered for contribution
next September in the regional and international markets.
</P>
<P>
The preliminary terms of the agreement were signed Wednesday in
London, entrusting 24 international banks with making arrangements
to cover 70 percent of the cost of the giant project for the
production of ethylene and polyethylene, the Arab daily Al Hayat
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Qatari petrochemical complex will cost 1.97 billion
dollars, a joint venture by the Qatari General Petroleum
Authority and the U.S. Philips Petroleum.

<HEADLINE> Social Action Party Quits Thai Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The Social Action Party (SAP)
decided to quit the Thai coalition government, the SAP's
newly-elected leader Suvit Khunkitti announced here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Suvit said it is the decision of the SAP party congress which
was held here earlier Friday aiming to elect a new party leader
and an executive committee.
</P>
<P>
Suvit, a former party leader who quitted the post amid an
internal dispute over cabinet seats allocation under the party's
portfolio, was re-elected as party leader.
</P>
<P>
And a 37-member executive committee, including Suvit himself,
was also elected at the party congress.
</P>
<P>
The SAP holds 20 seats in the 393-strong House of
Representatives. It was one of the seven partners within the
current Chuan Leekpai government, led by the Democrat Party.
</P>
<P>
The SAP used to control five posts in the cabinet, but all its
ministers resigned before the party congress.
</P>
<P>
The decision of the SAP's quitting the government was well
anticipated by local political analysts after a month-long
struggle within the party over cabinet seats pending a government
reshuffle this month.
</P>
<P>
Rebel factions, led by party advisor Rakkiat Sukthana and party
Secretary-General Somsak Thepsuthin, had demanded that Suvit give
up his science minister post and keep only the deputy prime
ministership. But Suvit refused to give in to the demand even
after the rebels, who controlled nine of the party's 20 seats in
the lower house, threatened to withdraw their support for the
government.
</P>
<P>
Instead, he fought back by resigning as party leader, forcing
the party to hold a new executive committee to choose a new
leader.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the SAP's withdrawal showed that Suvit, though
successfully re-elected, failed to quell the differences within
his party.
</P>
<P>
With the SAP's decision to quit the coalition, the government
is expected to conduct a reshuffle in the next two to three days.
</P>
<P>
A well-informed source said four of the five cabinet posts made
vacant by the SAP's withdrawal will be shared by the three largest
parties in the coalition, namely the Democrat Party, Chart Pattana
Party and Chart Thai Party.
</P>
<P>
He said Chart Pattana, the second largest party in the
coalition which holds 51 seats in the lower house, will get the
lion's share of two posts. The Democrat, holding 123 seats, and
Chart Thai Party, 39 seats, will each bag one more post in their
respective portfolios. The last post is yet to be decided.

<P>
WASHINGTON, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Brazil blew a 3-0 lead in the
last 30 minutes of regulation but beat Nigeria 4-3 on Sissi's
score in the 14th minute of the first overtime of the Women's
World Cup tournament here tonight.
</P>
<P>
Sissi blasted a powerful curling shot in the 104th minute to
put an end to the grueling fight. It was the first golden goal in
the tournament. Sissi, with two more goals today, is leading all
the shooters with eight goals.
</P>
<P>
Brazil will take on the United States, who beat Germany earlier
today 3-2, in the semifinal on July 4. The other two semifinal
teams are China and defending champions Norway, which will clash
with each other on July 4 in Boston.
</P>
<P>
Brazil looked very sharp in the first half, opening the scoring
in the 5th minute through Sissi, who seized a chance to put a ball
into the net during a goalmouth malee.
</P>
<P>
Brazil made it 2-0 in the 22nd minute when Cidinha received a
Sissi's cross to hit a brilliant header into the right low corner.
</P>
<P>
Brazil's third goal was a 25-meter shot by Nene, who unleashed
the powerful blast from the right and caught Nigeria's goalkeeper
Ann Chejine unprepared. Chiejine was quickly sent out of the field.
</P>
<P>
As most the 54,600 home crowd thought it was a lopsided game,
the Africans all of sudden came into live. They surged back
strongly to level the score in the last 30 minutes of the regular
time.
</P>
<P>
After today's actions, China, the United States, Norway, Brazil,
Germany, Nigeria, Sweden, along with host team Australia have
qualified for the Olympics next year. Russia, which was beaten by
China 0-2 yesterday, lost the chance to go to Sydney.

6th minute. Chastain made a silly error by scoring an owe goal for
the Germans.
</P>
<P>
"It just missed fire," explained DiCicco after the game. "
Brianna Scurry was supposed to overlap Brandy. It's a big game. It
's just the tension of the game. But Brandi came back and got us
the tying goal. It's a credit to her."
</P>
<P>
Chastain said: "Unfortunately that happened to our team, but I
think it also gave me an extra boost to do something more than I
was already doing for the team. I felt that I was playing maybe
average, maybe an even below average half. Thank God for Tony's
trust in me. They gave me the confidence to go out on the field
and be the player that I can be and contribute to this team."
</P>
<P>
Germany's coach Tina Theune-Meyer said: "We were in the lead
twice. We really believed we could win. We lead at halftime. I
thought we were very well prepared. They have great timing and
position. We just needed to wake up."

<HEADLINE> Safety of Water Not Guaranteed in Kenya: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government cannot
certify the safety of water supplies in the east African country,
according to Assistant Minister for Health Basil Criticos.
</P>
<P>
The East African Standard newspaper Friday quoted Criticos as
saying that Kenyans should desist from using unboiled water until
the government could attest to the safety of water supplies.
</P>
<P>
He said Thursday that a recent campaign against typhoid had
remarkably reduced the number of people still using unboiled
water.
</P>
<P>
Criticos lauded firms that were ready adapting to the use of
water coolers for their employees and clients.
</P>
<P>
The issue of clean water supplies has posed a big problem in
Kenya, where safe and adequate water supply is not accessible to
many slum residents and rural residents.

<HEADLINE> Imports Up But Exports Down in Central China Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, July 2 (Xinhua) -- In the first five months of this
year imports in central China's Henan Province reached 252 million
U.S. dollars, 20.1 percent up over the corresponding period last
year, while exports reached 409 million U.S. dollars, 13.3 percent
down.
</P>
<P>
Customs officials say that the main reason has been the adverse
impact of the Asian financial crisis, which led to 10 percent less
exports to the area. And the decrease in the exports of processing
industries has been the most noticeable, at 42.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The main causes for the increase of imports are: firstly, more
input in infrastructure construction which has encouraged domestic
demand which has accelerated imports in transportation, energy,
and raw materials.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, the reduction of the import tax rate has encouraged
state-owned enterprises to upgrade their technology with the use
of advanced equipment in foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
China, as a whole, is to encourage imports by reducing the
average tariff rates from 17 to 15 percent next year, and that by
2005 they will be just 10 percent. And it plans to import a total
1,500 billion U.S. dollars of technology, equipment and products
within the next seven years, according to Sun Zhenyu, vice-
minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC).
</P>
<P>
He also said that the central government will encourage the
development of agriculture, hi-tech industries, infrastructure
construction, the environmental sector, and export-oriented
industries, in particular in central and western parts of the
country.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The Uganda Parliament Thursday
passed the contentious referendum bill with several amendments to
beat the July 2 constitutional deadline.
</P>
<P>
The afternoon sitting featured conspicuous absence of
multi-partists, the New Vision daily reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Although the supporters of the National Resistance Movement
hailed the version of the bill passed as fair law which levels the
political playing field while most of the multi-partist MPs stayed
away from the final session of the House.
</P>
<P>
The bill was expected to be assented by President Yoweri
Museveni to beat the deadline.
</P>
<P>
Under the Constitution, any person will from Friday be free to
canvass for public support for a political system of his or her
choice.
</P>
<P>
There was reportedly less tension in the sitting as most of the
 amendments proposed by either Justice Minister Mayanja Nkangi or
Legal Affairs Committee Chairman Wandera Ogallo were quickly
approved.
</P>
<P>
A referendum will be held between June 3 and July 2 in the year
2000 to determine the political system to be used to govern the
country.
</P>
<P>
Multi-partists hold that a general election should be held
first and that all parties should be allowed to participate in the
election, a request flatly turned down by the ruling party.

<HEADLINE> Surplus Higher Than Expected in New Zealand Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The full-year surplus of the New
Zealand government is likely to be higher than the 2.2 billion NZ
dollars (1.188 billion U.S. dollars) forecast in the budget, the
New Zealand Treasury said.
</P>
<P>
The government's financial statements for the 11 months to May
31, which was released Friday by the treasury, show the government
in surplus by 3.018 billion NZ dollars (1.63 billion U.S.
dollars) compared with a forecast 2.587 billion NZ dollars (1.397
billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The treasury said the 431 million NZ dollar improvement on
11-month projections was due to higher-than-expected tax revenue,
a fall in expenses and better-than-anticipated net surpluses from
state-owned enterprises and other sources.
</P>
<P>
"The full year operation balance is likely to be somewhat
higher than the 2.2 billion NZ dollars forecast in the budget,"
the treasury said. But it noted that year-end adjustments would
also affect the full-year balance.
</P>
<P>
According to the treasury, the government's net worth was 422
million NZ dollars higher than forecast at 13.2 billion NZ dollars
while net debt was 587 million NZ dollars lower than expected at
21.556 billion NZ dollars.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Civilian Wounded in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 2 (Xinhua) -- A Lebanese man was wounded in an
Israeli air raid on south Lebanon overnight, the Voice of People
radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Ali Roumieh sustained injury when a missile fired by Israeli
warplanes hit his village of Kfarouman on the edge of the Israeli
occupied border zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
After the blast, Roumieh was rushed to a hospital in nearby
Nabatieh for treatment, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
This is the first casualty caused in the conflicts between
Israeli troops and Lebanese guerrillas since Israeli launched
the massive air strike on Lebanon last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Eight Lebanese were killed, 64 others wounded and the
country's infrastructure was ravaged in the attack, the biggest
since the Israeli 1996 "Grapes of Wrapth" operation on the country
which killed more than 200 people, most being civilians.
</P>
<P>
Isarel defended its attack as a retaliation for the
cross-border raid by Hezbollah which killed two Israelis while
the Iraian-backed group said it fired Katyusha rockets into
northern Israel to avenge the wounding of six Lebanese by Israeli
shelling on south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by
Hezbollah has been fighting to oust Israeli occupation troops
and its proxy South Lebanon Army out of the country.

<P>
BEIJING, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The ninth plenary session of the
Preparatory Committee for the Macao Special Administrative Region
(MSAR) opened here today.
</P>
<P>
Qian Qichen, vice-premier and chairman of the MSAR Preparatory
Committee, said at the opening of the two-day meeting that Edmund
Ho Hau Wah, first chief executive of the MSAR had launched the
work for establishing the MSAR government.
</P>
<P>
He expressed belief that the preparations for the establishment
of the MSAR government would be carried out successfully, with
support from the vast number of Macao residents and that the
policy of "Macao people governing Macao" would be well implemented.

Qian said the preparatory committee has already done a lot for
preparing the establishment of the MSAR and key tasks for
selecting the first executive of the MSAR had gone ahead smoothly.
</P>

every possible effort to support the work of the soon to be
established MSAR government, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
Qian said the overall cooperation between China and Portugal in
this later period leading to the transition in Macao had gone
smoothly. Top leaders of the two countries will hold a meeting
later this year and the Chinese side will continue to strengthen
consultation and cooperation with the Portuguese side to ensure
Macao's smooth transition and transfer of power, he said.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan President Warns Somali Militia Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
Thursday issued a stern warning to the Somali militia group,
demanding the return of the arms and vehicles they took from a
Kenyan army platoon.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the Somali militiamen Tuesday evening
crossed the Kenya-Somalia border and snatched two five-ton
vehicles and several G-3 rifles from 23 Kenyan soldiers who were
on a routine surveillance in Norther Eastern Province of Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The president told the militia group operating in southern
Somali along the Kenyan border that failure to return the
equipment they stole would be detrimental to their well-being.
</P>
<P>
The action by the Kenyan government would be swift, severe and
unpleasant to the militia group, Moi added.
</P>
<P>
Moi made the warning when he was speaking at opening ceremony
of a national show organized by the Agricultural Society of Kenya
at Nakuru, a city in central Kenya, local media reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Kenyan government Thursday also issued an
ultimatum to the southern Somali militia group for returning the
stolen ordnance.
</P>
<P>
Kenya Air Force fighter-bombers flew into Somali Thursday with
full armament loads and returned to base full-load, giving a
warning of full- fledge military retaliation if the hardware
robbed from the Kenyan soldiers is not immediately returned.

SHIJIAZHUANG, July 2 (Xinhua) -- A wooden, gold painted
Buddhist figure with a thousand eyes and hands in Chengde, north
China's Hebei Province, has recently been included in the Guinness
Book of Records as the tallest statue of its kind in the world.
</P>
<P>
The figure, which was carved in 1755, is made of 120 cubic
meters of wood, enough to build a four story house. The Central
Research Institute for Relics Protection and the Prospecting and
Designing Institute under the Ministry of Construction measured
its exact height as 27.21 meters, using the most advanced remote
measuring utilities.
</P>
<P>
The Guinness Book of Records headquarters confirmed it as the
tallest wooden Buddhist statue in the world after a thorough
examination.

<HEADLINE> Southern African States to Reach Free Trade Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 2 (Xinhua) -- South African Trade and
Industry Minister Alec Erwin has said southern African states were
close to clinching a long-awaited free trade pact expected to set
the stage for their economic integration, the Citizen newspaper
reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The minister said Thursday that he had enough negotiating
experience to know that the country were probably closest to an
agreement when the noise between the parties is at full steam.
</P>
<P>
"The noise that we now hear, the intense arguments and debates
in my view mean we're getting closer and closer to an agreement,"
he said in apparent reference to mounting calls from South
Africa's neighbors to conclude preferential trade deals.
</P>
<P>
Erwin did not say exactly when he expected a regional pact to
be wrapped up, but he said early this year that an agreement
should be in the bag by July.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, among other southern African states, has been
strongly advocating for a free trade pact. The country, which has
a large trade deficit with South Africa, accused Pretoria of
foot-dragging to conclude parallel talks to renew a bilateral
preferential trade deal which lapsed in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Pretoria says a bilateral pact with Zimbabwe -- South Africa's
largest trading partner in Africa -- was being held up by the
broader regional trade talks.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Peace-keepers Allowed to Enter Congo (K) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Belligerents in the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC) conflict have agreed that a U.N.
peace-keeping force should be sent to the DRC with full mandate
from the U.N. procedures once a cease- fire agreement is signed,
the Times of Zambia newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of rebel groups attending the Congo (K) peace talks
here are reportedly to have agreed to allow President Laurent
Kabila to have full control of Congolese territory as political
reforms start after the cease- fire document was signed.
</P>
<P>
These were among the thorny issues which delayed progress on
the peace talks for defense, home and foreign affairs ministers in
Zambian capital Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a source attending the talks as saying that
tremendous progress had been made since the meeting was narrowed
down to parties involved in the conflict in that country and the
document was likely to be adopted by the ministers soon. This
would pave way for signing by the heads of states in the region.
</P>
<P>
The meeting observed the question of control of the country
was a sovereign matter the Congolese government would decide on.
</P>
<P>
Zambian Presidential Affairs Minister Eric Silwamba told
reporters Thursday that an announcement on which way the on-going
peace talks go would be made Friday.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Recovery in Sight, Challenges Ahead for Thai Economy (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Two years after the financial storm
hit Thailand and spread across Southeast Asia, the Thai economy
finally began to show signs of recovery.
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, the central bank of Thailand announced that it
had given up its currency pegging system, triggering the collapse
of the baht and bringing down with it many other currencies in the
region, thus touching off a full-scale financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
With the aid of a 17.2-billion-U.S.-dollar rescue package of
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and after the adoption of
numerous reform measures, the Thai economy is now considered by
many experts as on the way to recovery.
</P>
<P>
The Thai baht has been stabilized at 37 to the U.S. dollar for
months, compared with the lowest level of 56 to the dollar in
early 1998.
</P>
<P>
Local companies with foreign loans applauded the current
foreign exchange level, saying it will alleviate their debt
burden, although some experts argued that the baht is too high to
effectively promote the country's exports.
</P>
<P>
International reserves, which had nearly been depleted in the
baht defense battle with foreign speculators before the financial
crisis, returned to the pre-battle level of 31.1 billion dollars
as of June 11.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Thailand recently announced that the country's
foreign debts have been reduced to 82.2 billion dollars from more
than 90 billion dollars when the crisis first broke out in July
1997.
</P>
<P>
Most importantly, debts of the private sector decreased sharply
from more than 80 percent of the total foreign debts to 58
percent.
</P>
<P>
After surging for a year to more than 10 percent at its peak in
June last year, inflation began to fall in the second half of 1998
and registered the first negative growth of 0.5 percent in May
1999.
</P>
<P>
The IMF's representative to Thailand Reza Moghadam said
recently that the policy Thailand has adopted and the measures
implemented are bearing fruit.
</P>
<P>
Thailand adopted an austerity policy following the IMF's
proposals, which featured tightened control of commercial banks'
lending and increased provision for their loans.
</P>
<P>
Four banks and 56 financial companies paid prices for their
relentless conduct before the crisis. The banks were nationalized
and the financial companies were closed at the end of 1997 by the
Chuan Leekpai government, which replaced the nine-month-old
Chavalit Yongchaiyudh government.
</P>
<P>
Realizing that banking reform is at the heart of the country's
economic recovery, the Thai government then introduced on August
14, 1998, a comprehensive financial reform package, helping banks
with their recapitalization.
</P>
<P>
And when the austerity policy brought the side-effect of
restricting domestic demand, the government then implemented a
130-billion-baht (3.5 billion dollars) stimulus package on March
30 this year. The package is aimed at cutting value-added tax and
personal income tax and spurring consumption with borrowed money
from the World Bank, Japan's Overseas Economic Cooperation Funds
and Japan's Export-Import Bank.

<HEADLINE> Resource Center to Help Tackle Y2K in Oman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, July 2 (Xinhua) -- A resource center will start
functioning within a week in Oman to help the country's private
sector tackle the computer millennium bug problem, known as Y2K, a
newspaper report said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The center will provide technical advice to private and
governmental organizations, create mass awareness to the problem
by distributing leaflets and holding seminars and workshops, the
Gulf News daily quoted Omani Minister of Commerce and Industry
Maqbool Bin Ali Bin Sultan as saying.
</P>
<P>
The center, to be run by the Omani Ministry of National
Economy, will also have a help-line desk in both English and
Arabic working around the clock to help private sector
organizations facing computer glitches, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Since many organizations were inter-dependent, a complete
coordination was imperative, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He explained that many developed countries had drawn up
contingency plans to fight the Y2K problem and Oman should not
lag behind.
</P>
<P>
"We are now focusing on computer system suppliers, especially
those who are engaged in supplying medical and telecommunication
equipments that directly affect the people's day-to-day life," the
minister told a gathering of computer and software experts.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Recovery in Sight, Challenges Ahead for Thai Economy (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Thai government's measures have been warmly applauded by
the IMF and other economic bodies. However, great challenges are
still ahead for the vulnerable economy.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts here said the progress of Thai banks'
recapitalization is at a snail's pace despite the August 14
package, especially that of small banks which are facing a tough
time raising funds.
</P>
<P>
Non-performing loans (NPLs) were at a high level of 46 percent
of the total loans in commercial banks for the whole year of 1998,
which made the banks unwilling to make new loans to cash-strapped
enterprises, particularly those small and medium-sized ones.
</P>
<P>
The biggest challenge for Thailand now is the shrinking
exports, the so-called engine of economic growth in the country.
</P>
<P>
Despite a devalued currency, Thailand recorded a negative
growth in exports in 1998. The government targeted a 4-percent
growth to 56.6 billion dollars for this year. However, in the
first five months of 1999, exports on average dropped 0.3 percent
from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the Bank of Thailand, the country's central bank,
lowered its 4-percent projection to 2.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
As the export engine is losing power, domestic consumption
became more important for economic recovery. However, the
inflation rate continued to fall since June last year, reflecting
a relatively weak public purchasing power.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts here even predicted that the cloud of deflation
is looming large as reflected by the minus 0.5-percent growth of
the inflation rate in May 1999.
</P>
<P>
What's more, the state budget was disbursed inefficiently, with
only 51.6 percent of the 825 billion baht (22.3 billion dollars)
having been disbursed in the first eight months of fiscal 1999,
which ends in September.
</P>
<P>
The government planned to spur the economy by expanding
government spending, allowed by a budget deficit accounting for 6
percent of the country's gross domestic product (GDP). But
bureaucracy and the liquidity crunch faced by government project
contractors have cast a shadow over the real effect of the plan.
</P>
<P>
However, despite these hurdles, most economic experts in
Thailand are optimistic about the country's economic situation,
saying the government's projection of 1-percent GDP growth can be
achieved.
</P>
<P>
The National Economic and Social Development Board, a
government think-tank, and the central bank have estimated that
the Thai economy experienced a 0.9-percent growth in the first
quarter of this year, the first quarterly GDP growth since the
second quarter of 1997.
</P>
<P>
They cited many positive signs appearing in recent months as
the reasons, among them NPLs, which slightly dropped in April to
42.06 percent of the total loans from 42.31 percent a month
earlier.
</P>
<P>
The IMF's Moghadam also said that as bad debts are dealt with,
restructuring progresses, the economy picks up and interest rates
go lower, the NPLs should be on a downward trend.
</P>
<P>
He also said the deflation fear was flawed, saying deflation
occurs when prices fall and output declines concurrently, which is
not the case in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the minus 0.5 percent inflation rate in May to
the cut in the VAT tax, which is part of the March 30 stimulus
package.
</P>
<P>
Also, exports in April and May recorded a growth of 4.7 percent
and 8.6 percent respectively after declines in the first three
months in 1999.
</P>
<P>
With good news from the region and the world, especially news
of a 1.9-percent GDP growth in Japan in the first quarter this
year, Thai exports are expected to have a better performance and
may even achieve the 4-percent growth target.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda once said Thailand would
continue borrowing from the IMF only if it is necessary.
</P>
<P>
After drawing 14.1 billion dollars from the 17.2-billion-dollar
multilateral package, the day for Thailand to stand on its own
feet is clearly at sight, analysts said.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa in Midst of AIDS Epidemic, Researchers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 2 (Xinhua)-- South Africa is in the midst of
an explosive AIDS epidemic which has increased 30-fold since 1990,
with no signs of stabilizing, local researchers have warned.
</P>
<P>
HIV rates have soared from 0.7 percent in 1990 to 22.8 percent
last year, with an estimated 3.6 million South Africans now
infected.
</P>
<P>
Findings by Quarraisha Abdool Kaarim and Professor Salum Abdool
Karim, both of the Medical Research Council's (MRC) Center for
Epidemiological Research in Southern Africa, were published in
this week's edition of the UK-based Journal of
Sexually-Transmitted Infections.
</P>
<P>
They said that while the seriousness of the HIV epidemic was
widely acknowledged, what was now becoming apparent was the
unprecedented escalation of the disease.
</P>
<P>
They confirmed earlier research that the disease was being
fuelled by migration, new infections in young women and high
levels of other sexually- transmitted diseases.
</P>
<P>
"The epidemic is spreading most rapidly in young South African
women who had HIV infection rates previously seen only in
high-risk sex worker populations," said Karim.
</P>
<P>
In just three years, HIV prevalence leapt from about seven
percent in 1992 to 21 percent in 1995 in the 20-to 24-year-old age
group, with about one in five young mothers attending ante-natal
clinics now infected with HIV.
</P>
<P>
The researchers attributed this to the fact that older men were
seeking out younger women for relationships in the hope that this
would free them of infections, and the fact that a woman's risk of
infection was substantially higher if her partner was a migrant
worker.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Epidemic Costs Kenya Dearly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The AIDS epidemic has cost the
Kenyan government about 40 billion shillings (some 556 million
U.S. dollars) in the past 15 years, according to Kenya's National
AIDS Control Program.
</P>
<P>
"About 80 percent of deaths reported annually in government
departments are attributed to AIDS," Tom Okeyo, Project
Coordinator of the National AIDS Control Program, said here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Kenya Times newspaper Friday quoted Okeyo as saying that
close to 700,000 Kenyans have died of AIDS, which means an average
of 130 deaths per day.
</P>
<P>
The development gains of the 20th century will have been eroded
by the epidemic, Okeyo warned at a seminar on work ethnics
improvement.
</P>
<P>
"People are chained by cultural beliefs and practices that
approve multiple sex partners, which is one of the root causes for
the rapid spread of the epidemic in Kenya," said Okeyo.
</P>
<P>
The program coordinator also said that ignorance was no longer
the issue, urging people to talk about AIDS at all levels and show
compassion for 1.9 million Kenyans already infected.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Banks Increase Lending Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Two commercial banks in Kenya have
increased their base lending rates in response to the recent rise
of treasury bill (TB) rate.
</P>
<P>
Commercial Bank of Africa and Standard Chartered Bank Thursday
announced the increases in their lending rates, from 16 percent to
18 percent and 15 percent to 16 percent respectively, as the
91-day TB rate rose to 13.4 percent from 12.26 percent last week.
</P>
<P>
Local financial analysts predicted that more banks will follow
suit soon which makes it hard for investors to borrow, the Daily
Nation newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Base lending rates in the country started falling last December
after TB rates dropped drastically. In early June this year, the
Kenyan currency shilling weakened by 15 percent against the U.S.
dollar, causing panic in the economy of the east African country.
</P>
<P>
However, yield on TB went up by 44 percent two weeks ago, a
fact meant to attract foreign currency in a bid to help the
falling shilling.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the average commercial banks' base lending rate was
19 percent with the lowest rate at 15 percent from Standard
Chartered Bank and Barclays Bank.

MANILA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines on Friday put its
export receipts from January through May at 12.942 billion U.S.
dollars, 12.4 percent up from the 11.515 billion dollars last
year.
</P>
<P>
For May 1999, the total receipts went up by 13.6 percent to
2.744 billion dollars from 2.346 billion dollars a year ago, said
a report from the National Statistics Office.
</P>
<P>
Receipts from electronics and components, still the top dollar
earner with a 55.1-percent share, increased in the month by 38
percent to 1.513 billion dollars from 1.096 billion dollars last

Manufactured goods, led by electronic equipment and parts,
posted a 22.3-percent increase as export sales reached 2.483
billion dollars from 2.03 billion dollars a year earlier. This
major export accounted for 90.5 percent of the total receipt.
</P>

Due to the drop in coconut products, the export value of
agriculture-based products totaled 129.41 million dollars,
declining from 171.13 million dollars last year.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Changes Rules to Back Technopreneurship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore government Friday
announced the first set of changes in the existing rules and
regulations with a view to bringing about a conducive environment
for technopreneurial development.
</P>
<P>
Teo Ming Kian, chairman of the Technopreneurship 21 Executive
Committee formed by the government months ago, told a press
conference that the changes include revision of the bankruptcy
law, the exercise of revised employee stock option, new
technopreneur investment incentive scheme, new technopreneur home
office scheme, changes in government procurement policy and
changes in work pass and long-term visitors pass policies.
</P>
<P>
Teo said that with the changes to bankruptcy procedures and
laws, debt settlement without resort to bankruptcy allows debtors
to avoid the cost, stigma and inconvenience of bankruptcy and
gives creditors greater prospects for debt recovery.
</P>
<P>
Teo also said the government will allow capital losses incurred
by investors on their investment in technopreneurial start-ups to
be tax deductible if subject to qualifying criteria under a new
technopreneur investment incentive scheme.
</P>
<P>
The government has also decided to allow tax liability from
employee share options (ESOP) to be deferred for up to five years,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Teo affirmed that the government has agreed to let
technopreneurs use Housing Development Board flats, which used to
be restricted for residential use, and residential properties as
registered home offices.
</P>
<P>
On risk acceptance and management for government procurement,
Teo said the government has allowed technopreneurial start-up
companies to participate in certain public projects and government
bids and build and enhance their credibility.
</P>
<P>
On employment passes which now are mostly issued to foreigners
who have found employment in Singapore, Teo said long-term Social
Visits Passes and work passes will be issued to foreign talent and
technopreneurs to give them time to stay in Singapore and study
the opportunities to start their companies.

<HEADLINE> Philippines May Import 500,000 Tons of Rice in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines will import 300,000
to 500,000 tons of rice next year even though the weather
condition in the second half of 1999 is good for the country's
grain production, an official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
National Food Authority (NFA) administrator Gregorio Tan told
reporters here that the volume may be brought in either by the
government or the private sector by the first semester of 2000 to
ensure sufficient rice supply next year.
</P>
<P>
Tan said the country may have to import that amount even
without the expected rice shortages and projected sufficient
rainfall in the next six months because its rice stocks are not
enough for next year.
</P>
<P>
NFA administrator Edno Joson said the 1.2-million-ton rice
stocks as of the end of June this year may be only enough for the
next 12 months.
</P>
<P>
But the country will not import rice during the remaining
months of 1999, he said.
</P>
<P>
The government already imported 991,000 tons of rice from
September 1998 to May 1999 due to food shortages caused by the
severe drought last year.

<HEADLINE> Hot Weather to Continue in North China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Unusually hot weather, which has
had most of north China in its grip for a week will continue for
at least another three or four days, according to the Central
Meteorology Station (CMS).
</P>
<P>
It's the eighth consecutive day that Beijing has suffered
temperatures soaring constantly above 35 degrees centigrade, which
hasn't happened in half a century. Tianjin has also endured
similar high temperatures for several successive days.
</P>
<P>
Li Yanxiang, a research fellow with the CMS, attributed the
sweltering hot weather to a ridge of high pressure which has
dominated the area and predicted that it will extend southward in
the next few days.
</P>
<P>
However, Li says that the temperature in northeast parts of
Hebei province, Beijing and Tianjin municipalities will drop a
little after July 5, but that Shandong and Henan provinces will
continue to suffer in the heatwave.
</P>
<P>
Continuous high temperatures have led to a boom in sales of
heatstroke preventing products, such as ice creams, electric fans
and air conditioners.

<HEADLINE> Heavy Rainfall Stops in East China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 2 (Xinhua) -- After ten days of heavy downpours
the rain finally stopped along the middle and lower reaches of the
Yangtze river this morning, the Central Meteorology Station (CMS)
has reported.
</P>
<P>
"There are still a few raindrops but it has mostly ended," said
a relieved Li Yanxiang, a research fellow from the CMS.
</P>
<P>
Since June 22, heavy rains have fallen in Zhejiang, Jiangsu,
Anhui and Jiangxi provinces, causing floods along some part of the
Yangtze River. The total rainfall has far exceeded normal average
levels in these areas, noted the CMS.
</P>
<P>
And yesterday the water levels of the Taihu and Hangjiahu lakes
reached a record high.
</P>
<P>
Li blamed the adverse weather conditions on cold and hot air
meeting high in the atmosphere and lingering around these areas
over the past couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
She predicted that no further heavy rainfall will occur in the
next couple of days in these areas but that showers and thunder
showers may occur after July 5.

<HEADLINE> 3rd Contingent of U.N. Civilian Police in E. Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- At least 31 personnel forming the
third contingent of the U.N. Civilian Police under the U.N.
Mission on East Timor (UNAMET), arrived in Dili, capital of East
Timor, from Darwin, Australia, on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Antara News Agency quoted UNAMET spokesman Ueki Yasuhiro as
saying the contingent includes 10 persons from the United States,
17 from Australia and four from Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The police members were also accompanied by six officials from
Australia and New Zealand, acting as military facilitators.
</P>
<P>
"So far the United States has not sent its civilian police, and
the presence of U.S. members in the contingent is a proof of
President Bill Clinton's attention to the direct ballot in East
Timor," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
With the third contingent, the number of U.N. civilian
policemen now has reached 104, while the total number of UNAMET
staff members and volunteers has reached 365.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement signed by Indonesia and Portugal on May 5,
the United Nations will send civilian police advisers from several
countries to assist Indonesian police maintain law and order. A
key function will be to disarm rival factions that are either for
or against the territory's independence.
</P>
<P>
All the U.N. poll officers have been tasked to help Indonesian
policemen during the August direct ballot.
</P>
<P>
The August ballot will allow the territory's people to choose
whether their homeland should become an autonomous region within
Indonesia or totally independent.
</P>
<P>
The former Portuguese colony of East Timor was integrated into
Indonesia in 1976 in a move never recognized by the United
Nations, which still considers Portugal as the administering power
of the territory.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Government Makes Progress in Y2K Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Philippine government services have
substantially increased its Y2K progress rate from 61 percent in
April to 72 percent in May, according to an official report
released here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The report by the Presidential Commission on Y2K Compliance
said the increased progress rating, which was just 45 percent in
March, could be attributed to the commission's "call to action" to
various government agencies during consultations and seminars
conducted in the past months.
</P>
<P>
Another factor for the progress, it said, is the concerted
efforts by government agencies to be Y2K ready in anticipation of
the enactment of the Y2K bill, which President Joseph Estrada
signed into law on June 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
The Y2K law mandates all government and private agencies to be
Y2K ready and allows government agencies to realign their funds
for Y2k projects.
</P>
<P>
Section 12 of the law allows for the filing of administrative,
criminal and civil charges against non-compliance in government
agencies.
</P>
<P>
Government services are one of the seven mission-critical
sectors being monitored by the commission for Y2K compliance. The
other six sectors are finance, manufacturing, utilities, health
care, transportation and telecommunication.
</P>
<P>
The government sector includes the Departments of Environment
and Natural Resources, Labor and Employment, Interior and Local
Governments, Foreign Affairs, Agriculture and Agrarian Reform.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Muslim Groups Protest Pornography in Media </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government and law
enforcers are under growing pressure to take stern measures
against pornography in the media as Islamic and women's groups
staged street rallies in the capital over the last two days.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of woman Muslim students, grouped in Calls for Human
Peace (Seruni) and the Indonesian Muslim Student Action Union
(KAMMI), Thursday staged a rally in front of the National Police
Headquarters in South Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
The students, attired in Muslim apparel, unfurled banners and
repeatedly chanted "Women should respect their Aurat (private
parts)."
</P>
<P>
The protesters also pointed a finger at artists and photo
models who help to make sensual photos in tabloids and magazines.
</P>
<P>
"Our action is a moral call and a form of rejection of
vulgarity. This protest in part displays our concern about the
abusive freedom of the press," The Jakarta Post Friday quoted the
group's coordinator Azimah S. as saying.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, hundreds of members of a group called the Women's
Front of Generation Saviors (Bestari) Thursday burned copies of
the Popular magazine outside the office of Women Affairs Minister
Tuti Alawiyah in Central Jakarta to protest against pornography.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, at least 100 Muslim youths of the Action Front
for the Love of the Country staged a rally in front of the
National Police Headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Pornography is another form of sexual harassment against women,
the group said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The National Police recently questioned witnesses regarding
issues of the Popular magazine, Pop tabloid, Obyektif tabloid and
the Liberty magazine, in relation to its investigation into
violations of the press' code of ethics.
</P>
<P>
Jakarta police Wednesday invited Muslim clerics to witness the
burning of pornographic VCDs and heroin.
</P>
<P>
Muslim opposition has intensified protest against the recent
explosion in the number of magazines. The protesters said pictures
of sexy women could destroy Indonesia's younger generation.

<HEADLINE> Cloning Won't Help Giant Panda Conservation: Scientist (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 2 (Xinhua) -- A top Chinese anthropologist has
warned that cloning giant pandas will do little to help preserve
the precious species, insisting that the most effective
conservation is to let them evolve in the natural environment.
</P>
<P>
Professor Pan Wenshi of Beijing University, a world renowned
expert in giant pandas whose research has spanned two decades,
said that cloning is unable to guarantee either the gene quality
or the diversity of a species.
</P>
<P>
There are at present only an estimated 1,000 giant pandas
living in the wild and in zoos, and finding ways to save the rare
black and white bear which is threatened with extinction is the
aspiration of many scientists.
</P>
<P>
Professor Pan's comments follow the news that a Chinese
research team recently announced that they are just a step away
from the first cloned giant panda, having cultivated a giant panda
embryo by injecting a tiny coil of DNA taken from the nucleus of
one giant panda cell into a rabbit cell whose nucleus has been
removed.
</P>
<P>
If the embryo is put into the womb of a surrogate mother and
able to grow, the scientists assert, the first cloned panda will
greet mankind "in three to five years."
</P>
<P>
The latest achievement made by the team headed by Professor
Chen Dayuan of the Chinese Academy of Sciences is regarded as a
giant leap in the development of the cloning technology. However,
conservation scientists fear that both the public and the
government's faith in hi-tech development will divert their
attention and support from conservation of the species in the
natural environment, which has proved to be a time and money
consuming job.
</P>
<P>
"Cloning is feasible if the animal has lost its ability to
propagate," said Professor Pan. "But in fact, the giant panda's
reproductive ability is not as low as people imagine," he added.

<HEADLINE> Cloning Won't Help Giant Panda Conservation: Scientist (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"It is a common misconception that the giant panda's plight is
caused by its declining reproductive ability and the monotony of
its food," he pointed out. "On the contrary, the damage done by
mankind to its natural habitat is the main threat to its existence,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
Fossils show that giant pandas spread in a vast area spanning
northern and southern China and some areas in Vietnam, Thailand,
the Laos and Myanmar. The drastic reduction of its population
occurred about 10,000 years ago, exactly when mankind started
agricultural cultivation.
</P>
<P>
Today, the species' habitats have been reduced to six mountain
systems in western China, according to the professor.
</P>
<P>
"Even so, giant pandas, whether living in the wilderness or in
zoos, have done well in breeding," he said.
</P>
<P>
The research center at Wolong Nature Reserve in the southwest
Sichuan province, a key panda habitat, has successfully bred two
to four cubs each year; while researchers stationed in Qinling,
over a nine-year observation period, found that the giant panda
population there grew by an annual 3.5 percent, higher than that
of the local human population.
</P>
<P>
Although Professor Pan voiced his support for development of
cloning technology using livestock and experiment animals for the
purpose of bringing humans better livestock and more effective
medicines he has his reservations about wild animals.
</P>
<P>
"Cloning them neither preserves their diversity nor the quality
of their genes and will be of no significance to their
conservation." he insisted.
</P>
<P>
The disadvantages of cloned animals have already be detected.
One estimate indicates that genetic abnormality occurs in less
than one out of 100 naturally bred embryos, 15 out of 100 tube-
bred ones, and half of those cloned.
</P>
<P>
"Why don't we devote our energy, time and money to helping
giant pandas reproduce healthier progeny in the natural way?"
asked Professor Pan.
</P>
<P>
He described a State Council's decree last year banning
lumbering in natural forests in the upper and middle reaches of
the Yangtze River, "good news" for the giant panda as it will help
protect 96 percent of the area where the animal lives.

<HEADLINE> Zhejiang Province Battles Early Summer Flooding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, July 2 (Xinhua) -- More than one million armymen and
civilians in east China's Zhejiang Province are battling floods,
which affected 7.9 million of the 43 million local people.
</P>
<P>
Well over 200,000 people have already been evacuated from flood-
stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang has experienced an unbroken spell of wet weather since
the advent of the rainy season during the first 10 days of June,
with total rainfall in some areas reaching as high as 806 mm, or
three times the level for a normal rainy season.
</P>
<P>
Continuing torrential rains sparked in heavy flooding in some
45 cities and counties in the northern part of the province, with
water levels in all major rivers and reservoirs in the areas
rising up to all-time highs. The water level in the Xin'anjiang
Reservoir located on the Qiantang River near Hangzhou, the
provincial capital, hit 108.2 meters on Thursday morning, the
highest mark since the reservoir was built in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
The Zhejiang Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters
estimates the flood water have destroyed 18,000 houses, damaged 3,
900 km of levees and inundated 478,000 hectares of farmland, with
direct losses approaching 5.8 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Vice Premier Wen Jiabao called Zhang Dejiang, secretary of the
Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee, on Thursday evening to
inquire about existing conditions. Wen urged the province to
continue all-out flood control and rescue efforts.
</P>
<P>
Social stability prevails in flooded areas and local residents
have access to an adequate supply of goods, according to local
official source.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Current-Account Deficit Soars in First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Israel's current-account deficit
soared 60 percent in the first quarter this year, up to 800
million U.S. dollars from 500 million dollars a year earlier,
according to official data made available here Friday.
</P>
<P>
On an annualized basis, the deficit for the whole year of 1999
is expected to be 2 billion dollars, compared with only 700
million dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
The deficit rise is mainly attributed to an overall gap between
imported and exported goods and services, together with unilateral
payments, such as U.S. aid, which stands at 3 billion dollars
annually.
</P>
<P>
Besides increased imports, mainly consumer product imports,
another cause for the deficit rise was an increase in foreign
debts, which rose by 1.1 billion dollars in the first quarter,
compared with a 600 million increase in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The figures published by the Central Bureau of Statistics also
showed that foreign investment fell 39 percent in the first
quarter to 1.1 billion dollars from 1.8 billion the same period
last year.
</P>
<P>
Foreign financial investment posted a particularly steep drop,
totaling only 100 million dollars, compared with 1.6 billion for
the same period last year. The bulk of the decline in foreign
financial investment came from a sharp reduction of government
bond issue.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaitis to go to Polls on Saturday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti voters will go to
polls on Saturday to elect a new four-year term National Assembly
(Parliament), which they hope will cooperate with the government
on important state issues.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti Emir Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah dissolved the former
parliament on May 4, on the ground that it had misused
constitutional rights and violated ethics and morals of the Gulf
Arab state.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, a total of 112,882 males are
eligible for the parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
A total of 288 registered candidates are contesting for 50
parliamentary seats at the 25 constituencies nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 500 people had originally registered for the race, but
over 200 of them pulled out as the deadline for withdrawals
expired on June 28.
</P>
<P>
Since there are no official political parties in Kuwait,
candidates are representing different government-tolerated
political groups. Some prominent and influential political
figures are even running as independents.
</P>
<P>
Tribal groups are expected to be dominant elements in
Saturday's elections as more than half of the constituencies
are considered to be tribal areas.
</P>
<P>
Candidates in the three main Islamic groups -- the Islamic
Popular Movement or Salaf, the Islamic Constitutional Movement
(ICM) and the Shia National Islamic Alliance (NIA) -- are
also believed to be competitive.
</P>
<P>
As Kuwait, like other oil rich Gulf nations, was heavily hit in
the past couple of years by the sagging oil prices in the global
market, domestic issues, especially the economic ones, have been
dominating the campaign platforms of most candidates.
</P>
<P>
The candidates called on the private sector to play a more
important role in the country's economy by employing more
national manpower, and promised to work on it if elected to the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Some candidates also focused their speeches on the importance
of cooperation between the parliament and government.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation crisis triggered by policy differences between the
legislature and the executive authority has led to the
dissolution of the last parliament and the mass resignation of
the former cabinet in March 1998.
</P>
<P>
Compared with economy, national security, the key issue in
the 1992 elections, has taken a backseat in the current
elections campaign speeches of most candidates.
</P>
<P>
Both candidates and voters said that they are feeling "more
secure at home and the defense agreements Kuwait signed with
foreign countries after the 1991 Gulf war are the main
reason for less preoccupation with national security in 1999."

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Military Chief Reaffirms Neutrality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Defense Minister Gen.
Wiranto Friday reaffirmed the Indonesian military's commitment to
neutrality during the upcoming general session of the People's
Consultative Assembly (MPR).
</P>
<P>
Wiranto, who is also chief of the Indonesian Defense Forces,
said such neutrality does not mean that the forces will not use
their political rights and obligation.
</P>
<P>
Answering questions at a parliamentary hearing with House
Commission I in charge of foreign and defense affairs, Wiranto
said that in securing the upcoming general session of the MPR, the
state police would play a big role.
</P>
<P>
It is in this context that the state police have intensified
their security operations in several parts of the city, he added.
</P>
<P>
He also disclosed that the Jakarta police command will deploy
81,000 personnel to secure the general session of the MPR. The
police force will also be aided by several platoons of the defense
forces, he added.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Wiranto warned of possible mass rallies ahead of
the MPR general session which may create conflict between the
people and the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
The MPR, the country's highest decision-making body, will meet
in November to elect the country's next president.
</P>
<P>
The 700-strong MPR is made up of 200 government appointees and
the 500 members of the House of Representatives. The June 7
election will produce 462 legislators. A further 38 seats are
reserved for the military.
</P>
<P>
The military has repeatedly stressed that all the appointed
military legislators will vote for the best presidential candidate
of the country, whether he or she is nominated by major or minor
political parties.

<HEADLINE> Thai PM Approves Plan to Buy 50 Second-hand Fighter Jets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Citing the economic crisis for buying the cheaper aircraft,
Chuan, also the defense minister of Thailand, said the aircraft
procurement would be subjected to further review by a top panel,
comprising military and defense officials in charge of military
budgetary allocation, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Thai Air Force Secretary AVM Prapas Chiemchawee was quoted as
saying that the 50 fighter jets would replace the OV-10
reconnaissance aircraft, scheduled to decommissioned in the next
three years. The jets would be deployed on aerial border patrol
operations.
</P>
<P>
The German government last February offered to sell its
decommissioned fighter, which had been out of deployment for two
years, as a government-to-government deal, the secretary added.
</P>
<P>
Based on the proposal, a fighter would cost one million baht
(27,000 U.S. dollars) but the actual price for each was to total
50 million baht (135,000 dollars), after additional costs for
pilot training and mechanical upgrading.
</P>
<P>
Each fighter had only 200 hours in the air despite its maximum
flight time of 15,000 hours. The under-used aircraft could be

The alternative would cost the country about one billion baht
(27 million dollars) for each new fighter.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Plays Down Russia-U.S. Warplanes Encounter, with correction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The United States said Thursday
that it was unconcerned about the incident in which two Russian
strategic bombers were reportedly intercepted by U.S. fighter jets
near Iceland.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said that the incident was
not "a militarily significant event."
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. routinely protects the airspace of Iceland and I don'
t think there's anyone who believed that these two propeller
bombers posed a significant military threat," he said.
</P>
<P>
Two Russian strategic bombers flew within striking distance of
the United States last week as part of Moscow's largest military
exercise --West-99 -- since the end of the Cold War, The
Washington Post reported in its Thursday's edition.
</P>
<P>
The TU-95 Bear bombers were intercepted by four U.S. F-15
fighters and a P-3 patrol plane near Iceland early Friday morning
and escorted in a clockwise flight around the island, the
newspaper quoted U.S. officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
The exercise, U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen told a
Pentagon news conference Thursday, has multi-purposes though he
said "there's nothing that's surprised us" in the exercise.
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure it does have -- they have some multiple purposes,
perhaps domestic purposes, international purposes. They want to be
seen as remaining a force that one has to deal with. We deal with
them," Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
However, The Washington Post said the U.S.-Russian warplane
encounter astounded U.S. officials and underlined recent Western
concerns about the military leadership in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
About 200 Russian peace-keepers surprisingly arrived in Kosovo
earlier than any NATO forces last month.
</P>
<P>
U.S. National Security Council spokesman P.J. Crowley said that
the bombers were flying in the international airspace as part of a
military exercise announced in advance by the Russian government.
</P>
<P>
"Russia routinely holds military exercises and we are not
particularly troubled by this. I don't think that there's any need
to over-dramatize this," Crowley added.
</P>
<P>
Moscow also downplayed the incident by denying any wrongdoing.
"Our planes did not violate any laws in that area," a Russian Air
Force spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Cohen is expected to visit Moscow later this month to repair
the fence in the U.S.-Russian relations that was undermined by
NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia. "It's all part of maintaining good
stable relations with them," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have kept up our diplomatic relations with them; I hope
that we can restore, on a more cordial basis, our military-to-
military contacts," Cohen added.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Police Detain 7 Tamils Before President's Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali police have detained
seven ethnic Tamils in Kathmandu days before the Sri Lanka
president's scheduled visit to Nepal, The Kathmandu Post reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Police suspected that the detainees are associated with Sri
Lanka's separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Elam (LTTE) and may
involve themselves in "undesirable activities," the
English-language daily said.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels have been fighting the Sri Lankan government
since 1983 for an independent Tamil homeland in the north and east
of the country.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga is
scheduled to start a four-day state visit to Nepal on July 5.
</P>
<P>
Police were quoted as saying that the detainees had been
changing their hotels almost on a daily basis since they entered
Nepal through India and they claimed themselves to be Indian
nationals and Pakistani nationals but the documents and passports
found from them belied their false statements.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Rice Exports Drop Due to Low Demand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The demand for the rice on the world market had dropped
sharply, and the strength of the baht had also meant that
importers had delayed placing orders, the newspaper quoted Thai
Deputy Prime Minister and Commerce Minister Supachai Panichpakdi
as saying.
</P>
<P>
In baht terms, Thailand's rice exports in the first half of
this year were worth 31.22 billion baht compared with 45.55
billion baht in the same period last years -- a fall of 31
percent.
</P>
<P>
The export volume fell to 2.83 million tones from 3.31 million
tones in the same period last year, a drop of 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, the export level is expected to rise in the second
half of the year because Thai exporters are expected to offer more
attractive prices, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is the biggest exporter of rice in the world with the
export volume amounted to 6.5 million tones last year.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Waste Management Gets International Funding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 2 (Xinhua)-- The Philippines will benefit from the
funding from World Bank, Asian Development Bank and other
financial institutions in the process of improving its solid waste
management program.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a recent summit in the northern city of Dagupan,
Rotor Dacanay, manager for Environmental Projects of Pennoni
International Philippines, Inc., said World Bank alone has
committed 40 million dollars of the proposed 100 million dollars
for the 10-year-long program.
</P>
<P>
The summit on solid waste management was held to generate
awareness of the people on the present problem of garbage in their
communities, Philippine News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
According to Dacanay who was an environmental specialist, the
program is divided into three phases, the first of which involved
the establishment of six sanitary landfills in the countryside
from 1999 to 2001.
</P>
<P>
Based on the estimate made by the Metro Manila Development
Authority, constructing a landfill today costs from 21 million to
26 million pesos (530,000 to 650,000 U.S. dollars) per hectare,
excluding land acquisition.
</P>
<P>
Admitting that acquisition of landfill site is difficult and
expensive, Dacanay proposed that the host community be compensated
in the form of tax incentives, cash payments and construction of
local improvement projects.
</P>
<P>
Landfill is essential component of any municipal waste
management system because large segment of municipal waste
requires disposal, he added.
</P>
<P>
Among other alternative strategies on solid waste management
mentioned by Dacanay aside from landfill disposal are source
reduction, recycling, composting, collection and transfer and
incineration.

<HEADLINE> Foreigners Are Allowed to Buy Shares in Vietnamese Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Vietnamese government has authorized
equitised companies in 11 economic sectors to sell shares to
foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese Prime Minister Phan Van Khai approved such sales of
shares in former state-owned enterprises in a decision issued and
came into effect on Monday, according to local press Friday.
</P>
<P>
Khai's decision covers equitised companies in the following
sectors: garment; shoe; leather processing; farm produce and
seafood production and processing; household items; construction
materials; road transportation, inland waterway transportation and
container shipping; services and hotel services; engineering
production and units exporting the above items.
</P>
<P>
However, the decision says that foreign investors are not
allowed to buy shares worth more than 30 percent of a company's
total authorized capital.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnam's decision aims to mobilize capital, advanced
technology and management skills from foreign companies to raise
the equitised companies' production, competitiveness and sale.
</P>
<P>
The equitisation of Vietnam's state-owned enterprises, which
started in 1993, is proceeding slowly. Up to date, only 175
state-owned enterprises were equitised.

<HEADLINE> First Private Power Plant to Start Trial Production in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's first 100 percent
locally-owned private power plant is to start trial production of
electricity by November this year, an English newspaper reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The 70-megawatt gas-turbine power plant, which has been built
by the Rural Power Company (RPC), has already been installed in
the country's northern district of Mymensingh, The Financial
Express quoted RPC's Managing Director Maksudul karim as saying.
</P>
<P>
The plant was installed by a consortium of the MES company of
Japan and the AGT company of France under an agreement signed in
September 1997, Karim stated, adding that a similar accord was
signed with the French company for installation of two other units
with similar capacity, at the same place by August 2000.
</P>
<P>
The third plant, with same generation capacity, would be
installed at the site covering 8.4 hectares of land at a later
stage, according to the RPC managing director.
</P>
<P>
The total cost for installation of the first plant was
estimated at 62 million U.S. dollars, of which 41 million dollars
had been provided by the Asian Development Bank, while the
remaining amount came from the sponsors of the company, he
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
The entire electricity produced by the plant would be purchased
by the Power Development Board (PDB), and negotiations on price
were still going on, he added.
</P>
<P>
At present, only about 15 percent of the total population in
Bangladesh has access to electricity. The present capacity of the
PDB with 52 generation units under 18 power stations is between
2,000 and 2,100 megawatts, whereas the country's total need is
about 2,300 megawatts.
</P>
<P>
The government has adopted the policy of privatizing the power
sector and of encouraging private sector to take part in
development of power sector, with a view to improving the serious
situation of power shortage in the country.

WASHINGTON, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The heavily favored United
States came from behind to beat Germany 3-2 in a quarterfinal of
the Women's World Cup here tonight.

from Group A, looked nervous at the beginning and silenced the
crowd with a own goal by Brandi Chastain in the fifth minute.
</P>
<P>
After 11 minutes, the U.S. team levelled the score through
Tiffeny Milbrett. The Americans dominated the court and forced
five corners in the first half, but it were the Germans who surged
ahead in the 46th minute when Bettina Wigegmann blasted a close-
range shot into the left corner of the net.
</P>

Trailing 1-2, the Americans roaring back strongly in the second
half. Their efforts were paid off in the 49th minute when Chastain
seized an opportunity ball from a U.S. corner and put it into the
net.
</P>
<P>
With the score tying at 2-all, the Americans found their
composure and confidence, pressing the Germans with waves of
attacking. In the 46th minute, substitute Shannon MacMillan sent a
low and sizzling corner into the goal area where Joy Fawcett
jumped timely to hit in a brilliant header.
</P>
<P>
Referee Martha Toro Pardo of Columbia only flashed one yellow
card in the game.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's GDP Growth Rate Declines in the First Half of the Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's gross domestic product
(GDP) in the first six months of this year grew 4.3 percent,
according to Vietnam's General Department of Statistics.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate dropped nearly two percentage points compared
with the 6.16 percent GDP growth rate for the first half of last
year.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate in industrial and construction sector in the
first half of the year was 7.4 percent, down from 9.98 percent in
the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The state-owned industrial sector performed poorly with the 3.6
percent growth rate compared with 10.2, 10.7 and 13.4 percent in
the first half of 1998, 1997 and 1996 respectively.
</P>
<P>
However, the growth rate in agricultural, forestry and
aquaculture was 2.7 percent, up from 2.12 percent during the
corresponding period last year.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam has harvested 14 million tones of rice, 1.4 million
tones of winter-spring cereal crops this year. The total
winter-spring grain yield reached 15.4 million tones, 500,000
tones more than that of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The service sector also saw a low growth rate due to poor
performance of trade. The total output value from the retail sales
and services were estimated at 90,000 billion Vietnamese dong
(6.47 billions U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> HIV Found Among Myanmar Blood Donors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, July 2 (Xinhua) -- HIV has been found among blood
donors in Myanmar after they went through blood test in hospitals
where HIV test kits are provided, said a high-ranking Myanmar
health official.
</P>
<P>
Blood testing indicated that HIV has been found in 0.7 percent
of blood donors in Yangon and 0.97 percent in Mandalay, two major
cities in the country, said Myanmar Minister of Health
Major-General Ket Sein Thursday.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting here of Myanmar's Central Committee to Control and
Combat AIDS (CCCC AIDS), Ket Sein, who is also the committee's
chairman, emphasized the need to organize more HIV-free blood
donors to reduce the percentage of HIV-carrying blood donors.
</P>
<P>
He said HIV can be found in various categories of men in
various states and divisions though the incidence may vary.
</P>
<P>
He urged medical officers in the country to speed up efforts to
fight the disease.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar CCCC AIDS was first formed in 1989 and reorganized in
1998 for consolidation and effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar government annually allocates about 13 million
Kyats (43,000 U.S. dollars) for implementing AIDS programs
identified in the country's National Health Plan.
</P>
<P>
According to available official figures, there were 17,846 HIV
cases and 2,337 AIDS cases in Myanmar by the end of 1997. The
figures for 1998 have not been published yet.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Myanmar is also participating actively in regional
AIDS control projects of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations through exchange of information, organization of meetings
and cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Government Reshuffle Expected in Next Week: Thai PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai
said the planned government reshuffle would be conducted no later
than next week, Channel 9, the state TV station, reported here
Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Chuan said the Social Action
Party (SAP) was still considered part of the coalition despite
vows made by part of its legislators to join the opposition.
</P>
<P>
Democrat Party Secretary-General Sanan Kachornprasart said on
Thursday that a meeting within the coalition will be held before
July 4 to end the government reshuffle as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The SAP was split when rebel faction's demand on ex-leader
Suvit Khunkitti quitting his science minister portfolio was
refused.
</P>
<P>
Rebel factions leaders, Party Advisor Rakkiat Sukthana and
Party Secretary-General Somsak Thepsuthin, who command nine of the
party's 20 members of parliament, have vowed to withdraw the
support for the Chuan government and join the opposition.
</P>
<P>
Suvit, by resigning as party leader, forced the party to hold
an executive committee election later Friday, of which he has
confidence to win.
</P>
<P>
So far, Deputy Industry Minister Suriya Chuengrungruangkit from
SAP had also resigned, clearing all the five ministerial posts
allocated to the party in the coalition government pending the
party's election meeting.
</P>
<P>
Other parties in the coalition are also preparing for the
upcoming government reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
Banharn Silpa-archa, leader of Chart Thai Party, which holds 39
seats in the lower house, has said that his party is well prepared
for the reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
Earlier last month, Education Minister Panja Kesornthong from
the Chart Thai Party resigned to clear the way for a reshuffle of
more cabinet posts among the party.
</P>
<P>
Both Banharn and Chart Pattana leader Korn Dabaransi had said
that they hope the SAP could stay within the coalition government.
</P>
<P>
The SAP's future of whether to stay in the coalition government
or end in the opposition will be decided at Friday's executive
committee election.
</P>
<P>
However, political analysts said it is difficult for the SAP to
come to a conclusion in just one day.

LONDON -- The UK manufacturing industry expanded for the first
time for more than a year in June as both domestic and overseas
orders increased, according to the latest research.
</P>
<P>
The return to growth comes on the back of increasing orders and
higher factory output, the research by the Chartered Institute of
Purchasing and Supply (CIPS) found. It's purchasing managers index
was 50.4 in June, up from 49.4 in May and the first reading above
50 since March last year when it was 51.1. A figure above 50
indicates expansion, below 50 contraction. (UK-Manufacturing)

ROME -- Italy is entitled to tap into 15.5 percent of European

the European Commission's approval Thursday of the bloc's next
seven-year aid package for economically-depressed areas.
</P>
<P>
Italy will be able to take advantage of some 55 trillion lire (
about 30 billion U.S. dollars) in EU funding, with the lion's
share going to the underdeveloped south, and it is hoped that it
will improve its notorious reputation for making the worst use of
its structural fund allowance of any EU member. Declining
industrial areas in northern and central Italy will be allowed
some 5 trillion lire, while 7.25 trillion lire has been earmarked
for employment-boosting initiatives in these areas and 186 billion
lire for the fishing industry. (Italy-EU-Fund)

<HEADLINE> U.S. Plays Down Russia-U.S. Warplanes Encounter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The United States said Thursday
that it was unconcerned about the incident in which two Russian
strategic bombers were reportedly intercepted by U.S. fighter jets
near Iceland.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said that the incident was
not "a militarily significant event."
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. routinely protects the airspace of Iceland and I don'
t think there's anyone who believed that these two propeller
bombers posed a significant military threat," he said.
</P>
<P>
Two Russian strategic bombers flew with striking distance from
the U.S. last week as part of Moscow's largest military exercise --
West-99 -- since the end of the Cold War, The Washington Post
reported in its Thursday's edition.
</P>
<P>
The TU-95 Bear bombers were intercepted by four U.S. F-15
fighters and a P-3 patrol plane near Iceland early Friday morning
and escorted in a clockwise flight around the island, the
newspaper quoted U.S. officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
The exercise, U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen told a
Pentagon news conference Thursday, has multi-purposes though he
said "there's nothing that's surprised us" in the exercise.
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure it does have -- they have some multiple purposes,
perhaps domestic purposes, international purposes. They want to be
seen as remaining a force that one has to deal with. We deal with
them," Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
However, The Washington Post said the U.S.-Russian warplane
encounter astounded U.S. officials and underlined recent Western
concerns about the military leadership in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
About 200 Russian peace-keepers surprisingly arrived in Kosovo
earlier than any NATO forces last month.
</P>
<P>
U.S. National Security Council spokesman P.J. Crowley said that
the bombers were flying in the international airspace as part of a
military exercise announced in advance by the Russian government.
</P>
<P>
"Russia routinely holds military exercises and we are not
particularly troubled by this. I don't think that there's any need
to over-dramatize this," Crowley added.
</P>
<P>
Moscow also downplayed the incident by denying any wrongdoing.
"Our planes did not violate any laws in that area," a Russian Air
Force spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Cohen is expected to visit Moscow later this month to repair
the fence in the U.S.-Russian relations that was undermined by
NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia. "It's all part of maintaining good
stable relations with them," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have kept up our diplomatic relations with them; I hope
that we can restore, on a more cordial basis, our military-to-
military contacts," Cohen added.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Sports Council Urged to Make Asiad Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Senior vice president of the
Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) Mohamad "Bob" Hasan has recommended
that Indonesia's National Sports Council (KONI) work together with
the government to prepare its bid for the 2006 Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
"It's better for KONI to involve the state minister of youth
affairs and sports office, the tourism, arts and culture ministry
and the coordinating minister for people's welfare office to
seriously prepare all facilities if Indonesia really wants to bid
for the Asiad," Hasan said.
</P>
<P>
Hasan, chairman of the Indonesian Amateur Athletics Association
(PASI) and the Indonesian Gymnastics Association (Persani), said
KONI could pick either Jakarta or Surabaya to host the quadrennial
event.
</P>
<P>
"If Surabaya successfully hosts the National Games next year,
maybe KONI can consider using the facilities," he was quoted by
The Jakarta Post Friday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Countries and regions must submit their proposals in October
next year. The proposal must include information on available
funds, sports facilities, the athletes village, media center,
transportation, catering and security.
</P>
<P>
"For the second biggest event after the Olympics, an Asiad host
must be able to accommodate about 6,000 athletes," he said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia, which hosted the fourth Asiad in 1962, will be hard
pressed to beat out other bids expected from Malaysia, Hong Kong,
India, Qatar, Syria and Uzbekistan. Malaysia distributed
promotional brochures on its bid during the 1998 Asiad in Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
KONI is setting up a special team to lobby OCA members on
Indonesia's bid.
</P>
<P>
"To stage the Asiad, the OCA will ask for a guarantee from the
bidding country's government. It needs a guarantee that the host
will be ready at the scheduled time," said Hasan, who also is the
president of the Asian Amateur Athletics Association.
</P>
<P>
Hasan said PASI would host the Asian Championships for
athletics before the Olympics next year.
</P>
<P>
"We must consult other countries' coaches concerning when will
be the right time to stage the event as a warm-up before they
compete in Sydney," he added.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Archers Optimistic of Qualifying for Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the Indonesian Archery
Association (Perpani) Hayono Isman was optimistic that his women
archers would qualify for the 2000 Olympics in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
Hayono said the four archers -- Nurfitriyana Saiman Lantang,
Hamdiah Lusia Elizabeth and Kusumawardhani -- improved their
scores during training for the World Championships in Riom, France,
from July 22 to July 26.
</P>
<P>
"They will fly to Seoul on July 12 for a warm-up before going
to Riom," the former state minister of youth affairs and sports
was quoted by The Jakarta Post Friday as saying.
</P>
<P>
The squad will be accompanied by South Korean coach Lee Jae-
hyun and Donald Pandiangan.
</P>
<P>
Perpani secretary-general Udi Harsono said Indonesian archers
would have to reach the championships' quarterfinals to qualify
for the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian archers would need to attain at least 3,845 points
to reach the quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
"Up to today, their total scores have reached above 3,880. I
believe if they can perform consistently, they will qualify for
the Olympics," he said.
</P>
<P>
If the archers do not qualify from their ranking at the
championships, they will have a second chance in the Asian
Championships in Beijing from September 1 to 5.
</P>
<P>
Hayono said that Perpani faced financial difficulties in
providing about 2 billion rupiah (296,750 U.S. dollars) for
preparation of the archers from February to the Olympics in
September next year.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Families Spend More on Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Thrifty Chinese are exhibiting a
greater propensity to lavish money on education, especially when
it comes to educating their children.
</P>
<P>
Education expenditures for the average family in south China's
Guangdong Province have grown by some 12 percent annually for the
past three years, with per capita spending rising from 313 yuan in
1995 to 443 yuan last year.
</P>
<P>
That margin of increase for education expenditures is
substantially higher than the level for both entertainment and
travel.
</P>
<P>
Education expenditures in such cities as Guangzhou, Shenzhen
and Zhuhai rank closely behind savings deposits as the destination
for disposable income. Residents in related cities tend to retain
a certain portion of savings for housing, automobiles and travel.
</P>
<P>
The bulk of spending on education goes to educate children.
Funds mainly cover tuition and fees and extracirricular training
for special skills such as piano and art.
</P>
<P>
Continuing education for Guangdong adults has also gained
increasing popularity, with per capita spending for related
activities reaching 58 yuan in 1998, up some 50 percent on the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
Private schools are playing an increasingly important role in
offering educational opportunities. Related schools have trained 2.
6 million Guandong residents since 1979.
</P>
<P>
Some 230,000 people attended private schools in 1998 in spite
of tuition costs reaching as high as several thousand yuan.
</P>
<P>
Major universities have increased fees for the most popular
specialized subject areas. For example, MBA majors attending the
South China University of Science and Engineering pay annual
tuition and fees totaling 10,000 yuan, with an additional 1,000
yuan going for textbooks.
</P>
<P>
University President Qian Ning noted that people are gaining an
increasing awareness of the important part education will play in
enabling them to compete in a knowledge-based economy.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka to Detain Meat Imports From Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka will detain meat
consignments originating from Europe following reports of dioxin
contamination detected in Belgium, said the Ministry of Livestock
Development and Estate Infrastructure on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said in a press release that it will detain
poultry, pork products and pet foods arriving particularly from
Belgium, the Netherlands and France.
</P>
<P>
The measure was being taken in response to reports that a fat
product from a rendering company in Europe was contaminated and
had been subsequently sold to feed manufacturers primarily in
Belgium and also other European countries, notably the Netherlands
and France, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The fats could have been mixed in compounded feeds given to
poultry and pigs and could pose a threat to human health.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly the animal quarantine staff in Colombo will detain
consignments of meat that have been already shipped or imported
into Sri Lanka from Europe, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
These consignments will be released after being cleared through
laboratory tests, it added.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Enjoys Trade Surplus in First Five Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia enjoyed a surplus of 8.40
billion U.S. dollars in its trade with foreign countries in the
first five months of this year, national newspapers Friday quoted
the Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS) as saying.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's exports in the January-May period were valued at
18.07 billion dollars, while its imports reached 9.67 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
But the exports dropped by 10.03 percent compared with the
20.09 billion dollars in the same period last year due to a
10.64-percent drop in the export of non-oil/non-gas commodities to
14.88 billion dollars from 16.65 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the export of oil/gas commodities also dropped by
7.07 percent to 3.19 billion dollars from 3.44 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's oil exports dropped by 15.84 percent to 284.3
billion dollars and gas exports declined by 19.97 percent to 1.35
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
But the export of crude oil increased to 1.55 billion dollars
from 1.41 billion dollars because of an increase in the price of
oil in the world market which rose to 16.94 dollars per barrel in
May from 15.12 dollars per barrel in April.
</P>
<P>
The import of gas/oil dropped by 16.44 percent to 1.10 billion
dollars from 1.32 billion dollars, while that of non-oil/non-gas
commodities dropped by 12.84 percent to 8.57 billion dollars from
9.84 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The import of oil dropped by 40.81 percent to 374 million
dollars and that of gas declined by 95.31 percent to 6.1 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
But the import of crude oil grew 41.64 percent to 163.7 million
dollars.

<HEADLINE> Expedition Says It Finds Origin of Amazon River in Southern Peru </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- A Czech geographical expedition team
said it has found the origin of the world's longest river, the
Amazon, to be the Carhuasanta River, flowing in Cailloma of
Arequipa Department in southern Peru, press reports said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the team said its findings overturned the
assumption accepted by many of the world's publications, which
puts the Amazon's origin at Lauricocha lagoon on Pasco hill in
Pasco Department.
</P>
<P>
The expedition team, composed of professionals and students
from Prague's Caroline University, said the Carhuasanta River has
two tributaries. The left tributary starts from a lagoon situated
5,233 meters above the sea-level and stretches 1,329 meters long,
while the right one, claimed by the expedition as "the true origin
of the Amazon," starts at 5,338 meters altitude and flows 1,278
meters long.
</P>
<P>
The team also said its findings once again proved the Amazon is
the longest river in the world, with an extension of more than 7,
000 kilometers and an area of 7,050 square kilometers, based on
their measurements made at Cailloma mountains.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Philippine volcanologists on
Thursday issued alert Level 2 as Mayon volcano showed persistent
tremors, elevated sulfur dioxide emission and slight swelling.
</P>
<P>
The national newspaper Malaya quoted the experts Friday as
saying that if the volcanic tremors and other physical indicators
persist, Mayon could erupt again in weeks, if not days.
</P>
<P>
The higher alert level expanded the six-kilometer permanent
danger zone under Level 1 to seven kilometers on the southeastern
side of the volcano.
</P>
<P>
"We have been monitoring weak to moderate steam emissions since
yesterday morning," said Ed Laguerta, resident volcanologist at
the Lingnon Hill observatory.
</P>
<P>
A slight increase in the sulfur dioxide emission, from 2,300
tons per day to 3,370 tons, means magma is moving up to crater,
emitting more gas along the way.
</P>
<P>
volcanic tremors are another indication magma is ascending to
the crater.
</P>
<P>
The experts said people should keep away from the danger zone
because of sudden explosions that may generate hazardous volcanic
flows.
</P>
<P>
They said residents outside the danger zone but staying within
eight kilometers from crater should be prepared to leave their
homes anytime.

<P>
During the past five decades, the SCN provided reports and
entertainment to American soldiers housed in military bases
situated on the sides of Panama Canal.
</P>
<P>
Commander of U.S. Southern Army Philip R. Kensinger said that
during its 58 years of operation, the military communication
network produced more than 3,500 hours of live radio transmission
from Panama and 240 interviews by U.S. Army, Marine and Air Force
Commanders.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the network's director, Gordon Martel,
announced that the SCN will stop producing programs from Panama as
from Thursday, but will keep on transmitting satellite programs
from the United States until December 31.
</P>
<P>
Only when the Southern Army moves to Puerto Rico, all
properties are transferred to Panama and the last soldier turns
off his light will the SCN definitely end its transmissions, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Under the Torrijos-Carter Treaties signed in 1977, the United
States will withdraw all troops from its military bases in the
Canal zone and turn over the sovereignty and administration back
to Panama by December 31, 1999.

<HEADLINE> Brazil's Trade Deficit Down Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, July 1 (Xinhua)-- Brazil registered 623 million U.S.
dollars in trade deficit in the first six months of this year, 61
percent less than the same period last year, the Ministry of
Development, Industry and Trade said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Development, Industry and Trade Secretary Mario Marconini said
the country posted a trade deficit of 144 million dollars in June,
with its exports reaching 4.313 billion dollars in the month.
</P>
<P>
Marconini attributed the deficit to the rise of petroleum and
machinery imports, saying that the increasing imports showed
another booming period of the domestic economy and a fall of
international prices.

<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Chile's lumber exports posted an
increase of 0.6 percent in the first four months this year,
reaching a total of 588.6 million U.S. dollars, the National
Forest Corporation said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The United States remains the main destination of lumber
shipments from Chile, followed by Japan and China, it said.
</P>
<P>
Chile's wood exports are expected to grow by 7 percent in 1999,
leading sales to 1.78 billion dollars, the Wood Corporation said.
It attributed the recuperation in this sector to the increase in
price and volume of cellulose shipments to Asia.

HELSINKI, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Top priorities of the European
Union (EU) at present are to take measures to guarantee Kosovo
refugees' return, make all ethnic communities in Kosovo feel safe
and help rebuild the region, Finnish Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Lipponen, whose country assumed the rotating EU presidency
Thursday, made the remarks while attending the ninth congress of
the European Trade Union Confederation.
</P>
<P>
He promised that during its presidency, Finland will dedicate
itself to the strengthening of the EU's role as a European and
world organization.
</P>
<P>
Finland supports measures aimed at strengthening the EU's role
in Europe's collective security and foreign policies and the
control of crises, Lipponen said.
</P>
<P>
It will actively press ahead with the EU expansion negotiations

<P>
Lipponen expressed dissatisfaction with the slow-paced EU
economic restruction and its relative low competitive power in the
past decade.
</P>
<P>
The EU should encourage enterprises to invest in scientific
research and improve education systems, so as to establish an
innovative mechanism, he said.
</P>
<P>
Considering the growing inter-dependence of the 11 Euro-zone
countries, these countries should establish close cooperation in

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Water Polo Team Aims For SEA Games Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's national squad of water
polo players have expressed confidence in grabbing gold at the
20th Southeast Asian (SEA) Games in Brunei Darussalam in August.
</P>
<P>
The water polo committee and chairman of the National Sports
Council (KONI) Wismoyo Arismunandar met on Thursday to discuss the
preparation of the 15 athletes set to attend the Games.
</P>
<P>
The athletes said they were ready to fight for the top spot,
citing their substantial pre-Games training and the experience of
the squad members in previous Games.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia, although fielding water polo teams 11 times in the
SEA Games, is yet to strike gold. Past teams have collected all up
four silvers and five bronze medals. At the 1997 Games here, the
Indonesian water polo team was beaten by Singapore for the gold.
</P>
<P>
Andreas Legawa, the water polo technical committee chief, said
Romanian coach Paul Niculeascu had prepared a range of strategies
to beat their Southeast Asian opponents. The team's toughest
contender will be Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Niculeascu is no stranger to the national squad. He coached the
Games water polo national team in 1985, 1987 and 1997. Under his
guidance, Indonesia was successful with a bronze in 1985, and
silver in 1987 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
"The coach learned from the 1997 experience and developed new
strategies. We feel we are better prepared, so we want to obtain
the best results," C. Calvin Legawa, one of the water polo
athletes who competed in the 1997 event, was quoted by The Jakarta
Post Friday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Team member Angga said: "I want to take revenge for our defeat
in 1997. I have practiced hard. If we only get silver, my practice
will have been useless."
</P>
<P>
Team captain Olsen Tiger said the coach had briefed them on the
relative strengths of their competitors, and that this team would
be more formidable, because senior members motivated the juniors
to play their best.
</P>
<P>
The most senior athlete Sumardji Bintoro Djarot said he would
play to the utmost of his ability.
</P>
<P>
The team will leave on Friday for a one-month tryout in
Bucharest, Romania They will compete with a local water polo
league team and return to Jakarta on July 23.

<HEADLINE> Russia Calls for Disconnecting Aid From Milosevic's Ouster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Sergei
Stepashin stressed on Thursday the importance of Yugoslavia's
reconstruction after the U.S.-led NATO's bombing, and maintained
that economic aid to Yugoslavia must not be conditional on the
ouster of President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a World Economic Forum (WEF) summit of central
European leaders in Salzburg, Austria, the Russian premier
insisted that economic assistance to the war-torn Yugoslavia for
its rehabilitation must not be conditional on the ouster of
President Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
"Russia believes that providing not only humanitarian but also
economic assistance should not be conditional on any demands or
provisions or reservations given ...sympathies or lack of such
with regard to the Milosevic regime," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Provision of such assistance ... would to my mind create more
favorable conditions for the people of Yugoslavia to make the
correct political choice during the current year," he said,
emphasizing that no problems could ever be solved by force.
</P>
<P>
He said the NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) attack
against Yugoslavia was "the biggest disaster in Europe in the
second half of the current century". And it complicated the
relations between Russia and the Western nations.
</P>
<P>
The Russian premier also said that his country actively
supports the EU-led Balkans Stability Pact for the region.
</P>
<P>
Moscow intended to take the most active part in the
establishment of mechanisms which will be established in
accordance with the pact, he said.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria to Deregulate Export of Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The Bulgarian government Thursday
adopted amendments to the Ordinance Concerning the Export and
Import of Currency Assets to deregulate the export of currency.
</P>
<P>
Under the amendments, people can freely carry currency
equivalent up to 2,000 new redenominated leva (about 1,100 U.S.
dollars) out of the country.
</P>
<P>
Declaration to the customs is required for export of currency
between 2,000 and 20,000 new leva and a permit of the National
Bank of Bulgaria is needed for export of over 20,000 new leva.
</P>
<P>
The redenomination will take effect in Bulgaria as from July 5
with 1,000 old leva becoming equal to one new lev.
</P>
<P>
Without the amendments, people can freely carry currency
amounting to no more than 1,000 U.S. dollars aboard. A bank permit
is required for export of currency surpassing this sum.
</P>
<P>
As for the remittance overseas through bank, the amendments
rule that only an application to the bank, which should tell the
reason for the remittance, is required for the remittance of below
1,000 new leva.
</P>
<P>
Currently, a permit of the Bulgarian treasury is required for
any sum of money to be remitted overseas.
</P>
<P>
Foreigners importing big sums of money should declare them to
avoid problems when exporting them back, according to the
amendments, which will take effect 30 days after the approval by
the government.

<HEADLINE> Graf Wins Williams Thriller </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Steffi Graf of Germany defied the
wet weather to complete a superb three-set victory over Venus
Williams in the women's singles quarter-finals at Wimbledon tennis
championships here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The six-time champion secured her place in the last four with a
6-2, 3-6, 6-4 success in a match that was halted by the rain on
four separate occasions.
</P>
<P>
A match that was due to begin on Centre Court at 12:00 BST, was
not completed until 20:15, when the German second seed finally
wrapped up the win.
</P>
<P>
Both players were at the top of their game in a thrilling
contest that would have made a worthy final for the championships.
</P>
<P>
After the longest break of all, for two-and-a-half hours, the
match resumed in fading light with 19-year-old American Williams
ahead 2-1 on serve in the third set.
</P>
<P>
The turning point came in the fifth game when Graf, applying
pressure on every shot, broke for a 3-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
After a furious corner-to-corner rally, Graf converted with a
forehand winner.
</P>
<P>
Graf saved three break points in the next games as Williams
blew a simple forehand volley that would have levelled the match.
</P>
<P>
Williams was stretched all over the court by Graf's variety of
angles and the occasional drop-shot but the American kept fighting.
</P>
<P>
It was enthralling action and just what the fans who had waited
nearly eight hours on court deserved.
</P>
<P>
The rest of the games went with serve, with Graf converting on
her first match point. When sixth seed Williams hit a forehand
wide, Graf hopped up and down on the baseline, punching the air
and screaming with delight.
</P>
<P>
Graf paid tribute to her opponent and predicted it would not be
long before she became the dominant player on the WTA Tour.
</P>
<P>
"She is very tough, I knew that beforehand and that's partly
why I am so happy because she is a strong player," said the 31-
year-old Graf.
</P>
<P>
"She has a big serve, moves incredibly well and she got some
balls back that I thought were over.
</P>
<P>
"Two years ago you could see what potential she has and I've
said it before and I'll say it again, she will be world number one.
</P>
<P>
"She has the game and the physique. She has a lot of talent.
She can do a lot of things out there. It rarely happens that you
have to play tennis like that in a quarter-final.
</P>
<P>
"We played unbelievable tennis. To play so well and be in the
semis is very exciting, " she added.
</P>
<P>
Williams meanwhile refused to blame the rain delays for her
defeat. "You have to be prepared to compete any time a match is
called," she said.
</P>
<P>
"I really wasn't thinking about the conditions. I had no issue
with it. It doesn't matter what happens, you have to be ready to
play tennis and can't let outside influences distract you.
</P>
<P>
"I think I was able to come back and still compete after each
delay and I don't think it affected me too much.
</P>
<P>
"Steffi has been through more rain delays than I've ever
dreamed of so everything is an experience," she said.

<HEADLINE> Defending Champion Novotna Crashes Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Jana Novotna's reign as Wimbledon
champion came to an abrupt end, as Lindsay Davenport romped to a
straight sets victory in the women's singles quarter-finals on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Third seed Davenport reached her first ever semi-final at the
All England Club, with a 6-3, 6-4 triumph as rain disrupted play
for the third day of the championships.
</P>
<P>
Czech veteran Novotna failed to find the form that secured her
an emotional first Grand Slam title last year as she was
dispatched with ease by her American opponent.
</P>
<P>
Davenport dominated the error-prone fifth seed in a lackluster
match to extend her career record against Novotna to 6-0.
</P>
<P>
After the start of the match was delayed an hour by rain,
Davenport set the tone by breaking Novotna to love in the first
game. She then broke twice more to take the opening set in 32
minutes.
</P>
<P>
The second set was delayed at 4-3 for an hour by rain - but
when play resumed 23-year-old Davenport put Novotna out of her
misery.
</P>
<P>
Novotna, who won last year after two defeats in the final, was
playing in her 14th Wimbledon. At age 30, she may not have many
more chances to win again.
</P>
<P>
Both players denied that Novotna's ankle injury, which she
suffered playing doubles in the French Open, had been a
significant factor in her defeat.
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure it affected her preparation coming to Wimbledon, "
Davenport said.
</P>
<P>
"But she's now been playing for at least 12 days on grass, so I
thought she actually came up with some good shots. I thought she
played well."
</P>
<P>
And Novotna added: "My ankle was just fine, I was moving fine.
</P>
<P>
"It seemed to get better and better, here. She played once
again with her serve and power groundstrokes. They were too good,"
she added.

<HEADLINE> Wimbledon Still Plagued by Weather </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Tennis fans have suffered another
frustrating time at Wimbledon, as persistent rain continued to
play havoc on the third day of the second week.
</P>
<P>
Players were kept off court for most of the day on Wednesday
when only two of the scheduled quarter-finals were completed.
</P>
<P>
After third seed Lindsay Davenport beat defending champion Jana
Novotna in the women's singles, Wimbledon legend Steffi Graf put
out the American Venus Williams in three thrilling sets in a later
time.
</P>
<P>
Home hero Tim Henman was able to start his much-anticipated
last eight clash with Cedric Pioline.
</P>
<P>
But after the Briton had won the first game and was well placed
at deuce on the Frenchman's serve, the rain returned and the
players were unable to resume their match.
</P>
<P>
It was the third day this week where the rain has wiped out
most of the meaningful action.
</P>
<P>
Tournament organisers now face a major headache to try to
reschedule the remaining matches.
</P>
<P>
Wimbledon chief executive Christopher Gorringe revealed that
the women's final may be moved from Saturday to Sunday
</P>
<P>
"The most realistic plan is that we would play the semi-finals
on Saturday and both finals on Sunday," he told BBC TV.
</P>
<P>
"We haven't decided which order the men's and women's finals
would be, we'll have to wait and see."
</P>
<P>
Gorringe added that the All England Club still hopes to avoid
carrying the tournament over into a third week.
</P>
<P>
"We're still planning to finish on Sunday," he confirmed.

<HEADLINE> Man United Sacrifices 'in Vain' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The unprecedented move to let
Manchester United miss next season's FA Cup is unlikely to improve
England's chances of hosting the 2006 World Cup, according to
football's governing body FIFA on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Football Association has allowed holders United to sit out
the FA Cup so they can take part in the inaugural World Team
Championship in Brazil next January.
</P>
<P>
The FA believes that by taking part in the new tournament,
which is the brainchild of FIFA president Sepp Blatter, United
will aid England's campaign to win the race for 2006.
</P>
<P>
United accepted the argument and on Wednesday they reluctantly
withdrew from the FA Cup -- against the wishes of many of their
supporters, who have been vocal in their condemnation of the
proposal.
</P>
<P>
However FIFA's head of communications Keith Cooper has warned
that United's sacrifice could be unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed the theory that United have improved the 2006 bid
and insisted the World Team Championship is a separate issue from
who hosts the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
"I think the two things are completely separate," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The position on who will host the World Cup in 2006 will be
taken by the 24 members of the executive committee in March next
year and the criteria that they choose to apply is entirely their
business."
</P>
<P>
Cooper's comments will add further fuel to the controversy
raging over United's withdrawal from the oldest and most famous
knockout competition in the world.
</P>
<P>
But one of the leading figures within international football
took the opposing view and feels England's hopes have been boosted
by the United situation.
</P>
<P>
Trinidad &AMP; Tobago's Jack Warner, a FIFA vice president and
president of the north and central American federation, CONCACAF,
welcomed the move.
</P>
<P>
Warner, one of 24 FIFA officials who will vote on who hosts the
2006 World Cup, said: "This can only augur well for England's bid
to host World Cup 2006.
</P>
<P>
"If England want to be taken seriously by the world of football
it's only right they take the world of football seriously
themselves.
</P>
<P>
"I am therefore very pleased to hear that Manchester United
will be taking part. It speaks volumes for the efforts of the club
and country," he said.

<HEADLINE> Northern Ireland Statement to Be Issued Friday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Britain and Ireland will on Friday
make a statement on the next stage of the stalled Northern Irish
peace accord, a British official said as negotiations continued
late on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The two governments will make a joint statement on the way
forward tomorrow," the Reuters news agency quoted the spokesman
for British Prime Minister Tony Blair as saying.
</P>
<P>
The governments would receive a report on Friday from the
Northern Ireland's disarmament commission on prospects for
guerrilla disarmament. The government statement would be based on
its content and an assessment of submissions made by the parties
involved in the talks, according to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Intensive talks have been under way in Belfast for four days in
an attempt to rescue the year-old Good Friday agreement, which has
been paralyzed by a dispute between pro-British Unionists and
Irish Republicans about guerrilla disaramament and the formation
of a power-sharing provincial government.

MEXICO CITY, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The Mexican Stock Exchanges on
Thursday closed slightly up with the benchmark IPC index surging
by 25.09 points, or 0.43 percent, at 5,854.60 points.
</P>
<P>
Operators exchanged 140.052 million shares for some 264.038
million U.S. dollars against 96.019 million shares worth 177.433
million dollars on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The local currency, the peso, stood at 9.50 to one dollar for
sale and 9.20 for purchase in the main exchange houses of the
Mexico City, compared with 9.55 for sale and 9.25 for purchase on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Since Wednesday, the Mexican stocks have maintained higher
following the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to increase its
interest rate to 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said higher U.S. interest rates tend to push Mexican
rates higher and pull capital flows out of riskier emerging market

<HEADLINE> Northern Irish Peace Talks Given One More Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The talks to resolve the Northern
Ireland peace process are to continue Friday after a fourth day of
negotiations failed to find a solution to the impasse over weapons
decommissioning.
</P>
<P>
The UK and Irish governments will make a statement Friday on
the way forward in the peace process. The report by General John
de Chastelain on the readiness of paramilitary groups to disarm is
also to be presented to political parties.
</P>
<P>
The marathon talks at the Stormont Castle Buildings in Belfast
involving the Ulster Unionists continued into the night Thursday.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Irish Prime Minister
Bertie Ahern spent Thursday in discussions but there has yet to be
any sign of a breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
A document containing the various proposals put by the
different sides in the talks has now been distributed to all
parties involved in the discussions.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday evening, Blair met Ulster Unionist assembly members
to hear their views on decommissioning. The party's chief
negotiator, Sir Reg Empey, said the key purpose of the meeting was
to allow the assembly members to tell the prime minister how
important decommissioning was to them.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton has appealed to both sides to
resolve their differences, saying it would be "very hard" for the
world to understand if the talks broke down without a deal,
according to a BBC report.
</P>
<P>
Blair's official spokesman has said the prime minister believes
there could be a handover of IRA (Irish Republican Army) weapons,
but he refused to confirm whether Sinn Fein, the IRA's political
wing, had produced any concrete proposals.
</P>
<P>
The main sticking point Thursday was the disagreement between
the two sides over whether Sinn Fein had made any concrete
proposals regarding decommissioning.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland's First Minister David Trimble insisted that
no commitment had been given by Sinn Fein to start decommissioning
because he had seen nothing in writing.
</P>
<P>
Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, immediately dubbed Trimble
's comments as "fabrication."
</P>
<P>
The political leaders were asked to write down their positions
Thursday evening. The prime minister's spokesman said there were
a series of papers on the table covering "what is do-able."
</P>
<P>
The impasse stems from the insistence of the Ulster Unionists
that they will not sit with Sinn Fein in Northern Ireland's
government without a start to arms decommissioning by the IRA.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein maintains it cannot guarantee this and points out it
is not in the Good Friday Agreement, which demands disarmament by
all groups by May 2000.
</P>
<P>
Adams' party suggested a timetable for decommissioning before
May 2000, on condition that the Unionists accept them into an
executive. But Trimble insists weapons must be handed over at the
same time legislative powers are transferred from London to
Belfast.

<HEADLINE> Italy to Get 15.5 Percent of EU Structural Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Italy is entitled to tap into 15.5
percent of European Union (EU) structural funds over the period
2000-2006, following the European Commission's approval Thursday
of the bloc's next seven-year aid package for
economically-depressed areas.
</P>
<P>
Italy will be able to take advantage of some 55 trillion lire
(about 30 billion U.S. dollars) in EU funding, with the lion's
share going to the underdeveloped south (43 trillion lire), and it
is hoped that it will improve its notorious reputation for making
the worst use of its structural fund allowance of any EU member.
</P>
<P>
Declining industrial areas in northern and central Italy will
be allowed some 5 trillion lire, while 7.25 trillion lire has been
earmarked for employment-boosting initiatives in these areas and
186 billion lire for the fishing industry.
</P>
<P>
On an annual basis, Italy will be entitled to almost 8 trillion
lire per year, against the 6.6 trillion a year set down in the
previous seven-year funding package.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission approved plans to set aside a total of
412 trillion lire in structural funds for the bloc's economic
trouble spots over the 2000-2006 period.

ROME, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Kosovo must begin establishing all the

because "the military alone cannot restore the Balkan region to a
normal life."
</P>
<P>
According to United Nations resolution 1244, civil
administrations must be established to govern while NATO troops
work to guarantee the peace.
</P>

Scognamiglio, who recently returned from a tour of Kosovo, also
called for the prompt naming of a chief UN commissioner to oversee

"I find it unacceptable that the international community is not

<P>
He said he had strongly appealed for more money to the foreign
ministers and officials from 18 countries who gathered at U.N.

</P>
<P>
Thursday morning, the number of ethnic Albanians who had returned
to Kosovo since the end of NATO's 11-week air campaign reached the
half-million mark, the deputy UNHCR chief said.
</P>
<P>
The priority needs are now for emergency shelter materials,
such as tents, blankets, mattresses, plywood, window frames, nails
and tools so the refugees can begin repairing at least part of
their homes so they have proper shelter before winter begins, he
said.

refused to sell Bangladesh its F-16 warplanes several years ago,
was not happy about Dhaka's plan to buy eight Russian MiG-29s.
State Department officials said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The United States and Bangladesh's other development
partners will certainly want to discuss the implications of this
purchase," State Department spokesman James Foley said at a briefing.
</P>
<P>
"We've already had a number of conversations with Bangladeshi
officials to explain our concerns. We've also declined to sell
high-performance aircraft to Bangladesh for our part," he added.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Administration Eases Computer Export Restrictions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The Clinton administration on
Thursday eased restrictions on the export of computer technology,
saying regulations haven't kept pace with technological advances.
</P>
<P>
The new limits maintain tighter control over machines exported
for military purposes than for civilian use, while accommodating
the capabilities of current processing chips, hard drives and
other components.
</P>
<P>
"These policies will strengthen America's high-tech
competitiveness, while maintaining controls that are needed to
maintain our national security," President Bill Clinton said.
"These reforms are needed because of the extraordinarily rapid
rate of technological change in the computer industry."
</P>
<P>
Computer industry leaders had sought the changes in a White
House meeting earlier this year with Clinton's chief of staff,
John Podesta.
</P>
<P>
Industry officials say products that will be widely available
next year would have surpassed the current guidelines.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he would ask Congress to change rules that require
a six-month waiting period between announcement and implementation
of regulatory changes for exports. The administration believes the
industry should only have to wait one month.
</P>
<P>
He also said he would review the limits again in six months.
</P>
<P>
Under current regulations, exports to what are classified as
"Tier 3" countries -- those the United States believes to present
the greatest risk to national security -- are restricted to
systems that can perform 7,000 million theoretical operations per
second, known as MTOPS, for civilian use and 2,000 million per
second for military use.
</P>
<P>
Now, computer makers will be able to sell systems for civilian
use that perform 12,300 MTOPS. Technology that could have a
military application will be limited to 6,500 MTOPS.
</P>
<P>
The industry had been pushing to raise the limits to 30,000
MTOPS.
